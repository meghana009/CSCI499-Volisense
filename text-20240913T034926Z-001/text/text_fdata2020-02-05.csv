russia s expected to grow faster than the west gloomy outlook for global growth austerity no austerity or some austerity that s the question russian federal tax service central bank austerity russia s new government set to abandon austerity gdp growth expected to accelerate but those global uncertainties there s a lot going for the russian economy as 2020 kicks into its second month russia s government reshuffle is seen as removing austerity constraints and speeding up the financing of in his speech to the national assembly putin signaled the end of austerity on social spending russia being the only country in the developed world which is now among other things increasing pensions double the rate of inflation and initiating massive child support programs while everyone else is cutting we expect that thewill have to follow suit and end its financial austerity in order toin line with the rapidly sinking inflation russia sabove global averages fueled by the national development programs and on the strength of the now maturing import substitution programs with new gas pipelines opened end of 2019 to china and turkey no matter what happens in the global economy because of the overall strong economy and the concurring huge reduction of influx of new young adults to the labor market due to the effects of the demographic crisis in the 1990 s the labor market will be increasingly tight puttingdue toacross the economy and strong government finances theas it has shown remarkable strength through the financial upheavals and global tensions of the past few years this in turn in addition to the weakening global economy should keep inflation pressure in check notwithstanding all the growth boosting stuff on the domestic front it is possible that emerging market currencies and the ruble with them would come under attack in connection with a potential global financial market hysteria including a drop in oil price connected with the coronavirus outbreak even so the fundamentals for the ruble are so strong that it should recover soon again potentially this all could translate into 2 2 5 gdp growth or even 3 at best but with all the global uncertainties there is no firm basis for making those forecasts the imf s forecasts for 2020 gdp growth are for the global economy 3 3 the us 2 3 and the euro area 1 3 among which germany 1 1 the forecast for russia is 1 9 considering that russia will reach 1 4 growth in 2019 against imf forecast of 1 1 they are probably underestimating 2020 too we are on a firmer ground on predicting that the russian economy will be in the absolute top of the developed world and grow 1 to 2 over those of western europe considering also the very real potential that during the next ten years it is reasonable to expect that in one decade russia s gdp ppp per capita could reach the european average level in 2019 the global economic environment was dominated by the us trade wars against china and other countries including the sanctions against russia although a truce of sorts was achieved between usa and china end of year we should expect more of the same in 2020 and going forward with a global slowdown and the terminal incapability of the west to generate real growth other than temporary relief by rigging the financial markets the big concern is how long the western economies can go on by no other means than financial engineering and ever growing debt leverage the mass protest in france being but one very visible manifestation of that by now we cannot be far from the final biggies hyperinflation and an epic financial crash followed by a meltdown of the real economy the most recent blow to the world economy was delivered byoriginating in china how bad the actual disease crisis will get nobody knows but there are already economic repercussions from it by way of both mandatory and voluntary restrictions to mobility of people and goods that has the potential on having a big impact on global trade what we mean is that the policies adapted based on the climate alarm seem to bethis is certainly a threat for the western economies over the near future having said this we must point out that contrary to the spurious climate change ideology which must and will be countered with the potential of added economic value on balance we consider that russia s geopolitical and geoeconomic position has strengthened during the last few years which remove some of the country risks formerly associated with russia most russians seemed relieved by putin s recent government reshuffle as former pm dmitry medvedev was not thought to be delivering on the economy any longer although russia ran a stellar macroeconomic balance sheet the medvedev government was too cautious and austerity minded for being able to translate that into solid economic growth and improving living standards for the people medvedev is sadly known for having in 2016 told a group of clamoring grandmas complaining about their pensions there s no money but you just hang in there it therefore came as such a relief when the new pm mikhail mishustin first thing said mishustin is the former hugely successful tax chief so he knows what he is talking about tax collection doubled in real terms under his ten year tenure while the tax burden on the economy remained low in a global comparison russia s total tax burden at 31 1 remained low especially when compared to oecd countries the vignette there s no money perfectly summarizes what medvedev s austerity government represented if anything russia had money running triple surpluses trade surplus current account surplus budget surplus and with international reserves reaching record highs together with a solidly strengthening sovereign wealth fund for details see this link there would have been ample room for stimulus with real money and into the real economy instead of us and eu style money printing stimulus squandered on the financial markets but the medvedev government locked it all away with russia s amazingly low debt levels russia would also have had ample room to dip into additional borrowings to finance much needed growth see this report in addition to the promising policy statements of the new pm mishustin signals the end of unnecessary austerity belousov had a one year stint in 2012 2013 in the cabinet as the minister of economic development but was soon ensconced to the presidential administration in the capacity of chief economic advisor it is said that belousov is more statist believing in the government s crucial role in directing economic processes and a proponent of increased government spending and a greater government role in the economy we shall hope so at least that would put paid to the talk of more privatization we heard from the medvedev government in its last gasp in particular which putin has ordered to be implemented the national projects amount to a half a trillion dollar spending program 2 3 government financed 1 3 private reaching until 2024 with the aim of upgrading the country s infrastructure modernizing the economy boosting exports of manufactured goods and improving standards of living health and skills of the population and strengthening the demographic development medvedev and his cabinet was not the worst austerity culprit however as that title goes to the russian central bank and its chief elvira nabiullina ever since the financial crisis in the wake of the ukrainian cataclysm in 2014 the russian cb has maintained unnecessarily and punitively high interest rates which have strangled economic activity after the initial shock the central bank has been very slow in cutting the steering rate even when domestic inflation slowed to record lows and western interest rates turned negative to wit the cb has cut rates but very slowly remaining all the time seriously behind the slowing inflation the primary real interest rate cb key rate minus inflation has remained at the level of 4 ever since 2014 even going up to levels of 5 compared to the running inflation in 2015 and 2016 by running inflation we mean the rate of predictable inflation based on the latest months as opposed to the cumulative past 12 months inflation the cb made the serious error in its interest rate policies to be guided by the past 12 months instead of looking forward the inflationary peak caused by the onset of the ukrainian crisis and collapsing oil prices was limited to the period of september 2014 through march 2015 after which inflation was rapidly tamed and showed a going forward rate of 5 but guided by the rear mirror view the cb kept the interest rates astronomically high about this topic read more here presently annual inflation stands at 2 5 both the running rate and cumulative but the cb s key rate still towers at a mind boggling 6 25 that s a 3 75 real interest a level you would maintain in an emergency situation but not in a healthy economic environment that russia has today indeed if the cb does not intend to run counter to president putin s insistence to take all efforts to rapidly boost economic growth and people s living standards the cb has to give in the excessive interest rates are especially taking a toll on russia s birth rates which putin recently identified as one of russia s biggest challenges for the interest rate cuts to have any effect they would have to be made upfront with at least 1 5 within the next half a year we stressed above that we speak about areal interest rate because the actual real interest rate for businesses and households is yet much higher that would be the primary interest rate plus the notoriously high margins that russian banks charge for their loans the russian central bank has failed in creating anything close to normal borrowing conditions for small and medium sized business for this to happen the primary real interest must be seriously slashed with the same measure household mortgage rates should be brought down from present levels of 9 5 to 6 however the cb should not be given too much credit for that either in our opinion at the end of the analysis inflation is always and everywhere a supply side problem except for in cases of reckless government deficit spending and money printing schemes as domestic ruble prices were overly sensitive and always only on the upside to imports dominated in dollars and forex market fluctuations coupled with currency speculation there had been a rapid growth of domestic manufacturing and agriculture from 2000 to the onset of the crisis in 2014 which already seriously helped russia to wean off from imports we wrote about this in a seminal report from 2014 the decisive strike against the dollar euro then came after russia in response to western sanctions in 2014 banned food imports from those countries by these economic processes and also active de dollarization policies by the government as a result of which domestic prices decoupled from the dollar euro and inflation pressures yielded with growth stimulating interest rates the central bank would have aided the supply side growth to tame the inflation instead of exacerbating the situation joining a growing chorus of critics recently came out with harsh criticism of central bank policies he questioned the excessive inflation clampdown and called for a growth oriented and poverty fighting rate policy by putting an end to cb s financial austerity russia could reach annual gdp growth at levels of 5 according to deripaska the rates will go down but will it be enough and fast enough that remains to be seen let s hope the central bank will keep its cool and not let a potential turmoil on the global markets deflect it from interest rate cuts no significant increase in inflation pressure would follow even if the ruble would depreciate in connection with a potential global market turmoil

experimental antiviral treatment is to begin clinical testing all of the markets in the asia pacific region advanced with japan china and singapore gaining more than 1 europe s dow jones stoxx 600 is powering ahead with a 1 25 gain through the morning the third consecutive advance led by information technology and materials real estate and utilities are struggling us shares are firmer pointing to another gap higher opening in ny benchmark bond yields are backing up with the antipodeans jumping 10 11 bp playing catch up european benchmarks are mostly 2 3 bp higher while the us yield is near 1 63 having flirted with 1 50 at the end of last week the dollar s role as the fulcrum is evident as it is slipping against the currencies seen as levered to growth like the dollar bloc and scandis the greenback is firmer against the yen swiss franc and euro which are used as funding currencies jp morgan s emerging market currency index is higher for the third day running oil is getting a reprieve from the selling pressure that knocked it lower in 10 of the past 11 sessions though opec still is debating cuts in output gold continues to surrender its recent gains it has not gained this wee and is off about 40 an ounce asia pacific japan s service and composite pmi saw the flash gains pared but both retained their foothold above the 50 boom bust level services were revised to 52 0 from 52 1 and 49 4 in december the composite reading is at 50 1 from 51 1 of the flash report and 49 4 in december both are at their highest level since september the q4 gdp estimate is due february 16 the economy may have contracted by 1 in q4 quarter over quarter the rebound is expected to be muted by the fallout from the coronavirus china s caixin pmi has been superseded by events it does not capture the extent of the economic disruption the service pmi eased to 51 8 from 52 5 and the composite slipped to 51 9 from 52 6 meanwhile the us is sending conflicting signals to china the us secretary of state called the chinese communist party the central threat of our time while in the state of the union address late yesterday president trump said the us had the best relationship with china especially with president xi trump s economic adviser kudlow warned of proportionate action if china uses the virus as an excuse to break its newly struck trade commitments the dollar is extending its recovery against the yen yesterday s gains had it retrace 61 8 of its recent decline jpy109 50 and has poked through jpy109 70 in europe today the intraday technicals warn increases into the jpy109 80 jpy110 00 area may meet sellers the australian dollar is seeing follow through buying after it posted a key reversal yesterday it rebounded from a dip below 0 6680 yesterday to a little above 0 6740 and today has marched to nearly 0 6775 in so doing it has recouped half of what it lost since the start of china s lunar new year holiday january 23 here too additional near term gains may be hard pressed to secure the greenback opened sharply higher to start the week against the chinese yuan it has entered the gap yesterday and filled more of it today as it approached the 200 day moving average near cny6 9645 europe the key takeaway from the eurozone pmi is an uneven and modest recovery is taking hold the service pmi was a little better than the 52 2 flash estimate at 52 5 but still was a decline from december s 52 8 the service pmi of france was weaker than the flash at 51 0 vs 51 7 flash and 52 4 in december both spain and itay s service pmi eased from december s report the emu composite improved from the 50 9 flash and december reading to reach 51 3 of note the french economy was disrupted by more strikes against macron s pension reforms italy s composite moved back above the key 50 level 50 4 vs 49 4 and spain which had been a relative bright spot softened more than expected composite 52 3 from 54 9 in december a smaller decline was expected the uk s service and composite pmi show the economy is shrugging off the uncertainty that dampened activity at the end of last year and the recent decision by the bank of england not to cut rates seems validated by the recent data the service pmi rose to 53 9 from a 52 9 flash report and a 50 reading in december the composite pmi surged to 53 3 from 49 3 in december and a 52 4 earlier estimate these january readings are the strongest since last september the euro could not resurface above 1 1050 and the sellers in europe grabbed the initiative and pushed the euro below the 1 1030 retracement target while it is a poor technical omen support in the 1 0980 1 1000 may offer sufficient support in the near term to stem larger declines the realization that a hard brexit re marketed as an australia like trade relationship is still possible and maybe likely scenario saw sterling trade near 1 2940 yesterday before recovering it reached about 1 3045 yesterday and extended those gains to 1 3070 today just shy of a 50 retracement of the decline from monday s high near 1 3215 support is now seen near 1 30 america the us releases a slew of data that includes the adp private sector employment estimate the december trade balance preliminary estimate of the goods balance was released previously the final pmi services and the ism non manufacturing survey outside of the headline risks the data will not mean very much before the fed meets again march 18 new updates of these reports will be seen but arguably more importantly the pressure on the fed to adjust policy is not coming from domestic considerations still the global risks which while different are as profound as last year s challenges that prompted the three rate cuts the treasury s refunding announcement may draw attention actually it is not the refunding announcement itself after all it is well understood that the us is running around a trillion fiscal deficit in a non recessionary relatively peacetime economy instead the focus may be on three other elements of the announcement first some more insight into the resumption of the 20 year bond sales many expect them to resume in may another dimension of the issue is whether the new issue will reduce the amount raised in the other note and bond sales second is to help facilitate a shift from libor the treasury will issue some floating rate debt linked to the secured overnight financing rate sofr this will help create a term structure for the overnight rate and make it more operational for lenders and borrowers third the us treasury is running its highest cash balances since 2008 and this needs to be taken into account when assessing financial conditions at the same time the fed is buying 60 bln of t bills a month and these will continue into q2 they will likely last longer even as the fed retreats from the repo market though a slower pace is possible canada reports december s trade balance canada reported a trade deficit every month except may in 2019 through november the average shortfall was about c 1 5 bln the december deficit is expected to be around c 600 mln which would be the smallest since june investors often emphasize non oil exports canada reports its january employment data on friday along with the us brazil s central bank meets today and it is expected to cut the selic rate by 25 bp to 4 25 it cut rates four times in h2 19 and adjusted for inflation is hoving around zero this has pushed the brazilian real to record lows at the end of last week the dollar reached almost brl4 29 the us dollar is meeting resistance near cad1

tanmia capital director samer srouji considers whether gcc currencies should maintain their fixed exchange rate with the us dollar in the post oil era for more than three decades gcc economies have benefited from having their currencies anchored to the us dollar in that time the us dollar peg has served the region well providing monetary stability for investors traders and businesses alike but structural changes in the economies of the region including the re alignment of trade and investment ties towards asia make it reasonable to consider reform proposals gcc central bank governors attending the 72nd meeting of the gcc committee of governors of monetary institutions and central banks in muscat in march 2019 were clear about the challenges faced in the new oil era sparked by the oil price downturn in 2015 that year the region registered its largest fiscal deficit as governments imposed the first spending cuts in 20 years giving a new impetus to efforts to prepare for the post oil era while gcc states were able to defend the us dollar peg through their robust level of foreign reserves volatile oil prices and shifting trade patterns raise questions about the costs versus the benefits for the region of maintaining the us dollar anchor and whether this regime continues to be well suited to the needs of economies implementing an economic diversification agenda time for change being tied to us monetary policy has deprived policymakers of an essential tool to take countercyclical measures ie dampen inflation and prevent excess investment and trade surpluses when oil prices are high and the opposite when oil is low and may harm non oil sector competitiveness in the long term in monetary policy the choice of currency anchor should reflect trading relationships as well as the currency composition of public debt since gcc debt levels are generally low it is the structure of trade relationships that counts in its 2008 study why do countries peg the way they peg the determinants of anchor currency choice the imf stated that it is optimal for a country to adopt the anchor currency that minimises the sum of bilateral exchange rate volatilities weighted by the importance of each trade partner rise of asia the re alignment of gcc trade patterns particularly towards asia needs to be considered when weighing the benefits and costs of the current regime more than two thirds of saudi and uae imports were sourced from europe and asia in 2016 asia supplied 39 per cent of saudi imports a 10 per cent increase since 2000 and accounted for 40 per cent of the uae s imports north america meanwhile accounted for 15 per cent of saudi imports and 12 per cent of the uae s similarly more than half of exports for both economies were directed to europe and asia while north america barely registers as an export market at 3 and 4 per cent respectively as for energy exports 68 per cent of saudi arabia s oil exports went to east and south asia and the asia pacific region while for the uae 99 per cent went to those regions by comparison the americas accounted for 16 per cent of saudi oil exports and only 0 8 per cent of the uae s while this asian dominance of gcc energy exports may seem surprising asian countries have much fewer regional oil supplies to draw from this is in contrast to europe which sources a large part of its energy needs from russia norway and north africa while the us imports close to 45 perc ent of its oil from neighbouring canada in addition to producing for its own needs inflation risk while it can be argued that oil exports are denominated in us dollar and the dollar remains essential in any gcc exchange rate regime trade flow analysis suggests that the yuan and the euro should not be ignored one of the consequences of not including them becomes clear when one considers inflation when exchange rates are prevented from adjusting in the face of unexpected capital inflows or outflows adjustment can only take place through prices in the case of the gcc a sudden spike in the price of oil and resulting capital inflows can lead to significant increases in inflation while a drop can lead to deficits and capital outflows high inflation or deflation are never good for an economy and are why nearly all major commodity exporters canada new zealand and norway allow some fluctuations in their exchange rates and practice inflation targeting using interest rates norway for example implements a crawling band against the us dollar to manage oil price fluctuations in the run up to 2008 as oil prices peaked gcc states struggled to contain inflation which reached 12 3 per cent in the uae and 9 9 per cent in saudi arabia the chart below shows how closely inflation in the region follows oil prices inflation is only one outcome of being pegged to the dollar in the boom phase of capital inflows increased government and private spending financial and real estate bubbles and higher levels of imports which also feed inflation are other consequences having some exchange rate flexibility during the boom phase can help absorb inflation while raising interest rates can discourage excess spending and asset bubbles interest rates the problem with the peg is that gcc states are unable to utilise interest rates to manage the domestic economic cycle a particularly fatal combination was in the years leading to 2008 when low us interest rates coincided with high oil prices leaving policymakers with their hands tied similarly following the 2015 oil downturn gcc states would have benefited from continued low interest rates to boost economic activity yet us interest rates were on an upwards trend until late 2018 in may 2007 kuwait reintroduced a basket peg of the dollar the euro and possibly the yuan the official composition of the basket is undisclosed and regained control over its interest rate tying its currency to that of its main trade partners in europe and asia has allowed for better management of inflation as the exchange rate adapts to movements in the three major currencies the following chart shows the smooth progression of monthly inflation in kuwait from 2015 to 2019 against a composite index of oil prices and the yuan dollar exchange rate compared to more sporadic movements in saudi arabia and the uae where prices react more directly to movements in oil and the yuan kuwait saudi arabia and uae monthly inflation against index of oil and yuan dollar exchange rate 2015 2019composite index of oil price and yuan dollar exchange rate left axis and consumer price index right axis to understand this in practice when the yuan strengthens against the dollar imports from china become more expensive in aed and sr terms as the uae and saudi are pegged to the dollar resulting in imported inflation these are described as pass through effects in economics economist nasser saidi a member of the imf s middle east regional advisory group argued in 2018 that the dollar anchor was no longer appropriate for maintaining macroeconomic stability and suggested the adoption of a basket peg composed of the dollar the euro and yuan adjusted over time to reflect changes in trade gdp and financial ties anchoring to these three major currencies provides an equal level of credibility as being pegged to the dollar while enabling the economies to better navigate the imported inflation problem crucially a basket regime would also enable gcc central banks to exert better control over interest rates and the domestic economic cycle alternative approach another approach developed by harvard economist jeffrey frankel would be to include the weighted average price of oil in the basket peg alongside the three currencies what he calls a commodity plus currency basket while this approach is interesting allowing domestic currencies to quickly adapt to oil price movements it is untested and may prove too unstable for gcc currencies abandoning such a long standing element of monetary policy should not be done in haste reforming the exchange rate regime in favour of a three currency peg for example would require gcc states to implement important policy reforms this includes establishing a stronger inflation forecasting capacity as well as enhancing tools to intervene in money markets none of these reforms are beyond the capabilities of the gcc states and given the realignments that are taking place in the global economy would also serve to boost the non oil sectors they are seeking to develop about the author samer srouji is a director at tanmia

washington president donald trump used his state of the union address to make the case for his reelection claiming success in delivering on promises especially the economy unlike so many who came before me i keep my promises trump said at an event marked by partisan acrimony the tensions played out live on national television with trump refusing to shake house speaker nancy pelosi s hand at the start of his address and her dramatically ripping a copy of his speech into pieces when he was done trump delivered his speech the night before the senate is expected to acquit him on democratic initiated impeachment charges of abuse of power and obstructing congress but the partisan hostilities also can be linked to significant policy differences on issues such as border security immigration and tax cuts here s are some of trump s key campaign pledges and his record so far in office border and immigration trump s 2016 presidential campaign was just a few minutes old when he made a bold promise i will build a great great wall on our southern border and i will have mexico pay for that wall trump vowed after riding down an escalator into the gilded lobby of trump tower where he formally announced what some considered to be a quixotic campaign for president to those doubters in the room and around the country trump wrapped his campaign promise in a three word coda mark my words perhaps no other issue animated trump s campaign as much as immigration from his proposed impenetrable physical wall on the u s border with mexico to the dramatic changes he proposed to the legal immigration system trump hammered away at what he described on the campaign trail as one of the greatest challenges facing our country today during a major address on immigration in the summer of 2016 trump laid out 10 policies he promised to pursue from building the wall and requiring mexico to pay for it to ending catch and release to blocking funding for so called sanctuary cities that decline to cooperate with some requests from the department of homeland security trump has cracked down on illegal immigration and curtailed legal immigration as well but on the specific promises he made during his campaign the administration has a mixed record that s partly because the white house has been unable to make deals with democrats has pursued its policies unilaterally and has been repeatedly shut down in court he ll claim success but from our point of view the goalposts are quite different said frank sharry executive director of america s voice a washington based group that advocates on behalf of immigrants roy beck president of numbersusa gave the president generally high marks for meeting his promises on immigration a lot of this is effort he said if the courts stopped you that s not necessarily your fault the president s border wall is among the most illustrative examples the administration said this month it had built 100 miles of border wall for instance but virtually all of that construction has replaced barriers that previously existed during the obama administration that is despite a government shutdown in 2018 over wall funding and an emergency declaration that allowed trump to free up military funding for the wall mexico has not paid for the wall and its government has vowed it will not do so still the president is aggressively campaigning on the wall this year as well promising to build 450 miles of barrier by the end of 2020 i ve always thought of it more as a metaphor and rally change than anything close to being an effective immigration strategy sharry said building the wall homeland security chief marks completion of 100 miles of new border wall with plaque on other immigration fronts trump signed an executive order in 2017 to block sanctuary cities and counties from receiving federal funding but much of that order has been struck down or is pending in federal courts there were nearly 1 million border apprehensions in the 2019 fiscal year according to u s customs and border protection data that s almost double the year before but still below several peaks in the 2000s when border patrol was routinely catching more than a million people a year trump promised to remove immigrants in the country illegally but the number of deportations under trump about 267 000 in 2019 remains lower than virtually every year of the obama presidency trump meanwhile approved a plan last year to cap the number of refugees admitted to the united states to 18 000 the lowest level in four decades ago and he recently expanded a travel ban he implemented early in his term to six additional countries trump s travel ban which the administration re worked after a series of court losses suspends the issuance of certain types of visas from countries the administration says does not adequately screen visitors to the u s the initial version of the travel ban which trump had promised on the campaign trail led to chaos and protests at u s airports and was struck down by federal courts over concerns that it discriminated against muslims travel ban trump expands controversial travel ban restrictions to six new countries the economy trump promised annual economic growth of at least 3 on a sustained basis but dangled the possibility of 4 5 and maybe even 6 that hasn t happened unemployment is at a 50 year low and the economy has expanded an average 2 5 during the first three years of his term somewhat faster than the 2 2 post recession average before he took office the federal tax cuts he spearheaded along with government spending increases juiced growth to 2 9 in 2018 but gains slowed to 2 3 in 2019 and are expected to throttle back to slightly less than 2 this year and in 2021 an aging population and weak productivity growth are restraining the u s and global economy over the long term still trump s economic record has been very solid said douglas holtz eakin president of the american action forum a nonprofit group that promotes center right policies trump s rollback of federal regulations that stymied business growth has been stunningly large and impactful holtz eakin said and many of the corporate reforms included in the tax cuts and jobs package passed in late 2017 will benefit businesses for years he said tax cuts trump vowed the 1 5 trillion in sweeping tax cuts he spearheaded in 2017 wouldn t increase the federal deficit because they would pay for themselves through faster economic growth that swells government revenue but the tax law is projected to add 1 8 trillion to the deficit over the next decade according to the committee for a responsible federal budget while faster economic growth is forecast to generate about 570 billion in additional revenue that will be offset by higher interest payments on a bigger national debt the committee says trump also said the tax cuts would spark a wave of business investment as a result of both lower rates and changes allowing businesses to deduct capital spending more rapidly a study by the international monetary fund found the legislation did boost investment but by 3 5 percentage points but that was below the average 5 3 percentage point increase that was forecast about 80 of the tax savings was channeled into stock buybacks dividends and other similar activities while just 20 went to capital spending or research and development president donald trump and china president xi jinping in 2017 trade trump kept his promise to withdraw the trans pacific partnership a 12 nation trade deal negotiated by his predecessor barack obama on his third day in office trump signed an executive order pulling the u s out of the agreement which he had once called a rape of our country trump also lived up to a pledge to negotiate a new trade agreement with mexico and canada just last week trump signed into law the u s mexico canada agreement a revised trade pact that puts in place rules for moving products among the three countries and replaces the north american free trade agreement or nafta a quarter century old trade pact that trump had mocked as the worst trade deal ever on the campaign trail trump promised to cut a better deal with china that helps american businesses and workers compete after months of on again off again negotiations and a trade war in which the two countries slapped billions of dollars in tariffs on each other s products trump signed a limited phase one trade deal with china in january the agreement calls for china to buy an additional 200 billion worth of u s goods and services over the next two years including 32 billion in agriculture products trump said negotiations would begin soon on a broader agreement that he said could be completed after the 2020 election china trade what s in trump s phase one trade deal between the u s and china regardless trump gets a b minus on trade policy from daniel griswold a trade expert at the mercatus center at george mason university part of the reason griswold said is the new trade deal with mexico and canada looks a lot like nafta which trump had disparaged at the same time many parts of the new trade pact were lifted directly from the trans pacific partnership the deal trump abandoned after taking office what s more griswold said the nation s trade deficit has risen by 25 percent under trump when compared to obama s last year in office despite trump s campaign promise that under his administration the trade deficit would drop like you ve never seen before u s duties on 360 billion in chinese imports and china s counter tariffs on u s exports to that country lowered economic growth by three tenths of a percentage point last year and are expected to cut growth by a tenth of a point in 2020 said gregory daco chief u s economist for oxford economics and trump s trade fights have shaved u s employment by 340 000 jobs said mark zandi chief economist of moody s analytics on the positive side the phase one trade deal requires china to buy an additional 200 billion in agricultural and other goods from the u s over the next two years more than doubling current exports daco said it s questionable whether china has the desire and drive to boost shipments that much in any case he said it doesn t appear the u s has the capacity to produce that much more without shifting its exports to china from other countries leaving economic growth unchanged president donald trump smiles as he walks with his daughter ivanka trump across the south lawn of the white house in washington working families everybody is getting a tax cut especially the middle class trump promised when he was a candidate not everyone got a tax cut but many americans did an analysis by politifact found that under the tax cut and jobs package that passed congress at the end of 2017 every income group would pay less taxes in 2019 but that the benefits would flow disproportionately to wealthier taxpayers by 2027 every income group below 75 000 would see a tax increase while only those income ranges above 75 000 would still see a cut politifact found the primary reason is some of the individual tax cuts phase out after 2025 trump also embraced daughter ivanka trump s push for paid family leave when he was running for office at a campaign stop in pennsylvania trump called for six weeks of paid maternity leave as part of a package of childcare initiatives that idea went nowhere in congress but some 2 1 million civilian federal workers will be eligible for 12 weeks of paid leave after the birth of a child adoption or the start of foster care under a deal struck last year the paid leave policy was included in a compromise defense package congressional democrats signed off on money for trump s space force program while republicans agreed to demands on parental and family leave paid family leave for everyone is not going to happen this year holtz eakin said that s something he s going to have to promise in a second term speech drama he snubbed her handshake she tore up his speech drama between trump and pelosi was on full display at the state of the union address health care candidate trump promised americans he would repeal the affordable care act the landmark health care reform law enacted under obama real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing obamacare what a mess trump told a crowd at a political rally in toledo on oct 27 2016 but three years after trump took office obamacare is still in effect the big promise was the repeal and replacement of the affordable care act holtz eakin said that hasn t happened republicans in general had a fairly spectacular unsuccessful run at that they have however managed to dilute parts of the law in their 2017 tax package the gop eliminated the penalty on people who can afford health insurance but choose not to buy it the change wiped out one of the most unpopular provisions of obamacare but the law itself still stands even so obamacare s fate remains uncertain a federal judge ruled in texas ruled in 2018 that the affordable care act is unconstitutional finding that the mandate that everyone buy insurance or pay a fine is so central to the law that it cannot stand now that congress has rolled back the penalty a three judge appeals court panel has sent the case back to the texas judge to decide which portions of the law can stand repeal and replace 3 promises trump made about health care that repeal plans haven t kept national security trump may be hard pressed to articulate any major foreign policy accomplishments since many of his initiatives have yet to bear fruit his push to oust venezuela s president nicholas maduro has stalled his negotiations with north korea s kim jong un have fizzled his push for a peace deal with the taliban in afghanistan remains out of reach what s more trump s recently unveiled middle east peace plan years in the making was dismissed by regional experts as a nonstarter trump has unquestionably made good on his promise to take a hard line on iran but while he yanked the u s out of the 2015 nuclear deal and reimposed severe economic sanctions on iran he has not been able to persuade tehran s leaders to negotiate a new agreement with him instead iran has begun to abandon its commitments under the 2105 deal and appears to be inching toward acquiring a nuclear weapon and while trump has touted his decision to authorize a deadly strike killing gen qasem soleimani the powerful iranian military leader it is not clear if that will make americans safer shortly after the soleimani strike iran responded by launching ballistic missiles at an iraqi air base in an attack that left more than 60 u s service members with traumatic brain injury and while tensions have eased since soleimani s death many experts believe iran will continue to look for less overt but still lethal ways to retaliate against the u s for his killing president trump meets with kim jong un and is first u s president to step onto north korean soil north korea trump has met with north korean dictator kim jong un twice since last year s state of the union address in hanoi last february and at the demilitarized zone between north and south korea over the summer the president has said his bold new diplomacy could result in tremendous things for u s north korea relations but trump s unconventional strategy of engagement focusing on personal diplomacy at the highest level has yet to produce any concessions that would put north korea on the path to denuclearization kim has not tested long range ballistic missiles or nuclear weapons during the negotiations but he has continued to test short range missiles and other weapons and the region is on a knife s edge after kim promised to unveil a new strategic weapon and as trump s next move remains unclear in the meantime experts say north korea continues to improve its ballistic missile program and expand its nuclear arsenal with ongoing fissile material production ending forever wars trump promised in last year s state of the union address that he would reduce america s military presence in the middle east repeating his oft cited campaign pledge our brave troops have now been fighting in the middle east for almost 19 years he said great nations do not fight endless wars but trump has deployed more american troops to the region particularly in recent months amid escalating tensions with iran after trump authorized a deadly striking killing iran s soleimani the president sent an additional 3 000 troops to kuwait amid increased threat levels in the region according to the associated press 14 000 u s troops have been deployed to the middle east since may the president has successfully reduced u s troop levels in syria after a successful military campaign against the islamic state terrorist group but trump was forced to back off his call for a complete withdrawal from syria amid an uproar over what many saw as a betrayal of america s kurdish allies in syria who helped u s troops rout isis he also endured withering bipartisan criticism for his decision to withdraw about 50 american troops from the syria turkey border a decision that paved the way for turkey to invade syria and attack the kurds this article originally appeared on usa today state of the union where donald trump stands on promises
washington president donald trump used his state of the union address to make the case for his reelection claiming success in delivering on promises especially the economy unlike so many who came before me i keep my promises trump said at an event marked by partisan acrimony the tensions played out live on national television with trump refusing to shake house speaker nancy pelosi s hand at the start of his address and her dramatically ripping a copy of his speech into pieces when he was done trump delivered his speech the night before the senate is expected to acquit him on democratic initiated impeachment charges of abuse of power and obstructing congress but the partisan hostilities also can be linked to significant policy differences on issues such as border security immigration and tax cuts here s are some of trump s key campaign pledges and his record so far in office border and immigration trump s 2016 presidential campaign was just a few minutes old when he made a bold promise i will build a great great wall on our southern border and i will have mexico pay for that wall trump vowed after riding down an escalator into the gilded lobby of trump tower where he formally announced what some considered to be a quixotic campaign for president to those doubters in the room and around the country trump wrapped his campaign promise in a three word coda mark my words perhaps no other issue animated trump s campaign as much as immigration from his proposed impenetrable physical wall on the u s border with mexico to the dramatic changes he proposed to the legal immigration system trump hammered away at what he described on the campaign trail as one of the greatest challenges facing our country today during a major address on immigration in the summer of 2016 trump laid out 10 policies he promised to pursue from building the wall and requiring mexico to pay for it to ending catch and release to blocking funding for so called sanctuary cities that decline to cooperate with some requests from the department of homeland security trump has cracked down on illegal immigration and curtailed legal immigration as well but on the specific promises he made during his campaign the administration has a mixed record that s partly because the white house has been unable to make deals with democrats has pursued its policies unilaterally and has been repeatedly shut down in court he ll claim success but from our point of view the goalposts are quite different said frank sharry executive director of america s voice a washington based group that advocates on behalf of immigrants roy beck president of numbersusa gave the president generally high marks for meeting his promises on immigration a lot of this is effort he said if the courts stopped you that s not necessarily your fault the president s border wall is among the most illustrative examples the administration said this month it had built 100 miles of border wall for instance but virtually all of that construction has replaced barriers that previously existed during the obama administration that is despite a government shutdown in 2018 over wall funding and an emergency declaration that allowed trump to free up military funding for the wall mexico has not paid for the wall and its government has vowed it will not do so still the president is aggressively campaigning on the wall this year as well promising to build 450 miles of barrier by the end of 2020 i ve always thought of it more as a metaphor and rally change than anything close to being an effective immigration strategy sharry said building the wall homeland security chief marks completion of 100 miles of new border wall with plaque on other immigration fronts trump signed an executive order in 2017 to block sanctuary cities and counties from receiving federal funding but much of that order has been struck down or is pending in federal courts there were nearly 1 million border apprehensions in the 2019 fiscal year according to u s customs and border protection data that s almost double the year before but still below several peaks in the 2000s when border patrol was routinely catching more than a million people a year trump promised to remove immigrants in the country illegally but the number of deportations under trump about 267 000 in 2019 remains lower than virtually every year of the obama presidency trump meanwhile approved a plan last year to cap the number of refugees admitted to the united states to 18 000 the lowest level in four decades ago and he recently expanded a travel ban he implemented early in his term to six additional countries trump s travel ban which the administration re worked after a series of court losses suspends the issuance of certain types of visas from countries the administration says does not adequately screen visitors to the u s the initial version of the travel ban which trump had promised on the campaign trail led to chaos and protests at u s airports and was struck down by federal courts over concerns that it discriminated against muslims travel ban trump expands controversial travel ban restrictions to six new countries the economy trump promised annual economic growth of at least 3 on a sustained basis but dangled the possibility of 4 5 and maybe even 6 that hasn t happened unemployment is at a 50 year low and the economy has expanded an average 2 5 during the first three years of his term somewhat faster than the 2 2 post recession average before he took office the federal tax cuts he spearheaded along with government spending increases juiced growth to 2 9 in 2018 but gains slowed to 2 3 in 2019 and are expected to throttle back to slightly less than 2 this year and in 2021 an aging population and weak productivity growth are restraining the u s and global economy over the long term still trump s economic record has been very solid said douglas holtz eakin president of the american action forum a nonprofit group that promotes center right policies trump s rollback of federal regulations that stymied business growth has been stunningly large and impactful holtz eakin said and many of the corporate reforms included in the tax cuts and jobs package passed in late 2017 will benefit businesses for years he said tax cuts trump vowed the 1 5 trillion in sweeping tax cuts he spearheaded in 2017 wouldn t increase the federal deficit because they would pay for themselves through faster economic growth that swells government revenue but the tax law is projected to add 1 8 trillion to the deficit over the next decade according to the committee for a responsible federal budget while faster economic growth is forecast to generate about 570 billion in additional revenue that will be offset by higher interest payments on a bigger national debt the committee says trump also said the tax cuts would spark a wave of business investment as a result of both lower rates and changes allowing businesses to deduct capital spending more rapidly a study by the international monetary fund found the legislation did boost investment but by 3 5 percentage points but that was below the average 5 3 percentage point increase that was forecast about 80 of the tax savings was channeled into stock buybacks dividends and other similar activities while just 20 went to capital spending or research and development trade trump kept his promise to withdraw the trans pacific partnership a 12 nation trade deal negotiated by his predecessor barack obama on his third day in office trump signed an executive order pulling the u s out of the agreement which he had once called a rape of our country trump also lived up to a pledge to negotiate a new trade agreement with mexico and canada just last week trump signed into law the u s mexico canada agreement a revised trade pact that puts in place rules for moving products among the three countries and replaces the north american free trade agreement or nafta a quarter century old trade pact that trump had mocked as the worst trade deal ever on the campaign trail trump promised to cut a better deal with china that helps american businesses and workers compete after months of on again off again negotiations and a trade war in which the two countries slapped billions of dollars in tariffs on each other s products trump signed a limited phase one trade deal with china in january the agreement calls for china to buy an additional 200 billion worth of u s goods and services over the next two years including 32 billion in

will make americans safer shortly after the soleimani strike iran responded by launching ballistic missiles at an iraqi air base in an attack that left more than 60 u s service members with traumatic brain injury and while tensions have eased since soleimani s death many experts believe iran will continue to look for less overt but still lethal ways to retaliate against the u s for his killing north korea trump has met with north korean dictator kim jong un twice since last year s state of the union address in hanoi last february and at the demilitarized zone between north and south korea over the summer the president has said his bold new diplomacy could result in tremendous things for u s north korea relations but trump s unconventional strategy of engagement focusing on personal diplomacy at the highest level has yet to produce any concessions that would put north korea on the path to denuclearization kim has not tested long range ballistic missiles or nuclear weapons during the negotiations but he has continued to test short range missiles and other weapons and the region is on a knife s edge after kim promised to unveil a new strategic weapon and as trump s next move remains unclear in the meantime experts say north korea continues to improve its ballistic missile program and expand its nuclear arsenal with ongoing fissile material production ending forever wars trump promised in last year s state of the union address that he would reduce america s military presence in the middle east repeating his oft cited campaign pledge our brave troops have now been fighting in the middle east for almost 19 years he said great nations do not fight endless wars but trump has deployed more american troops to the region particularly in recent months amid escalating tensions with iran after trump authorized a deadly striking killing iran s soleimani the president sent an additional 3 000 troops to kuwait amid increased threat levels in the region according to the associated press 14 000 u s troops have been deployed to the middle east since may the president has successfully reduced u s troop levels in syria after a successful military campaign against the islamic state terrorist group but trump was forced to back off his call for a complete withdrawal from syria amid an uproar over what many saw as a betrayal of america s kurdish allies in syria who helped u s troops rout isis he also endured withering bipartisan criticism for his decision to withdraw about 50 american troops from the syria turkey border a decision that paved the way for turkey to invade syria and attack the kurds
washington president donald trump used his state of the union address to make the case for his reelection claiming success in delivering on promises especially the economy unlike so many who came before me i keep my promises trump said at an event marked by partisan acrimony the tensions played out live on national television with trump refusing to shake house speaker nancy pelosi s hand at the start of his address and her dramatically ripping a copy of his speech into pieces when he was done trump delivered his speech the night before the senate is expected to acquit him on democratic initiated impeachment charges of abuse of power and obstructing congress but the partisan hostilities also can be linked to significant policy differences on issues such as border security immigration and tax cuts here s are some of trump s key campaign pledges and his record so far in office border and immigration trump s 2016 presidential campaign was just a few minutes old when he made a bold promise i will build a great great wall on our southern border and i will have mexico pay for that wall trump vowed after riding down an escalator into the gilded lobby of trump tower where he formally announced what some considered to be a quixotic campaign for president to those doubters in the room and around the country trump wrapped his campaign promise in a three word coda mark my words perhaps no other issue animated trump s campaign as much as immigration from his proposed impenetrable physical wall on the u s border with mexico to the dramatic changes he proposed to the legal immigration system trump hammered away at what he described on the campaign trail as one of the greatest challenges facing our country today during a major address on immigration in the summer of 2016 trump laid out 10 policies he promised to pursue from building the wall and requiring mexico to pay for it to ending catch and release to blocking funding for so called sanctuary cities that decline to cooperate with some requests from the department of homeland security trump has cracked down on illegal immigration and curtailed legal immigration as well but on the specific promises he made during his campaign the administration has a mixed record that s partly because the white house has been unable to make deals with democrats has pursued its policies unilaterally and has been repeatedly shut down in court he ll claim success but from our point of view the goalposts are quite different said frank sharry executive director of america s voice a washington based group that advocates on behalf of immigrants roy beck president of numbersusa gave the president generally high marks for meeting his promises on immigration a lot of this is effort he said if the courts stopped you that s not necessarily your fault the president s border wall is among the most illustrative examples the administration said this month it had built 100 miles of border wall for instance but virtually all of that construction has replaced barriers that previously existed during the obama administration that is despite a government shutdown in 2018 over wall funding and an emergency declaration that allowed trump to free up military funding for the wall mexico has not paid for the wall and its government has vowed it will not do so still the president is aggressively campaigning on the wall this year as well promising to build 450 miles of barrier by the end of 2020 i ve always thought of it more as a metaphor and rally change than anything close to being an effective immigration strategy sharry said building the wall homeland security chief marks completion of 100 miles of new border wall with plaque on other immigration fronts trump signed an executive order in 2017 to block sanctuary cities and counties from receiving federal funding but much of that order has been struck down or is pending in federal courts there were nearly 1 million border apprehensions in the 2019 fiscal year according to u s customs and border protection data that s almost double the year before but still below several peaks in the 2000s when border patrol was routinely catching more than a million people a year trump promised to remove immigrants in the country illegally but the number of deportations under trump about 267 000 in 2019 remains lower than virtually every year of the obama presidency trump meanwhile approved a plan last year to cap the number of refugees admitted to the united states to 18 000 the lowest level in four decades ago and he recently expanded a travel ban he implemented early in his term to six additional countries trump s travel ban which the administration re worked after a series of court losses suspends the issuance of certain types of visas from countries the administration says does not adequately screen visitors to the u s the initial version of the travel ban which trump had promised on the campaign trail led to chaos and protests at u s airports and was struck down by federal courts over concerns that it discriminated against muslims travel ban trump expands controversial travel ban restrictions to six new countries the economy trump promised annual economic growth of at least 3 on a sustained basis but dangled the possibility of 4 5 and maybe even 6 that hasn t happened unemployment is at a 50 year low and the economy has expanded an average 2 5 during the first three years of his term somewhat faster than the 2 2 post recession average before he took office the federal tax cuts he spearheaded along with government spending increases juiced growth to 2 9 in 2018 but gains slowed to 2 3 in 2019 and are expected to throttle back to slightly less than 2 this year and in 2021 an aging population and weak productivity growth are restraining the u s and global economy over the long term still trump s economic record has been very solid said douglas holtz eakin president of the american action forum a nonprofit group that promotes center right policies trump s rollback of federal regulations that stymied business growth has been stunningly large and impactful holtz eakin said and many of the corporate reforms included in the tax cuts and jobs package passed in late 2017 will benefit businesses for years he said tax cuts trump vowed the 1 5 trillion in sweeping tax cuts he spearheaded in 2017 wouldn t increase the federal deficit because they would pay for themselves through faster economic growth that swells government revenue but the tax law is projected to add 1 8 trillion to the deficit over the next decade according to the committee for a responsible federal budget while faster economic growth is forecast to generate about 570 billion in additional revenue that will be offset by higher interest payments on a bigger national debt the committee says trump also said the tax cuts would spark a wave of business investment as a result of both lower rates and changes allowing businesses to deduct capital spending more rapidly a study by the international monetary fund found the legislation did boost investment but by 3 5 percentage points but that was below the average 5 3 percentage point increase that was forecast about 80 of the tax savings was channeled into stock buybacks dividends and other similar activities while just 20 went to capital spending or research and development trade trump kept his promise to withdraw the trans pacific partnership a 12 nation trade deal negotiated by his predecessor barack obama on his third day in office trump signed an executive order pulling the u s out of the agreement which he had once called a rape of our country trump also lived up to a pledge to negotiate a new trade agreement with mexico and canada just last week trump signed into law the u s mexico canada agreement a revised trade pact that puts in place rules for moving products among the three countries and replaces the north american free trade agreement or nafta a quarter century old trade pact that trump had mocked as the worst trade deal ever on the campaign trail trump promised to cut a better deal with china that helps american businesses and workers compete after months of on again off again negotiations and a trade war in which the two countries slapped billions of dollars in tariffs on each other s products trump signed a limited phase one trade deal with china in january the agreement calls for china to buy an additional 200 billion worth of u s goods and services over the next two years including 32 billion in agriculture products trump said negotiations would begin soon on a broader agreement that he said could be completed after the 2020 election china trade what s in trump s phase one trade deal between the u s and china regardless trump gets a b minus on trade policy from daniel griswold a trade expert at the mercatus center at george mason university part of the reason griswold said is the new trade deal with mexico and canada looks a lot like nafta which trump had disparaged at the same time many parts of the new trade pact were lifted directly from the trans pacific partnership the deal trump abandoned after taking office what s more griswold said the nation s trade deficit has risen by 25 percent under trump when compared to obama s last year in office despite trump s campaign promise that under his administration the trade deficit would drop like you ve never seen before u s duties on 360 billion in chinese imports and china s counter tariffs on u s exports to that country lowered economic growth by three tenths of a percentage point last year and are expected to cut growth by a tenth of a point in 2020 said gregory daco chief u s economist for oxford economics and trump s trade fights have shaved u s employment by 340 000 jobs said mark zandi chief economist of moody s analytics on the positive side the phase one trade deal requires china to buy an additional 200 billion in agricultural and other goods from the u s over the next two years more than doubling current exports daco said it s questionable whether china has the desire and drive to boost shipments that much in any case he said it doesn t appear the u s has the capacity to produce that much more without shifting its exports to china from other countries leaving economic growth unchanged working families everybody is getting a tax cut especially the middle class trump promised when he was a candidate not everyone got a tax cut but many americans did an analysis by politifact found that under the tax cut and jobs package that passed congress at the end of 2017 every income group would pay less taxes in 2019 but that the benefits would flow disproportionately to wealthier taxpayers by 2027 every income group below 75 000 would see a tax increase while only those income ranges above 75 000 would still see a cut politifact found the primary reason is some of the individual tax cuts phase out after 2025 trump also embraced daughter ivanka trump s push for paid family leave when he was running for office at a campaign stop in pennsylvania trump called for six weeks of paid maternity leave as part of a package of childcare initiatives that idea went nowhere in congress but some 2 1 million civilian federal workers will be eligible for 12 weeks of paid leave after the birth of a child adoption or the start of foster care under a deal struck last year the paid leave policy was included in a compromise defense package congressional democrats signed off on money for trump s space force program while republicans agreed to demands on parental and family leave paid family leave for everyone is not going to happen this year holtz eakin said that s something he s going to have to promise in a second term speech drama he snubbed her handshake she tore up his speech drama between trump and pelosi was on full display at the state of the union address health care candidate trump promised americans he would repeal the affordable care act the landmark health care reform law enacted under obama real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing obamacare what a mess trump told a crowd at a political rally in toledo on oct 27 2016 but three years after trump took office obamacare is still in effect the big promise was the repeal and replacement of the affordable care act holtz eakin said that hasn t happened republicans in general had a fairly spectacular unsuccessful run at that they have however managed to dilute parts of the law in their 2017 tax package the gop eliminated the penalty on people who can afford health insurance but choose not to buy it the change wiped out one of the most unpopular provisions of obamacare but the law itself still stands even so obamacare s fate remains uncertain a federal judge ruled in texas ruled in 2018 that the affordable care act is unconstitutional finding that the mandate that everyone buy insurance or pay a fine is so central to the law that it cannot stand now that congress has rolled back the penalty a three judge appeals court panel has sent the case back to the texas judge to decide which portions of the law can stand repeal and replace 3 promises trump made about health care that repeal plans haven t kept national security trump may be hard pressed to articulate any major foreign policy accomplishments since many of his initiatives have yet to bear fruit his push to oust venezuela s president nicholas maduro has stalled his negotiations with north korea s kim jong un have fizzled his push for a peace deal with the taliban in afghanistan remains out of reach what s more trump s recently unveiled middle east peace plan years in the making was dismissed by regional experts as a nonstarter trump has unquestionably made good on his promise to take a hard line on iran but while he yanked the u s out of the 2015 nuclear deal and reimposed severe economic sanctions on iran he has not been able to persuade tehran s leaders to negotiate a new agreement with him instead iran has begun to abandon its commitments under the 2105 deal and appears to be

2017 to block sanctuary cities and counties from receiving federal funding but much of that order has been struck down or is pending in federal courts there were nearly 1 million border apprehensions in the 2019 fiscal year according to u s customs and border protection data that s almost double the year before but still below several peaks in the 2000s when border patrol was routinely catching more than a million people a year trump promised to remove immigrants in the country illegally but the number of deportations under trump about 267 000 in 2019 remains lower than virtually every year of the obama presidency trump meanwhile approved a plan last year to cap the number of refugees admitted to the united states to 18 000 the lowest level in four decades ago and he recently expanded a travel ban he implemented early in his term to six additional countries trump s travel ban which the administration re worked after a series of court losses suspends the issuance of certain types of visas from countries the administration says does not adequately screen visitors to the u s the initial version of the travel ban which trump had promised on the campaign trail led to chaos and protests at u s airports and was struck down by federal courts over concerns that it discriminated against muslims travel ban trump expands controversial travel ban restrictions to six new countries the economy trump promised annual economic growth of at least 3 on a sustained basis but dangled the possibility of 4 5 and maybe even 6 that hasn t happened unemployment is at a 50 year low and the economy has expanded an average 2 5 during the first three years of his term somewhat faster than the 2 2 post recession average before he took office the federal tax cuts he spearheaded along with government spending increases juiced growth to 2 9 in 2018 but gains slowed to 2 3 in 2019 and are expected to throttle back to slightly less than 2 this year and in 2021 an aging population and weak productivity growth are restraining the u s and global economy over the long term still trump s economic record has been very solid said douglas holtz eakin president of the american action forum a nonprofit group that promotes center right policies trump s rollback of federal regulations that stymied business growth has been stunningly large and impactful holtz eakin said and many of the corporate reforms included in the tax cuts and jobs package passed in late 2017 will benefit businesses for years he said tax cuts trump vowed the 1 5 trillion in sweeping tax cuts he spearheaded in 2017 wouldn t increase the federal deficit because they would pay for themselves through faster economic growth that swells government revenue but the tax law is projected to add 1 8 trillion to the deficit over the next decade according to the committee for a responsible federal budget while faster economic growth is forecast to generate about 570 billion in additional revenue that will be offset by higher interest payments on a bigger national debt the committee says trump also said the tax cuts would spark a wave of business investment as a result of both lower rates and changes allowing businesses to deduct capital spending more rapidly a study by the international monetary fund found the legislation did boost investment but by 3 5 percentage points but that was below the average 5 3 percentage point increase that was forecast about 80 of the tax savings was channeled into stock buybacks dividends and other similar activities while just 20 went to capital spending or research and development trade trump kept his promise to withdraw the trans pacific partnership a 12 nation trade deal negotiated by his predecessor barack obama on his third day in office trump signed an executive order pulling the u s out of the agreement which he had once called a rape of our country trump also lived up to a pledge to negotiate a new trade agreement with mexico and canada just last week trump signed into law the u s mexico canada agreement a revised trade pact that puts in place rules for moving products among the three countries and replaces the north american free trade agreement or nafta a quarter century old trade pact that trump had mocked as the worst trade deal ever on the campaign trail trump promised to cut a better deal with china that helps american businesses and workers compete after months of on again off again negotiations and a trade war in which the two countries slapped billions of dollars in tariffs on each other s products trump signed a limited phase one trade deal with china in january the agreement calls for china to buy an additional 200 billion worth of u s goods and services over the next two years including 32 billion in agriculture products trump said negotiations would begin soon on a broader agreement that he said could be completed after the 2020 election china trade what s in trump s phase one trade deal between the u s and china regardless trump gets a b minus on trade policy from daniel griswold a trade expert at the mercatus center at george mason university part of the reason griswold said is the new trade deal with mexico and canada looks a lot like nafta which trump had disparaged at the same time many parts of the new trade pact were lifted directly from the trans pacific partnership the deal trump abandoned after taking office what s more griswold said the nation s trade deficit has risen by 25 percent under trump when compared to obama s last year in office despite trump s campaign promise that under his administration the trade deficit would drop like you ve never seen before u s duties on 360 billion in chinese imports and china s counter tariffs on u s exports to that country lowered economic growth by three tenths of a percentage point last year and are expected to cut growth by a tenth of a point in 2020 said gregory daco chief u s economist for oxford economics and trump s trade fights have shaved u s employment by 340 000 jobs said mark zandi chief economist of moody s analytics on the positive side the phase one trade deal requires china to buy an additional 200 billion in agricultural and other goods from the u s over the next two years more than doubling current exports daco said it s questionable whether china has the desire and drive to boost shipments that much in any case he said it doesn t appear the u s has the capacity to produce that much more without shifting its exports to china from other countries leaving economic growth unchanged working families everybody is getting a tax cut especially the middle class trump promised when he was a candidate not everyone got a tax cut but many americans did an analysis by politifact found that under the tax cut and jobs package that passed congress at the end of 2017 every income group would pay less taxes in 2019 but that the benefits would flow disproportionately to wealthier taxpayers by 2027 every income group below 75 000 would see a tax increase while only those income ranges above 75 000 would still see a cut politifact found the primary reason is some of the individual tax cuts phase out after 2025 trump also embraced daughter ivanka trump s push for paid family leave when he was running for office at a campaign stop in pennsylvania trump called for six weeks of paid maternity leave as part of a package of childcare initiatives that idea went nowhere in congress but some 2 1 million civilian federal workers will be eligible for 12 weeks of paid leave after the birth of a child adoption or the start of foster care under a deal struck last year the paid leave policy was included in a compromise defense package congressional democrats signed off on money for trump s space force program while republicans agreed to demands on parental and family leave paid family leave for everyone is not going to happen this year holtz eakin said that s something he s going to have to promise in a second term speech drama he snubbed her handshake she tore up his speech drama between trump and pelosi was on full display at the state of the union address health care candidate trump promised americans he would repeal the affordable care act the landmark health care reform law enacted under obama real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing obamacare what a mess trump told a crowd at a political rally in toledo on oct 27 2016 but three years after trump took office obamacare is still in effect the big promise was the repeal and replacement of the affordable care act holtz eakin said that hasn t happened republicans in general had a fairly spectacular unsuccessful run at that they have however managed to dilute parts of the law in their 2017 tax package the gop eliminated the penalty on people who can afford health insurance but choose not to buy it the change wiped out one of the most unpopular provisions of obamacare but the law itself still stands even so obamacare s fate remains uncertain a federal judge ruled in texas ruled in 2018 that the affordable care act is unconstitutional finding that the mandate that everyone buy insurance or pay a fine is so central to the law that it cannot stand now that congress has rolled back the penalty a three judge appeals court panel has sent the case back to the texas judge to decide which portions of the law can stand repeal and replace 3 promises trump made about health care that repeal plans haven t kept national security trump may be hard pressed to articulate any major foreign policy accomplishments since many of his initiatives have yet to bear fruit his push to oust venezuela s president nicholas maduro has stalled his negotiations with north korea s kim jong un have fizzled his push for a peace deal with the taliban in afghanistan remains out of reach what s more trump s recently unveiled middle east peace plan years in the making was dismissed by regional experts as a nonstarter trump has unquestionably made good on his promise to take a hard line on iran but while he yanked the u s out of the 2015 nuclear deal and reimposed severe economic sanctions on iran he has not been able to persuade tehran s leaders to negotiate a new agreement with him instead iran has begun to abandon its commitments under the 2105 deal and appears to be inching toward acquiring a nuclear weapon and while trump has touted his decision to authorize a deadly strike killing gen qasem soleimani the powerful iranian military leader it is not clear if that will make americans safer shortly after the soleimani strike iran responded by launching ballistic missiles at an iraqi air base in an attack that left more than 60 u s service members with traumatic brain injury and while tensions have eased since soleimani s death many experts believe iran will continue to look for less overt but still lethal ways to retaliate against the u s for his killing north korea trump has met with north korean dictator kim jong un twice since last year s state of the union address in hanoi last february and at the demilitarized zone between north and south korea over the summer the president has said his bold new diplomacy could result in tremendous things for u s north korea relations but trump s unconventional strategy of engagement focusing on personal diplomacy at the highest level has yet to produce any concessions that would put north korea on the path to denuclearization kim has not tested long range ballistic missiles or nuclear weapons during the negotiations but he has continued to test short range missiles and other weapons and the region is on a knife s edge after kim promised to unveil a new strategic weapon and as trump s next move remains unclear in the meantime experts say north korea continues to improve its ballistic missile program and expand its nuclear arsenal with ongoing fissile material production ending forever wars trump promised in last year s state of the union address that he would reduce america s military presence in the middle east repeating his oft cited campaign pledge our brave troops have now been fighting in the middle east for almost 19 years he said great nations do not fight endless wars but trump has deployed more american troops to the region particularly in recent months amid escalating tensions with iran after trump authorized a deadly striking killing iran s soleimani the president sent an additional 3 000 troops to kuwait amid increased threat levels in the region according to the associated press 14 000 u s troops have been deployed to the middle east since may the president has successfully reduced u s troop levels in syria after a successful military campaign against the islamic state terrorist group but trump was forced to back off his call for a complete withdrawal from syria amid an uproar over what many saw as a betrayal of america s kurdish allies in syria who helped u s troops rout isis he also endured withering bipartisan criticism for his decision to withdraw about 50 american troops from the syria turkey border a decision that paved the way for turkey to invade syria and attack the kurds
washington president donald trump used his state of the union address to make the case for his reelection claiming success in delivering on promises especially the economy unlike so many who came before me i keep my promises trump said at an event marked by partisan acrimony the tensions played out live on national television with trump refusing to shake house speaker nancy pelosi s hand at the start of his address and her dramatically ripping a copy of his speech into pieces when he was done trump delivered his speech the night before the senate is expected to acquit him on democratic initiated impeachment charges of abuse of power and obstructing congress but the partisan hostilities also can be linked to significant policy differences on issues such as border security immigration and tax cuts here s are some of trump s key campaign pledges and his record so far in office border and immigration trump s 2016 presidential campaign was just a few minutes old when he made a bold promise i will build a great great wall on our southern border and i will have mexico pay for that wall trump vowed after riding down an escalator into the gilded lobby of trump tower where he formally announced what some considered to be a quixotic campaign for president to those doubters in the room and around the country trump wrapped his campaign promise in a three word coda mark my words perhaps no other issue animated trump s campaign as much as immigration from his proposed impenetrable physical wall on the u s border with mexico to the dramatic changes he proposed to the legal immigration system trump hammered away at what he described on the campaign trail as one of the greatest challenges facing our country today during a major address on immigration in the summer of 2016 trump laid out 10 policies he promised to pursue from building the wall and requiring mexico to pay for it to ending catch and release to blocking funding for so called sanctuary cities that decline to cooperate with some requests from the department of homeland security trump has cracked down on illegal immigration and curtailed legal immigration as well but on the specific promises he made during his campaign the administration has a mixed record that s partly because the white house has been unable to make deals with democrats has pursued its policies unilaterally and has been repeatedly shut down in court he ll claim success but from our point of view the goalposts are quite different said frank sharry executive director of america s voice a washington based group that advocates on behalf of immigrants roy beck president of numbersusa gave the president generally high marks for meeting his promises on immigration a lot of this is effort he said if the courts stopped you that s not necessarily your fault the president s border wall is among the most illustrative examples the administration said this month it had built 100 miles of border wall for instance but virtually all of that construction has replaced barriers that previously existed during the obama administration that is despite a government shutdown in 2018 over wall funding and an emergency declaration that allowed trump to free up military funding for the wall mexico has not paid for the wall and its government has vowed it will not do so still the president is aggressively campaigning on the wall this year as well promising to build 450 miles of barrier by the end of 2020 i ve always thought of it more as a metaphor and rally change than anything close to being an effective

tenth of a point in 2020 said gregory daco chief u s economist for oxford economics and trump s trade fights have shaved u s employment by 340 000 jobs said mark zandi chief economist of moody s analytics on the positive side the phase one trade deal requires china to buy an additional 200 billion in agricultural and other goods from the u s over the next two years more than doubling current exports daco said it s questionable whether china has the desire and drive to boost shipments that much in any case he said it doesn t appear the u s has the capacity to produce that much more without shifting its exports to china from other countries leaving economic growth unchanged working families everybody is getting a tax cut especially the middle class trump promised when he was a candidate not everyone got a tax cut but many americans did an analysis by politifact found that under the tax cut and jobs package that passed congress at the end of 2017 every income group would pay less taxes in 2019 but that the benefits would flow disproportionately to wealthier taxpayers by 2027 every income group below 75 000 would see a tax increase while only those income ranges above 75 000 would still see a cut politifact found the primary reason is some of the individual tax cuts phase out after 2025 trump also embraced daughter ivanka trump s push for paid family leave when he was running for office at a campaign stop in pennsylvania trump called for six weeks of paid maternity leave as part of a package of childcare initiatives that idea went nowhere in congress but some 2 1 million civilian federal workers will be eligible for 12 weeks of paid leave after the birth of a child adoption or the start of foster care under a deal struck last year the paid leave policy was included in a compromise defense package congressional democrats signed off on money for trump s space force program while republicans agreed to demands on parental and family leave paid family leave for everyone is not going to happen this year holtz eakin said that s something he s going to have to promise in a second term speech drama he snubbed her handshake she tore up his speech drama between trump and pelosi was on full display at the state of the union address health care candidate trump promised americans he would repeal the affordable care act the landmark health care reform law enacted under obama real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing obamacare what a mess trump told a crowd at a political rally in toledo on oct 27 2016 but three years after trump took office obamacare is still in effect the big promise was the repeal and replacement of the affordable care act holtz eakin said that hasn t happened republicans in general had a fairly spectacular unsuccessful run at that they have however managed to dilute parts of the law in their 2017 tax package the gop eliminated the penalty on people who can afford health insurance but choose not to buy it the change wiped out one of the most unpopular provisions of obamacare but the law itself still stands even so obamacare s fate remains uncertain a federal judge ruled in texas ruled in 2018 that the affordable care act is unconstitutional finding that the mandate that everyone buy insurance or pay a fine is so central to the law that it cannot stand now that congress has rolled back the penalty a three judge appeals court panel has sent the case back to the texas judge to decide which portions of the law can stand repeal and replace 3 promises trump made about health care that repeal plans haven t kept national security trump may be hard pressed to articulate any major foreign policy accomplishments since many of his initiatives have yet to bear fruit his push to oust venezuela s president nicholas maduro has stalled his negotiations with north korea s kim jong un have fizzled his push for a peace deal with the taliban in afghanistan remains out of reach what s more trump s recently unveiled middle east peace plan years in the making was dismissed by regional experts as a nonstarter trump has unquestionably made good on his promise to take a hard line on iran but while he yanked the u s out of the 2015 nuclear deal and reimposed severe economic sanctions on iran he has not been able to persuade tehran s leaders to negotiate a new agreement with him instead iran has begun to abandon its commitments under the 2105 deal and appears to be inching toward acquiring a nuclear weapon and while trump has touted his decision to authorize a deadly strike killing gen qasem soleimani the powerful iranian military leader it is not clear if that will make americans safer shortly after the soleimani strike iran responded by launching ballistic missiles at an iraqi air base in an attack that left more than 60 u s service members with traumatic brain injury and while tensions have eased since soleimani s death many experts believe iran will continue to look for less overt but still lethal ways to retaliate against the u s for his killing north korea trump has met with north korean dictator kim jong un twice since last year s state of the union address in hanoi last february and at the demilitarized zone between north and south korea over the summer the president has said his bold new diplomacy could result in tremendous things for u s north korea relations but trump s unconventional strategy of engagement focusing on personal diplomacy at the highest level has yet to produce any concessions that would put north korea on the path to denuclearization kim has not tested long range ballistic missiles or nuclear weapons during the negotiations but he has continued to test short range missiles and other weapons and the region is on a knife s edge after kim promised to unveil a new strategic weapon and as trump s next move remains unclear in the meantime experts say north korea continues to improve its ballistic missile program and expand its nuclear arsenal with ongoing fissile material production ending forever wars trump promised in last year s state of the union address that he would reduce america s military presence in the middle east repeating his oft cited campaign pledge our brave troops have now been fighting in the middle east for almost 19 years he said great nations do not fight endless wars but trump has deployed more american troops to the region particularly in recent months amid escalating tensions with iran after trump authorized a deadly striking killing iran s soleimani the president sent an additional 3 000 troops to kuwait amid increased threat levels in the region according to the associated press 14 000 u s troops have been deployed to the middle east since may the president has successfully reduced u s troop levels in syria after a successful military campaign against the islamic state terrorist group but trump was forced to back off his call for a complete withdrawal from syria amid an uproar over what many saw as a betrayal of america s kurdish allies in syria who helped u s troops rout isis he also endured withering bipartisan criticism for his decision to withdraw about 50 american troops from the syria turkey border a decision that paved the way for turkey to invade syria and attack the kurds
the coronavirus outbreak has triggered demand for safe haven assets a similar pattern has been seen with the iran crisis and may reoccur throughout 2020 five financial assets stand out in these times of trouble whether it originates in wuhan or iran financial markets always have something to worry about but the demand for safe haven assets is changing the most recent coronavirus outbreak has been grabbing the headlines since mid january and will likely last for longer despite a low attention span in the age of social media arresting the disease will probably take some time and investors will not tune out so quickly it may have a similar effect as sino american trade tensions and like those fears they come and go triggering buying and selling of such assets the new year has resulted in different trends with some assets becoming more prominent others losing some shine and some have become trickier to trade here are five top safe havens in 2020 1 gold gold has made a comeback for various reasons goldbugs that were dismayed by the downfall at prices in the middle of the decade have begun returning to the generations old precious metal moreover some of those that were wooed by cryptocurrencies have become disillusioned both assets are attractive for those fearing central bank induced inflation gold has benefited from the federal reserve s interest rate cuts in 2019 and provides ample liquidity to the repo market and while some central banks are printing money others such as in russia and china have been diversifying their portfolios into gold another factor helping the yellow metal stems from the high demand for other rare materials such as palladium and rhodium used in modern automobiles overall xau usd is enjoying an uptrend that may continue there is still a long way to go to reach a peak near 2 000 recorded in 2011 leaving substantial room to rise within the chartered territory gold continues enjoying an uptrend 2 japanese yen the japanese currency tops the list of safe haven currencies but the yen trade is crowded leaving the crown to gold nevertheless usd jpy and other yen crosses had fallen when depressing news broke out even if it related to japan the devastating earthquake tsunami and nuclear disaster in fukushima in 2011 resulted in a rush to the yen despite the catastrophe for the island nation while its status has eroded since then the currency benefited from tensions around north korea and more recently iran it remains in demand also with the coronavirus 3 us bonds the us dollar is the world s reserve currency and treasury bonds still provide a high yield in comparison to other developed nations moreover america s debt market is deep and liquid allowing investors to flock into bills notes and bonds at almost any time while president donald trump s tax cuts have bloated the deficit and us debt ample liquidity provided by the fed and insatiable demand for bonds makes it the go to asset in debt markets it is essential to note that us debt is a worthy safe haven asset while the us dollar is losing its shine in 2020 similar to the yen usd demand is overcrowded moreover when investors flock into us treasuries they lower their yields making the dollar less attractive this yield dollar correlation was not that prominent in 2019 but seems to be gathering pace in 2020 4 swiss franc the small nation in the alps is home to secretive banks safety and solidity however the swiss national bank s decision to peg the value of the franc to the euro in 2011 and its chaotic abandoning of this floor in 2015 have pushed it lower in the ranks nevertheless 2020 has been positive for chf while it is not the first choice when bad news erupts it is neither sold off that quickly overall it serves as an appealing alternative to the beaten yen trade for those who prefer shying away from gold 5 german bunds lending money and expecting to receive less in return indeed that is what is happening in most of germany s yield curve the old continent s locomotive is showing only little signs of opening its purse strings to fiscal investment the combination of a shallow bond pool and high demand from the european central bank which has restarted its bond buying scheme in november amplify the need for german bunds apart from global issues such as the coronavirus the eu is grappling with brexit russian threats and political division in this changing world german bunds remain a haven nevertheless negative yields mean there is a limit to how far safe haven demand may go the interesting outcome for currency traders is the moderating effect that demand for bunds has on the euro eur usd volatility remains depressed while other assets are rocking and rolling what about bitcoin as mentioned earlier some goldbugs became bitcoin believers during the crisis around iran the granddaddy of cryptocurrencies soared however while prices remain above the end 2019 levels the coronavirus outbreak has failed to trigger a sustainable rally why sanctions hobble iran and some of its citizens have used bitcoin as a means to interact with the outside world fear of open war with the us and later the fading of these concerns pushed demand from both iranians and speculators from the outside however the novel coronavirus is not triggering substantial outflows from china at least not for now after an initial slide of the yuan it has recovered partly due to officials efforts to keep the economy stable without this kind of fear factor cryptocurrencies are not going to fly the world s second largest economy is home to many bitcoin miners and has yet to come to terms with its digital currency policy bitcoin is also tricky as a safe haven asset as its price is determined by so many other factors that are unrelated to the global mood hacks of exchanges regulation movements from altcoins to the btc hash rate whale activity and many other crypto related factors are all in the mix an increase in the value of bitcoin alongside rising global fears may therefore be coincidental and may not repeat itself bitcoin s case is more complicated conclusion the coronavirus scare is set to last for a significant period of time and when it diminishes other troubles will likely worry investors and trigger flows into safe havens gold is topping the list of havens in 2020 pushing the yen to second place us and german bonds
us president donald trump s state of the union speech once again was chock full of stretched facts and dubious figures many of these claims have been fact checked repeatedly yet the president persists in using them here in the order in which he made them are 31 statements by the president as is our practice with live events we do not award pinocchio ratings which are reserved for complete columns i am thrilled to report to you tonight that our economy is the best it has ever been the president can certainly brag about the state of the economy but he runs into trouble when he repeatedly makes a play for the history books our database of trump claims shows he has made a variation of this claim some 260 times there are several metrics one could look at but the current economy falls short according to experts we consulted the unemployment rate reached a low of 3 5 under trump but it was as low as 2 5 in 1953 trump has never achieved an annual growth rate above 3 but in 1997 1998 and 1999 the gross domestic product grew 4 5 4 5 and 4 7 respectively but even that period paled against the 1950s and 1960s growth between 1962 and 1966 ranged from 4 4 to 6 6 in 1950 and 1951 it was 8 7 and 8 respectively from the instant i took office i moved rapidly to revive the us economy enacting historic and record setting tax cuts trump constantly claims he passed the biggest tax cut in us history but that s false the best way to compare tax cuts or spending plans over time is to measure them as a percentage of the national economy trump s tax cut according to treasury department data is nearly 0 9 of gdp compared to 2 89 of gdp for ronald reagan s 1981 tax cut the actual largest tax cut when measured as a share of the us economy his tax cut is the 8th largest in the past century since my election we have created 7 million new jobs trump often inflates the number of jobs created under his presidency by counting from election day rather than when he took the oath of office there have been almost 6 7 million jobs created since february 2017 according to the bureau of labor statistics job creation under obama s last three years 227 000 a month still exceeds the monthly average of 191 000 a month under trump president donald trump delivering his state of the union address photo ap incredibly the average unemployment rate under my administration is lower than any administration in the history of our country this is ingenious and worth fact checking because the average over three years is hardly comparable to a four year or eight year average for other presidents for example the unemployment rate average was lower in lyndon johnson s second term than it has been under trump but when johnson s first term is factored in trump gains the edge the unemployment rate for disabled americans has reached an all time low the bureau of labor statistics has reported this rate since 2008 so it s a big stretch to call it an all time low the rate was 7 in december under my administration 7 million americans have come off of food stamps about 4 2 million people not 7 million have stopped receiving food stamps since february 2017 according to the latest data but experts say the improvement in the economy may not be the only reason for the decline several states have rolled back recession era waivers that allowed some adults to keep their benefits for longer periods of time without employment reports have also suggested immigrant families with citizen children have dropped out of the program fearing the administration s immigration policies moreover the number of people collecting benefits has been declining since fiscal 2014 in 8 years under the last administration over 300 000 working age people dropped out of the workforce in just 3 years of my administration 3 5 million working age people have joined the workforce trump never seems to remember or prefers to forget that barack obama took office during the world economic crisis since the great depression when 800 000 jobs a month were being shed the labor force participation rate fell sharply as people had trouble finding work as millions of jobs were eliminated in january 2009 the labor force participation rate was 65 7 and it fell to 62 8 by the time obama left office it has since inched up a bit to 63 2 under trump but it is still not back to pre recession levels of 66 as for trump s math here we re not able to replicate it over the course of obama s two terms labor force participation times the working age population gets you a gain of about 5 5 million under obama and nearly 5 million under trump this is a blue collar boom in the past year things have gotten grimmer for many blue collar workers the manufacturing sector is in a technical recession and only 9 000 manufacturing jobs have been gained since june compared to the 460 000 in the first 2 1 2 years of trump s presidency job growth has slowed in many blue collar sectors such as transportation construction and mining since my election the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased by 47 3 times faster than the increase for the top 1 trump is just spinning here net worth for the bottom half has gone up but it was from such a low base that it s pretty silly to call it a boom people in the bottom half have essentially no wealth just 1 6 of the nation s wealth as debts cancel out whatever assets they might have the top 5 hold more than 70 of all net worth in the united states kelli and gage hake of stillwater okla are recognized by president donald trump during his state of the union address photo ap everybody said that criminal justice reform couldn t be done but i got it done and the people in this room got it done trump signed the first step act in 2018 one of the biggest pieces of the first step act a provision that reduced sentences for crack cocaine offenses was an extension of obama s efforts in 2010 we gave three pinocchios to trump for claiming that he accomplished what obama could not in his speech tuesday night trump didn t mention obama when discussing the criminal justice law all of those millions of people with 401 k s and pensions are doing far better than they have ever done before with increases of 60 70 80 90 and even 100 trump often boasts that the value of 401 k retirement accounts has skyrocketed during his presidency even though there s no evidence of such huge gains and even though the census bureau reports only 32 of americans are saving for retirement with such plans an analysis by fidelity investments showed the average 401 k balance increased less than 1 when comparing the first quarters of 2018 and 2019 thanks to our bold regulatory reduction campaign the united states has become the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world by far the notion that a revolution in energy began under the trump administration is wrong the united states has led the world in natural gas production since 2009 crude oil production has been increasing rapidly since 2010 the united states was the top producer in 2013 in september 2018 the united states once again passed both russia and saudi arabia to become the largest global crude oil producer but the energy revolution he takes credit for began under obama with the tremendous progress we have made over the past three years america is now energy independent this is false the united states continues to import energy in 2018 the united states imported about 9 94 million barrels per day mmb d of petroleum from nearly 90 countries according to an energy information agency report with 43 coming from canada and 16 from persian gulf countries after losing 60 000 factories under the previous two administrations america has now gained 12 000 new factories under my administration with thousands upon thousands of plants and factories being planned or built factories conjures up images of smokestacks and production lines but the data set trump cited is not really about factories trump is using a bureau of labor statistics database set known as the quarterly census of employment and wages the data show that united states gained nearly 12 000 additional manufacturing establishments between the first quarter of 2017 through the second quarter of 2019 there was also a gain of 10 000 in obama s second term but more than 80 of these manufacturing establishments employ five or fewer people if those sound like pretty small factories that s because many are not factories the bls counts any establishment engaged in the mechanical physical or chemical transformation of materials substances or components into new products so that also includes businesses that transform materials or substances into new products by hand or in the worker s home and those engaged in selling to the general public products made on the same premises from which they are sold such as bakeries candy stores and custom tailors house speaker nancy pelosi of calif tears her copy of president donald trump s state of the union address after he delivered it photo ap following nafta s adoption our nation lost 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs this is misleading as trump attributes all manufacturing lost to the north american free trade agreement nafta when many other factors were responsible such as automation and china s entry into the world trade organization many politicians came and went pledging to change or replace nafta only to do absolutely nothing but unlike so many who came before me i keep my promises six days ago i replaced nafta and signed the brand new united states mexico canada agreement usmca into law the usmca is a modest reworking of nafta launched in 1994 with about 85 90 the same as the deal trump repeatedly trashed as terrible the us international trade commission which is tasked with evaluating the impact of trade agreements calculated the new deal would have a relatively minor impact usmca would raise us real gross domestic product by 68 2 billion 0 35 and us employment by 176 000 jobs 0 12 usitc said the usmca will create nearly 100 000 new high paying american auto jobs this is an invented figure the isitc report said the agreement would create about 28 000 jobs in the auto sector to safeguard american liberty we have invested a record breaking 2 2 trillion in the united states military trump is just talking about three years of defense funding added up together on an inflation adjusted basis not one year of trump s defense budgets has exceeded the high point in 2010 under barack obama i have raised contributions from the other nato members by more than 400 billion and the number of allies meeting their minimum obligations has more than doubled trump gives himself too much credit since 2006 each nato member has had a guideline of spending at least 2 of gross domestic product on defense spending defense expenditures for nato countries other than the united states have been going up in a consistent slope since 2014 that s when nato decided to boost spending in response to russia s seizure of ukraine s crimea region nato estimates that its european members and canada will add 130 billion in cumulative defense spending through 2020 in 2015 dollars as an increase over 2016 spending nato also estimates the cumulative figure will rise to 400 billion through 2024 before i took office health insurance premiums had more than doubled in just five years i moved quickly to provide affordable alternatives our new plans are up to 60 less expensive trump often makes this claim but we have not been able to verify the claim of a 60 reduction in costs the new short term health plans authorized by the trump administration are less expensive for a reason they offer skimpier coverage and thus provide less protection as for the doubling in health insurance premiums that claim is based on a white house report that made some questionable methodological choices we will always protect patients with pre existing conditions that is a guarantee in an ongoing court case the trump administration is supporting a total repeal of the affordable care act including its guarantee that patients can t be denied coverage for pre existing conditions republicans in congress tried for years to repeal the whole law trump has not presented a plan to cover the gaps in case the court challenge is successful moreover he has promoted short term plans which he touted in his speech that are not required to cover pre existing conditions through our pledge to american workers over 400 companies will also provide new jobs and education opportunities to almost 15 million americans trump usually describes this as jobs already created but apparently his language was tamed by a teleprompter these are not new jobs but training opportunities moreover the numbers reflect pledges over a five year period not something already achieved many companies signed up by offering training programs that already existed i was pleased to announce last year that for the first time in 51 years the cost of prescription drugs actually went down the consumer price index for prescription drugs in 2018 fell for the first time in 46 years but that s only when measuring calendar years from january to december which is somewhat arbitrary the president s record shrinks to 5 1 2 years when measuring non calendar years the cpi had last declined in the 12 month period ended july 2013 experts say the cpi for prescription drugs fails to account for rebates which can be substantial and may be giving a skewed picture because of recent market shifts toward generics and electronic payments by third parties a range of studies we found shows drug prices have not declined especially when it comes to branded drugs president donald trump departs after delivering his state of the union address photo ap as we speak a long tall and very powerful wall is being built we have now completed over 100 miles and will have over 500 miles fully completed by early next year trump doubled down on a promise for 500 miles of new border fencing by early next year which would require the current pace of construction to more than double department of homeland security officials have been trying to lower expectations lately saying they will have that much built or under construction he also exaggerates the barrier s sturdiness the washington post has reported that the steel and concrete bollard fence can be cut through with a souped up power saw and that a series of large flood gates must be left open for months every summer during monsoon season in the desert with unyielding commitment we are curbing the opioid epidemic drug overdose deaths declined for the first time in nearly 30 years overall drug overdose deaths fell in 2018 for the first time in 28 years according to cdc data but fentanyl overdose deaths increased 10 last year our brave ice officers arrested more than 120 000 criminal aliens charged with nearly 10 000 burglaries 5 000 sexual assaults 45 000 violent assaults and 2 000 murders many of the criminal aliens trump is describing are immigrants who were convicted of immigration or nonviolent offenses he quickly switched from the total for ice arrests 120 000 to a different number that includes all the different charges it s a misleading apples and oranges comparison because one individual may face multiple charges and not all arrests result in convictions before i came into office if you showed up illegally on our southern border and were arrested you were simply released and allowed into our country never to be seen again my administration has ended catch and release if you come illegally you will now be promptly removed we entered into historic cooperation agreements with the governments of mexico honduras el salvador and guatemala as a result of our unprecedented efforts illegal crossings are down 75 since may dropping eight straight months in a row and as the wall goes up drug seizures rise and border crossings go down the trump administration has tried but has not ended catch and release the policy of releasing asylum seekers and refugees many of them women and children into the country while they await a hearing in the clogged us immigration court system immigrants continue to be released southwest border apprehensions dropped 75 when measuring from may to december but when looking at all of trump s presidency the gains are almost negligible 42 359 apprehensions in january 2017 and 40 620 in december 2019 in the senate we have confirmed a record number of 187 new federal judges it s not a record trump has a long way to go to have appointed the most federal judges ronald reagan has the record with 383 followed by bill clinton with 378 and then barack obama with 329 through jan 18 2020 187 judges nominated by trump have been confirmed by the senate forty million american families have an average 2 200 extra thanks to our child tax credit this is an example of trump using correct numbers but he gives too much credit to himself and his republican colleagues the child tax credit has existed since 1997 and it s been expanded since then including in the recent tax law in 2016 under president barack obama 35 million american families took the tax credit with an average benefit of over 1 500 a year according to the treasury department so there s only been a modest increase in part because of inflation three years ago the barbarians of isis held over 20 000 square miles of territory in iraq and syria today the isis territorial caliphate has been 100 destroyed and the founder and leader of isis the bloodthirsty killer albaghdadi is dead the us military warned in a report issued the day trump spoke that isis remained a dangerous threat and the killing of baghdadi did not degrade to isis s capabilities uscentcom told the dod oig that following the death of isis leader abu bakr al baghdadi the group s capabilities in syria remained the same the report said uscentcom said that isis remained cohesive with an intact command and control structure urban clandestine networks and an insurgent presence in much of rural syria qasem soleimani directed the december assault on united states forces in iraq and was actively planning new attacks other than trump s assertion there is no publicly available evidence that iranian general suleimani directed the december attacks or that any possible attack was imminent

know the last quarter of 2019 was marked by protests as a consequence of the social unrest that started in october affecting economic growth as a result gdp fell 3 4 and 3 3 year on year in october and november after an expansion of 3 3 in the third quarter in the chart on the left you can see how the economy was affected by the social crisis this weakening can be explained by both supply and demand factors first is we re accompanied by damage to private and public infrastructure reducing the capacity of growth or in other words the aggregate supply of the economy according to official estimates the damage was equivalent to nearly 3 billion or 1 of the gdp affecting the public service as well as retail and transportation sectors reducing the average working hours however this supply shock should be temporary as the government announced an ambitious reconstruction agenda that would probably be implemented this year in fact there was a strong recovery in the december monthly gdp figure which posted an impressive 3 5 monthly change or 1 1 year on year over pressing private expectations this reinforces our expectations about a temporary slowdown there have also been important impact on domestic demand which have been reflected by different figures such as business and consumer confidence indicators and retail sales however some figures from retail and manufacturing sectors showed an improvement in december in line with the trend observed in gdp although unemployment has remained stable as seen in the chart on the bottom left it s probably that there could be a slight deterioration in the near future since the labor market has a delay following a slower growth it s important to pay special attention to the evolution of employment as it has an important impact on the banking sector especially in terms of asset quality despite this environment the inflation rate which is a key driver of our net income has gradually been increasing during the last month this trend can be seen in the top right chart which clearly shows the tradable inflation which represents nearly 60 of the cpi basket has led the pickup in the overnight inflation consequently the inflation rate achieved the policy target of 3 set by the central bank leaving more room for the central bank to have a neutral bias in its monetary policy the exchange rate has unusual volatility as seen in the chart on the right the chilean currency depreciated to clp840 reaching the lowest value seen in our history this led the central bank to announce an intervention equivalent to 20 billion to be implemented by weekly sales of usd of dollar in the open market until may of this year after this measure the fx strengthened to clp750 reducing the gap between the fx value and its long term fundamentals nevertheless the currency has weakened during the last week as a result of the lower copper prices given fierce on the impact of coronavirus on china s growth beyond the short term volatility it s worth mentioning the positive impact that the weaker pesos should have on net export offsetting at least partially the slightest growth expected in both consumption and investment now i would like to discuss our baseline scenario for this and the next year please go to slide number 4 the weaker activity observed in the fourth quarter 19 was likely the bottom of the negative cycle particularly we expect the economy to improve gradually this year resulting in an overall expansion of around 1 this year for 2021 we forecast an expansion of 2 2 which is consistent with a heavy convergence toward the potential growth our view is based on four main factors first demonstrations and disruption have calmed in relation to october and november this has made possible our gradual normalization of activities across all economic sectors the improvement observed in several december indicators is consistent with this diagnosis next the government announced a robust countercyclical fiscal plan in order to address social demand and reconstruction of public infrastructure specifically the finance ministry increased the fiscal spending growth in the 2020 budget to 10 from the 3 set formerly this change is mostly explained by additional spending of clp5 5 billion on infrastructure which has a positive fiscal multiplier third the multilateral weakening in the chilean peso generate better conditions for tradable sectors especially mining lastly we expect the central bank to leave the interest rate unchanged this year at 1 75 this interest rate is negative in real terms around minus 1 25 confirmed the existence of easing conditions in the monetary sector even though all these factors should contribute to improving the activity in the future uncertainty will potentially affect investment this year as seen in the chart on the top right our scenario considers an inflation rate hovering in the range between 3 and 3 5 during this year as a result of two opposite forces a weaker currency and on the other hand subdued gdp growth finally as i mentioned before we though not expect changes in the monetary policy rate this year since the cpi is within the range of the central bank taking into consideration the important uncertainty the central bank has more reasons to accumulate better information before changing the interest rate please move to slide 6 to analyze the evolution of the banking industry over the last 12 months loans in the chilean banking system have grown 10 and increased 3 quarter on quarter the slowdown of the chilean economy hasn t affected significantly loan growth in fact the 3 quarter on quarter growth is the same growth that we saw in the third quarter 19 nevertheless we d say that loan growth will gradually fall due to the below trend growth as i mentioned earlier according to the central bank survey for instance the banking industry has become more restrictive for granted loans and demand has weakened over the last quarter of 2019 the survey indicates that 50 of banks reported more restrictive terms for consumer loans the survey also indicated that there was less dynamism in the demand side in this context 42 of banks saw a reduction in demand for consumer loans as well as an 18 decrease for mortgage loans in terms of results the chilean banking industry posted net income of clp147 billion in the fourth quarter the decrease was mainly due to significantly higher loan loss provisions in line with the events seen during the fourth quarter 19 and to a lesser extent greater operating expenses as i mentioned before we will likely have a challenging year with a below trend growth and a potential deterioration in the labor market in this environment it s reasonable to expect that total loan growth for the industry will reach around 6 in nominal terms this year please turn to slide 8 to begin our discussion on banco de chile we are very proud to present our main achievements in 2019 we ended the year as the leader of the industry in many aspects especially in financial results we were ranked once again first in net income net operating income as well as in net fees we also recorded a very strong year in terms of sme and residential loan origination with a 11 3 and 14 4 year on year rise respectively these results have been achieved through our superior and consistent commercial and risk management strategies that focus to grow with an adequate risk return relation in key market segments as a result of our front end efforts and improvements to give the best service to our clients we were recognized as having the highest net promoter score and best customer service by procalidad a prestigious chilean non profit organization in addition the banker and brand finance honored our brand as the most valuable in the chilean banking industry and we also were recognized as the bank with the best corporate reputation in the last decade by merco as result of our continued concern to take care and developing our employees we were chosen as the best bank to work in chile according to university students survey by merco moreover showing our commitment with the environment during 2019 we issued our first green bond it was the first green bond from a chilean financial institution and it was issued to finance renewable energy for our operations lastly deva awarded us as having the best annual report of the banking sector reflecting our focus on improving our reporting process and offering valuable information to our stakeholders now i would like to pass the call to pablo who will go into more detail about financial results please turn to slide number 9 pablo mejia head of investor relations thank you rodrigo the fourth quarter was challenging as rodrigo mentioned we went from a scenario expecting strong growth in 2020 to subdued gdp with an expected rise in unemployment levels this undoubtedly will impact growth perspectives for the banking industry in 2020 in turn october and november were coupled with high credit costs damaged infrastructure and a drop in confidence levels despite this environment we were able to demonstrate the effectiveness and consistency of our business strategy and the value of our competitive advantages in the fourth quarter 2019 we posted a bottom line of clp147 billion only 3 below the prior quarter and 9 below the same period last year on a full year basis we recorded clp593 billion basically in line with the results in 2018 this is especially noteworthy when we compare results to that our peers as you can see on the bottom part of the slide we clearly outperformed all of the banks in our quarterly and yearly results as well as our roe this leading result is not by chance but it s consistent throughout our history we systematically post more predictable results throughout the economic cycles clearly staying us apart from our peers and generating greater value for our shareholders please turn to slide number 10 the fourth quarter operating revenues increased 5 when compared to the same period last year and 8 when compared to the full year period the quarterly and full year rise was generated by solid customer income expansion that rose 13 in the quarter and 12 for the year while non customer income dropped 18 in the quarter and 7 for the year customer income was driven by a 9 year on year rise in average interest earning assets that sustained net interest income growth for both the quarter and the full year specifically our net interest income excluding inflation revenues grew 7 during the fourth quarter of 2019 and 6 for the full year when compared to the same periods last year these figures were partially offset by the lower overall spreads due to a change in mix as a consequence of greater growth in mortgage and commercial loans together with the negative effect of the lower overnight rate that went from 2 8 on average in 2018 to 1 8 on average in 2019 fees continued to deliver solid results growing 34 in the fourth quarter of 2019 and 27 for the full year when compared to the same periods last year this was due to good dynamism of our transactional revenues principally from the retail products services such as higher usage rates derived from our larger atm network as well as our more intensive use of cards in addition we recorded a strong increment and an insurance brokerage fees associated with the income coming from the joint venture signed with an international insurer and an increase in 10 in gross written premiums we also had solid revenues from mutual fund management in line with the rise in aum the strong results in customer income permitted us to offset lower non customer income revenues owed mainly to higher revenues recognized in the fourth quarter of 2018 as a result of the adoption of debit value adjustments to a lesser degree we also had lower revenues from the position that hedges fx fluctuations and loyalty program fees as well as credit risk allowances for dollar denominated loans which coupled with the cumulative negative effect of flattened yield curves over the last 18 months on results term gapping and alm these drivers are partially offset by higher contribution of our u s structural gap position in both the fourth quarter of 2019 and the full year 2019 this had to do with higher inflation in the fourth quarter of 2019 as compared to year earlier for the full year although inflation has decreased in 2019 the effect of lower nominal rates benefited the funding of the u s structural asset position our focus at the bank has been to promote responsible growth in every segments we serve we firmly believe that this is the main pillar of our proven and successful track record we have advance toward growing our bottom line by selectively expanding in key market segments that provide adequate returns for the risks we take in the next slides we will show you in which segments we have grown and the evolution of our asset quality please turn to slide 11 total loans grew by 7 5 year on year and on a sequential quarterly basis slowed to 1 5 this trend is in line with both the weaker activity and the results showed by the central bank survey which concluded that banks have become stricter in terms of risk and that demand for loans has dropped nevertheless on an annual perspective according to our strategy our retail segment was the principal source of growth loans to individuals rose by 11 4 year on year and smes increased just over 10 during the same period the main drivers for retail loan growth were mortgages and commercial loans to smes mortgages grew 14 5 year on year and also had a similar level in the quarter when annualized we didn t see a drop in the quarter in mortgage loan growth because loans were in the pipeline before the events occurred however we observed a reduction in an about 20 of applications during october november and december versus the running rate smes also performed well posting double digit loan growth of 10 year on year and 1 6 on a sequential basis in fact origination the segment remained strong growing 9 over the last year and at similar levels when compared to the immediate prior quarter it s clear that this was a demanding quarter for the segment and in line with our approach to build solid long term relationships with our customers we assisted those clients which had difficulties during this period by providing them with flexible financing options at special rates to get their businesses back in order on other hand wholesale lending which was accelerating last quarter slowed and grew only 1 7 year on year and on sequential basis grew 1 2 it s important to emphasize that we continually focus on maintaining an adequate relationship of risk and return as well as rational use of our capital because of the current environment we have and because of the current environment we are taking conservative steps to ensure responsible growth in the segments regarding liabilities without a doubt we are the financial institution with the best funding structure in chile which remains as one of the most important competitive advantages we have the highest market share in demand deposits and these represent 38 of total assets in fact customer deposit has accelerated significantly year on year to 18 2 the high level of growth during this quarter is associated to our strong credit risk rating and their superior brand positioning that results in flight to quality in times of higher uncertainty this is proven in the churn of rate where we are clearly the bank with the greatest inflows of deposits in the industry during the fourth quarter of 2019 with 24 market share of the flow of deposits in 2019 we also continued pricing bonds at very good rates including subordinated bonds with spreads that were below average of the banking industry in fact we issued bonds not only in chile but also in norway hong kong japan australia and peru as a result as shown on the chart on the bottom right our cost of funding was once again the lowest in the industry reaching 2 6 on an annual basis please turn to slide 12 this quarter we posted a cost of risk of clp101 billion as you can see on the lower left chart we incurred a net credit deterioration of clp32 billion which was mainly originated in the retail segment as a result of particular circumstances that occurred in october and november nevertheless we posted improvement in december with the result as a result of better payment behavior and more normal development in the collection process also volume growth increased in our loan loss provisions by clp10 billion lastly the lower depreciation of the chilean peso to the u s dollar in the fourth quarter of 2019 when compared to the same period in 2018 had a positive effect on our allowances for loan losses denominated in foreign currencies by about clp2 billion partly offsetting the aforementioned impacts as you can see on the chart on the top right total overdue loans remained similar to the same period last beginning this year although during the crisis the mixed change specifically we saw an increase in about 30 days past due loan book we reached the cost of risk of 1 37 this quarter and 1 21 for the full year which we think are reasonable and levels considering the events occurred during the fourth quarter of 2019 please turn to the next slide number 13 we dedicated important resources to credit risk at banco de chile thanks to that we have built the bank with the best fundamentals as to face the weaker economic cycle in chile over the last decade we have been conservative and created the largest buffer in additional provisions among private banks as you can see on the chart on the left as of december we have clp213 billion of additional provisions substantially higher than our peers which is even more important when consider the implementation of base offering our coverage ratio including additional allowances reached 220 as you can see on the chart on the right this level of coverage is also substantially higher than all of our peers as a consequence of the prudent and consistent risk policies we ve had a stable and low cost of risk in npl ratios when compared to our peers we are confident that our commitment to managing risk prudently and growing responsibly throughout the cycles will permit us to continue outranking our competition not only in credit risk but also in the bottom line please turn to slide 14 on operating expenses total operating expenses increased 7 5 this quarter and the same level year on year personnel expenses were the main driver of this increase for both periods as a result of extraordinary bonuses granted to our employees due to the commitment during the events that occurred in the fourth quarter an increase in severance payments and a rise in salaries driven by the effect of inflation administrative and depreciation expenses decreased clp1 3 billion quarter on quarter and clp31 billion year on year in the fourth quarter of 2019 we incurred non recurring expenses of clp8 billion and fixed asset related expenses as a result of charge offs and repairs undertaken on branches and atms that were affected during the events that took place we also grew it and communication expenses due to software licensing and development of new it projects to strengthen the digital platforms and cybersecurity infrastructure these increases were offset by lower marketing expenses and a reduction in outsourced services and lower expenses related to assets received in lieu of payment it s important to mention that we are focused in improving our efficiency in the medium term from the 45 levels posted in recent past as you can see on the chart on the bottom left in this context i d like to mention some important advances of our strategic priorities that we have made during the last year that not only will support the reduction in the medium term expenses but also improvement in operating revenues and customer experience please turn to slide 15 we are proud of our robust and consistent results that we have had over time however we are aware about several challenges that we faced in different areas such as economic environment social changes more banking and non banking competition and new regulations in order to address this we have defined four main strategic focuses as you can see in this slide the first of these is to implement further steps in our digital transformation process that the bank has carried out in recent years as we mentioned in previous conference calls we have innovated in several fields including the creation of new websites for companies and individuals the launching of successful mobile apps for banking investment products and insurance which contributed to improving the speed and security of transactions made by our customers we have also made advances in business intelligence allowing us the company understand even more of the needs of our customers throughout their life cycle additionally we are working on several improvements in our crm during the last years in order to better provide information to our customers and our account managers thanks to this today we have even a more comprehensive understanding of our customers improving the service even more nevertheless we re ambitious and we want to go further based on our agile work methodology which is centered on simple fast processes with strong interconnections between different areas we are continuously improving our road map that aims to strengthen our value offering specifically we are identifying improvements in our processes with the goal of addressing more efficiently the needs of our customers and developing more embedded products we are very convinced by doing so we are building the foundation for a stronger growth in customer base and importantly to continue being the bank with the best customer experience in the chilean industry the second focus is related to reduce and manage operation risks in an environment of increasing use of technology in the banking sector in particular we have been working on strengthening our cybersecurity not only in reinforcing the perimeters and transactions but also on raising the awareness of our employees we are conscious that the main way of reducing the number of searches by promoting safe conduct of our workforce in this context during 2019 more than 80 of our banco de chile staff participated in training programs on issues related to the information security with an impressive increase in actions that mitigate potential fx furthermore we have continued to implement in several improvements in the service model of our branches a project that began in late 2018 which basically aims to move toward a more intensive use of digital technologies in particular we have ended a successful transformation of more than 100 branches by the incorporation of new self service terminals which promote even more of the use of digital tools by our customers in addition to that we have automated several back office activities allowing a reduction in several manual processes which allow account managers to have more time to service better the needs of our customers for this year we plan to continuing to deepening this initiative to complete the remaining branches another area that has received special attention in our strategy is productivity in order to improve our efficiency we have carried out a series of actions that aim to increase our income without raising our recurring costs some of these areas was been to reduce expenses and clean external advisor activities and new road map for internal processes more efficient supplier options and optimization of physical space among others it s important to mention that we have been implementing these measures gradually in order to maintain a superior quality of service we deliver to our customers we aspire to have a gradual improvement in efficiency ratios in the long term finally our strategy pay special attention to the main basis of our long term sustainability mainly through actions in the environmental social and corporate governance areas we are proud to have issued the first green bond in our history as well as have carried out a series of actions to support our sme clients who were affected by the events in october and november we also have the national entrepreneurial challenge contest in which more than 50 000 micro entrepreneurs participate and we also trained more than 7 000 people in financial education in this context i would like to also highlight that we are the bank with the greatest improvements in esg disclosure in chile according to the index released by bloomberg we are convinced that these focuses together with our strong competitive advantages will allow us to maintain our leadership in the industry please turn to slide number 16 summing up before we our results we believe that our results are positive when compared to our peers and with our own performance in previous years when taking into consideration the economic environment and the impact of the events that occurred in the fourth quarter our higher level of loans coverage ratio and additional provisions provide us with excellent capability to cope with the slowdown in our business activity additionally we are confident that our sound risk policies support a profitable business model and that this is focused on maintaining an adequate risk return relationship finally before moving on to questions i would like to mention some key takeaways in terms of gdp growth we expect the activity to grow around 1 in 2020 which should translate into banking industry loan growth of approximately 6 nominal loan growth will most likely be concentrated in the retail segment while larger companies will probably delay the investment decisions however as we mentioned in the first part of this presentation we expect a recovery in both gdp and loan growth for 2021 in this environment we expect net interest margin to remain at a level of around 4 1 this year due to the below trend growth this year and the potential increase in unemployment we believe cost of risk for us and the industry could increase we cannot rule out this ratio it would reach a level of around 1 3 to 1 4 given our prudent and conservative approach to credit risk we believe risk expenses may increase but below that of our peers since we expect the economy to improve in 2021 a lower cost of risk in 2021 is likely we expect that top line growth should slow but given our emphasis on cost control this should still translate into site improvements in efficiency ratio we expect a level of around 44 for 2020 with inflation hovering around 3 2 this should imply an effective tax rate of around 23 for this year our solid fundamentals superior risk management and sound strategy should permit us to maintain a sustainable roe of around 18 in the medium term in line with our baseline scenario roe should be slightly below this level in 2020 thank you and if you have any questions we d be happy to answer them questions and answers operator thank you the floor is now open for questions and our first question will come from ernesto gabilondo of bank of america please go ahead ernesto gabilondo bank of america analyst hi good morning rodrigo and pablo thanks for the opportunity my first question is related to loan growth and asset quality given a softer economic growth the protests that are likely to resume on march as they were in holidays expected higher unemployment and higher debt in chile and the challenges to reach constitutional agreements considering pinera s approval of 6 and the congress approval of 3 how do you see the downside risk for loan growth and the upside risk for the cost of risk for the year and then my second question is in the line of expenses opex growth was 9 in 2019 so where do you see the growth for this line in this year and finally considering your guidance should we expect mid single digit net earnings growth this year thank you rodrigo aravena chief economist and senior vice president of institutional relations hi thank you very much for the question and this is rodrigo aravena for the first part related to the loan growth before moving to that answer from paola i think that it s very important to understand the trend that we are expecting for the china economy this year we are expecting an economy growth of around 1 for 2020 however it s very important to keep in mind that in the fourth quarter of 2019 the economy contracted by almost 2 what i m trying to say is that we are expectating that economy to move from very weak fourth quarter toward a more positive activity during this year in part because the government announced an important countercyclical plan because the central bank has been maintained at very low level of interest rate and additionally it s very important to mention that the chilean economy has been very so this is a shock particular if you take a look to the latest figure you must take the monthly gdp growth in december was a positive surprise because the economy recovered most part of the previous contraction that we saw between october and november so to answer that even though the weak the below trend activity growth that we expect for this year as a whole i would like to put on the tables that we are expecting a recovery from that very weak activity in the fourth quarter toward a more positive growth in the first quarter so that idea only just to put in context our scenario for the loan growth pablo mejia head of investor relations so in line with the slower gdp and the potential increased unemployment we re expecting obviously a slowdown in the growth levels so as rodrigo mentioned we re expecting somewhere around 1 for gdp for 2020 with inflation hovering around 3 2 and we re estimating that the growth should be around 6 nominal for the industry historically elasticity of loans is about to gdp is about two times and we think that the retail products should be driving the growth for the industry and the wholesale should be slightly below that 6 level should be below that 6 level in terms of banco de chile in line with what i just mentioned we are focusing to continue to grow responsibly and taking care of our risk return relationship and we re aiming or focusing to growing high quality sme customers consumer loans basically the retail segment so we should be growing in line with that 6 but with a special emphasis in the retail segment and always taking care of our spreads and growing responsibly in terms of opex growth we should be growing we re as we mentioned in the presentation we ve been implementing a strategy that continues to focus in improving how we operate the bank and the administration expenses especially and in line with our new service models that should all assist us including the digitalization of the bank and automation of back office processes to continue improving our costs so we re expecting for 2020 a level of growth that should be below inflation for us and in terms of net income we should expect to continue in the medium term a level of around 18 roe and we could consider that we should have low to medium single digit growth ernesto gabilondo bank of america analyst perfect thank you very much operator okay our next question will come from jason mollin of scotiabank please go ahead jason mollin scotiabank analyst yes hi just some continued further questions on the profitability outlook you mentioned most of the line items we re paying attention so two that i d like some further details one is fees you mentioned very strong fee income growth in the fourth quarter on the back of insurance brokerage due to the joint venture and increase in premiums as well as an increase in fees from credit cards and atms as well as mutual funds if you can talk to us a little bit about the drivers there and what we should expect going forward and secondly in the construct of this outlook for 18 roe in the medium term what are you considering for taxes do you think that tax rates will go up given the need to finance expenditures by the government thank you pablo mejia head of investor relations in terms of fees evolution for banco de chile most of our fees are generated by the retail segment so the growth will be determined in that time one of the areas that we saw strong growth in 2019 and that should continue in 2020 is this agreement this joint venture with this insurance company we ll be recognizing important revenues in terms of fees of around above 2019 is something around the levels of clp30 billion clp30 billion to clp40 billion on top of that we ve been having very good growth in written premiums and the insurance business in terms of other business and the subsidiaries the asset management and stock brokerage that will depend a lot on the evolution of the economy on how those will be driven in 2020 and then transactional products we should also think that we should be growing in line slightly higher in terms of customer growth in customers we grow about 6 year on year and we should be at least growing at levels similar to that and also obviously this will like an upside risk would be that the economy improves above our baseline scenario rodrigo aravena chief economist and senior vice president of institutional relations i would like to reinforce one idea of our loan term assumption so basically what we re taking like the key assumptions that the economy will be able to maintain the potential growth rate which is around 3 so basically in our scenario the slowdown will be only temporary which in part was confirmed by the improvement in the activity in december it s very important to consider as well that we are expecting a high year inflation rate for this year in comparison to the previous year which is a positive driver as well for the net income for the bank mainly because the exchange rate today is weaker than before in chile the inflation rate is very sensitive to the change in the effects in the currency so the key assumption here is that the slowdown is mainly temporary and that economy will be able to converge toward a more healthy long term agreeable in the long term pablo mejia head of investor relations i think it s also important to mention in relation to income is the risk will play a very important part in 2020 so in terms of the evolution of the economy and how risk develops it will be important for the bottom line of the bank so the bottom line can grow faster obviously if risk is in lower levels and then in terms of and and finishing off going back on fees for one second we should be expecting double digit growth in terms of fees jason mollin scotiabank analyst and so on the expected tax effective tax rate are you making any assuming any changes daniel galarce head of financial control hi this is daniel galarce we are not expecting nothing different from this year i mean effective tax rate should be in the range of 23 to 24 considering an inflation of around 3 we don t have any piece of information signaling that this should change in the future jason mollin scotiabank analyst thank you very much operator our next question will come from tito labarta of goldman sachs please go ahead tito labarta goldman sachs analyst hi rodrigo and pablo thank you for the call i guess my question is in terms of gdp growth and in terms of potential sensitivities to the upside and downside i mean for the recovery that you expect in 2021 what do you need to see for that to happen or possibly be better and conversely what could make it worse so what are you looking at in terms of to drive the gdp growth just given the political uncertainty and the constitutional vote expected what would you like to see and what could be upside and downside risk to that thank you rodrigo aravena chief economist and senior vice president of institutional relations okay hi this is rodrigo aravena thank you very much for the question basically what we have today in chile in this scenario is combination between supply and demand factors from the supply side as we mentioned in the presentation seen some areas in terms of infrastructure which was equivalent to nearly 1 of the gdp which obviously affects negatively the capacity of growth capacity of production in the economy however the government announced an important plan of construction in this infrastructure so it s very important to pay attention when the government will be able to begin this the construction in critical areas for example in the subway and other areas in terms of the impact on demand as you mentioned there will be very important discussions this year in critical in key areas constitution pensions etc and therefore the evolution of the discussion is very important mainly because the impact in terms of business confidence and investment etc but we don t have enough information today because this type of discussion will be held mainly between april and may of this year so all in all what we expect today is an economic growth of around 1 with a neutral bias we don t have a negative bias in this estimate mainly because we have a positive surprise in the economy in december and because as i mentioned before both fiscal and monetary policies will be supportive for growth this year we also have to pay special attention to the copper price and the chinese economic growth because china represents nearly 50 of total export of chile so the recent negative news from coronavirus etc is also important for the china economy but more important is that we expect to recover for 2021 because we basically we think that all the measures announced by the government and the central bank will be positive for the economy in terms of the breakdown we expect a negative growth for investments this year minus 3 nearly for total consumption we expect an increase of around 1 in terms of export around 2 so but more importantly we think that both part of this negative cycle was in the previous quarter and pablo if you wanted to add tito labarta goldman sachs analyst thanks that was very helpful rodrigo rodrigo aravena chief economist and senior vice president of institutional relations okay thanks operator our next question will come from emilio acevedo please go ahead emilio acevedo santander analyst hello thank you for the call i was just wondering about the excess capital that you can have because of basel iii do you have any particular number in mind and with this excess of capital you can have a potential higher dividend for 2021 thank you daniel galarce head of financial control hi daniel galarce what we know so far are some regulations that have been published by the cmf for comments today we have a drop of regulation for risk weighted assets for operational risks and also financial risks and in addition some rules regarding buffers countercyclical buffer conservation buffer and also the systemic buffer although we believe that probably this regulation is very in line with basel iii guidelines which is very positive of course we are still evaluating the final effect that this will have in our capital adequacy first of all we have some preliminary estimates and in our view the regulation that has been published so far is very in line with our preliminary estimates as long as we have more details and a detailed analysis of all of these regulations probably we ll have a more specific a more specific estimate however and due to this regulation is more focused on the characteristic of the counterparty rather than on accounting methodology we believe that we should be benefit more or less because of this because of this basel iii approach nevertheless as i told you we are still evaluating what s going to be the final effect today probably we have a kind of positive gap with respect to fully loaded limit for instance common equity tier 1 ratio however we believe that this positive gap is going to afford or is going to be the basis for future growth in terms of total loans as long as the economy retakes the economic growth so we are not thinking that we have an excess of capital today and according to that we don t see any extraordinary dividend for 2020 or 2021 we feel comfortable with the levels of capital we have to date we believe that probably the basel iii approach will benefit us as compared to our peers for instance since we have a premium loan portfolio and a premium customer base for instance but however we can t rule out that we re going to use or we re going to utilize this our capital base in order to support future growth of our balance sheet emilio acevedo santander analyst thank you very much operator and our next question will come from yuri fernandes with jp morgan please go ahead yuri fernandes jp morgan analyst hi gentlemen thank you rodrigo i have a question regarding your additional coverage it s pretty high you mentioned in the presentation and my question is if you have like a level like a number that you don t feel comfortable in going lower and what s your plan to use that coverage in the current credit cycle thank you pablo mejia head of investor relations hi yuri well we have a good level of coverage including additional provisions in banco de chile and we ve been generating this additional coverage through the use of additional provisions during the last decade when we realized these additional provisions were for periods of more stressful periods not for any particular customer segment and we don t have we ve never actually released these provisions in the past for an economic cycle but if there was an event that affected us significantly and the banking industry or the banking industry and us that would be a reason to release these provisions we don t have a specific number in terms of coverage but we expect that we should continue hovering around the same levels that we had historically had based on our credit risk model so our credit risk models don t have a target for coverage it s the result of our credit risk models based on overdue loans beginning from day one yuri fernandes jp morgan analyst but pablo if i may follow up like do you plan to use those reserves now like can you use a little bit i got like the message but can we see like some more volatility on the additional provisions pablo mejia head of investor relations and in terms of our baseline scenario our baseline scenarios at chile is relatively are in level but we re expecting a baseline scenario for cost of risk is something slightly above what we had in 2019 between maybe 1 3 1 4 and a more cost of risk percentage of cost of risk and a more negative bias however it s not clear that we will actually reach these levels and at these levels it s more difficult to justify releasing provisions when the banking industry and us haven t been wouldn t be significantly impacted with that level of cost of risk this is more for example in 2009 when there was a crisis in the south of chile in a certain sector the banks had a lot very large effect of this where for example we can use these additional provisions but there is no there is nothing today that would suggest that we could use this and it s not a baseline scenario yuri fernandes jp morgan analyst super clear thank you very much operator and our next question will come from neha agarwala of hsbc please go ahead neha agarwala hsbc analyst hi and thank you for taking my question my first question is on our loan growth i understand that you expect the economy to grow around 5 6 but is it fair to say that you are taking a more cautious stand on loan growth because wholesale will remain weak and i believe the competition in retail will be higher because everybody will be focusing on retail and you would like to focus more on the risk reward perspective so not compromising on margins i believe so would that translate into slightly lower growth than the system and the second question is on expenses i believe you mentioned that you expect to grow expenses in line or slightly below inflation do you expect any drawn recurring expenses for 2020 could you elaborate on how many branches were impacted from the riots and if everything was insured could we see some impact in this year thank you so much pablo mejia head of investor relations hi neha in terms of our loan growth expectations like rodrigo mentioned we re expecting 2020 to have a gdp growth of around 1 and generally the elasticity of loans to gdp is 2 times so that include inflation we re expecting somewhere close to 6 for loan growth where we re focusing more in the retail segment we have a very good retail segment of customers that is focusing upper income individuals and we have what we can say the best sme portfolio in chile so we re expecting to continuing leveraging this customer base to continue growing in 2020 which is something similar that we ve done in prior years that s where we ve seen stronger growth in our retail segment thanks to our customer base which also provides us with attractive returns and generally lower cost of risk because of the segments that they are in in terms of expenses could you repeat the question neha agarwala hsbc analyst how many branches were affected last year and is everything is insured do you expect any non recurring expenses in 2020 pablo mejia head of investor relations so last year we had nine branches which were closed because of the events but all of these branches were insured so we re not expecting any significant impact in terms of this material impact in terms of these events the rest of the branch network there is minor damage but it wasn t something significant neha agarwala hsbc analyst thank you so much pablo mejia head of investor relations you re welcome operator and our next question will come from sebastian gallego of credicorp capital please go ahead sebastian gallego credicorp capital analyst hi good morning everyone thanks for the call i have couple of questions the first one if you can if you could elaborate a bit more on the nims and rates for this year you mentioned that you expect stability around 4 1 can you talk about the sources that may drive this stability and then the second question is regarding cost of risk and i know you show on the presentation on slide 12 a bit of the evolution of overdue loans i know it s a bit too early but could you maybe share what are you seeing so far this year in 2020 and how that trend do you expect to evolve our 2020 and maybe one last question you mentioned during the call that probably the contribution from chubb this year will be more like clp30 billion to clp40 billion i understand previous guidance was around clp60 billion for this year can you elaborate if that change or if maybe i understood wrong thank you pablo mejia head of investor relations hi sebastian in terms of your first question there is a variety of facts that affect net interest margin for 2020 for us in the banking industry like we mentioned we re expecting somewhere around the level of 4 1 for net interest margin and so i would say there is three effects that would be more negative and there is a few positive effects so you have the lower overnight rates we ve been experiencing which impact pricing initially the drop of the rates are positive in repricing of our liabilities now we re repricing at lower levels but there s also higher risk so that also helps and adjust in offsetting this impact the second thing that is important is that take into consideration in terms of nim is that the long term rates in 2019 were very low before the events that occurred and this triggered customers to refinance their mortgage loans so this had a this will have a negative effect on our net interest margin and the third negative effect would be the new regulation that was put in place in january of this year which obligates bank to offer customers to choose to automatically pay their overdraft lines with funds in their current account so we have about 2 of loans in overdraft lines obviously not all of that would disappear but a portion of that would disappear in terms of the loan and also in terms of deposits because what s being used as the deposits in the current accounts to repay these loans so this new regulation will have an impact as well in terms of our net interest margin nevertheless it s important to take into consideration that in terms of our baseline scenario we re looking to continue to grow our retail book we think that in this year we will grow at around 6 for loans and we re focused to grow at that same around that same level with a focus geared toward sme loans and consumer loans so better mix should help us in terms of the net interest margins as well as we are expecting higher inflation for 2020 so this also has a benefit in net interest margin as well as a steeper yield curve so these things these what i mentioned should help maintain our levels of net interest margins around 4 1 as we mentioned in terms of your second question cost of risk and that slide i think it was slide number 12 we have the evolution of cost of risk i think one of the very important things to mention there so you can see how the overdue loan book in one to 29 days has decreased significantly thanks to a more active corrections in banco de chile we think that the levels that we ve seen the improvements that we have seen in the last months if this continues can be positive for 2020 and that can change our bottom line obviously because every 10 basis points of cost of risk is about clp30 billion before tax in a positive or a negative impact in 2020 it s difficult to say the evolution of how the customer behavior will be especially in these two months of the year which tend to be more cyclical in terms of payment behavior because people are on vacation so it s a difficult period of time in order to analyze the evolution of cost of risk but what we saw in december was quite positive where we were able to reduce significantly the early overdue loan book sebastian gallego credicorp capital analyst perfect and regarding chubb pablo mejia head of investor relations in terms of chubb so chubb is an agreement that we have entered into this agreement a couple of years ago and we recognized the revenues beginning july 2019 more or less we recognize about based on the model it s about clp5 billion per month in chubb which basically means for 2020 versus 2019 which was closer to clp3 5 billion so we should have about clp30 billion more in recognitions in chubb fees in 2020 than in 2019 sebastian gallego credicorp capital analyst okay alright thank you very much very clear operator this concludes the question and answer section at this time i would like to turn the floor back to banco de chile for any closing remarks please go ahead rodrigo aravena chief economist and senior vice president of institutional relations thanks and thanks for your

operations generated adjusted ebitda of 85 million compared to 652 million in the prior year and european operations delivered adjusted ebitda of 64 million compared to 86 million in the prior year for the fourth quarter of 2019 norbord recorded adjusted ebitda of 27 million versus 33 million in the third quarter of 2019 and 70 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 the quarter over quarter decline was primarily due to lower shipment volumes attributed to higher downtime partially offset by modestly higher north american osb prices the year over year decline was primarily due to lower north american osb prices as well as lower shipment volumes 2019 was a challenging year for norbord said peter wijnbergen norbord s president and ceo our financial results were disappointing relative to our record performance in 2018 as the slowdown in us housing starts through most of 2019 decreased north american osb demand and a slowing of german industrial production put downward pressure on european panel prices in the face of these challenges we focused on reducing both costs and production by indefinitely curtailing operations at our 100 mile house british columbia mill and line 1 at our cordele georgia mill despite the tough markets norbord s mills performed well in north america we consolidated downtime across our mill portfolio which allowed us to more efficiently allocate production volumes this resulted in record production at two mills and lower north american unit manufacturing costs in europe we had record production at both our osb mills including at our expanded inverness scotland mill which continues to ramp production to meet growing demand we reinvested more than 140 million in our mills and returned 130 million in cash to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share buybacks while our fourth quarter results reflected the continued weakness in north american housing markets osb prices have started to recover in recent weeks further the outlook for new home construction in 2020 is encouraging with december s seasonally adjusted annualized pace of permits for us housing starts up nearly 6 year over year to 1 42 million we expect a healthy pick up in osb demand as the spring building season approaches in europe our panel business is set for another solid year as osb demand in our key markets is supported by the ongoing trend of substitution against plywood and our reinvested inverness scotland mill continues to ramp up with a solid balance sheet and a diversification strategy that is growing non traditional end uses

down slightly from 70 in 2018 of note however the actual pace of us housing activity lagged prior year levels through most of 2019 only turning positive in november us housing economists are forecasting 2020 starts of approximately 1 33 million which suggests an increase of 3 over 2019 according to apa the engineered wood association north american osb production which is a proxy for osb

below historical averages throughout 2019 benchmark osb prices decreased steadily in the first half of the year due to lower demand from the continued pullback in us homebuilding activity which started in the second half of 2018 as affordability concerns that had negatively affected us housing demand in recent quarters began to moderate driven by lower mortgage rates and real wage growth benchmark osb prices improved modestly in the fourth quarter of 2019 the north central benchmark osb price ranged from a low of 180 per msf 7 16 inch basis in april to a high of 230 per msf in

industrial production while housing starts were in line with the previous year performance norbord s occupational safety and health administration osha recordable injury rate was 1 31 in 2019 and two mills completed recordable injury free years in north america full year shipment volumes decreased 5 driven primarily by the production curtailments taken to match the company s supply with customer demand fourth quarter shipments were 19 lower than the prior quarter and 17 lower than the same quarter last year primarily due to the curtailments taken during the fourth quarter as well as fewer fiscal days in the current quarter annual production records were achieved at two of the company s north american osb mills for the full year norbord s operating osb mills produced at 85 of available capacity compared to 95 in 2018 excluding the curtailed chambord quebec mill the decrease in capacity utilization was driven by the december 31 2018 restatement of annual production capacities at a number of mills as well as the downtime and indefinite curtailments taken during the year norbord s 2019 north american osb cash production costs per unit excluding mill profit share decreased 1 versus the prior year due to improved productivity lower resin prices and the foreign exchange translation impact of a weaker canadian dollar partially offset by higher raw material usages and increased curtailments european shipment volume was slightly higher in 2019 due to changes in product mix annual production records were achieved at the company s two european osb mills all of norbord s panel mills ran on full production schedules excluding maintenance and holiday shutdowns and produced at 88 of stated capacity in both 2019 and 2018 norbord expects to ship more osb in 2020 from the continued ramp up of the reinvested inverness mill as well as the completion of the second wood room and dryer for 2019 the company generated modest margin improvement program mip gains as improved

require more product norbord s 2020 capital expenditure budget is approximately 100 million for maintenance of business projects and projects focused on reducing manufacturing costs across the mills as well as a portion of the chambord mill rebuild and the inverness expansion project it also includes investments to support the company s strategy to increase the production of specialty products for industrial applications and exports operating working capital increased by 32 million during the year to 120 million at year end primarily due to lower accounts payable and accrued liabilities higher inventory was offset by lower accounts receivable the lower accounts payable and accrued liabilities were primarily attributed to lower mill profit share and bonus accruals due to lower earnings as well as lower accrued capital expenditures higher inventory was primarily a result of higher finished goods inventory levels due to the timing of mill curtailments lower accounts receivable was primarily attributed to lower north american pricing and shipment volumes working capital continues to be managed at minimal levels across the company at year end the company had unutilized liquidity of 272 million comprising 20 million in cash and cash equivalents 237 million in revolving bank lines and 15 million in available drawings under its accounts receivable

s 2019 management s discussion and analysis dated february 4 2020 for a quantitative reconciliation of adjusted ebitda and adjusted earnings to earnings the most directly comparable ifrs measure february 5 2020 to our shareholders fiscal 2019 was a challenging year for norbord and for the north american wood products industry more generally as a slow us housing market created headwinds for our industry we worked diligently as a company to confront these issues and undertook a number of initiatives to adjust our operations to the current realities in particular we took significant downtime across our mills and made the difficult but necessary decisions to indefinitely curtail production at two of our north american mills we generated 138 million of adjusted ebitda in 2019 well down from our record result in 2018 an extraordinary year in which we generated the highest adjusted ebitda in norbord s history we were challenged by market conditions that resulted in persistently weak osb prices throughout 2019 in response we consolidated downtime across our operating north american mills which allowed us to more efficiently allocate production volumes resulting in record production at two mills and lower north american unit manufacturing costs this reflects our team s fundamental focus on continuous improvement and operational discipline and our ongoing commitment to cost management we also continued our balanced approach to creating shareholder value we saw a compelling opportunity to buy back 44 million of our shares at prices we view to be well below intrinsic value we also used our variable dividend policy in the way it is intended adjusting it to the current business conditions while still returning 86 million of cash to shareholders on the strength of our prudent approach to capital allocation we ended the year with a solid balance sheet giving us the continued flexibility to evaluate and pursue value enhancement opportunities managing through challenging conditions despite favourable underlying indicators us homebuilding demand was slow to translate into construction activity in the second half of 2018 and through most of 2019 this trend did not begin to improve until the end of 2019 as a buildup of unsold housing inventory was eventually absorbed mortgage rates continued to ease and builders adjusted their product offerings to suit growing demand for more affordable entry level homes in response to the backdrop of softer osb demand through most of the year we took deliberate action to adjust our production indefinitely curtailing our 100 mile house british columbia mill and line 1 of our mill in cordele georgia combined these curtailments reduced our available north american capacity by nearly 12 aligning our production to customer demand these were necessary but difficult decisions that impacted our experienced hard working team of employees at both mills i would like to once again thank them for their efforts and commitment our north american specialty products sales volumes were mixed in 2019 while our export sales were impacted by global trade uncertainty our industrial sales increased we remain focused on fulfilling the real opportunities we see for industrial products growth the investments we have made in the finishing ends at many of our mills have given us new product capabilities allowing us to work with customers on new applications such as the use of osb for the core of products like countertops and other overlay applications we will continue to adapt our production capabilities to expand the overall osb market in europe slower industrial production in germany and the continued uncertainty from brexit caused prices to decline from recent peaks toward historic averages as a result our ebitda decreased but remained above the longer term average and 2019 still represented the third best year ever for our european business while prices will fluctuate and influence our margins overall european osb demand continues to grow supported by the ongoing trend of osb substitution for plywood our expanded inverness scotland mill is an important strategic asset positioning us to benefit from the steady increase expected in european osb demand as the ramp up at inverness continues we expect the mill s productivity and cost performance to further improve safety is an overarching priority for norbord and 2019 was a source of both disappointment and optimism our osha recordable injury rate increased to 1 31 though fortunately none of the injuries were serious as part of our commitment to achieving world class safety performance last year we launched stronger together a new company wide safety initiative aimed at reinforcing the importance of safety to both our employees and our company performance we are encouraged by the level of employee engagement we have seen to date and are confident this commitment will support our efforts toward continuous safety improvement priorities for 2020 our focus in 2020 is on seizing the opportunities of an improving osb market in north america and regaining momentum seasonally adjusted annual us housing permits were 1 42 million in december up 6 year over year and we are encouraged by the demand we are seeing from our customers in the first weeks of the year additionally consensus forecasts from us housing economists point to 3 year over year growth in starts and industry experts expect north american osb markets to tighten in 2020 as demand increases and the 2019 capacity shutdowns are fully realized we are undertaking a number of initiatives across our mill portfolio to support operational productivity we have consolidated the downtime and curtailments we took in 2019 and will focus on running our mills even more efficiently consistent with this focus we are implementing projects to reduce manufacturing costs and making investments to support our strategy to increase production of specialty products for industrial applications and exports we will continue to allocate our capital with discipline we have set a 2020 capital budget of 100 million which is sufficient to support our product growth objectives and our focus on operating efficiently and safely but which is about half of our annual investment over the past three years a portion of our 2020 budget includes further work on the second phase investment at our inverness mill as well as additional capital at our chambord quebec mill where we continue to prepare for an eventual restart though no decision has yet been made about timing we also remain committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders and our variable dividend policy gives us the flexibility to balance capital allocation decisions with the inherent cyclicality in our business similarly we will continue to carefully examine our production capacity we have the ability to bring back indefinitely curtailed capacity when market conditions warrant but these decisions will continue to be guided by market analysis and customer demand in 2020 we will also provide greater disclosure of our esg environmental social and governance performance we have always focused on our environmental performance as a positive attribute for our business we believe we have a good story to tell on the esg front as wood is a renewable resource and wood products like osb actually sequester carbon in fact we estimate the net impact of the osb production from our operations offsets the annual emissions from approximately 900 000 vehicles while 2019 was a difficult year we managed our operations and balance sheet in a prudent manner that we believe positions our company well for the coming year and beyond we are confident that a strengthening osb market will translate into better financial performance in 2020 and as always we thank our shareholders for their investment in norbord in closing i would like to recognize nigel

bch earnings call for the period ending december 31 2019 banco de chile bch 0 07 q4 2019 earnings call 10 30 a m et contents prepared remarks questions and answers call participants prepared remarks operator hello everyone and welcome to banco de chile s fourth quarter 2019 financial results conference call if you need a copy of the press release it is available on the company s website today with us we have mr rodrigo aravena chief economist and senior vice president of institutional relations mr pablo mejia head of investor relations daniel galarce head of financial control and natalia villela investor relations specialist before we begin i would like to remind you that this call is being recorded and that information discussed today may include forward looking statements regarding the company s financial and operating performance all projections are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially please refer to the detailed note in the company s press release regarding forward looking statements i would now like to turn the call over to mr rodrigo aravena you may proceed rodrigo aravena chief economist and senior vice president of institutional relations good afternoon everyone and thank you for participating in this conference call today i would like to share with you our view about the evolution of the chilean economy with additional emphasis in the new macro perspective after that pablo mejia our head of investor relations will analyze the financial results achieved by banco de chile during the last quarter and our guidance for this year as usual we will finalize this conference call with the q a section i would like to start with an overview of the chilean economy please flip to slide number 3 as you probably know the last quarter of 2019 was marked by protests as a consequence of the social unrest that started in october affecting economic growth as a result gdp fell 3 4 and 3 3 year on year in october and november after an expansion of 3 3 in the third quarter in the chart on the left you can see how the economy was affected by the social crisis this weakening can be explained by both supply and demand factors first is we re accompanied by damage to private and public infrastructure reducing the capacity of growth or in other words the aggregate supply of the economy according to official estimates the damage was equivalent to nearly 3 billion or 1 of the gdp affecting the public service as well as retail and transportation sectors reducing the average working hours however this supply shock should be temporary as the government announced an ambitious reconstruction agenda that would probably be implemented this year in fact there was a strong recovery in the december monthly gdp figure which posted an impressive 3 5 monthly change or 1 1 year on year over pressing private expectations this reinforces our expectations about a temporary slowdown there have also been important impact on domestic demand which have been reflected by different figures such as business and consumer confidence indicators and retail sales however some figures from retail and manufacturing sectors showed an improvement in december in line with the trend observed in gdp although unemployment has remained stable as seen in the chart on the bottom left it s probably that there could be a slight deterioration in the near future since the labor market has a delay following a slower growth it s important to pay special attention to the evolution of employment as it has an important impact on the banking sector especially in terms of asset quality despite this environment the inflation rate which is a key driver of our net income has gradually been increasing during the last month this trend can be seen in the top right chart which clearly shows the tradable inflation which represents nearly 60 of the cpi basket has led the pickup in the overnight inflation consequently the inflation rate achieved the policy target of 3 set by the central bank leaving more room for the central bank to have a neutral bias in its monetary policy the exchange rate has unusual volatility as seen in the chart on the right the chilean currency depreciated to clp840 reaching the lowest value seen in our history this led the central bank to announce an intervention equivalent to 20 billion to be implemented by weekly sales of usd of dollar in the open market until may of this year after this measure the fx strengthened to clp750 reducing the gap between the fx value and its long term fundamentals nevertheless the currency has weakened during the last week as a result of the lower copper prices given fierce on the impact of coronavirus on china s growth beyond the short term volatility it s worth mentioning the positive impact that the weaker pesos should have on net export offsetting at least partially the slightest growth expected in both consumption and investment now i would like to discuss our baseline scenario for this and the next year please go to slide number 4 the weaker activity observed in the fourth quarter 19 was likely the bottom of the negative cycle particularly we expect the economy to improve gradually this year resulting in an overall expansion of around 1 this year for 2021 we forecast an expansion of 2 2 which is consistent with a heavy convergence toward the potential growth our view is based on four main factors first demonstrations and disruption have calmed in relation to october and november this has made possible our gradual normalization of activities across all economic sectors the improvement observed in several december indicators is consistent with this diagnosis next the government announced a robust countercyclical fiscal plan in order to address social demand and reconstruction of public infrastructure specifically the finance ministry increased the fiscal spending growth in the 2020 budget to 10 from the 3 set formerly this change is mostly explained by additional spending of clp5 5 billion on infrastructure which has a positive fiscal multiplier third the multilateral weakening in the chilean peso generate better conditions for tradable sectors especially mining lastly we expect the central bank to leave the interest rate unchanged this year at 1 75 this interest rate is negative in real terms around minus 1 25 confirmed the existence of easing conditions in the monetary sector even though all these factors should contribute to improving the activity in the future uncertainty will potentially affect investment this year as seen in the chart on the top right our scenario considers an inflation rate hovering in the range between 3 and 3 5 during this year as a result of two opposite forces a weaker currency and on the other hand subdued gdp growth finally as i mentioned before we though not expect changes in the monetary policy rate this year since the cpi is within the range of the central bank taking into consideration the important uncertainty the central bank has more reasons to accumulate better information before changing the interest rate please move to slide 6 to analyze the evolution of the banking industry over the last 12 months loans in the chilean banking system have grown 10 and increased 3 quarter on quarter the slowdown of the chilean economy hasn t affected significantly loan growth in fact the 3 quarter on quarter growth is the same growth that we saw in the third quarter 19 nevertheless we d say that loan growth will gradually fall due to the below trend growth as i mentioned earlier according to the central bank survey for instance the banking industry has become more restrictive for granted loans and demand has weakened over the last quarter of 2019 the survey indicates that 50 of banks reported more restrictive terms for consumer loans the survey also indicated that there was less dynamism in the demand side in this context 42 of banks saw a reduction in demand for consumer loans as well as an 18 decrease for mortgage loans in terms of results the chilean banking industry posted net income of clp147 billion in the fourth quarter the decrease was mainly due to significantly higher loan loss provisions in line with the events seen during the fourth quarter 19 and to a lesser extent greater operating expenses as i mentioned before we will likely have a challenging year with a below trend growth and a potential deterioration in the labor market in this environment it s reasonable to expect that total loan growth for the industry will reach around 6 in nominal terms this year please turn to slide 8 to begin our discussion on banco de chile we are very proud to present our main achievements in 2019 we ended the year as the leader of the industry in many aspects especially in financial results we were ranked once again first in net income net operating income as well as in net fees we also recorded a very strong year in terms of sme and residential loan origination with a 11 3 and 14 4 year on year rise respectively these results have been achieved through our superior and consistent commercial and risk management strategies that focus to grow with an adequate risk return relation in key market segments as a result of our front end efforts and improvements to give the best service to our clients we were recognized as having the highest net promoter score and best customer service by procalidad a prestigious chilean non profit organization in addition the banker and brand finance honored our brand as the most valuable in the chilean banking industry and we also were recognized as the bank with the best corporate reputation in the last decade by merco as result of our continued concern to take care and developing our employees we were chosen as the best bank to work in chile according to university students survey by merco moreover showing our commitment with the environment during 2019 we issued our first green bond it was the first green bond from a chilean financial institution and it was issued to finance renewable energy for our operations lastly deva awarded us as having the best annual report of the banking sector reflecting our focus on improving our reporting process and offering valuable information to our stakeholders now i would like to pass the call to pablo who will go into more detail about financial results please turn to slide number 9 pablo mejia head of investor relations thank you rodrigo the fourth quarter was challenging as rodrigo mentioned we went from a scenario expecting strong growth in 2020 to subdued gdp with an expected rise in unemployment levels this undoubtedly will impact growth perspectives for the banking industry in 2020 in turn october and november were coupled with high credit costs damaged infrastructure and a drop in confidence levels despite this environment we were able to demonstrate the effectiveness and consistency of our business strategy and the value of our competitive advantages in the fourth quarter 2019 we posted a bottom line of clp147 billion only 3 below the prior quarter and 9 below the same period last year on a full year basis we recorded clp593 billion basically in line with the results in 2018 this is especially noteworthy when we compare results to that our peers as you can see on the bottom part of the slide we clearly outperformed all of the banks in our quarterly and yearly results as well as our roe this leading result is not by chance but it s consistent throughout our history we systematically post more predictable results throughout the economic cycles clearly staying us apart from our peers and generating greater value for our shareholders please turn to slide number 10 the fourth quarter operating revenues increased 5 when compared to the same period last year and 8 when compared to the full year period the quarterly and full year rise was generated by solid customer income expansion that rose 13 in the quarter and 12 for the year while non customer income dropped 18 in the quarter and 7 for the year customer income was driven by a 9 year on year rise in average interest earning assets that sustained net interest income growth for both the quarter and the full year specifically our net interest income excluding inflation revenues grew 7 during the fourth quarter of 2019 and 6 for the full year when compared to the same periods last year these figures were partially offset by the lower overall spreads due to a change in mix as a consequence of greater growth in mortgage and commercial loans together with the negative effect of the lower overnight rate that went from 2 8 on average in 2018 to 1 8 on average in 2019 fees continued to deliver solid results growing 34 in the fourth quarter of 2019 and 27 for the full year when compared to the same periods last year this was due to good dynamism of our transactional revenues principally from the retail products services such as higher usage rates derived from our larger atm network as well as our more intensive use of cards in addition we recorded a strong increment and an insurance brokerage fees associated with the income coming from the joint venture signed with an international insurer and an increase in 10 in gross written premiums we also had solid revenues from mutual fund management in line with the rise in aum the strong results in customer income permitted us to offset lower non customer income revenues owed mainly to higher revenues recognized in the fourth quarter of 2018 as a result of the adoption of debit value adjustments to a lesser degree we also had lower revenues from the position that hedges fx fluctuations and loyalty program fees as well as credit risk allowances for dollar denominated loans which coupled with the cumulative negative effect of flattened yield curves over the last 18 months on results term gapping and alm these drivers are partially offset by higher contribution of our u s structural gap position in both the fourth quarter of 2019 and the full year 2019 this had to do with higher inflation in the fourth quarter of 2019 as compared to year earlier for the full year although inflation has decreased in 2019 the effect of lower nominal rates benefited the funding of the u s structural asset position our focus at the bank has been to promote responsible growth in every segments we serve we firmly believe that this is the main pillar of our proven and successful track record we have advance toward growing our bottom line by selectively expanding in key market segments that provide adequate returns for the risks we take in the next slides we will show you in which segments we have grown and the evolution of our asset quality please turn to slide 11 total loans grew by 7 5 year on year and on a sequential quarterly basis slowed to 1 5 this trend is in line with both the weaker activity and the results showed by the central bank survey which concluded that banks have become stricter in terms of risk and that demand for loans has dropped nevertheless on an annual perspective according to our strategy our retail segment was the principal source of growth loans to individuals rose by 11 4 year on year and smes increased just over 10 during the same period the main drivers for retail loan growth were mortgages and commercial loans to smes mortgages grew 14 5 year on year and also had a similar level in the quarter when annualized we didn t see a drop in the quarter in mortgage loan growth because loans were in the pipeline before the events occurred however we observed a reduction in an about 20 of applications during october november and december versus the running rate smes also performed well posting double digit loan growth of 10 year on year and 1 6 on a sequential basis in fact origination the segment remained strong growing 9 over the last year and at similar levels when compared to the immediate prior quarter it s clear that this was a demanding quarter for the segment and in line with our approach to build solid long term relationships with our customers we assisted those clients which had difficulties during this period by providing them with flexible financing options at special rates to get their businesses back in order on other hand wholesale lending which was accelerating last quarter slowed and grew only 1 7 year on year and on sequential basis grew 1 2 it s important to emphasize that we continually focus on maintaining an adequate relationship of risk and return as well as rational use of our capital because of the current environment we have and because of the current environment we are taking conservative steps to ensure responsible growth in the segments regarding liabilities without a doubt we are the financial institution with the best funding structure in chile which remains as one of the most important competitive advantages we have the highest market share in demand deposits and these represent 38 of total assets in fact customer deposit has accelerated significantly year on year to 18 2 the high level of growth during this quarter is associated to our strong credit risk rating and their superior brand positioning that results in flight to quality in times of higher uncertainty this is proven in the churn of rate where we are clearly the bank with the greatest inflows of deposits in the industry during the fourth quarter of 2019 with 24 market share of the flow of deposits in 2019 we also continued pricing bonds at very good rates including subordinated bonds with spreads that were below average of the banking industry in fact we issued bonds not only in chile but also in norway hong kong japan australia and peru as a result as shown on the chart on the bottom right our cost of funding was once again the lowest in the industry reaching 2 6 on an annual basis please turn to slide 12 this quarter we posted a cost of risk of clp101 billion as you can see on the lower left chart we incurred a net credit deterioration of clp32 billion which was mainly originated in the retail segment as a result of particular circumstances that occurred in october and november nevertheless we posted improvement in december with the result as a result of better payment behavior and more normal development in the collection process also volume growth increased in our loan loss provisions by clp10 billion lastly the lower depreciation of the chilean peso to the u s dollar in the fourth quarter of 2019 when compared to the same period in 2018 had a positive effect on our allowances for loan losses denominated in foreign currencies by about clp2 billion partly offsetting the aforementioned impacts as you can see on the chart on the top right total overdue loans remained similar to the same period last beginning this year although during the crisis the mixed change specifically we saw an increase in about 30 days past due loan book we reached the cost of risk of 1 37 this quarter and 1 21 for the full year which we think are reasonable and levels considering the events occurred during the fourth quarter of 2019 please turn to the next slide number 13 we dedicated important resources to credit risk at banco de chile thanks to that we have built the bank with the best fundamentals as to face the weaker economic cycle in chile over the last decade we have been conservative and created the largest buffer in additional provisions among private banks as you can see on the chart on the left as of december we have clp213 billion of additional provisions substantially higher than our peers which is even more important when consider the implementation of base offering our coverage ratio including additional allowances reached 220 as you can see on the chart on the right this level of coverage is also substantially higher than all of our peers as a consequence of the prudent and consistent risk policies we ve had a stable and low cost of risk in npl ratios when compared to our peers we are confident that our commitment to managing risk prudently and growing responsibly throughout the cycles will permit us to continue outranking our competition not only in credit risk but also in the bottom line please turn to slide 14 on operating expenses total operating expenses increased 7 5 this quarter and the same level year on year personnel expenses were the main driver of this increase for both periods as a result of extraordinary bonuses granted to our employees due to the commitment during the events that occurred in the fourth quarter an increase in severance payments and a rise in salaries driven by the effect of inflation administrative and depreciation expenses decreased clp1 3 billion quarter on quarter and clp31 billion year on year in the fourth quarter of 2019 we incurred non recurring expenses of clp8 billion and fixed asset related expenses as a result of charge offs and repairs undertaken on branches and atms that were affected during the events that took place we also grew it and communication expenses due to software licensing and development of new it projects to strengthen the digital platforms and cybersecurity infrastructure these increases were offset by lower marketing expenses and a reduction in outsourced services and lower expenses related to assets received in lieu of payment it s important to mention that we are focused in improving our efficiency in the medium term from the 45 levels posted in recent past as you can see on the chart on the bottom left in this context i d like to mention some important advances of our strategic priorities that we have made during the last year that not only will support the reduction in the medium term expenses but also improvement in operating revenues and customer experience please turn to slide 15 we are proud of our robust and consistent results that we have had over time however we are aware about several challenges that we faced in different areas such as economic environment social changes more banking and non banking competition and new regulations in order to address this we have defined four main strategic focuses as you can see in this slide the first of these is to implement further steps in our digital transformation process that the bank has carried out in recent years as we mentioned in previous conference calls we have innovated in several fields including the creation of new websites for companies and individuals the launching of successful mobile apps for banking investment products and insurance which contributed to improving the speed and security of transactions made by our customers we have also made advances in business intelligence allowing us the company understand even more of the needs of our customers throughout their life cycle additionally we are working on several improvements in our crm during the last years in order to better provide information to our customers and our account managers thanks to this today we have even a more comprehensive understanding of our customers improving the service even more nevertheless we re ambitious and we want to go further based on our agile work methodology which is centered on simple fast processes with strong interconnections between different areas we are continuously improving our road map that aims to strengthen our value offering specifically we are identifying improvements in our processes with the goal of addressing more efficiently the needs of our customers and developing more embedded products we are very convinced by doing so we are building the foundation for a stronger growth in customer base and importantly to continue being the bank with the best customer experience in the chilean industry the second focus is related to reduce and manage operation risks in an environment of increasing use of technology in the banking sector in particular we have been working on strengthening our cybersecurity not only in reinforcing the perimeters and transactions but also on raising the awareness of our employees we are conscious that the main way of reducing the number of searches by promoting safe conduct of our workforce in this context during 2019 more than 80 of our banco de chile staff participated in training programs on issues related to the information security with an impressive increase in actions that mitigate potential fx furthermore we have continued to implement in several improvements in the service model of our branches a project that began in late 2018 which basically aims to move toward a more intensive use of digital technologies in particular we have ended a successful transformation of more than 100 branches by the incorporation of new self service terminals which promote even more of the use of digital tools by our customers in addition to that we have automated several back office activities allowing a reduction in several manual processes which allow account managers to have more time to service better the needs of our customers for this year we plan to continuing to deepening this initiative to complete the remaining branches another area that has received special attention in our strategy is productivity in order to improve our efficiency we have carried out a series of actions that aim to increase our income without raising our recurring costs some of these areas was been to reduce expenses and clean external advisor activities and new road map for internal processes more efficient supplier options and optimization of physical space among others it s important to mention that we have been implementing these measures gradually in order to maintain a superior quality of service we deliver to our customers we aspire to have a gradual improvement in efficiency ratios in the long term finally our strategy pay special attention to the main basis of our long term sustainability mainly through actions in the environmental social and corporate governance areas we are proud to have issued the first green bond in our history as well as have carried out a series of actions to support our sme clients who were affected by the events in october and november we also have the national entrepreneurial challenge contest in which more than 50 000 micro entrepreneurs participate and we also trained more than 7 000 people in financial education in this context i would like to also highlight that we are the bank with the greatest improvements in esg disclosure in chile according to the index released by bloomberg we are convinced that these focuses together with our strong competitive advantages will allow us to maintain our leadership in the industry please turn to slide number 16 summing up before we our results we believe that our results are positive when compared to our peers and with our own performance in previous years when taking into consideration the economic environment and the impact of the events that occurred in the fourth quarter our higher level of loans coverage ratio and additional provisions provide us with excellent capability to cope with the slowdown in our business activity additionally we are confident that our sound risk policies support a profitable business model and that this is focused on maintaining an adequate risk return relationship finally before moving on to questions i would like to mention some key takeaways in terms of gdp growth we expect the activity to grow around 1 in 2020 which should translate into banking industry loan growth of approximately 6 nominal loan growth will most likely be concentrated in the retail segment while larger companies will probably delay the investment decisions however as we mentioned in the first part of this presentation we expect a recovery in both gdp and loan growth for 2021 in this environment we expect net interest margin to remain at a level of around 4 1 this year due to the below trend growth this year and the potential increase in unemployment we believe cost of risk for us and the industry could increase we cannot rule out this ratio it would reach a level of around 1 3 to 1 4 given our prudent and conservative approach to credit risk we believe risk expenses may increase but below that of our peers since we expect the economy to improve in 2021 a lower cost of risk in 2021 is likely we expect that top line growth should slow but given our emphasis on cost control this should still translate into site improvements in efficiency ratio we expect a level of around 44 for 2020 with inflation hovering around 3 2 this should imply an effective tax rate of around 23 for this year our solid fundamentals superior risk management and sound strategy should permit us to maintain a sustainable roe of around 18 in the medium term in line with our baseline scenario roe should be slightly below this level in 2020 thank you and if you have any questions we d be happy to answer them questions and answers operator thank you the floor is now open for questions and our first question will come from ernesto gabilondo of bank of america please go ahead ernesto gabilondo bank of america analyst hi good morning rodrigo and pablo thanks for the opportunity my first question is related to loan growth and asset quality given a softer economic growth the protests that are likely to resume on march as they were in holidays expected higher unemployment and higher debt in chile and the challenges to reach constitutional agreements considering pinera s approval of 6 and the congress approval of 3 how do you see the downside risk for loan growth and the upside risk for the cost of risk for the year and then my second question is in the line of expenses opex growth was 9 in 2019 so where do you see the growth for this line in this year and finally considering your guidance should we expect mid single digit net earnings growth this year thank you rodrigo aravena chief economist and senior vice president of institutional relations hi thank you very much for the question and this is rodrigo aravena for the first part related to the loan growth before moving to that answer from paola i think that it s very important to understand the trend that we are expecting for the china economy this year we are expecting an economy growth of around 1 for 2020 however it s very important to keep in mind that in the fourth quarter of 2019 the economy contracted by almost 2 what i m trying to say is that we are expectating that economy to move from very weak fourth quarter toward a more positive activity during this year in part because the government announced an important countercyclical plan because the central bank has been maintained at very low level of interest rate and additionally it s very important to mention that the chilean economy has been very so this is a shock particular if you take a look to the latest figure you must take the monthly gdp growth in december was a positive surprise because the economy recovered most part of the previous contraction that we saw between october and november so to answer that even though the weak the below trend activity growth that we expect for this year as a whole i would like to put on the tables that we are expecting a recovery from that very weak activity in the fourth quarter toward a more positive growth in the first quarter so that idea only just to put in context our scenario for the loan growth pablo mejia head of investor relations so in line with the slower gdp and the potential increased unemployment we re expecting obviously a slowdown in the growth levels so as rodrigo mentioned we re expecting somewhere around 1 for gdp for 2020 with inflation hovering around 3 2 and we re estimating that the growth should be around 6 nominal for the industry historically elasticity of loans is about to gdp is about two times and we think that the retail products should be driving the growth for the industry and the wholesale should be slightly below that 6 level should be below that 6 level in terms of banco de chile in line with what i just mentioned we are focusing to continue to grow responsibly and taking care of our risk return relationship and we re aiming or focusing to growing high quality sme customers consumer loans basically the retail segment so we should be growing in line with that 6 but with a special emphasis in the retail segment and always taking care of our spreads and growing responsibly in terms of opex growth we should be growing we re as we mentioned in the presentation we ve been implementing a strategy that continues to focus in improving how we operate the bank and the administration expenses especially and in line with our new service models that should all assist us including the digitalization of the bank and automation of back office processes to continue improving our costs so we re expecting for 2020 a level of growth that should be below inflation for us and in terms of net income we should expect to continue in the medium term a level of around 18 roe and we could consider that we should have low to medium single digit growth ernesto gabilondo bank of america analyst perfect thank you very much operator okay our next question will come from jason mollin of scotiabank please go ahead jason mollin scotiabank analyst yes hi just some continued further questions on the profitability outlook you mentioned most of the line items we re paying attention so two that i d like some further details one is fees you mentioned very strong fee income growth in the fourth quarter on the back of insurance brokerage due to the joint venture and increase in premiums as well as an increase in fees from credit cards and atms as well as mutual funds if you can talk to us a little bit about the drivers there and what we should expect going forward and secondly in the construct of this outlook for 18 roe in the medium term what are you considering for taxes do you think that tax rates will go up given the need to finance expenditures by the government thank you pablo mejia head of investor relations in terms of fees evolution for banco de chile most of our fees are generated by the retail segment so the growth will be determined in that time one of the areas that we saw strong growth in 2019 and that should continue in 2020 is this agreement this joint venture with this insurance company we ll be recognizing important revenues in terms of fees of around above 2019 is something around the levels of clp30 billion clp30 billion to clp40 billion on top of that we ve been having very good growth in written premiums and the insurance business in terms of other business and the subsidiaries the asset management and stock brokerage that will depend a lot on the evolution of the economy on how those will be driven in 2020 and then transactional products we should also think that we should be growing in line slightly higher in terms of customer growth in customers we grow about 6 year on year and we should be at least growing at levels similar to that and also obviously this will like an upside risk would be that the economy improves above our baseline scenario rodrigo aravena chief economist and senior vice president of institutional relations i would like to reinforce one idea of our loan term assumption so basically what we re taking like the key assumptions that the economy will be able to maintain the potential growth rate which is around 3 so basically in our scenario the slowdown will be only temporary which in part was confirmed by the improvement in the activity in december it s very important to consider as well that we are expecting a high year inflation rate for this year in comparison to the previous year which is a positive driver as well for the net income for the bank mainly because the exchange rate today is weaker than before in chile the inflation rate is very sensitive to the change in the effects in the currency so the key assumption here is that the slowdown is mainly temporary and that economy will be able to converge toward a more healthy long term agreeable in the long term pablo mejia head of investor relations i think it s also important to mention in relation to income is the risk will play a very important part in 2020 so in terms of the evolution of the economy and how risk develops it will be important for the bottom line of the bank so the bottom line can grow faster obviously if risk is in lower levels and then in terms of and and finishing off going back on fees for one second we should be expecting double digit growth in terms of fees jason mollin scotiabank analyst and so on the expected tax effective tax rate are you making any assuming any changes daniel galarce head of financial control hi this is daniel galarce we are not expecting nothing different from this year i mean effective tax rate should be in the range of 23 to 24 considering an inflation of around 3 we don t have any piece of information signaling that this should change in the future jason mollin scotiabank analyst thank you very much operator our next question will come from tito labarta of goldman sachs please go ahead tito labarta goldman sachs analyst hi rodrigo and pablo thank you for the call i guess my question is in terms of gdp growth and in terms of potential sensitivities to the upside and downside i mean for the recovery that you expect in 2021 what do you need to see for that to happen or possibly be better and conversely what could make it worse so what are you looking at in terms of to drive the gdp growth just given the political uncertainty and the constitutional vote expected what would you like to see and what could be upside and downside risk to that thank you rodrigo aravena chief economist and senior vice president of institutional relations okay hi this is rodrigo aravena thank you very much for the question basically what we have today in chile in this scenario is combination between supply and demand factors from the supply side as we mentioned in the presentation seen some areas in terms of infrastructure which was equivalent to nearly 1 of the gdp which obviously affects negatively the capacity of growth capacity of production in the economy however the government announced an important plan of construction in this infrastructure so it s very important to pay attention when the government will be able to begin this the construction in critical areas for example in the subway and other areas in terms of the impact on demand as you mentioned there will be very important discussions this year in critical in key areas constitution pensions etc and therefore the evolution of the discussion is very important mainly because the impact in terms of business confidence and investment etc but we don t have enough information today because this type of discussion will be held mainly between april and may of this year so all in all what we expect today is an economic growth of around 1 with a neutral bias we don t have a negative bias in this estimate mainly because we have a positive surprise in the economy in december and because as i mentioned before both fiscal and monetary policies will be supportive for growth this year we also have to pay special attention to the copper price and the chinese economic growth because china represents nearly 50 of total export of chile so the recent negative news from coronavirus etc is also important for the china economy but more important is that we expect to recover for 2021 because we basically we think that all the measures announced by the government and the central bank will be positive for the economy in terms of the breakdown we expect a negative growth for investments this year minus 3 nearly for total consumption we expect an increase of around 1 in terms of export around 2 so but more importantly we think that both part of this negative cycle was in the previous quarter and pablo if you wanted to add tito labarta goldman sachs analyst thanks that was very helpful rodrigo rodrigo aravena chief economist and senior vice president of institutional relations okay thanks operator our next question will come from emilio acevedo please go ahead emilio acevedo santander analyst hello thank you for the call i was just wondering about the excess capital that you can have because of basel iii do you have any particular number in mind and with this excess of capital you can have a potential higher dividend for 2021 thank you daniel galarce head of financial control hi daniel galarce what we know so far are some regulations that have been published by the cmf for comments today we have a drop of regulation for risk weighted assets for operational risks and also financial risks and in addition some rules regarding buffers countercyclical buffer conservation buffer and also the systemic buffer although we believe that probably this regulation is very in line with basel iii guidelines which is very positive of course we are still evaluating the final effect that this will have in our capital adequacy first of all we have some preliminary estimates and in our view the regulation that has been published so far is very in line with our preliminary estimates as long as we have more details and a detailed analysis of all of these regulations probably we ll have a more specific a more specific estimate however and due to this regulation is more focused on the characteristic of the counterparty rather than on accounting methodology we believe that we should be benefit more or less because of this because of this basel iii approach nevertheless as i told you we are still evaluating what s going to be the final effect today probably we have a kind of positive gap with respect to fully loaded limit for instance common equity tier 1 ratio however we believe that this positive gap is going to afford or is going to be the basis for future growth in terms of total loans as long as the economy retakes the economic growth so we are not thinking that we have an excess of capital today and according to that we don t see any extraordinary dividend for 2020 or 2021 we feel comfortable with the levels of capital we have to date we believe that probably the basel iii approach will benefit us as compared to our peers for instance since we have a premium loan portfolio and a premium customer base for instance but however we can t rule out that we re going to use or we re going to utilize this our capital base in order to support future growth of our balance sheet emilio acevedo santander analyst thank you very much operator and our next question will come from yuri fernandes with jp morgan please go ahead yuri fernandes jp morgan analyst hi gentlemen thank you rodrigo i have a question regarding your additional coverage it s pretty high you mentioned in the presentation and my question is if you have like a level like a number that you don t feel comfortable in going lower and what s your plan to use that coverage in the current credit cycle thank you pablo mejia head of investor relations hi yuri well we have a good level of coverage including additional provisions in banco de chile and we ve been generating this additional coverage through the use of additional provisions during the last decade when we realized these additional provisions were for periods of more stressful periods not for any particular customer segment and we don t have we ve never actually released these provisions in the past for an economic cycle but if there was an event that affected us significantly and the banking industry or the banking industry and us that would be a reason to release these provisions we don t have a specific number in terms of coverage but we expect that we should continue hovering around the same levels that we had historically had based on our credit risk model so our credit risk models don t have a target for coverage it s the result of our credit risk models based on overdue loans beginning from day one yuri fernandes jp morgan analyst but pablo if i may follow up like do you plan to use those reserves now like can you use a little bit i got like the message but can we see like some more volatility on the additional provisions pablo mejia head of investor relations and in terms of our baseline scenario our baseline scenarios at chile is relatively are in level but we re expecting a baseline scenario for cost of risk is something slightly above what we had in 2019 between maybe 1 3 1 4 and a more cost of risk percentage of cost of risk and a more negative bias however it s not clear that we will actually reach these levels and at these levels it s more difficult to justify releasing provisions when the banking industry and us haven t been wouldn t be significantly impacted with that level of cost of risk this is more for example in 2009 when there was a crisis in the south of chile in a certain sector the banks had a lot very large effect of this where for example we can use these additional provisions but there is no there is nothing today that would suggest that we could use this and it s not a baseline scenario yuri fernandes jp morgan analyst super clear thank you very much operator and our next question will come from neha agarwala of hsbc please go ahead neha agarwala hsbc analyst hi and thank you for taking my question my first question is on our loan growth i understand that you expect the economy to grow around 5 6 but is it fair to say that you are taking a more cautious stand on loan growth because wholesale will remain weak and i believe the competition in retail will be higher because everybody will be focusing on retail and you would like to focus more on the risk reward perspective so not compromising on margins i believe so would that translate into slightly lower growth than the system and the second question is on expenses i believe you mentioned that you expect to grow expenses in line or slightly below inflation do you expect any drawn recurring expenses for 2020 could you elaborate on how many branches were impacted from the riots and if everything was insured could we see some impact in this year thank you so much pablo mejia head of investor relations hi neha in terms of our loan growth expectations like rodrigo mentioned we re expecting 2020 to have a gdp growth of around 1 and generally the elasticity of loans to gdp is 2 times so that include inflation we re expecting somewhere close to 6 for loan growth where we re focusing more in the retail segment we have a very good retail segment of customers that is focusing upper income individuals and we have what we can say the best sme portfolio in chile so we re expecting to continuing leveraging this customer base to continue growing in 2020 which is something similar that we ve done in prior years that s where we ve seen stronger growth in our retail segment thanks to our customer base which also provides us with attractive returns and generally lower cost of risk because of the segments that they are in in terms of expenses could you repeat the question neha agarwala hsbc analyst how many branches were affected last year and is everything is insured do you expect any non recurring expenses in 2020 pablo mejia head of investor relations so last year we had nine branches which were closed because of the events but all of these branches were insured so we re not expecting any significant impact in terms of this material impact in terms of these events the rest of the branch network there is minor damage but it wasn t something significant neha agarwala hsbc analyst thank you so much pablo mejia head of investor relations you re welcome operator and our next question will come from sebastian gallego of credicorp capital please go ahead sebastian gallego credicorp capital analyst hi good morning everyone thanks for the call i have couple of questions the first one if you can if you could elaborate a bit more on the nims and rates for this year you mentioned that you expect stability around 4 1 can you talk about the sources that may drive this stability and then the second question is regarding cost of risk and i know you show on the presentation on slide 12 a bit of the evolution of overdue loans i know it s a bit too early but could you maybe share what are you seeing so far this year in 2020 and how that trend do you expect to evolve our 2020 and maybe one last question you mentioned during the call that probably the contribution from chubb this year will be more like clp30 billion to clp40 billion i understand previous guidance was around clp60 billion for this year can you elaborate if that change or if maybe i understood wrong thank you pablo mejia head of investor relations hi sebastian in terms of your first question there is a variety of facts that affect net interest margin for 2020 for us in the banking industry like we mentioned we re expecting somewhere around the level of 4 1 for net interest margin and so i would say there is three effects that would be more negative and there is a few positive effects so you have the lower overnight rates we ve been experiencing which impact pricing initially the drop of the rates are positive in repricing of our liabilities now we re repricing at lower levels but there s also higher risk so that also helps and adjust in offsetting this impact the second thing that is important is that take into consideration in terms of nim is that the long term rates in 2019 were very low before the events that occurred and this triggered customers to refinance their mortgage loans so this had a this will have a negative effect on our net interest margin and the third negative effect would be the new regulation that was put in place in january of this year which obligates bank to offer customers to choose to automatically pay their overdraft lines with funds in their current account so we have about 2 of loans in overdraft lines obviously not all of that would disappear but a portion of that would disappear in terms of the loan and also in terms of deposits because what s being used as the deposits in the current accounts to repay these loans so this new regulation will have an impact as well in terms of our net interest margin nevertheless it s important to take into consideration that in terms of our baseline scenario we re looking to continue to grow our retail book we think that in this year we will grow at around 6 for loans and we re focused to grow at that same around that same level with a focus geared toward sme loans and consumer loans so better mix should help us in terms of the net interest margins as well as we are expecting higher inflation for 2020 so this also has a benefit in net interest margin as well as a steeper yield curve so these things these what i mentioned should help maintain our levels of net interest margins around 4 1 as we mentioned in terms of your second question cost of risk and that slide i think it was slide number 12 we have the evolution of cost of risk i think one of the very important things to mention there so you can see how the overdue loan book in one to 29 days has decreased significantly thanks to a more active corrections in banco de chile we think that the levels that we ve seen the improvements that we have seen in the last months if this continues can be positive for 2020 and that can change our bottom line obviously because every 10 basis points of cost of risk is about clp30 billion before tax in a positive or a negative impact in 2020 it s difficult to say the evolution of how the customer behavior will be especially in these two months of the year which tend to be more cyclical in terms of payment behavior because people are on vacation so it s a difficult period of time in order to analyze the evolution of cost of risk but what we saw in december was quite positive where we were able to reduce significantly the early overdue loan book sebastian gallego credicorp capital analyst perfect and regarding chubb pablo mejia head of investor relations in terms of chubb so chubb is an agreement that we have entered into this agreement a couple of years ago and we recognized the revenues beginning july 2019 more or less we recognize about based on the model it s about clp5 billion per month in chubb which basically means for 2020 versus 2019 which was closer to clp3 5 billion so we should have about clp30 billion more in recognitions in chubb fees in 2020 than in 2019 sebastian gallego credicorp capital analyst okay alright thank you very much very clear operator this concludes the question and answer section at this time i would like to turn the floor back to banco de chile for any closing remarks please go ahead rodrigo aravena chief economist and senior vice president of institutional relations thanks and thanks for your

dollar rises broadly in early us session after strong adp employment data but it s outshone by both australian dollar and sterling the aussie is apparently helped by return of risk appetite as well as an rba s governor that s comfortable with current monetary policy on the other hand swiss franc and euro are the weakest ones dragged down by selling against sterling yen is not far away as the third weakest technically 0 6777 minor resistance in aud usd is a level to watch break will suggests that the pair has successfully defended 0 6670 low and bring stronger rebound back towards 0 6849 resistance 121 60 minor resistance in eur jpy is another level to watch as break will align its outlook with usd jpy and bring retest of 122 87 high nevertheless upside of eur jpy could be capped by

regarding general economic development have brightened significantly up from 19 to 7 just above long term average of 9 rba to continue to look at both sides of the rate cut equation in an address to the national press club today rba governor philip lowe said the rate hold yesterday reflects a judgement about the benefits from a further reduction in interest rates against some of the costs and risks associated with very low interest rates he added a further cut would help households balance sheet adjustment and bring forward the day that consumption strengthens it would also have a further effect on the exchange rate which would boost demand for our exports and therefore support jobs growth however there were global concerns on the resource allocation and confidence on very low interest rates it could also encourage more borrowing for house purchases and increase risk of problems down the track but the board will continue to look at both sides of the equation if the unemployment rate were to be trending in the wrong direction and there was no further progress being made towards the inflation target the balance of arguments would change there would be a strong case for further monetary easing in those circumstances new zealand unemployment rate dropped to 4 new zealand unemployment rate dropped to 4 0 in q4 down from 4 1 better than expectation of 4 2 however participation

support in eur usd with today s decline break there will resume the whole decline from 1 1239 also that would add to the case that corrective rebound from 1 0879 has completed at 1 1239 in this case deeper decline would be seen back to retest 1 0879 low on the upside break of 1 1095 will turn bias to the upside for 1 1172 resistance instead in the bigger picture rebound from 1 0879 is seen as a corrective move at this point in case of another rise upside should be limited by 38 2 retracement of 1 2555 to 1 0879 at 1 1519 and down trend from 1 2555 2018 high would resume at a later stage however sustained break of 1 1519 will dampen this bearish view and bring stronger rise to 61 8 retracement at 1 1915 next economic indicators update
president trump s state of the union speech once again was chock full of stretched facts and dubious figures many of these claims have been fact checked repeatedly yet the president persists in using them here in the order in which he made them are 31 statements by the president as is our practice with live events we do not award pinocchio ratings which are reserved for complete columns i am thrilled to report to you tonight that our economy is the best it has ever been the president can certainly brag about the state of the economy but he runs into trouble when he repeatedly makes a play for the history books our database of trump claims shows he has made a variation of this claim some 260 times there are several metrics one could look at but the current economy falls short according to experts we consulted the unemployment rate reached a low of 3 5 percent under trump but it was as low as 2 5 percent in 1953 trump has never achieved an annual growth rate above 3 percent but in 1997 1998 and 1999 the gross domestic product grew 4 5 percent 4 5 percent and 4 7 percent respectively but even that period paled against the 1950s and 1960s growth between 1962 and 1966 ranged from 4 4 percent to 6 6 percent in 1950 and 1951 it was 8 7 percent and 8 percent respectively advertisement from the instant i took office i moved rapidly to revive the u s economy enacting historic and record setting tax cuts trump constantly claims he passed the biggest tax cut in u s history but that s four pinocchios false the best way to compare tax cuts or spending plans over time is to measure them as a percentage of the national economy the trump tax cut according to treasury department data is nearly 0 9 percent of gdp compared with 2 89 percent of gdp for ronald reagan s 1981 tax cut the actual largest tax cut when measured as a share of the u s economy trump s tax cut is the eighth largest in the past century since my election we have created 7 million new jobs trump often inflates the number of jobs created under his presidency by counting from election day rather than when he took the oath of office there have been almost 6 7 million jobs created since february 2017 according to the bureau of labor statistics advertisement job creation under president barack obama s last three years 227 000 a month still exceeds the monthly average of 191 000 a month under trump incredibly the average unemployment rate under my administration is lower than any administration in the history of our country this is worth fact checking because the average over three years is hardly comparable to a four or eight year average for other presidents for example the unemployment rate average was lower in lyndon b johnson s second term than it has been under trump but when johnson s first term is factored in trump gains the edge the unemployment rate for disabled americans has reached an all time low the bureau of labor statistics has reported this rate since 2008 so it s a big stretch to call it an all time low the rate was 7 percent in december advertisement under my administration 7 million americans have come off of food stamps about 6 million people not 7 million have stopped receiving food stamps since february 2017 according to the latest data an earlier version of this article offered an out of date number but experts say the improvement in the economy may not be the only reason for the decline several states have rolled back recession era waivers that allowed some adults to keep their benefits for longer periods of time without employment reports have also suggested immigrant families with citizen children have dropped out of the program fearing the administration s immigration policies moreover the number of people collecting benefits has been declining since fiscal year 2014 in eight years under the last administration over 300 000 working age people dropped out of the workforce in just three years of my administration 3 5 million people working age people have joined the workforce advertisement trump never seems to remember or prefers to forget that obama took office during the worst economic crisis since the great depression when 800 000 jobs a month were being shed the labor force participation rate fell sharply as millions of jobs were eliminated and people had trouble finding work in january 2009 the labor force participation rate was 65 7 percent and it fell to 62 8 percent by the time obama left office it has since inched up a bit to 63 2 percent under trump but it is still not back to pre recession levels of 66 percent as for trump s math here we re not able to replicate it over the course of obama s two terms labor force participation times the working age population gets you a gain of about 5 5 million under obama and nearly 5 million under trump update on feb 6 we published a full fact check of this statistic this is a blue collar boom advertisement in the past year things have gotten grimmer for many blue collar workers the manufacturing sector is in a technical recession and only 9 000 manufacturing jobs have been gained since june compared with the 460 000 in the first 2½ years of trump s presidency job growth has slowed in many blue collar sectors such as transportation construction and mining since my election the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased by 47 percent three times faster than the increase for the top 1 percent trump is just spinning here net worth for the bottom half has gone up but it was from such a low base that it s pretty silly to call it a boom people in the bottom half have essentially no wealth just 1 6 percent of the nation s wealth as debts cancel out whatever assets they might have the top 5 percent hold more than 70 percent of all net worth in the united states advertisement everybody said that criminal justice reform couldn t be done but i got it done and the people in this room got it done trump signed the first step act in 2018 one of the biggest pieces of the first step act a provision that reduced sentences for crack cocaine offenses was an extension of obama s efforts in 2010 we gave three pinocchios to trump for claiming that he accomplished what obama could not in his speech tonight trump didn t mention obama when discussing the criminal justice law all of those millions of people with 401 k s and pensions are doing far better than they have ever done before with increases of 60 70 80 90 and even 100 percent trump often boasts that the value of 401 k retirement accounts has skyrocketed during his presidency even though there s no evidence of such huge gains and even though the census bureau reports only 32 percent of americans are saving for retirement with such plans an analysis by fidelity investments showed the average 401 k balance increased less than 1 percent when comparing the first quarters of 2018 and 2019 advertisement thanks to our bold regulatory reduction campaign the united states has become the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world by far the notion that a revolution in energy began under the trump administration is wrong the united states has led the world in natural gas production since 2009 crude oil production has been increasing rapidly since 2010 the united states was the top producer in 2013 in september 2018 the united states once again passed both russia and saudi arabia to become the largest global crude oil producer but the energy revolution he takes credit for began under obama with the tremendous progress we have made over the past three years america is now energy independent this is false the united states continues to import energy in 2018 the united states imported about 9 94 million barrels per day mmb d of petroleum from nearly 90 countries according to an energy information agency report with 43 percent coming from canada and 16 percent from persian gulf countries advertisement after losing 60 000 factories under the previous two administrations america has now gained 12 000 new factories under my administration with thousands upon thousands of plants and factories being planned or built factories conjures up images of smokestacks and production lines but the data set trump cited is not really about factories trump is using a bureau of labor statistics database set known as the quarterly census of employment and wages the data show that united states gained nearly 12 000 additional manufacturing establishments between the first quarter of 2017 through the second quarter of 2019 there was also a gain of 10 000 in obama s second term but more than 80 percent of these manufacturing establishments employ five or fewer people if those sound like pretty small factories that s because many are not factories the bls counts any establishment engaged in the mechanical physical or chemical transformation of materials substances or components into new products so that also includes businesses that transform materials or substances into new products by hand or in the worker s home and those engaged in selling to the general public products made on the same premises from which they are sold such as bakeries candy stores and custom tailors following nafta s adoption our nation lost one in four manufacturing jobs this is misleading as trump attributes all manufacturing lost to the north american free trade agreement nafta when many other factors were responsible such as automation and china s entry into the world trade organization many politicians came and went pledging to change or replace nafta only to do so and then absolutely nothing happened but unlike so many who came before me i keep my promises we did our job six days ago i replaced nafta and signed the brand new united states mexico canada agreement usmca into law the usmca is a modest reworking of nafta launched in 1994 with about 85 to 90 percent the same as the deal trump repeatedly trashed as terrible the u s international trade commission which is tasked with evaluating the impact of trade agreements calculated the new deal would have a relatively minor impact the usmca would raise u s real gross domestic product by 68 2 billion 0 35 percent and u s employment by 176 000 jobs 0 12 percent the report actually said usmca will cause growth to decline by 0 12 percent but then made some assumptions about investment and an end of policy uncertainty to achieve positive growth some analysts found those assumptions dubious the usmca will create nearly 100 000 new high paying american auto jobs this is a dubious figure we often warn readers to be wary of job creation claims the usitc report said the agreement would create about 28 000 jobs in the auto sector the office of the u s trade representative estimated that the deal would support 76 000 jobs in the auto sector 22 800 assembly jobs and then additional auto supply jobs to safeguard american liberty we have invested a record breaking 2 2 trillion in the united states military trump is just talking about three years of defense funding added up together on an inflation adjusted basis not one year of trump s defense budgets has exceeded the high point in 2010 under obama i have raised contributions from the other nato members by more than 400 billion and the number of allies meeting their minimum obligations has more than doubled trump gives himself too much credit since 2006 each nato member has had a guideline of spending at least 2 percent of gross domestic product on defense spending defense expenditures for nato countries other than the united states have been going up in a consistent slope since 2014 that s when nato decided to boost spending in response to russia s seizure of ukraine s crimea region nato estimates that its european members and canada will add 130 billion in cumulative defense spending through 2020 in 2015 dollars as an increase over 2016 spending nato also estimates the cumulative figure will rise to 400 billion through 2024 before i took office health insurance premiums had more than doubled in just five years i moved quickly to provide affordable alternatives our new plans are up to 60 percent less expensive trump often makes this claim but we have not been able to verify the claim of a 60 percent reduction in costs the new short term health plans authorized by the trump administration are less expensive for a reason they offer skimpier coverage and thus provide less protection as for the doubling in health insurance premiums that claim is based on a white house report that made some questionable methodological choices we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions in an ongoing court case the trump administration is supporting a total repeal of the affordable care act including its guarantee that patients can t be denied coverage for preexisting conditions republicans in congress tried for years to repeal the whole law trump has not presented a plan to cover the gaps in case the court challenge is successful moreover he has promoted short term plans which he touted in his speech that are not required to cover preexisting conditions through our pledge to american workers over 400 companies will also provide new jobs and education opportunities to almost 15 million americans trump usually describes this as jobs already created but apparently his language was tamed by a teleprompter these are not new jobs but training opportunities moreover the numbers reflect pledges over a five year period not something already achieved many companies signed up by offering training programs that already existed i was pleased to announce last year that for the first time in 51 years the cost of prescription drugs actually went down the consumer price index for prescription drugs in 2018 fell for the first time in 46 years but that s only when measuring calendar years from january to december which is somewhat arbitrary the president s record shrinks to 5½ years when measuring non calendar years the cpi had last declined in the 12 month period ended july 2013 experts say the cpi for prescription drugs fails to account for rebates which can be substantial and may be giving a skewed picture because of recent market shifts toward generics and electronic payments by third parties studies we found show drug prices have not declined especially when it comes to branded drugs as we speak a long tall and very powerful wall is being built we have now completed over 100 miles and have over 500 miles fully completed in a very short period of time early next year we will have substantially more than 500 miles completed trump doubled down on a promise for 500 miles of new border fencing by early next year which would require the current pace of construction to more than double department of homeland security officials have been trying to lower expectations lately saying they will have that much built or under construction he also exaggerates the barrier s sturdiness the washington post has reported that the steel and concrete bollard fence can be cut through with a souped up power saw and that a series of large floodgates must be left open for months every summer during monsoon season in the desert with unyielding commitment we are curbing the opioid epidemic drug overdose deaths declined for the first time in nearly 30 years overall drug overdose deaths fell in 2018 for the first time in 28 years according to data from the centers for disease control and prevention but fentanyl overdose deaths increased 10 percent last year our brave ice officers arrested more than 120 000 criminal aliens charged with nearly 10 000 burglaries 5 000 sexual assaults 45 000 violent assaults and 2 000 murders many of the criminal aliens trump is describing are immigrants who were convicted of immigration or nonviolent offenses he quickly switched from the total for ice arrests 120 000 to a different number that includes all the different charges it s a misleading apples and oranges comparison because one individual may face multiple charges and not all arrests result in convictions before i came into office if you showed up illegally on our southern border and were arrested you were simply released and allowed into our country never to be seen again my administration has ended catch and release if you come illegally you will now be promptly removed from our country very importantly we entered into historic cooperation agreements with the governments of mexico honduras el salvador and guatemala as a result of our unprecedented efforts illegal crossings are down 75 percent since may dropping eight straight months in a row and as the wall rapidly goes up drug seizures rise and border crossings are going down the trump administration has tried but has not ended catch and release the policy of releasing asylum seekers and refugees many of them women and children into the country while they await a hearing in the clogged u s immigration court system immigrants continue to be released southwest border apprehensions dropped 75 percent when measuring from may to december but when looking at all of trump s presidency the gains are almost negligible 42 359 apprehensions in january 2017 and 40 620 in december 2019 in the senate we have confirmed a record number of 187 new federal judges it s not a record trump has a long way to go to have appointed the most federal judges reagan has the record with 383 followed by bill clinton with 378 and then obama with 329 through jan 18 187 judges nominated by trump have been confirmed by the senate the trump campaign notes that trump ranks second in terms of judges confirmed at this point in his presidency after jimmy carter and first in appeals court judges forty million american families have an average 2 200 extra thanks to our child tax credit this is an example of trump using correct numbers but he gives too much credit to himself and his republican colleagues the child tax credit has existed since 1997 and it has been expanded since then including in the recent tax law in 2016 under obama 35 million american families took the tax credit with an average benefit of over 1 500 a year according to the treasury department so there s only been a modest increase in part because of inflation three years ago the barbarians of isis held over 20 000 square miles of territory in iraq and syria today the isis territorial caliphate has been 100 percent destroyed and the founder and leader of isis the bloodthirsty killer known as al baghdadi is dead the u s military warned in a report issued the day trump spoke that the islamic state remained a dangerous threat and that the killing of abu bakr al baghdadi did not degrade the group s capabilities uscentcom told the dod oig that following the death of isis leader abu bakr al baghdadi the group s capabilities in syria remained the same the report said uscentcom said that isis remained cohesive with an intact command and control structure urban clandestine networks and an insurgent presence in much of rural syria qasem soleimani directed the december assault and went on to assault u s forces in iraq and was actively planning new attacks other than trump s assertion there is no publicly available evidence that iranian maj gen qasem

operations generated adjusted ebitda of 85 million compared to 652 million in the prior year and european operations delivered adjusted ebitda of 64 million compared to 86 million in the prior year for the fourth quarter of 2019 norbord recorded adjusted ebitda of 27 million versus 33 million in the third quarter of 2019 and 70 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 the quarter over quarter decline was primarily due to lower shipment volumes attributed to higher downtime partially offset by modestly higher north american osb prices the year over year decline was primarily due to lower north american osb prices as well as lower shipment volumes 2019 was a challenging year for norbord said peter wijnbergen norbord s president and ceo our financial results were disappointing relative to our record performance in 2018 as the slowdown in us housing starts through most of 2019 decreased north american osb demand and a slowing of german industrial production put downward pressure on european panel prices in the face of these challenges we focused on reducing both costs and production by indefinitely curtailing operations at our 100 mile house british columbia mill and line 1 at our cordele georgia mill despite the tough markets norbord s mills performed well in north america we consolidated downtime across our mill portfolio which allowed us to more efficiently allocate production volumes this resulted in record production at two mills and lower north american unit manufacturing costs in europe we had record production at both our osb mills including at our expanded inverness scotland mill which continues to ramp production to meet growing demand we reinvested more than 140 million in our mills and returned 130 million in cash to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share buybacks while our fourth quarter results reflected the continued weakness in north american housing markets osb prices have started to recover in recent weeks further the outlook for new home construction in 2020 is encouraging with december s seasonally adjusted annualized pace of permits for us housing starts up nearly 6 year over year to 1 42 million we expect a healthy pick up in osb demand as the spring building season approaches in europe our panel business is set for another solid year as osb demand in our key markets is supported by the ongoing trend of substitution against plywood and our reinvested inverness scotland mill continues to ramp up with a solid balance sheet and a diversification strategy that is growing non traditional end uses

below historical averages throughout 2019 benchmark osb prices decreased steadily in the first half of the year due to lower demand from the continued pullback in us homebuilding activity which started in the second half of 2018 as affordability concerns that had negatively affected us housing demand in recent quarters began to moderate driven by lower mortgage rates and real wage growth benchmark osb prices improved modestly in the fourth quarter of 2019 the north central benchmark osb price ranged from a low of 180 per msf 7 16 inch basis in april to a high of 230 per msf in

industrial production while housing starts were in line with the previous year performance norbord s occupational safety and health administration osha recordable injury rate was 1 31 in 2019 and two mills completed recordable injury free years in north america full year shipment volumes decreased 5 driven primarily by the production curtailments taken to match the company s supply with customer demand fourth quarter shipments were 19 lower than the prior quarter and 17 lower than the same quarter last year primarily due to the curtailments taken during the fourth quarter as well as fewer fiscal days in the current quarter annual production records were achieved at two of the company s north american osb mills for the full year norbord s operating osb mills produced at 85 of available capacity compared to 95 in 2018 excluding the curtailed chambord quebec mill the decrease in capacity utilization was driven by the december 31 2018 restatement of annual production capacities at a number of mills as well as the downtime and indefinite curtailments taken during the year norbord s 2019 north american osb cash production costs per unit excluding mill profit share decreased 1 versus the prior year due to improved productivity lower resin prices and the foreign exchange translation impact of a weaker canadian dollar partially offset by higher raw material usages and increased curtailments european shipment volume was slightly higher in 2019 due to changes in product mix annual production records were achieved at the company s two european osb mills all of norbord s panel mills ran on full production schedules excluding maintenance and holiday shutdowns and produced at 88 of stated capacity in both 2019 and 2018 norbord expects to ship more osb in 2020 from the continued ramp up of the reinvested inverness mill as well as the completion of the second wood room and dryer for 2019 the company generated modest margin improvement program mip gains as improved

require more product norbord s 2020 capital expenditure budget is approximately 100 million for maintenance of business projects and projects focused on reducing manufacturing costs across the mills as well as a portion of the chambord mill rebuild and the inverness expansion project it also includes investments to support the company s strategy to increase the production of specialty products for industrial applications and exports operating working capital increased by 32 million during the year to 120 million at year end primarily due to lower accounts payable and accrued liabilities higher inventory was offset by lower accounts receivable the lower accounts payable and accrued liabilities were primarily attributed to lower mill profit share and bonus accruals due to lower earnings as well as lower accrued capital expenditures higher inventory was primarily a result of higher finished goods inventory levels due to the timing of mill curtailments lower accounts receivable was primarily attributed to lower north american pricing and shipment volumes working capital continues to be managed at minimal levels across the company at year end the company had unutilized liquidity of 272 million comprising 20 million in cash and cash equivalents 237 million in revolving bank lines and 15 million in available drawings under its accounts receivable

s 2019 management s discussion and analysis dated february 4 2020 for a quantitative reconciliation of adjusted ebitda and adjusted earnings to earnings the most directly comparable ifrs measure february 5 2020 to our shareholders fiscal 2019 was a challenging year for norbord and for the north american wood products industry more generally as a slow us housing market created headwinds for our industry we worked diligently as a company to confront these issues and undertook a number of initiatives to adjust our operations to the current realities in particular we took significant downtime across our mills and made the difficult but necessary decisions to indefinitely curtail production at two of our north american mills we generated 138 million of adjusted ebitda in 2019 well down from our record result in 2018 an extraordinary year in which we generated the highest adjusted ebitda in norbord s history we were challenged by market conditions that resulted in persistently weak osb prices throughout 2019 in response we consolidated downtime across our operating north american mills which allowed us to more efficiently allocate production volumes resulting in record production at two mills and lower north american unit manufacturing costs this reflects our team s fundamental focus on continuous improvement and operational discipline and our ongoing commitment to cost management we also continued our balanced approach to creating shareholder value we saw a compelling opportunity to buy back 44 million of our shares at prices we view to be well below intrinsic value we also used our variable dividend policy in the way it is intended adjusting it to the current business conditions while still returning 86 million of cash to shareholders on the strength of our prudent approach to capital allocation we ended the year with a solid balance sheet giving us the continued flexibility to evaluate and pursue value enhancement opportunities managing through challenging conditions despite favourable underlying indicators us homebuilding demand was slow to translate into construction activity in the second half of 2018 and through most of 2019 this trend did not begin to improve until the end of 2019 as a buildup of unsold housing inventory was eventually absorbed mortgage rates continued to ease and builders adjusted their product offerings to suit growing demand for more affordable entry level homes in response to the backdrop of softer osb demand through most of the year we took deliberate action to adjust our production indefinitely curtailing our 100 mile house british columbia mill and line 1 of our mill in cordele georgia combined these curtailments reduced our available north american capacity by nearly 12 aligning our production to customer demand these were necessary but difficult decisions that impacted our experienced hard working team of employees at both mills i would like to once again thank them for their efforts and commitment our north american specialty products sales volumes were mixed in 2019 while our export sales were impacted by global trade uncertainty our industrial sales increased we remain focused on fulfilling the real opportunities we see for industrial products growth the investments we have made in the finishing ends at many of our mills have given us new product capabilities allowing us to work with customers on new applications such as the use of osb for the core of products like countertops and other overlay applications we will continue to adapt our production capabilities to expand the overall osb market in europe slower industrial production in germany and the continued uncertainty from brexit caused prices to decline from recent peaks toward historic averages as a result our ebitda decreased but remained above the longer term average and 2019 still represented the third best year ever for our european business while prices will fluctuate and influence our margins overall european osb demand continues to grow supported by the ongoing trend of osb substitution for plywood our expanded inverness scotland mill is an important strategic asset positioning us to benefit from the steady increase expected in european osb demand as the ramp up at inverness continues we expect the mill s productivity and cost performance to further improve safety is an overarching priority for norbord and 2019 was a source of both disappointment and optimism our osha recordable injury rate increased to 1 31 though fortunately none of the injuries were serious as part of our commitment to achieving world class safety performance last year we launched stronger together a new company wide safety initiative aimed at reinforcing the importance of safety to both our employees and our company performance we are encouraged by the level of employee engagement we have seen to date and are confident this commitment will support our efforts toward continuous safety improvement priorities for 2020 our focus in 2020 is on seizing the opportunities of an improving osb market in north america and regaining momentum seasonally adjusted annual us housing permits were 1 42 million in december up 6 year over year and we are encouraged by the demand we are seeing from our customers in the first weeks of the year additionally consensus forecasts from us housing economists point to 3 year over year growth in starts and industry experts expect north american osb markets to tighten in 2020 as demand increases and the 2019 capacity shutdowns are fully realized we are undertaking a number of initiatives across our mill portfolio to support operational productivity we have consolidated the downtime and curtailments we took in 2019 and will focus on running our mills even more efficiently consistent with this focus we are implementing projects to reduce manufacturing costs and making investments to support our strategy to increase production of specialty products for industrial applications and exports we will continue to allocate our capital with discipline we have set a 2020 capital budget of 100 million which is sufficient to support our product growth objectives and our focus on operating efficiently and safely but which is about half of our annual investment over the past three years a portion of our 2020 budget includes further work on the second phase investment at our inverness mill as well as additional capital at our chambord quebec mill where we continue to prepare for an eventual restart though no decision has yet been made about timing we also remain committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders and our variable dividend policy gives us the flexibility to balance capital allocation decisions with the inherent cyclicality in our business similarly we will continue to carefully examine our production capacity we have the ability to bring back indefinitely curtailed capacity when market conditions warrant but these decisions will continue to be guided by market analysis and customer demand in 2020 we will also provide greater disclosure of our esg environmental social and governance performance we have always focused on our environmental performance as a positive attribute for our business we believe we have a good story to tell on the esg front as wood is a renewable resource and wood products like osb actually sequester carbon in fact we estimate the net impact of the osb production from our operations offsets the annual emissions from approximately 900 000 vehicles while 2019 was a difficult year we managed our operations and balance sheet in a prudent manner that we believe positions our company well for the coming year and beyond we are confident that a strengthening osb market will translate into better financial performance in 2020 and as always we thank our shareholders for their investment in norbord in closing i would like to recognize nigel

washington president donald trump s state of the union speech once again was chock full of stretched facts and dubious figures many of these claims have been fact checked repeatedly yet the president persists in using them here in the order in which he made them are 31 statements by the president as is our practice with live events we do not award pinocchio ratings which are reserved for complete columns i am thrilled to report to you tonight that our economy is the best it has ever been the president can certainly brag about the state of the economy but he runs into trouble when he repeatedly makes a play for the history books our database of trump claims shows he has made a variation of this claim some 260 times there are several metrics one could look at but the current economy falls short according to experts we consulted the unemployment rate reached a low of 3 5 under trump but it was as low as 2 5 in 1953 trump has never achieved an annual growth rate above 3 but in 1997 1998 and 1999 the gross domestic product grew 4 5 4 5 and 4 7 respectively but even that period paled against the 1950s and 1960s growth between 1962 and 1966 ranged from 4 4 to 6 6 in 1950 and 1951 it was 8 7 and 8 respectively from the instant i took office i moved rapidly to revive the u s economy enacting historic and record setting tax cuts trump constantly claims he passed the biggest tax cut in u s history but that s false the best way to compare tax cuts or spending plans over time is to measure them as a percentage of the national economy trump tax cut according to treasury dept data is nearly 0 9 of gdp compared to 2 89 of gdp for ronald reagan s 1981 tax cut the actual largest tax cut when measured as a share of the u s economy his tax cut is the 8th largest in the past century since my election we have created 7 million new jobs trump often inflates the number of jobs created under his presidency by counting from election day rather than when he took the oath of office there have been almost 6 7 million jobs created since february 2017 according to the bureau of labor statistics advertising job creation under obama s last three years 227 000 a month still exceeds the monthly average of 191 000 a month under trump incredibly the average unemployment rate under my administration is lower than any administration in the history of our country this is ingenious and worth fact checking because the average over three years is hardly comparable to a four year or eight year average for other presidents for example the unemployment rate average was lower in lyndon johnson s second term than it has been under trump but when johnson s first term is factored in trump gains the edge the unemployment rate for disabled americans has reached an all time low the bureau of labor statistics has reported this rate since 2008 so it s a big stretch to call it an all time low the rate was 7 in december advertising under my administration 7 million americans have come off of food stamps about 4 2 million people not 7 million have stopped receiving food stamps since february 2017 according to the latest data but experts say the improvement in the economy may not be the only reason for the decline several states have rolled back recession era waivers that allowed some adults to keep their benefits for longer periods of time without employment reports have also suggested immigrant families with citizen children have dropped out of the program fearing the administration s immigration policies moreover the number of people collecting benefits has been declining since fiscal 2014 in 8 years under the last administration over 300 000 working age people dropped out of the workforce in just 3 years of my administration 3 5 million working age people have joined the workforce trump never seems to remember or prefers to forget that barack obama took office during the world economic crisis since the great depression when 800 000 jobs a month were being shed the labor force participation rate fell sharply as people had trouble finding work as millions of jobs were eliminated in january 2009 the labor force participation rate was 65 7 and it fell to 62 8 by the time obama left office it has since inched up a bit to 63 2 under trump but it is still not back to pre recession levels of 66 as for trump s math here we re not able to replicate it over the course of obama s two terms labor force participation times the working age population gets you a gain of about 5 5 million under obama and nearly 5 million under trump this is a blue collar boom in the past year things have gotten grimmer for many blue collar workers the manufacturing sector is in a technical recession and only 9 000 manufacturing jobs have been gained since june compared to the 460 000 in the first 2 1 2 years of trump s presidency job growth has slowed in many blue collar sectors such as transportation construction and mining advertising since my election the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased by 47 3 times faster than the increase for the top 1 trump is just spinning here net worth for the bottom half has gone up but it was from such a low base that it s pretty silly to call it a boom people in the bottom half have essentially no wealth just 1 6 of the nation s wealth as debts cancel out whatever assets they might have the top 5 hold more than 70 of all net worth in the united states everybody said that criminal justice reform couldn t be done but i got it done and the people in this room got it done trump signed the first step act in 2018 one of the biggest pieces of the first step act a provision that reduced sentences for crack cocaine offenses was an extension of obama s efforts in 2010 we gave three pinocchios to trump for claiming that he accomplished what obama could not in his speech tuesday night trump didn t mention obama when discussing the criminal justice law all of those millions of people with 401 k s and pensions are doing far better than they have ever done before with increases of 60 70 80 90 and even 100 advertising trump often boasts that the value of 401 k retirement accounts has skyrocketed during his presidency even though there s no evidence of such huge gains and even though the census bureau reports only 32 of americans are saving for retirement with such plans an analysis by fidelity investments showed the average 401 k balance increased less than 1 when comparing the first quarters of 2018 and 2019 thanks to our bold regulatory reduction campaign the united states has become the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world by far the notion that a revolution in energy began under the trump administration is wrong the united states has led the world in natural gas production since 2009 crude oil production has been increasing rapidly since 2010 the united states was the top producer in 2013 in september 2018 the united states once again passed both russia and saudi arabia to become the largest global crude oil producer but the energy revolution he takes credit for began under obama with the tremendous progress we have made over the past three years america is now energy independent this is false the united states continues to import energy in 2018 the united states imported about 9 94 million barrels per day mmb d of petroleum from nearly 90 countries according to an energy information agency report with 43 coming from canada and 16 from persian gulf countries after losing 60 000 factories under the previous two administrations america has now gained 12 000 new factories under my administration with thousands upon thousands of plants and factories being planned or built advertising factories conjures up images of smokestacks and production lines but the data set trump cited is not really about factories trump is using a bureau of labor statistics database set known as the quarterly census of employment and wages the data show that united states gained nearly 12 000 additional manufacturing establishments between the first quarter of 2017 through the second quarter of 2019 there was also a gain of 10 000 in obama s second term but more than 80 of these manufacturing establishments employ five or fewer people if those sound like pretty small factories that s because many are not factories the bls counts any establishment engaged in the mechanical physical or chemical transformation of materials substances or components into new products so that also includes businesses that transform materials or substances into new products by hand or in the worker s home and those engaged in selling to the general public products made on the same premises from which they are sold such as bakeries candy stores and custom tailors following nafta s adoption our nation lost 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs this is misleading as trump attributes all manufacturing lost to the north american free trade agreement nafta when many other factors were responsible such as automation and china s entry into the world trade organization many politicians came and went pledging to change or replace nafta only to do absolutely nothing but unlike so many who came before me i keep my promises six days ago i replaced nafta and signed the brand new united states mexico canada agreement usmca into law the usmca is a modest reworking of nafta launched in 1994 with about 85 90 the same as the deal trump repeatedly trashed as terrible advertising the u s international trade commission which is tasked with evaluating the impact of trade agreements calculated the new deal would have a relatively minor impact usmca would raise u s real gross domestic product by 68 2 billion 0 35 and u s employment by 176 000 jobs 0 12 usitc said the usmca will create nearly 100 000 new high paying american auto jobs this is an invented figure the isitc report said the agreement would create about 28 000 jobs in the auto sector to safeguard american liberty we have invested a record breaking 2 2 trillion in the united states military trump is just talking about three years of defense funding added up together on an inflation adjusted basis not one year of trump s defense budgets has exceeded the high point in 2010 under barack obama i have raised contributions from the other nato members by more than 400 billion and the number of allies meeting their minimum obligations has more than doubled trump gives himself too much credit since 2006 each nato member has had a guideline of spending at least 2 of gross domestic product on military spending defense expenditures for nato countries other than the united states have been going up in a consistent slope since 2014 that s when nato decided to boost spending in response to russia s seizure of ukraine s crimea region nato estimates that its european members and canada will add 130 billion in cumulative military spending through 2020 in 2015 dollars as an increase over 2016 spending nato also estimates the cumulative figure will rise to 400 billion through 2024 advertising before i took office health insurance premiums had more than doubled in just five years i moved quickly to provide affordable alternatives our new plans are up to 60 less expensive trump often makes this claim but we have not been able to verify the claim of a 60 reduction in costs the new short term health plans authorized by the trump administration are less expensive for a reason they offer skimpier coverage and thus provide less protection as for the doubling in health insurance premiums that claim is based on a white house report that made some questionable methodological choices we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions that is a guarantee in an ongoing court case the trump administration is supporting a total repeal of the affordable care act including its guarantee that patients can t be denied coverage for preexisting conditions republicans in congress tried for years to repeal the whole law trump has not presented a plan to cover the gaps in case the court challenge is successful moreover he has promoted short term plans which he touted in his speech that are not required to cover preexisting conditions through our pledge to american workers over 400 companies will also provide new jobs and education opportunities to almost 15 million americans trump usually describes this as jobs already created but apparently his language was tamed by a teleprompter these are not new jobs but training opportunities moreover the numbers reflect pledges over a five year period not something already achieved many companies signed up by offering training programs that already existed advertising i was pleased to announce last year that for the first time in 51 years the cost of prescription drugs actually went down the consumer price index for prescription drugs in 2018 fell for the first time in 46 years but that s only when measuring calendar years from january to december which is somewhat arbitrary the president s record shrinks to 5 1 2 years when measuring non calendar years the cpi had last declined in the 12 month period ended july 2013 experts say the cpi for prescription drugs fails to account for rebates which can be substantial and may be giving a skewed picture because of recent market shifts toward generics and electronic payments by third parties a range of studies we found shows drug prices have not declined especially when it comes to branded drugs as we speak a long tall and very powerful wall is being built we have now completed over 100 miles and will have over 500 miles fully completed by early next year trump doubled down on a promise for 500 miles of new border fencing by early next year which would require the current pace of construction to more than double department of homeland security officials have been trying to lower expectations lately saying they will have that much built or under construction he also exaggerates the barrier s sturdiness the washington post has reported that the steel and concrete bollard fence can be cut through with a souped up power saw and that a series of large flood gates must be left open for months every summer during monsoon season in the desert advertising with unyielding commitment we are curbing the opioid epidemic drug overdose deaths declined for the first time in nearly 30 years overall drug overdose deaths fell in 2018 for the first time in 28 years according to cdc data but fentanyl overdose deaths increased 10 last year our brave ice officers arrested more than 120 000 criminal aliens charged with nearly 10 000 burglaries 5 000 sexual assaults 45 000 violent assaults and 2 000 murders many of the criminal aliens trump is describing are immigrants who were convicted of immigration or nonviolent offenses he quickly switched from the total for ice arrests 120 000 to a different number that includes all the different charges it s a misleading apples and oranges comparison because one individual may face multiple charges and not all arrests result in convictions before i came into office if you showed up illegally on our southern border and were arrested you were simply released and allowed into our country never to be seen again my administration has ended catch and release if you come illegally you will now be promptly removed we entered into historic cooperation agreements with the governments of mexico honduras el salvador and guatemala as a result of our unprecedented efforts illegal crossings are down 75 since may dropping eight straight months in a row and as the wall goes up drug seizures rise and border crossings go down the trump administration has tried but has not ended catch and release the policy of releasing asylum seekers and refugees many of them women and children into the country while they await a hearing in the clogged u s immigration court system immigrants continue to be released advertising southwest border apprehensions dropped 75 when measuring from may to december but when looking at all of trump s presidency the gains are almost negligible 42 359 apprehensions in january 2017 and 40 620 in december 2019 in the senate we have confirmed a record number of 187 new federal judges it s not a record trump has a long way to go to have appointed the most federal judges ronald reagan has the record with 383 followed by bill clinton with 378 and then barack obama with 329 through jan 18 2020 187 judges nominated by trump have been confirmed by the senate forty million american families have an average 2 200 extra thanks to our child tax credit this is an example of trump using correct numbers but he gives too much credit to himself and his republican colleagues the child tax credit has existed since 1997 and it s been expanded since then including in the recent tax law in 2016 under president barack obama 35 million american families took the tax credit with an average benefit of over 1 500 a year according to the treasury department so there s only been a modest increase in part because of inflation three years ago the barbarians of isis held over 20 000 square miles of territory in iraq and syria today the isis territorial caliphate has been 100 destroyed and the founder and leader of isis the bloodthirsty killer albaghdadi is dead advertising the u s military warned in a report issued the day trump spoke that isis remained a dangerous threat and the killing of baghdadi did not degrade to isis s capabilities uscentcom told the dod oig that following the death of isis leader abu bakr al baghdadi the group s capabilities in syria remained the same the report said uscentcom said that isis remained cohesive with an intact command and control structure urban clandestine networks and an insurgent presence in much of rural syria qasem soleimani directed the december assault on united states forces in iraq and was actively planning new attacks other than trump s assertion there is no publicly available evidence that iranian general suleimani directed the december attacks or that any possible attack was imminent
in the wake of labour s election defeat the blairite right and its intellectual outriders have launched a sustained campaign against the left and socialism the leadership sectarianism ideological purity and of course anti semitism are standard explanations of labour s defeat part of this is a bad tempered observer article by economist will hutton in which he claims the word neoliberal applied to people or ideas is just an unthinking leftist insult will hutton it will be remembered was the author of a sharp attack on thatcherism the state we re in published in 1996 and subsequently a strong advocate of blairism he now claims the left lost its battles against the right in the last decade because at bottom it has a fatal divisive weakness lack of any agreement about what being liberal left can and should mean creates a sectarianism that unless confronted consumes it the left defining itself as the custodian of the socialist flame and everyone else in varying degrees as a traitorous neoliberal further the very term neoliberal has become a catch all to indicate contempt for any policy position or political figure the left considers to be departing from true socialism which in turn must be based on the subordination of capitalism to the state rather than its reform the passions aroused created a never ending sectarian war making the compromises necessary to create a governing coalition that could exercise power is not on its agenda the left s struggle is all about fighting for and delivering a particular definition of socialism or nothing accusing the left of being sectarian is pretty standard stuff but hutton s article begs the question of whether neoliberalism actually exists either as an ideology or as the dominant form of actually existing capitalism because if it does so exist then it is reasonable to suppose that certain ideas and individuals actually embody that ideology and propose policies to implement neoliberal nostrums obviously just in passing we might note that there s a whole body of writing in the observer s stable mate the guardian which utilises the concept of neoliberalism and calls out its consequences indeed guardian columnist george monbiot argues that it is impossible to understand the world without the concept of neoliberalism he points out that among wide sectors of the population the idea is unknown he says imagine if the people of the soviet union had never heard of communism the ideology that dominates our lives has for most of us no name mention it in conversation and you ll be rewarded with a shrug david harvey most of us in this case means people not on the left and far from being as will hutton maintains an unthinking leftist insult there is a huge literature that explains it in his well known a brief history of neolibealism david harvey explains it as follows neoliberalism is in the first instance a theory of political economic practices that proposes that human well being can best be advanced by liberating individual entrepreneurial freedoms and skills within an institutional framework characterised by strong private property rights free markets and free trade the role of the state is to create and preserve an institutional framework appropriate to such practices furthermore if markets do not exist in areas such as land water education health care social security or environmental pollution then they must be created by state action if necessary but beyond these tasks the state should not venture there has everywhere been an emphatic turn towards neoliberalism in political economic practices and thinking since the 1970s deregulation privatisation and withdrawal of the state from many areas of social provision have been all too common neoliberalism has in short become hegemonic as a mode of discourse it has pervasive effects on ways of thought to the point where it has become incorporated into the common sense way many of us interpret live in and understand the world a couple of points of detail need to be added the neoliberal state has everywhere attempted to attack workers rights and diminish trade union power it has reduced job security and indeed created a society where economic insecurity is the permanent lot of a significant section of the population it has increased economic inequality massively carrying through a gigantic transfer of wealth and power away from working people in favour of the mega rich it has meant working longer and harder as most jobs become subject to minute oversight and measurement and it has created a debt laden society in which millions keep their heads above water by building up unsustainable debts just to keep going it has created huge left behind areas in which poverty will be lifelong and it has created a situation where the future for millions of young people is grim add to that the fact that obsession with short term profit inevitably prevents any resolution of the climate crisis and a world of massive corruption as banks collaborate with the rich to hide their money from observation and tax collectors and you have a pretty good overview of what neoliberalism means hutton s fatal error hutton was very much pro new labour before the 1997 election but not uncritical of new labour in power but his basic viewpoint has remained unchanged since the mid 1990s he believes that the problem is that we have the wrong type of capitalism one which prioritises financial profits over productive investment and what we need is investment in robust productive companies like they have over there in germany in a recent article hutton praised elizabeth warren a contender to become the democratic candidate in the november presidential election over her more left wing rival bernie sanders because warren praises markets and wants to remake capitalism but significant sections of the capitalist class in europe and america cannot be won to his or warren s project because the present configuration of capitalism delivers such vast profits to its dominant sectors hutton fails to see that financialisation the dominance of finance capital is built into the modern capitalist system aka neoliberalism hutton says i continue to think that rhineland capitalism with its emphasis on protecting companies long run purpose and values interestingly now echoed by the mighty west coast us tech companies permits more great companies to prosper in germany than in britain gec and ici are now dead surrendering to the financial preoccupations of the stock market their german counterparts siemens and basf are world leaders companies like bosch and bmw or carlsberg and ikea in scandinavia are well owned and driven by a great sense of purpose rather as apple and google are it is britain that treats companies like casino chips with results that cascade into poor productivity low innovation and rising inequality the reason that hutton s vision a desire to go back to the dominance of manufacturing capital in the 1950s and 1960s won t work is that financialisation is built into the dna of neoliberalism here s why neoliberalism by pushing down the share of gdp allocated to wages and social spending has an inherent deflationary tendency as well as boosting the super profits of finance capital this is linked to privatisation privatised utilities privatised transport and the destruction of the social housing sector lead to a hoovering up of the spending power of the working class and lower sections of the middle class in utility bills local taxes transport costs and above all rents and mortgages financial capital has an answer to all this a way of ensuring continued capitalist growth vast oceans of debt now the rentier the capitalist money lender reigns supreme the current model of capitalism in the advanced countries prioritises hyper consumerism all financed through debt over lorded by the ideology of the consumer spectacle in the process vast profits are piled up by key corporations like the california hi tech companies praised by hutton making it difficult to distinguish clearly industrial and financial capital much of this profit is used for financial and not manufacturing operations hundreds of millions of workers depend on debt not just for housing or consumer durables but for part of their daily expenditure as well the cash rich upper sections of society are matched by the debt ridden masses the corollary of a debt laden economy is financial crash as we saw in 2007 8 in 2006 hutton wrote a retrospective of his 1996 thatcher critique in which he wondered whether in the light of the onward and upward progress of globalisation he had got his critique of thatcherism at least partially wrong then came the 2007 world banking crisis followed by endless neoliberal austerity the crash and the austerity were not something separate from neoliberalism and financialisation they were caused by it lying about the left will hutton is hostile to the trump johnson style right but his notion that left sectarianism and division is responsible for it being in power is very superficial hard right victories are at least in part a verdict on what came before in britain blairism in the us obama the results of the blair and obama governments exactly the type of centrist government you get if the right is defeated and the radical left marginalised were to say the least disappointing because neither challenged the dominant neoliberal discourse as i wrote in a recent article blair s government maintained harsh anti union laws that made effective trade union action difficult it deepened thatcher s adherence to labour flexibility it kept her policy of starving local government finances it continued the policy of rock bottom welfare payments and harsh penalties for claimants including disabled people most of all despite several initiatives to help the poorest in society it failed to take the kind of measures needed to make any significant dent in britain s status as one of the most unequal advanced capitalist economies which is why the few significant measures to help the most disadvantaged were so quickly overthrown by the post 2010 tory liberal coalition government blair s government fully signed up to a low wage economy which forced many working class people to depend on consumer debt to finance their daily lives which of course contributed to the dreadful outcome of the 2007 8 financial crash the cost of daily life was massively inflated by the increasing reliance on the private rental sector for housing and the huge amounts of disposable income pumped out of working people by privatised utilities and transport networks will hutton is wildly wrong about why the radical left and revolt against what tariq ali calls the extreme centre have won significant support since 2007 it is not just that some mendacious and maliciously sectarian people went into a corner to cause trouble for the liberal left it reflects something real in the experience of millions the failure of the extreme centre to ameliorate their condition since the 2007 8 financial crash there has been endless austerity but also endless revolt against it from the indignados in spain to the yellow vests in france it is also why we got corbynism in britain to get out of the grim mess that neoliberalism has created you have to change a lot of things at once you have to scrap the anti union laws to empower workers you have to ban zero hours contracts there has to be a minimum wage that reflects the real costs of living you have to control rents and start a huge public house building campaign there has to be a revolution in social care utilities and rail transport have to be brought into social ownership and we need a green new deal to convert to a carbon neutral economy and society it is impossible to do these things without massively taxing wealth not just income a structural change in wealth and power relations is not just socialist purity it is a burning necessity will hutton does not intervene directly in the labour leadership battle but what he says is identical to what people like alan johnson and tony blair say it is part of an offensive whose ultimate aim is the decisive defeat of the left in the labour party coda it s all around you on the day i wrote this article i heard an item on the bbc world service about the looming battle in california over labour flexibility last september the state legislature passed a measure that would extend many rights enjoyed by full time workers to part time workers or labour only contractors this is now being challenged by a group of companies led by uber lyft and doordash who are launching a 90m campaign to overturn this measure in a proposition to be voted on with november s elections imagine that a huge 90m campaign so they don t have to pay out basic benefits to workers would it be possible to call the opposition of uber et al neoliberal of course this kind of thing is at the core of neoliberalism it s precisely what it s all about when i retired from teaching in 2016 i was put on the panel interviewing for my successor i had to explain to the four candidates who arrived at the college by 8 30am that first they would have to do a sample mini lesson then a 15 minute presentation then in the afternoon a panel interview no hopers would be sent home at lunchtime for the rest it would take all day i apologised for this drawn out procedure typical of the approach imported from corporate human resource departments in the united states one of the candidates shot back it s called neoliberalism yes it is it is the counter revolution that is ingrained into modern capitalism which everyone experiences to understand it we have to name it and fight its advocates phil hearse is active in mutiny and socialist resistance observer 29 december 2019 accusing people who use the term neoliberal of being unthinking is pretty rich especially inb the light of the huge number of books and documents which document and establish this concept see particulary in the writing of aditya chakrabortty and goerge monbiot se also oxford university press 2007 petra dünhaupt explains how this has been theorised by the monthly review school foster 2006 2007 2008 2010a 2010b argues that by the late 1970s capitalism entered a new phase which he calls monopoly finance capital the defining features of this phase are amongst others the accelerating increase in financial bubbles and financial speculation though profits of financial corporations have risen as a share of total corporations profits foster argues that the divide between financial and non financial corporations became less clear given the increasing reliance of non financial corporations on financial activities moreover he mentions the rise in income inequality as another defining feature which generated a rise in households indebtedness to compensate for stagnating or falling real wages according to foster a more unequal distribution of income is a prerequisite for the functioning of monopoly finance capital given the demand for new cash infusions to keep 8 economic surplus is defined as the difference between what a society produces and the costs of producing it baran sweezy 1966 9 12 speculative bubbles expanding foster 2007 foster 2007 regards neoliberalism as the ideological counterpart of monopoly finance capital reflecting to some extent the new imperatives of capital brought on by financial globalization

president donald trump delivered his third state of the union address tuesday night the heritage foundation s policy experts weighed in with reaction and analysis economy tax cuts continue to boost jobs and wages thanks to the 2017 tax cuts and other pro growth economic reforms like deregulation the u s economy has outstripped expectations the president touted the economic success of slashing job killing regulations and enacting historic and record setting tax cuts he is right and the proof is in the numbers unemployment is at a 50 year low of 3 5 businesses have added jobs for 111 straight months the longest streak on record and there are more jobs available than people looking for them wages have also been increasing wage growth for the median worker was 4 over the past year what s most impressive is that the lowest income workers in the u s have benefited the most from the strong labor market seeing some of the fastest wage growth of any workers minority and lower skilled workers have also seen some of the largest drops in unemployment and largest wage gains in recent years for example the median black female worker benefited from an 11 wage increase over the last year our strong economy is truly benefiting all americans this isn t happenstance the 2017 tax cuts made american workers globally competitive again by lowering punitive business taxes to levels similar to most european countries coupled with sweeping reforms to outdated and unnecessary regulations tax cuts have made the u s an easier place to do business and hire american workers adam n michel senior policy analyst hermann center for the federal budget lifting americans off welfare the president rightly noted that millions of americans have risen out of poverty and have been lifted off welfare and that 7 million americans have been lifted off food stamps since the 2016 election the best and necessary foundation for reducing poverty a strong economy as the president has delivered congress and the president should build on this foundation by reforming welfare programs to promote marriage and work as the key long term pathways out of poverty specifically congress should reform the 1 1 trillion spent on the means tested welfare state by reducing welfare penalties against marriage and requiring able bodied recipients to work or prepare for work as a condition for receiving assistance additionally in programs designed to improve behavior congress should pay only for outcomes rather than ineffective services e g pay when someone gets and stays off drugs rather than just paying for treatment that didn t work finally congress should accurately measure benefits when the government measures poverty it excludes all welfare benefits this is unfair to the taxpayer and produces exaggerated inaccurate figures on poverty in the u s policymakers should fix this by insisting that all welfare benefits are correctly counted when estimating poverty for more see robert rector s paper understanding the hidden 1 1 trillion welfare system and how to reform it marie fishpaw director domestic policy studies slashing regulations in recounting the strong performance of the economy the president noted his record of regulatory reform indeed within days of taking office the president issued executive order 13771 which requires federal departments and agencies to take two deregulatory actions for each new regulatory action as well as to not exceed annual regulatory budgets according to the latest status report from the white house the administration has eliminated 50 9 billion in regulatory costs since 2017 in the coming year additional savings of 51 6 billion are forecast including easing automotive fuel economy standards most recently the white house council on environmental quality issued revised guidelines for the national environmental policy act which imposes some of the worst regulatory barriers to modern and safer roads bridges airports and railways dozens of regulations have been targeted for elimination but regulatory reform has been stymied at every turn by lawsuits and other administrative hurdles devised by those who benefit from the status quo but there has been a dramatic reduction in the number of new regulations in the 37 months of the trump presidency the administration has issued 73 fewer significant regulations than president barack obama in the same period and 63 fewer than president george h w bush diane katz senior research fellow regulatory policy paid parental leave for federal workers the president applauded congress for providing federal employees with 12 weeks of paid parental leave and called on lawmakers to provide some form of national benefit for private sector workers the provision of taxpayer provided parental leave to federal workers makes sense in this case because the government is the employer but the addition of this new benefit should have been coupled with more comprehensive federal employee compensation reform in addition to receiving significantly higher compensation than their private sector counterparts federal employees already had a de facto paid family leave and short term disability insurance allowance through a very generous sick leave policy adding this new benefit on top without reforming the existing and arguably less efficient system allows federal employees who are new parents to take at least 20 weeks and up to a full year of paid leave rachel greszler research fellow grover m hermann center for the federal budget at the heritage foundation a new federal paid family leave entitlement the president is right that providing paid parental leave is a model for the rest of the country but it is a model to be implemented by companies as they are able and on their own terms it is not a model the federal government should impose through a new national paid parental or paid family leave entitlement instead of a federal program the president should promote more of the rapid growth that s already occurring among employer provided paid family leave programs across the u s employer provided policies can be flexible and accommodating and are usually more generous but one size fits all government policies are rigid burdensome and impersonal government programs also have higher costs and consequences and they are extremely regressive taxing everyone while primarily only benefitting middle and upper income earners while most americans support a national paid family leave program their support drops precipitously when asked about the costs and trade offs democrats support a program they say would only cost a cup of coffee a week but without government rationing a national program would cost about seven times as much closer to a tank of gas instead even at the modest cup of coffee a week cost support for a national program drops below 50 and only 29 of workers support a national program if it were to mean lower benefits for them or fewer promotions for women but that has been the consequence with government paid leave programs abroad and despite the argument that paid family leave increases women s labor force attachment and earnings california s program was found to have the opposite effect reducing the employment earnings and even fertility rates of new mothers who used the program although access to paid family leave is valuable and employers are responding by increasingly offering it there are many other things that are more important to working families when asked which of six factors would best allow workers to balance work and family 34 said more flexible work schedules and 25 said ability to work remotely telecommuting while only 6 said more paid maternity or paternity leave the working families flexibility act would give lower wage workers the option to accumulate paid time off universal savings accounts would help families save for all kinds of life events and fewer regulations would free up business resources to help employers provide paid family leave and none of these would create another unfunded middle class entitlement rachel greszler research fellow grover m hermann center for the federal budget failure to mention america s spending driven debt problem one issue that the president failed to address tuesday night is the nation s looming spending driven debt crisis last week the congressional budget office released its budget and economic projections for the next 10 years the budget office estimates that the national debt held by the public will increase to nearly 100 of gross domestic product by 2030 driven by entitlement spending and growing interest payments on the national debt moreover these projections could be optimistic assuming that lower interest rates slow the growth of interest payments on the debt and that congress approves no major disaster and emergency spending the good news is there is still time to change course and avert a debt crisis but the president must take the lead in this effort the first opportunity to initiate reforms is the release of the president s fiscal year 2021 budget next week the president s first three budgets pledged to cut spending and fundamentally reform the role of the federal government president donald trump must continue to push for bolder reforms that focus the responsibilities of national government back to its constitutional roots current and future generations cannot afford for washington s reckless pattern of spending to continue justin bogie senior policy analyst in fiscal affairs grover m hermann center for the federal budget institute for economic freedom and opportunity warning against socialism president donald trump declared socialism destroys nations but always remember freedom unifies the soul today s progressive politicians are calling for expanded government control in a myriad of sectors in addition to health care such as energy utilities housing and education this would transform the united states economy into something reflective of many nations across europe where the government spending as a percentage of gdp is far higher ordinary taxpayers bear the brunt of this burden for instance payroll taxes in france top 50 consumers pay national sales tax value added tax of up to 27 overall a typical 40 000 a year worker pays 6 000 more in taxes compared to the same worker in the u s even if every dollar of income is taxed from those earning more than 200 000 per year this doesn t come close to paying for the 48 92 trillion in spending proposed by progressive politicians over 10 years many americans especially the younger generation are unfamiliar with the cold war the misery endured by hundreds of millions under communist regimes across eastern europe the ussr southeast asia and even parts of latin america thankfully nordic countries have been moving away from the democratic socialist economic model after growing tired of the economic stagnation which it created but across swaths of western europe democratic socialism continues to yield high taxes including on the middle class slow economic growth high unemployment and lower wages joel griffith research fellow financial regulations defense foreign policy progress in rebuilding military the president declared that our military is completely rebuilt the last three years have indeed been good for the u s military and much of the lost readiness that had dwindled over the years has been restored army readiness for example is up 55 but despite favorable budgets the military is not yet fully rebuilt years of budget cuts and years of over use have strained the military postponed necessary equipment refresh and caused the military to shrink in size while there are unmistakable signs of progress there is still work to be done to fully restore the military additional investment and attention will still be needed as noted by the president the creation of the space force is a true step forward for the united states it will allow our country to better focus its efforts in this critical domain the united states depends on space and other countries are seeking to deny those capabilities the space force will put america in a much stronger position as our experts explain thomas spoehr director center for national defense clear message on the middle east the middle east was prominently featured in trump s state of the union speech the president noted that his administration had made a priority of combating radical islamic terrorism and briefly described his israeli palestinian peace initiative which calls for the disarming of hamas and other islamic terrorists as part of that effort he spent much more time in recounting the progress his administration has made in defeating isis terrorists in iraq and syria he noted the death of isis leader al baghdadi in a u s military operation last year and received one of the longest standing ovations of the night he also introduced the parents of kayla mueller an american aid worker who was kidnapped in syria tortured and enslaved by isis and kept as a prisoner by al baghdadi before being murdered he revealed that the u s special operations forces that eliminated al baghdadi had named their mission task force 8 14 after kayla s aug 14 birthday trump also introduced the family of army staff sgt christopher hake who was killed in iraq by a roadside bomb he noted that the leader of the iranian revolutionary guard force that provided the bomb was gen qassim suleimani who was killed in a u s military operation in iraq last month trump warned our message to the terrorists is clear you will never escape american justice if you attack our citizens you forfeit your life trump ended the middle east portion of his speech by drawing a distinction between iran s long suffering people and iran s oppressive regime he called on tehran to end its nuclear weapon ambitions and support for terrorism while stressing that he remains open to a diplomatic resolution of these issues because of our powerful sanctions the iranian economy is doing very poorly we can help them make it very good in a short period of time but perhaps they are too proud or too foolish to ask for that help we are here let s see which road they choose it is totally up to them jim phillips senior research fellow middle eastern affairs health care empowering states to reduce health costs president donald trump is right to call on congress to lower health costs protect people with preexisting conditions and protect american families ability to choose the private coverage that is right for them he s made progress toward this goal already delivering reforms to lower the cost of care by providing consumers and small businesses with new more affordable health insurance options and by giving states more latitude to provide relief from high premiums for individual coverage one reform alone allowing states to obtain waivers to deviate from some of obamacare s cost increasing mandates has led to lower costs while better protecting people with preexisting conditions seven states that obtained waivers saw premiums fall a median of 7 48 while premiums in the other 44 states and the district of columbia rose by a median of 3 09 congress should build on this progress and adopt the health care choices proposal endorsed by over 100 conservatives across the country that can lower premiums by as much as a third while increasing private coverage and focusing resources on vulnerable people with preexisting conditions many laws today work against families being able to choose the plan and doctor that is right for them this proposal would address these laws and empower people not government bureaucrats or insurance companies to make the best decisions for their families a goal shared by 94 of americans rejecting ideas that would make existing problems worse the left s ideas as the president rightly warns against would make current problems facing american families worse not better that s because the left s proposals would drastically expand the role of government in our health care sector some bills in congress would immediately outlaw private coverage and put us all on a new government program others would move toward the same goal on the installment plan using so called public options that ostensibly would have the government compete with private plans but in reality would put in place the infrastructure and produce the same outcomes the left likes to claim that people are better off under this approach in reality heritage foundation estimates show that ideas like medicare for all would cost some working families more than their budget for electricity others their gasoline budget and others even more than their food budget as a result roughly three quarters of americans will have less money in their pockets under medicare for all that s because fully funding medicare for all requires a new additional tax of 21 2 cents on every dollar americans earn meaning the government will take roughly half of your paycheck to learn how several sample families would be impacted see in charts how medicare for all would make most families poorer ending surprise medical billing the president rightly called on congress to address concerns families face today when dealing with the health care system such as surprise medical billing an unfair practice that is hurting patients this occurs when patients who try to follow insurance company rules are hit with surprise bills through no fault of their own heritage s solution would eliminate surprise bills ensuring patients get honest information before they receive care lowering prescription drug costs the president also is right to call on congress to address high prescription drug costs government policy created this problem through flawed regulations and subsidies that drive up costs policymakers must reject heavy handed solutions such as those proposed by house speaker nancy pelosi because they would limit access to lifesaving medicines and impede access to new cures congress should instead consider heritage s roadmap which addresses the flawed government policies behind high costs and would provide relief for patients and taxpayers specifically congress should reform medicare s prescription drug programs and ban practices that prevent affordable generic medicines from coming to market marie fishpaw director domestic policy studies education federal tax credit scholarships more than half of all u s states offer eligible k 12 students a private learning option in addition to the child s assigned district school a new federal tax credit scholarship program would further complicate the already complex federal tax code furthermore the new program would eclipse state authority over k 12 education and because it would be dollar for dollar and most state tax credit scholarships are not it would encourage donors to preference the federal program draining donations to state scholarships we offered more detail on the negative tax implications and other problems that would stem from a federal school choice program here another paramount concern is that a new federal program would give future administrations that may be less friendly to school choice a toehold to regulate participating private schools damaging school choice in the long run what requirements might a left leaning administration place on schools that accept students paying tuition through the federal tax credit program the administration s support of parent choice in education is welcome but washington should stop there taxpayers and students do not need carve outs in the tax code but for federal officials to set an example for future administrations allow encourage even state lawmakers to create more public and private learning options in the form of scholarships education savings accounts magnet schools and charter schools to offer new opportunities for students from all walks of life the goal of conservative policymakers should be to significantly narrow rather than broaden washington s reach in education policy unfortunately this proposal goes in the wrong direction lindsey burke director center for education policy energy unleashing american energy affordable energy is fundamentally important for a healthy and vibrant economy tonight president donald trump mentioned how his administration has helped grow such an economy in part by permitting access to our country s vast oil and gas supply we are now a net energy exporter and access to this energy has not only made us less dependent on foreign oil but has also resulted in greater job opportunities lower electricity prices and more income for all americans all across the country kevin dayaratna senior statistician and research programmer center for data analysis life cherishing the value of life tonight president donald trump recognized 2 year old ellie schneider a special guest at the state of the union address ellie was born when she was just 21 weeks and 6 days old and weighed less than a pound at the time of her birth one of the youngest premature infants to ever survive ellie is now happy healthy and thriving trump lauded the medical advancements that allow an increasing number of premature babies to survive and thrive and called on congress to commit additional resources to fund neonatal research he also called on congress to pass the pain capable unborn child protection act which would protect women and unborn children from gruesome late term abortions performed after 20 weeks the u s is one of only seven countries in the world that allows elective abortion past 20 weeks five months at which point scientific evidence suggests that the baby is capable of feeling excruciating pain during an abortion procedure at the state level over a dozen states across the country have enacted 20 week bills regardless of party affiliation americans support significant abortion restrictions by a large margin in fact 70 of americans support limiting abortion to at most the first trimester congress should ensure that public policy respects the rights of the most vulnerable and innocent among us including the right to life our most basic and fundamental freedom enacting legislation to protect unborn children who are capable of feeling pain would be a meaningful step to build a culture that cherishes human life melanie israel research associate richard and helen devos center for religion civil society law remaking the federal judiciary the president highlighted that he has so far appointed 187 judges including justices neil gorsuch and brett kavanaugh and he promised that there are many more in the pipeline as the judicial appointment tracker shows only president bill clinton appointed more at this point but just one more quantity is just one side of the coin however quality is the other trump s judicial appointment record goes beyond the number of judges he appoints because the real impact on the country will come from the kind of judges he appoints trump uses the shorthand of judges who will uphold the constitution as written that means they will take the constitution or statutes or regulations and figure out what the constitution meant when it was written that s what it is supposed to mean today so that judges follow the constitution instead of controlling it trump has been more consistent than any president in history in appointing judges who take this traditional defined approach to deciding cases the other part of the story is that trump is making such a profound change in the judiciary in the face of a campaign of resistance and obstruction that no president has ever faced the pattern documented in the heritage foundation s report on the 115th congress only got worse in 2019 democrats have radically changed more than 200 years of confirmation history by making opposition to trump s judicial nominations the rule rather than the exception in just three years trump s judges have received more than three times as many votes against confirmation as all the judges confirmed in the 20th century combined federal judges serve for an average of more than 20 years long after the president who appoints them is gone trump s judges and the move away from a political judiciary may well end up being his most important legacy thomas jipping deputy director meese center for legal judicial studies passing criminal justice reform trump highlighted the first step act and praised congress for coming together to pass the law that gave people a second chance at life as the president said everybody said that criminal justice reform could not be done but i got it done and the people in this room got it done he is right about that the first step act was a landmark bipartisan law that ushered in what heritage foundation scholars described as much needed reforms among other things the act gave hope to prisoners convicted of some drug trafficking crimes where they are not the type of hard core criminals or major drug traffickers that deserve long term incapacitation and it promises to provide them some of the skills they need to reduce the risk that they will recidivate and maximize the likelihood that they will become law abiding productive citizens when they are released and return to our communities trump s reference to second chances called attention to his plans for additional legislation that would ease employment barriers for formerly incarcerated people like tony rankins who attended the state of the union as one of trump s special guests rankins served in the army in afghanistan but lost his job and family to drug addiction which led him to crime and incarceration he now has a stable job and has reunited with his family trump is working to pass additional legislation that would make it easier for other former prisoners to do the same it is doubtless the case that there are other people like rankins the criminal law should not throw them away there should always be room in the law to recognize the frailties of human character where someone does not make crime a career does not pillage the community and does not end a life before nature takes its course as heritage scholars have observed criminal justice reform needs to address more than just prison conditions and sentences it needs to tackle the criminal code itself and rein in the authority of executive agencies to create crimes for too long congress has allowed administrative agencies to define crimes in ways that the average person would not know to be criminal that is a serious flaw in the criminal law congress should revisit the authority given to agencies to define terms that can lead to criminal liability and congress should revise the criminal code so that no one is at risk of innocently crossing the line between legal and illegal mens rea latin for guilty mind reform remains a crucial issue too before he retired sen orrin hatch r utah was a champion of mens rea reform without a champion in congress the time is ripe for trump to take up that cause heritage scholars have provided a roadmap for how trump can use his executive authority to further mens rea reform while also encouraging congress to work on the issue we urge the president to do so john g malcolm vice president institute for constitutional government paul larkin jr senior legal research fellow meese center for legal and judicial studies and giancarlo canaparo legal fellow meese center protecting the second amendment president donald trump told the nation just as we believe in the first amendment we also believe in another constitutional right that is under siege all across our country so long as i am president i will always protect your second amendment right to keep and bear arms the president is right lawmakers across the country and at all levels of government have spent the last several years taking aim at the second amendment more importantly he is right to insist on protecting this important safeguard of liberty we all want a safe nation we all want to know that our loved ones are protected against those who would do them harm we all grieve with the communities whose peace has been shattered by horrific acts of evil but we do ourselves and our communities no favors by caving to emotionally laden appeals to just do something about gun violence especially when that something often means imposing severe restrictions on the constitutional rights of law abiding citizens we do not need to just do something we need to do the right thing and the right thing is to ensure that the american people are never deprived of their greatest check against the tyrannical impulses of government the right thing is to disarm dangerous criminals without inhibiting the ability of law abiding americans to protect their lives and livelihoods the right thing is to defend the second amendment just as ardently as we defend the rest of the bill of rights amy swearer senior legal policy analyst meese center for legal and judicial studies infrastructure wrong approach to infrastructure the state of the union contained a brief mention of infrastructure unfortunately the president used this time to promote a further expansion of federal activity the senate infrastructure bill is badly flawed increasing spending and creating questionable new programs despite the highway trust fund s chronic deficits the federal role should be heavily devolved to states and the private sector while nationwide high speed internet would be a wonderful thing this should not be accomplished through billions of dollars in federal subsidies as seen in the proposal recently introduced by house democrats the administration should continue its focus on deregulation to ensure that private investments such as infrastructure expansion are as easy as possible david ditch research associate hermann center for the federal budget immigration protecting the border and fighting sanctuary cities president donald trump criticized the over 130 members of congress who endorsed legislation that would bankrupt our nation by providing free taxpayer funded health care to millions of illegal aliens forcing taxpayers to subsidize free care for anyone in the world who unlawfully crosses our borders trump said this would raid the medicare benefits our seniors depend on while acting as a powerful lure for illegal immigration he is right about that providing government benefits to aliens who are in this country illegally is financially foolish and will in the long run make the illegal immigration problem even worse trump also engaged congress on the issue of sanctuary jurisdictions this is the reckless policy of cities and states obstructing federal immigration enforcement and releasing dangerous criminal illegal aliens who ve been arrested for local crimes back into local communities to prey upon the public as trump said rather than turning them over to federal authorities so they can be removed from the country this has resulted in literally hundreds of thousands of crimes that could have been prevented and the victimization of countless americans trump described some of those victims including rocky jones who was murdered by an illegal alien with prior convictions for robbery and assault the alien was released by california authorities under that state s sanctuary policy rather than turned over to federal authorities the president voiced his support for a bill that would allow victims and their families like jones wife to sue sanctuary jurisdictions jones brother was in the senate gallery as the president told members of congress and the public the united states of america should be a sanctuary for law abiding americans not criminal aliens trump talked about the wall being built along the southern border his ending the catch and release policy of prior administrations and the new agreements he has negotiated with several countries including mexico and el salvador he can rightly claim credit for those and other policies having reduced illegal border crossings 75 since may and the president promoted his new approach to legal immigration by replacing our outdated and randomized immigration system with one based on merit that is a serious proposal that should be considered by congress as the president said we should welcome those who follow the rules contribute to our economy and uphold our values the vast majority of americans agree hans von spakovsky senior legal fellow meese center for legal and judicial studies
speech by christine lagarde president of the ecb at the grand prix de l économie des echos pour l année 2019 it s a great honour to be awarded this prize and to receive it in the presence of so many leading figures from the french business community the environment facing european business today is characterised by both uncertainty in the short term and a changing landscape in the longer term the short term uncertainties are mainly related to global risks trade geopolitical and now the outbreak of the coronavirus and its potential effect on global growth over the last two years the euro area economy has been quite resilient to global shocks with our accommodative monetary policy supporting employment and consumption and though gdp growth in the last quarter was weak it was broadly in line with our expectations but while the threat of a trade war between the united states and china appears to have receded the coronavirus adds a new layer of uncertainty so we re continuing to monitor closely how these risks develop and how they feed into our central scenario for the economy in the face of these uncertainties the ecb s forward guidance on interest rates and asset purchases acts as an effective automatic stabiliser the longer term picture is different ambitious proposals are gathering momentum within europe today and look set to profoundly reshape the environment for business in particular two big ambitions are pervading many aspects of policymaking in ways that create change but also opportunity the goal to build real european autonomy and the aim to urgently fight the consequences of climate change i know that as business leaders you naturally seek the new opportunities that emerge for your companies in such times so i d like today to talk about how i see these ambitions evolving and where they intersect with the tasks and priorities of the ecb european autonomy we all have a sense of the world around us moving more quickly the post war global order is fracturing tensions between great powers are rising and technological change is transforming the way we produce distribute and consume this environment clearly exposes europe to new types of risk as demonstrated today for example by the turn towards protectionist policies and the increasing use of sanctions so it s no surprise that the ambition of building european autonomy is gaining traction and has been gathering momentum in various policy areas where this overlaps most with the ecb is the international role of the euro issuing an international currency confers obligations but it also creates opportunities it lowers external financing costs the so called exorbitant privilege it helps shield domestic prices against volatile exchange rates it strengthens monetary policy autonomy and it can help reduce vulnerabilities such as the potential to be denied access to the financial and payment systems of others of course autonomy should be seen not as an alternative but as a robust complement to global cooperation which is of utmost importance but in europe s case while the international use of the euro has stabilised in recent years it still lags some way behind the dollar even for european trade around half of the euro area s international trade is invoiced in euro most of the oil we buy is denominated in foreign currency so european policymakers are showing renewed interest in strengthening the euro s global role and this coincides with the ecb s tasks we know from history that deep and liquid financial markets are one of the most important factors to enable a currency to attain international status in fact research shows that capital market depth was by far the most important driver helping the us dollar to overtake the pound sterling in the interwar period capital markets in europe however remain heavily segmented and financial integration has actually gone into reverse today it is only around half its pre crisis peak so if we truly want to boost the euro s international role it s essential that governments and regulators are committed to building a genuine capital markets union and here the ecb can contribute in particular by providing safe and innovative market infrastructures under european jurisdiction and by acting as an accelerator in payments solutions already europe has gone a long way in this direction in 2018 for example we launched target instant payment settlement tips a europe wide instant payments service but these achievements are not sufficient for us to consider our payments landscape autonomous especially in the retail space where payments are becoming more digital and non european solutions dominate at the end of 2016 for example more than two thirds of credit card transactions in europe were made using international cards this underlines the need to fully implement the recently re launched pan european retail payments strategy the challenge for us now in other words is to remain at the forefront of innovation both to respond to changing consumer demand and to strengthen europe s place in the world and this will include exploring with other central banks the risks and opportunities of issuing central bank digital currencies and the conceptual options available another aspect that s crucial for the effectiveness of our market infrastructures is resilience against the new risks in today s world namely cyber threats industry estimates for 2018 already put the global cost of cyber attacks at between usd 45 billion and usd 654 billion and as an operator of critical infrastructures the ecb obviously takes such threats very seriously but cyber risk is becoming important for financial stability too as forthcoming analysis from the european systemic risk board shows there are plausible channels through which a cyber attack could morph into a serious financial crisis an operational outage that say destroys or encrypts the balance accounts of a major financial institution could trigger a liquidity crisis and history shows that liquidity crises can quickly become systemic crises so the ecb is well aware that it has a duty to be prepared and to act pre emptively for example our banking supervision already requires all significant institutions to report cyber incidents immediately so that we can react quickly in the event of a major incident this is an area again where we intend to stay at the forefront of developments both to fulfil our own mandate and to discharge our wider responsibility to europe climate change the second big ambition reshaping the landscape for business is the mission to fight the consequences of climate change we are entering an era where climate risk will play a much more central role in public policies be it via regulation taxation or the focus of public spending we are already seeing this in the plans for a european green deal and several national governments have recently adopted large green investment packages in keeping with this climate change will be a key part of our ongoing strategy review though we re still in the early phases of this process i see two broad areas where we can move forward the first is filling the knowledge gap we need to extend our knowledge about the macroeconomic effects of climate change in particular in key areas like inflation productivity and trade a recent study found that out of approximately 77 000 articles published in top economics journals less than 60 have been on climate change so the ecb will also strive to deepen its analysis and its modelling in this field what we do know so far suggests that climate change will affect monetary policy for instance research on natural disasters suggests that climatic events could make inflation more volatile especially in the short run and over time mitigation strategies such as carbon taxes could have significant and persistent effects on relative prices in other words bringing climate change more fundamentally into our analysis and strategy is not mission creep climate change is also a price stability risk the second area where we can already make progress is on properly reflecting climate risks there s a growing awareness today that banks and financial institutions are exposed to material climate risks these include physical risks from natural disasters and climate change and they include risks from a disorderly climate transition these risks are not distinct because rising physical risks make a disorderly transition more likely a combination mark carney has termed the tragedy of the horizon so it s crucial that both the public and the private sector take these risks into account more systematically for instance by setting higher standards for climate risk disclosure we re already seeing progress in the private sector especially among large investors and france is leading the way at the country level the commission s green deal agenda sees european standards on disclosure being tabled in the course of 2020 at the ecb we will also do our part and we are already starting to promote climate risk disclosure across our range of tasks for example we re examining the disclosure standards we will need in order to incorporate climate issues into the risk assessment of our collateral framework ecb staff have also started working on a comprehensive climate risk stress testing framework which is due to be ready by the end of the year and our banking supervisors are assessing banks climate risk disclosures and examining how those risks should be embedded in the supervisory process this is an area where europe has an opportunity to lead the world both as a global standard setter and as a centre of green finance and this could support other policy goals the eu is already the largest international market for green bonds european entities account for around 50 of global issuance and around 44 of the global market is in euro as green finance grows it could provide another avenue through which to bolster the capital markets union and cement the euro s international role conclusion let me conclude the world is changing in ways that are challenging the certainties of the past it s a shifting environment for business and for policy but it s one that we can master the attitude we must strive for is one of cooperation without compromise being open to the world but assertive in defending our values and our interests that means forging ahead in fields that are vital to us like environmental sustainability it means taking steps to reduce our common vulnerabilities and increase our autonomy and it means working together as policymakers businesses and europeans if we are to strengthen the global standing of our currency we need our banks and our regulators to act in a european way if we are to fight climate change we need our large firms to be pioneers and leaders on disclosure and green investment this is an ambitious agenda but it s also in truth a self evident one we are all stakeholders in the future of europe and in the future of our planet the task ahead of us is clear and there s no time to lose thank you

her later telling reporters it was the courteous thing to do considering the alternative kayleigh mcenany trump s campaign spokeswoman said of pelosi her hatred for realdonaldtrump has blinded her to

the coronavirus outbreak grabbing the world s attention and which has likely wreaked havoc on its second largest economy is set to give safe haven currencies another lift over the coming month a reuters poll of market strategists found the virus which originated in china has left authorities across the globe grappling with how to stop its rapid spread and financial markets in disarray it was forecast to prop up safe havens like the japanese yen and swiss franc by 2 to 3 this month story continues below advertisement remove ad it is also set to keep the u s dollar which has dominated most others in foreign exchange markets for around two years on top into 2020 with half the analysts polled predicting it would last at least six months more that lined up with currency speculators who increased their bets in favour of the dollar for a second week according to data from the u s commodity futures trading commission as we speak there is no information suggesting that there has been any sort of peak in the coronavirus the only information that we ve got is that it is spreading to other countries said jane foley head of fx strategy at rabobank covid 19 vaccine frequently asked questions view more how does a vaccine work a vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection a vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future covid 19 infection but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely the good news is that sars cov 2 virus has been fairly stable which increases the viability of a vaccine how many types of vaccines are there there are broadly four types of vaccine one a vaccine based on the whole virus this could be either inactivated or an attenuated virus vaccine two a non replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of sars cov three nucleic acid vaccines that have genetic material like dna and rna of antigens like spike protein given to a person helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine and four protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of sars cov 2 along with an adjuvant booster is given as a vaccine what does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind vaccine development is a long complex process unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children pregnant women and the elderly so rigorous tests are compulsory history says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time view more show as long as the news flow is consistent with that i think it is very likely that the dollar the yen and swiss franc will remain well bid and emerging markets will be out of favor analysts said the u s dollar index calculated against a basket of six currencies and the japanese yen were both likely to gain a maximum of around 3 if the outbreak worsened the swiss franc was forecast to strengthen by close to 2 0 against the euro under the same circumstances all three are viewed as de facto safe haven currencies with the yen and franc the only major currencies to have made any gains against the dollar this year story continues below advertisement remove ad any increase in safe haven buying usually comes at the expense of emerging market assets after a brief run up in for riskier risky assets at the start of the year following an initial washington beijing trade deal the tide has turned again a majority of analysts 46 of 52 who answered a separate question said emerging market currencies were at significant risk of weakening over the next three months emerging markets benefit from low rates and easy money but they re very vulnerable to significant economic slowdown in the short term they are just getting knocked from pillar to post by the virus and by sentiment said kit juckes head of currency strategy at societe generale it is clear that the chinese economy is going to slow the chinese are going to use monetary policy and will probably have a period where resource prices industrial metals and oil prices are going to be under some pressure if you re in latin america you may think you re closer to america physically but you are probably closer to china economically but demand for safe haven currencies was not expected to last with most analysts predicting the dollar would lose against all major currencies over the next 12 months the euro the japanese yen the british pound and the swiss franc are forecast to chip away at the dollar s strength over the coming year the common currency and sterling were expected to lead the pack by gaining around 4 in a year s time followed by the yen which was forecast to gain over 1 5 from here while that view has been held for nearly two years there was a clear shift in the latest poll analysts who had repeatedly expected the dollar s dominance to last for six months at least were less confident twenty two of 50 said the dollar s strength was unlikely to carry on beyond the next six months the rest said six to 12 months or more than a year but the dependence of the global economy on the united states and the dollar s role as the world s reserve currency means any downside is most likely to be limited rabobank s foley said there will be inflows from emerging markets and other risky nations into the dollar in the near term but when those reverse she does not expect big moves in the opposite direction either yes we ve penciled in some slight weakening or moderate weakening of the dollar in our 12 month view because of the risk of a u s recession but i don t think those losses are going to be more than moderate

economists at the american farm bureau estimated that the trans pacific partnership tpp would have provided american producers over 4 billion annually in increased sales but president donald trump withdrew the u s from the agreement the 11 remaining countries formed a new tpp without the united states this allowed canada and australia to sell wheat and beef to japan on more favorable terms than the united states trump had lost markets for u s producers and desperately needed to negotiate an agreement with japan to fill the hole he had created however the u s japan agreement does not completely cover what the u s had gained in the original tpp and we lost short term and potentially long term markets to canada and australia during the two years we were negotiating with japan thus trump was only able to partially fill the hole he had created the north america free trade agreement s nafta biggest flaw was the lack of a requirement for mexico to raise its labor standards this error has impacted immigration and moved u s jobs to mexico over the last 25 years trump s negotiated united states mexico canada agreement usmca did not correct this error house speaker nancy pelosi and richard neal s nine member committee negotiated an increase in mexico s labor standards the success of those negotiations resulted in a dramatically improved usmca pelosi s usmca moved the three countries toward fair trade with improved labor standards for mexico additional environmental commitments decreased power for multinational corporations and increased benefits for the middle class in all three countries the u s china phase 1 agreement culminates two devastating years for american producers trump had to use 28 billion in taxpayer dollars to prevent a complete wreck in the agricultural economy due to lost markets in china even with 28 billion from the u s taxpayers american agriculture is still experiencing record bankruptcies and suicides not seen since the devastating 1980s grain prices were on the low end of the price cycle when trump slapped tariffs on china and they retaliated in kind against american agriculture however we generally move from the low end of the price cycle to the high end when two major weather disasters occur and supply is reduced the drought in australia and the very wet spring in the u s would have moved us to higher prices but the increased supply due to lack of demand from china prevented that from happening trump substituted two very bad years in regards to price for what could have been two years of decent prices what did we gain from this tremendous sacrifice trump emphasizes that the phase 1 agreement states that china will buy 40 billion in ag products for each of the next two years much more than they have ever bought before china emphasizes that per the agreement they will buy to fill their market needs at global competitive prices as required by the world trade organization wto during the two years of the tariff war with the united states china has diversified their sourcing of agricultural products and has assured these sources that they will continue to buy from them it appears highly unlikely that china will buy 40 billion per year in ag products from the u s in the next two years to enforce the 40 billion per year trump would have to increase tariffs on china this would likely lead to a decline in the stock market prior to the election which trump does not want to occur thus after two devastating years we are right back where we were before tariffs with china buying to fulfill their market needs at competitive prices once again trump s rash actions dug a hole for american producers and this time trump claimed victory by simply stopping the digging of course he could start digging again if he attempts to enforce the agreement with additional tariffs ron de yong was director of agriculture for montana for over nine years taught agricultural policy and economics at cal poly state university for seven years and operated a family farm in kalispell for over 30 years

to reunify a polarized peninsula complex warfare with korean characteristics thomas a drohan introduction using concepts of complex warfare from previous swj articles on china and japan this article applies the same holistic approach to korean security strategies in the information environment with comparisons to strategies from china and japan to discern how the koreas wage complex warfare using both cooperation and confrontation today we ll start with world view threat assessment and combined effects strategy understanding these aspects of the information environment is critical to producing superior effects the great results test of any power or actor korea s world view threat assessment and combined effects strategy world view both koreas share a common world view that attends to main power alignment while emphasizing self reliance each of these considerations refracts differently in the contrasting political systems of totalitarian north korea and democratic south korea the historical context of this world view remains extremely influential today for five thousand years inhabitants of the korean peninsula have dealt with prying neighbors through strategies of cooperation and confrontation predatory powers are fixtures in a korean information environment where peninsular alignment or alliance is seen as pivotal to neighborly calculations of security location and neighbors matter korean civilization developed in between expansionist empires and nation states consequently korean rulers have had to manage multiple centers of power to eke out sovereignty korean society is a resilient fabric one that has been repeatedly stretched torn and repaired in response to foreign invasions and occupations the rugged peninsula and outlying islands have been contentious territory among the koreas china russia japan and western powers main power alignment in describing the pragmatic practice of aligning with a major power the term sadaejuui attending to the big power is popularly evoked the meaning is often derisive its contemporary use tends to portray major powers condescending attitudes toward koreans with the latter having to placate the major powers dating back to korean dynasties as tributaries of chinese empires the connotation is that of being controlled after resisting and ultimately giving in to a stronger power in the late 19th century choson dynasty for instance there were two main political parties the sadae main power party in korea was status quo which prior to japan s defeat of china in the sino japanese war 1894 1895 meant pro china the domestic opposition was the reformist and pro japan kaehwa enlightenment party for korean leaders successfully managing the influence of a foreign power meant aligning with another power in their midst foreign interference remains a contentious issue today this utilitarian ethic of aligning with a main power clashes with other societal beliefs from neo confucianism and religious principles to community based populism pride in national autonomy stores intense feelings and fuels outrage which power ought to be confronted and which accommodated if any which parties factions and individuals can be trusted and under what conditions how can sovereignty be protected and reconciled with the interests of resented foreign powers these questions test deeply held concerns and convictions in korean society in both north and south korea sadaejuui characterizes a fundamental practice of korean security no official documents admit the term in contrast to this grudgingly recognized national interest self reliance is an ingrained value self reliance in north korea self reliance is officially known as juche a vague concept designed to legitimize the kim dynasty apart from its monolithic role as kim il sung ism juche s tangible facets include revenue generating activities pyongyang actively promotes money laundering narcotics smuggling counterfeiting human trafficking illegal weapons sales and other lucrative crimes tragically hate generating propaganda covers for the lack of national self reliance with respect to basic needs such as food water shelter health and electricity since the massive famine of the mid 1990s north koreans self reliance includes the not so secret embrace of illicit private capitalism in south korea assorted conceptions of self reliance float freely about from the traditional jagileul uijihaneun depending on oneself to business diversification strategies jageub ui self sufficiency to self absorbed honjok loner tribe korean cultural narratives on both sides of the de militarized zone emphasize confucian principles such as loyalty resolve harmony and justice priorities begin with the family ties that help manage life s challenges figurative analogies describe the environment as interrelated opposites um light hot and yang dark cold people are expected to accept the immutable and shape the changeable confrontation is natural a practical complement to cooperation achieving that relative harmony has been a continuous national struggle against the oft reminded 900 invasions 117 a cultivated heritage of having borne the brunt of injustices reinforces societal awareness of vulnerability and the need to compete korean ancestry includes a minjok ethnic nation identity rooted in a strong and just legendary founder king tangun mythical equivalent to china s emperors claiming a mandate of heaven and japan s sun goddess amaterasu another identity is minjung the people which conjures up populist struggles against oppression both constructs promote a self reliance imbued with values of resilience and endurance to build a strong nation capable of facing down threats threat assessment the main threat to koreans has been external invasion in the forms of chinese control russian and western probes and japanese colonization koreans have assessed foreign powers from a frame of sadaejuui and self reliance countering threats has involved both confrontation and cooperation invasions invasions of korean territory date back to china s han dynasty in 109 bc a period of aggressive expansion following the qin dynasty s unification of warring states in 221 bc sui and tang dynasty emperors launched several campaigns to subdue koreans during a period of three korean kingdoms silla paekche koguryo 57 bc 668 this contested history stirs a textbook war today koreans arguably first unified dynasty silla 668 935 was followed by koryo 935 1392 and choson 1392 1910 each dynasty confronted and cooperated with chinese russian and japanese empires to win sovereign prerogatives china s yuan dynasty mongols led invasions of korea in 1231 imposing indirect control that subjugation was followed by china s ming dynasty suzerainty until 1644 large scale japanese invasions 1592 1597 were eventually defeated however the manchus defeat of the ming brought the qing dynasty to china 1644 1912 and new invasions to choson japan s defeat of qing china in 1895 and russia in 1905 led to outright colonization of the korean peninsula 1910 1945 the stream of invasions has left indelible marks on the korean psyche as a way to characterize their impact we refer to two types of threat patterns they are described in terms of being viewed from outside the peninsula inward and then from the inside out patterns the basic outside in threat pattern has been external powers exploiting lack of domestic unity in korea to dominate the peninsula or deny it to their rivals here are a few examples from modern history great britain blocked a russian navy attempt to establish a base on tsushima island in 1861 china restricted russian diplomatic access in korea until 1884 japan defeated china 1895 115 118 and russia 1905 154 155 colonizing korea until 1945 the ussr and us accepted japan s surrender separately to occupy korea in halves 1945 in 1945 korean efforts to reunify their country evaporated in new big power disagreements the moscow agreement december 1945 had planned a five year trusteeship of four external powers the us ussr china and great britain however the joint us ussr commission charged with implementing the moscow agreement was very much the arena of ideological warfare the soviets refused to include non communist groups in the formation of a provisional korean government they subsequently rejected united nations resolution 112 which called for general elections to express the will of the korean people instead moscow reached in to groom kim il sung a soviet army anti japanese guerrilla fighter in manchuria as their proxy in pyongyang with russian support kim out maneuvered rivals to head the korean workers party and become premier of the democratic republic of north korea in the south united nations monitored elections brought anti communist rhee syng man into power as the first president of the republic of korea rhee had prepared by leading the provisional korean provisional government in shanghai while in exile 1919 1939 mostly from hawaii the basic inside out threat pattern has been koreans focusing on their common former colonizer and seeking externally favorable conditions to reunite the peninsula both korean leaders saw japan and each other as threats to a unified korea and sought reunification on their own terms kim il sung was necessarily aligned with the ussr josef stalin and prudently chose to curry china s favor mao zedong as well kim regarded us support of the south as the next greatest threat he garnered stalin s support under a wary assumption of no us intervention 33 34 rhee suffered the cost of perceived dealignment from his presumed patron power the united states south korea appeared isolated from outside support after us secretary of state dean acheson described a defensive perimeter excluding the korean peninsula within six months kim il sung invaded the south june 1950 ironically acheson s comments may have been calibrated to gain congressional approval for korean aid armistice both korean leaders saw japan and each other as threats to a unified korea and craved reunification on their own terms kim il sung necessarily aligned with the ussr josef stalin and currying china s favor mao zedong regarded us support of the south as the next greatest threat he garnered stalin s support under a wary assumption of no us intervention 33 34 rhee suffered the cost of perceived dealignment from his presumed protector the united states within six months of us secretary of state dean acheson s press club remark that described a defensive perimeter excluding the korean peninsula kim il sung invaded the south june 1950 ironically acheson s comments may have been calibrated to gain congressional approval for korean aid after three years of fighting that saw chinese forces save north korea from outright defeat a military armistice stopped most hostilities in 1953 no peace treaty was signed while rhee pointlessly rejected the armistice 38 kim blamed wartime failures on conspirators and methodically consolidated his power by eliminating externally aligned domestic factions ever since north korea s kim led syndicate has used every opportunity to eliminate domestic threats and manipulate main power rivalries south korean leaders have taken variable approaches to domestic threats and managed main power relations with non coercive methods next we describe each korea s assessment of threat in turn note that there is no mutual diplomatic recognition between north korea and south korea each state claims to be the sole legitimate government on the peninsula north korea north korea is notorious for using violence to create and control threats a congressional research service report tallies thousands of armed infiltrations at least three presidential assassination attempts nearly 500 kidnappings two large scale bombings assorted murders of south korean civilians and military personnel politically timed missile launches and nuclear detonations and threats to devastate south korea japan and the united states add to that the kim regime s use of force against its own citizens 100 000 political prisoners in labor camps and massive human rights violations pyongyang s violent blend of sadaejuui and self reliance is manifested in the foreign policy behavior of its three successive kims kim il sung great leader posthumously eternal president his eldest son kim jong il dear leader posthumously eternal general secretary and his youngest son kim jong un 2011

threats via integration include the northeast asia plus community of responsibility new northern policy and new southern policy as the kim dynasty to the north builds its nuclear capability south koreans also debate the possibility of an independent nuclear deterrent combined effects strategy as a reminder of the complex warfare model introduced previously the following diagram depicts the eight basic types of effects interacting among sentient actors in the information environment these effects are cooperative dissuade persuade secure induce and confrontational deter compel defend coerce each desired effect may be brought about using any instrument of power diplomatic informational military economic social in comparison to 17 chinese and two japanese cases of combined effects discussed in earlier papers we consider two inter related korean examples from a common perspective of achieving reunification a north korea nuclear and complex threats north korea south korea us china japan 1953 now b south korea occupation of dokdo japan takeshima 1952 now and ieodo china suyan 1987 now both cases reflect korean struggles to achieve a reunification this assumption requires a caveat in south korea where globalization is reducing some incentives for reunification increasingly south koreans favor peaceful coexistence over reunification with a reactionary regime in north korea party propaganda exhorts an inured population to sacrifice for reunification many factors affect reunification such as main power alignments various forms of self reliance territorial disputes financial costs all domain weapons programs economic development and transnational linkages to account for this complexity yet also recommend decisions we analyze the cases in three parts historical background of each case combined effects strategy of north korea and south korea and interacting strategies of north korea south korea the united states china japan and russia historical background a north korean nuclear and complex threats in november of 1950 five months after north korea s invasion of the south chairman kim il sung absorbed president harry truman s threat to consider using atomic weapons the subsequent lack of us will to use the weapon that ended the pacific war and china s will to massively intervene with ground troops led to the armistice 1953 within a decade the soviet union had provided north korea technical training and a nuclear research reactor this effort was followed in 1964 by china s first nuclear weapon detonation by then all foreign troops except technical advisors had left north korea with domestic room to maneuver two developments pushed kim to achieve an independent nuclear capability first there were ideological differences among pyongyang purges of pro china soviet communists moscow de stalinization perestroika and glasnost nationalist capitalism and beijing post mao reforms nationalist socialist capitalism north korea s main patrons were developing politically and economically second both main powers were unreliable as allies the ussr was non committal china was difficult to work with on an equal basis and neither supported another north korean attempt at reunification in south korea leaders generally desired closer ties with american democratic capitalism all wanted an in place tripwire that committed the us to defending against another north korean invasion the same resident us influence however presented a problematic image of obliging us interests too much any alignment with us policy was subject to criticism for being too much sadaejuui and not enough self reliance us pressure for instance had prevented south korea from acquiring nuclear weapons seemingly locking seoul into a permanent us military presence in contrast the non resident ussr then non resident but closeby china actively supported north korea s nuclear program in addition both communist regimes enacted domestic reforms that kim ism would not so even though russian ties never included commitments to actually defend north korea moscow s socialist credentials remain important to pyongyang in 1989 chairman mikhail gorbachev s policy reversal that demanded north korea pay market prices for soviet oil shocked north korea s command economy however it was the specter of russian liberalization that kim saw as the greater threat similarly china s peace treaty with south korea 1992 shocked north korea diplomatically however it was beijing s post tiananmen massacre reforms that mattered more to kim the reforms strengthened communist party control of state capitalism a fix that suited pyongyang s first special economic zone rason 1991 designed to attract foreign investment in both cases the absence of chinese and soviet tripwire forces in north korea itself a deliberate kim policy designed to prevent foreign influence provided pyongyang more domestic freedom of action this domestic space empowered kim to manipulate both great powers using all instruments of national power north korea has used that maneuver space to break every agreement it has signed and to develop weapons of mass effects the payloads are nuclear biological chemical high explosive and cyber information see the arms control association s chronology of nuclear and missile programs here beginning with the 1985 non proliferation treaty up to its current pledge to denuclearize and stop long range missile tests north korea s record is to threaten promise dare demand deny and deceive all while conceding nothing in return meanwhile pyongyang continues to develop and leverage nuclear weapons biological weapons chemical weapons high explosive missiles and cyber theft kim jong un is positioned to demand an end to economic sanctions and retention of his nuclear weapons capability north korean strategy is poised to use nuclear weapons as much more than weapons of mass destruction there are many effects that do not risk retaliatory destruction mass effects weapons are part of pyongyang s basic cause and prevent strategy a cause confrontation among main powers primarily the us and china and to a lesser degree russia and japan b to prevent domestic intervention by any main power this strategy aims to ensure the kim dynasty s survival as an independent korean regime capable of achieving reunification b south korea s occupation of dokdo and ieodo since 1954 a year after us forces stopped using dokdo as a bombing range south korean forces have occupied its two small main islands located 135 miles east of the korean peninsula south korea s dokdo research institute proclaims ten truths about dokdo not known in japan the basis for these claims are ancient references to an island claimed to be dokdo followed by settlers in ulleungdo who named the rocks dok stone french russian british and japanese passers by also name claimed them 75 as liancourt rocks 1849 olivutsa rocks 1854 hornet rocks 1855 and takeshima 1905 respectively japan s ministry of foreign affairs makes detailed claims about takeshima dokdo dating back to the mid 17th century all of which are rejected by south korea s ministry of foreign affairs either as a matter for negotiation or for judicial settlement ieodo is a submerged rock where the claimed exclusive economic zones of china and south korea overlap the spot is 93 miles southwest of south korea s mara island and 178 miles from china s yushan island while the south korean government proposes that the midpoint be based on respective coastlines china s authoritarian regime insists on factoring in population and length of coastline just as dokdo is wrapped up in japan s colonization of south korea ieodo s context re signals imperial china s control over korean territory south korea s placement of a plaque 1951 and beacon 1987 and construction of an oceanographic research facility 2001 and helipad 2003 enable a degree of operational control seoul proactively deters and fiercely defends against illegal chinese fishing no doubt intensified by chinese economic and territorial designs on north korea china s threats to use force to block south korean forces from exercising in its own territorial waters 302 with us forces add to seoul s well founded suspicion north korea s coercion infusion strategy the chart below provides examples of north korean dimes wide all domain effects and activities that generate them these combinations of effects largely coerce domestic and main power targets in the following pattern dimes elements are capitalized to highlight instruments of power diplomatically north korea compels and coerces adversaries and persuades and induces partners tools for coercion tend to be provocations that threaten military actions or provide territorial access tools for persuasion generally consist of diatribes and visits backed by diplomatic bag bribes coercion is ever present infused information is crafted to compel and coerce adversaries and persuade partners diplomatic and informational coercion are force multiplier infusions for state sponsored crime to induce economic transactions and investment domestically authorities social persuasion is less purely ideological as in kim il sung s day and more pragmatic the proliferation of market exchanges and portable foreign information chapter 2 competes with payoffs nepotism and surveillance technology external social persuasion directed toward foreign actors seems limited to the provision of labor where that is risked against un sanctions table 1 north korea dimes wide all domain effects south korea s inducement led strategy south korean effects and activities are relatively ad hoc except for military deterrence and defense which have been deliberately planned and well sustained seoul musters combinations of effects in the following pattern diplomacy is persuasive when dialogues policies and information shape main powers interests tools for persuasion include a globalizing economy cultural social appeal and activities that enhance both peninsular and continental security information campaigns persuade actors of seoul s resolve with respect to territorial integrity dialogue based reunification and global economic competition military deterrence and defense focus more narrowly on territorial threats even as diplomatic informational and economic effects broaden in geographic scope externally directed social effects are a product of south korea s economic success and talent in contrast to north korea south korea s domestic social foundation is becoming multi racial pyongyang s racist nationalism seeks to exploit this demographic as if it were a vulnerability table 2 south korea dimes wide all domain effects interacting strategies using our description of patterns and details from the two tables above we anticipate how korean strategies interact in terms of effects first let s identify best current and future synergies best synergies north korea s current synergy is to coercively envelop south korea s military deterrence and defense with broader effects while controlling information in north korea and exploiting divisions among relevant powers the latter are south korea the us japan china and russia pyongyang is executing this strategy of manufactured hostility the overall combination of external envelopment and exploitation and internal protection creates opportunities to out maneuver main powers and build a degree of self reliance juche juche has been an economic failure in providing basic necessities but a success with respect to the ability to punish people this depraved punishment is a tragic form of self reliance that ordinary north koreans bear table 1 provides examples of how pyongyang elites combine these various cooperative and confrontational effects of compellence inducement persuasion and coercion nuclear and other mass effects weapons enable north korea s strategy but the critical element is information control the kim regime s ideology relies on near total control of information a problematic requirement we can expect any decentralized engagement therefore to be regarded as a threat that assessment is a strategic vulnerability to the extent that resilient command and control relies on distributed authorities to out compete adversary strategies future kim cronyism will need to be flexible such as promoting initiative within its narrative while tolerating self interested loyalty the expansion of private markets is a potential indicator of such informal flexibility even though it departs from kim il sung ism given this ideological contradiction we can expect to see an expansion of delegated authority among trusted elites to extend the regime s monitoring of information this broadened oversight may accommodate more cooperation and less confrontation kim jong un appears to be doing this as new and formerly corrupt practices stretch his power base south korea s ideal synergy would be if seoul and washington agreed on combining cooperative and confrontational effects such as a sunshine policy with non negotiable alliance exercises that type of combination has been rare and temporary instead we see seoul policies that partly suit washington priorities and partly accommodate north korean and chinese priorities such as us south korea military exercises in rote scenarios the north massively invades the south again that do not address ongoing threats from china russia and north korea cyber attacks political interference military incursions therefore seoul s best future oriented combined effect is to globally induce pyongyang to conform to international norms by expanding economic and political engagement around north korea engagement with north korea should occur in a global rather than exclusively bilateral context engage to shape networks actors that flaunt international norms while mouthing them such as china under xi and russia under putin are the main challenge table 2 contains examples of how seoul can generate such a northern policy type effect via all tools persuasion military deterrence and defense and economic inducements our next section answers the question how will pyongyang s coercive envelopment interact with seoul s global inducement coercion meets inducement for north korea the coercive envelopment that it takes to out compete south korean global inducement requires economic modernization and unprecedented control over information achieving total control of the domestic information environment even for the kim regime is not possible if contested let s see why under the kim 3 regime so far north korea s envelopment strategy relies on two major activities first the strategy foments main power rivalries to counter and circumvent the south korea us alliance s military deterrence and defense a rising china can limit us power projection however from north korea s standpoint this is not preferable to us military superiority china not the us claims territory also claimed by north korea gando mount paektu yalu and tumen rivers and the yellow sea whether china or the united states has the advantage in a particular domain is not as relevant to pyongyang as keeping main power rivalries simmering a military standoff among main powers and a nuclear north korea leaves pyongyang more room for diplomatic and information maneuver if pyongyang succeeds in eliminating economic sanctions with the support of china and russia its options expand a limited north korean nuclear capability does not change that calculation with respect to nuclear armed main powers though it might create a new one japan if tokyo were to consider a nuclear deterrent that controversy would also provide pyongyang more opportunities to divide the main powers second pyongyang must prevent north korean elites and the public from accessing more and more information the former may be bought off but the population cannot be compensated or suppressed as portable technologies provide access to more sources of information economic development creates more information financial trade manufacturing and services all potential sources of power although north korea does not have restless minorities as in china pyongyang easily could have a restless majority as expectations exceed incentives how the kim regime s envelopment strategy requires more information and more control to out perform main powers kim s top down orchestration of diplomacy information and military activities relies on information dominance at home the social foundation for this environment is uncontested domestic control eliminating economic sanctions to open opportunities for growth can undermine pyongyang s control even if it also feeds a mass effects arsenal pyongyang will be forced to modernize its control of domestic information while chinese and russian information controls certainly provide different techniques for repression the technologies can be contested in ways that are difficult to stop as pyongyang continues to foment main power rivalries and tighten domestic control over information technology the need for economic integration becomes acute increasingly competitive economies need instantly transparent access to information criminal economies such as north korea s can be reduced via international enforcement self reliance in nuclear capability however may be possible how does pyongyang s coercion plus strategy compare to seoul s strategy of global inducement as with most democracies south korea struggles to maintain a consistent or coherent policy over time a global inducement strategy however can exploit the trends it helps create in this respect political and economic engagement on the eurasian continent and throughout the indo pacific are critical to surrounding north korea with korean branded success the sustained set of combined effects detailed in table 2 can out perform north korea s coercion heavy hand with its greater breadth and depth inducement can prevail over coercion as long as seoul has a credible military deterrent and defense economic growth is key to sustaining the strategy south korea s economy is capable of increasing its defense outlays to provide a convincing conventional superiority pyongyang elites know this political will however has been variable the military aspect of us south korean relations has indeed provided credible capability and leadership seoul needs nuclear deterrence extended us or organic the us extended deterrent can continue to underwrite south korea s economic success at a domestic political cost of self reliance and main power alignment yet strategic effects that result in desired north korean behavior matter most in that regard the economic growth and military alliance have not prevented nuclearization a better approach is to coordinate a synergistic strategy that involves all instruments of power global inducement requires expansive diplomatic and economic engagement which in turn requires more than peninsular deterrence and defense the military alliance with the us has enabled south korea s economic and technological development and promoted democratic civil military relationships for the us the benefits of the alliance are also dimes wide and should be appreciated from that broad perspective what types of military activities can combine with what types of non military activities to cause north korean de nuclearization a superior strategy of south korean global inducement is the place to start conclusions our holistic approach to strategy in the information environment considered how the koreas wage effective complex warfare through cooperation and confrontation we applied a common world view to both koreas main power alignment sadaejuui and self reliance juche and freely formed concepts that blends pragmatic interests with socially conditioned values this korean worldview refracts through starkly different political economic systems that struggle to retain sovereignty amidst interventionist powers reunification remains a common goal of north and south korea but on vastly different terms and specific conceptions of threat threat assessments which historically have been directed against invasions and domestic interference by main powers reflect strongly contested narratives narratives shape social perceptions and contain assumptions about enduring threats to korean sovereignty north korea s violent mix of sadaejuui and juche creates threats that underpin a cultish ideology of sole source rule self reliance is supposed to reinforce exclusive trust in us the kim family this construction of permanent threats selectively draws from a history of predatory powers the social manufacturing of threats is rigidly intolerant of domestic dissent to the extent that the kim regime is uncontested at home it is therefore free to manipulate main power relations this in turn helps preserve its idiosyncratic rule and set more conditions for reunification south korea s blend of sadaejuui and self reliance has been externally non violent and internally transformative economic success protected by credible military alliance with a main power the us has fueled a vibrant democracy and globalizing economy as a result seoul s main power alignment has broadened to include positive relations with all main powers self reliance is networked a business practice that generates diverse strategies to deal with competitive threats the combined effects strategies of the two koreas reflect these disparate approaches to assessing threats north korea seeks to coercively envelop the south korea us alliance with a two pronged approach pyongyang attempts to 1 compel and induce adversaries via provocations that threaten coercion and 2 persuade and induce partners via territorial access and illicit transactions that enrich its loyal elite domestically control over information sells a racist nationalism as morally legitimate south korea s strategy is one of global inducement seoul attempts to persuade and induce adversaries and partners via a globalizing economy and cultural appeal military alliance with the us deters and defends against the use of force on south korean territory a multi racial society is beginning to emerge one that will transform south korean identity in a complex domestic and global context comparing both strategies pyongyang is executing its best synergy of coop frontation while seoul either cooperates or confronts us efforts to do the same are seldom in step relative to the south the north has been able to orchestrate diplomatic informational military economic and social activities that seize the initiative and shape future outcomes the south s strategy creates its own synergistic effects but struggles to sustain them over the long term due to changing political priorities what can be done recommendations as the two strategies interact seoul s global inducement can prevail over pyongyang s coercive envelopment by exploiting the north s basic dilemma north korea s core problem is that it must simultaneously modernize its system of controlling domestic information and manipulate main powers the kim regime s authoritarianism creates a dilemma of undesirable alternatives a politically risky modernization or b increasing dependence on modernizing main powers whether north korea achieves both authoritarian modernization and national independence is not a matter of self reliance the outcome depends upon the strategies of other powers we propose the following two options for south korea and the united states first seoul and washington should agree on maintaining economic sanctions as long as pyongyang refuses to de nuclearize economic sanctions accelerate the kim regime s need to embrace capitalist reforms even if in corrupt forms sooner or later however a sunshine inspired south korean president will relax economic sanctions in the hope that the north will eventually de nuclearize this risky step might be insured by the technological feasibility of a countervailing south korean nuclear deterrent second seoul and washington should agree on how to cooperate with and confront north korea china and russia this politically ambitious course can induce the dilemma of north korean strategy the effort could combine the moon administration s new northern policy and the trump administration s and japan s abe administration s free and open indo pacific foip concepts converting these policies into effective strategies would require operationalizing them in terms of specific effects such as inducement for instance the foip vision of ensuring peace and security 22 23 by protecting the maritime domain should include exercises that develop capabilities to induce territorial withdrawal not just to deter and defend against territorial invasion this nuance means orchestrating military actions in concert with diplomatic informational economic and social activities in a similar fashion the new northern policy should specify what it intends to prevent and what it intends to cause in terms of inducing behavior broader relationships need to be considered as well such as the south korea china japan summit the us japan alliance and the australia india japan us quad building options along the eurasian pacific edge can help moderate the periodic rupturing of south korea japan relations that pyongyang is keen to exploit in comparison to north korea s dilemma south korea s dilemma is not between undesirable modernization and undesirable over dependence on main powers south korea s dilemma is between a an increasingly distinct south korean nation state compared to north korea and b a reunified korean state of two nations both of these alternatives are undesirable to different groups in south korea option a is where south koreans are today dealing with the world s most authoritarian regime armed with nuclear weapons bent on coercive reunification option b will require significant financial costs political reforms and unprecedented cooperation among main powers however a reunified korea could become a global power in its own right seoul s inducement strategy is a characteristic pathway to that goal a combined

us futures and european stocks gained and treasuries tanked as virus optimism ran wild on reports that a key breakthrough was made in the search for a coronavirus cure markets are still primarily focused on the coronavirus and today s news that h i v and flu drugs show promise in treating the coronavirus will keep the risk on rally going strong china s health commission lead researcher li lanjuan will propose the combination of arbidol and darunavir as the latest version of the government s treatment plan li did not specify how many patients have been successfully treated with the combination therapy uk scientists are also claiming a significant vaccine breakthrough delivering another boost in the overall positive sentiment it seems the world is nearing a cure for the coronavirus and that could mean markets may only need to price in only one bad quarter of data for china financial markets may get overly optimistic on these early headlines but the playbook remains once wall street is beyond the virus risky assets will remain supported on central bank stimulus and the global growth rebound story us stocks did come down slightly from the pre market highs after the who reiterated that there has been no known breakthrough in the treatment to date the who will hold a press conference at 10 00 am est safe havens while researchers will embrace the breakthroughs made in treating the virus they would say it is still too early to assess the overall effectiveness with us stocks almost recovering all of the declines from coronavirus led selloff safe havens are likely to give back a majority their gains both gold and treasuries are getting sold on optimism the virus was contained and that researchers are getting closer to finding a cure treasury yields are higher across the board with the 10 year yield jumping 3 8 basis points to 1 637 the yield curve between the three month and 10 year is no longer inverted and many economists may feel this recent inversion may end up being a false alarm for a recession like the ones in 1966 and 1998 gold volatility will remain in place as investors need to rebalance their reasons for holding onto the precious metal the latest virus breakthrough news is bearish for gold prices but it does bring the focus back to the global growth rebound story of 2020 which could eventually lead to a weaker dollar gold may lose its recent gains that stemmed from coronavirus concerns but the longer term outlook will be attractive as european recovery could finally lead to a stronger euro thus weaker dollar oil oil s bloodbath could be over after researchers announce the breakthrough in creating a coronavirus vaccine energy traders might start pricing a return to normalcy in chinese demand for crude in the second quarter scientists will need a lot more time to test and confirm the recent breakthroughs but west texas intermediate crude might not wait to retest the mid 50s as optimism will run high that the demand shock for crude is nearing an end if opec is smart they would take this opportunity to deliver a short term commitment of deeper production cuts opec was set to respond if oil prices collapsed even further but they should not use today s positive news to punt the decision even if no additional cuts are outlined today oil prices could remain bid latam latin america will have a nice open as emerging markets are rallying across the board on hopes china is nearing a solution for treating the coronavirus brazil assets will have a strong day as optimism will grow that china their biggest trading partner might see a return to normalcy as early as next quarter in trade brazil s recent trade deficit is likely to be temporary as we should see a rebound with their exports once trade returns closer to normal with china colombia will also remain one of the most attractive investments in latam the economy is strong in colombia and the central bank remains optimistic that they will even be able to deliver a 25 basis point rate hike by the end of the year the colcap could continue resume its climb back to highs set in early january argentina s situation remains ugly argentina needs to restructure 100 billion in sovereign debt to creditors while combatting inflation above 50 and currency in freefall president alberto fernandez s government will keep capitol controls in place and continue to impose price freezes the peso is stabilizing but too many risks remain to keep a confident trade that it will continue rebounding

spread the love zimbabwe poverty indices are the highest in sadc high cost of utilities especially electricity charges have gone out of control fuel is out of reach and industry is grinding to a halt for me this is real implosion the real economy has long been decimated and what we are dealing with are remnants of the once vibrant economy which used to be the bread basket of africa with a strong currency stronger than the usd in 1980 yet despite our economic malaise we still have a huge potential of exponential growth if we do the right things we are the most educated country in africa and proud owners of vast mineral wealth and natural resources above all the educated youth bulge is a demographic dividend despite the closure of democratic space and the trampling of people s freedoms and rights our country can rise again if we all put the country first understanding the problem is fine but let us focus more on solutions in terms of alternative solutions we propose the following 1 political governance institutional and economic reforms to create a conducive environment leading to peace stability confidence and economic growth zanu pf and ed must show leadership and magnanimity they must take responsibility for failing to run government and causing the economic free fall to date it is in the interest of the country for ed to unite and galvanize the nation it is now common cause that adv nelson chamisa the mdc president garnered 2 6 million votes in the 2018 elections and he carries this mass base and support with him he cannot be ignored in the governance and leadership equation of the country that will be equivalent to committing the ostrich s offence so the issue of legitimacy should be addressed through an honest national dialogue 2 domestic and foreign investment is required because growth is constrained by capital deficiencies the private sector desperately needs lines of credit let us remove all barriers 3 harnessing and mobilizing domestic sources of revenue is key the low hanging fruit is tourism which has the potential to raise usd 1 billion in receipts per annum the next low hanging fruit is beneficiation and value addition of raw materials and minerals which has the potential to raise usd 10 billion per annum the third low hanging fruit is fighting corruption which has the potential to recover and lock in usd 20 billion per annum 4 policy consistency can assist in building confidence 5 addressing the currency and exchange rate conundrum should be given key priority simultenous with the building of foreign currency reserves at the reserve bank for purposes of macroeconomic stability zimbabwe needs a stable currency which is a store of value for as long as we do not produce the zim dollar will remain a destabilizing force in the economy the alternative is to redollarize for a time bound period in order to stabilize prices after all the economy has since self dollarized 6 the diaspora should be offered financial and economic incentives so they can institutionalize their remittances 7 the budget deficit must always be kept under lock and key there is a temptation under sovereign currencies to print money for seigniorage revenue the monetary policy committee must vaccinate itself against the monetization of the deficit and abuse of the central bank overdraft 8 the central bank must be given monetary policy independence but should guard itself against quasi fiscal operations which are slowly creeping in 9 parastatal reforms are difficult to implement i think there should be established a parastatals reform commission to replace sera which is arguably failing to usher reforms and instil financial discipline and good corporate governance 10 dealing with the public service and social sectors which are burning zimbabwe has to deal with a deep humanitarian crisis in the urban areas in regard to the quality of healthcare services hospitals have no drugs or equipment medical personnel is demoralized and hospitals are now death chambers 11 an urgent zimbabwe conference is required to raise new capital to strengthen the budget and attract official development assistance 12 zimbabwe should engage the paris club for consideration under the highly indebted poor countries hipic this is a practical plan to deal with arrears and debt zim has no capacity to service its debts 13 pro poor policies and social safety nets are necessary to protect the vulnerable social base austerity has never succeeded in africa because it is not a developmental strategy austerity is not human centred it is inspired by the discredited neo liberal washington consensus it is not progressive 14 drought mitigation should be implemented in a non partisan manner throughout the country s 10 provinces food aid is being distributed on party lines food is used as a political weapon why are development agencies not seeing this ploy 15 zimbabwe must invest in its infrastructure this sector has potential to create jobs investment in renewable energy should be prioritized 16 restoration of agriculture and the rural economy is key to the recovery of this agro based economy zim must work out a viable pricing policy for agricultural products and ratchet up new markets innovation and mechanization will be boosted by irrigation 17 the country should preserve peace and stability at all times and threat and menace of mashurugwis should be confronted 18 local government is a key arm of government in this regard devolution must happen now development of communities and service delivery can be facilitated through devolution 19 priority should be given to water and sanitation hygiene wash in urban and rural areas 20 the beitbridge harare chirundu highway is of national strategic importance this highway carries 90 of zimbabwean trade the road forms a greater part of the north south corridor and is important under the african continental free trade area afcfta conclusion we urge all zimbabweans at home and in the diaspora to consider and examine our alternative working proposals in the form of the the zimbabwe we want 20 point plan by the grace of god zimbabwe can be

summary in his 2020 address to congress president donald trump stretched and distorted the facts trump claimed the economy is the best it has ever been but gdp growth fell to 2 3 last year and economists predict further slowing this year he said he brought about low unemployment by reversing years of economic decay and failed economic policies when in fact over 1 million more jobs were added in the 35 months before he took office than in the first 35 months since trump boasted that the unemployment rate for women reached the lowest level in almost 70 years that s true but it had been trending down for several years before he took office the president wrongly said after decades of flat and falling incomes wages are rising fast they ve gone up under trump but also have risen under the last several presidents trump claimed that people s 401 k s and pensions have increased 60 70 80 90 and 100 and even more some may have but that s far higher than the average he said real median household income is now at the highest level ever recorded however the census bureau noted that was partly due to a change in survey questions in 2014 based on adjusted figures median household income was slightly higher in 1999 than in 2018 trump claimed the new trade agreement with canada and mexico will create nearly 100 000 auto jobs but an independent federal commission puts the job gains at 28 000 over five years the president boasted t hat a long tall and very powerful wall is being built along the southern border and more than 100 miles have been completed but only one mile is located where no barriers previously existed trump said illegal crossings at the southwest border are down 75 since may but total apprehensions in 2019 were 81 higher than in 2016 the year before trump took office he said that after losing 60 000 factories under the previous two administrations america has now gained 12 000 new factories under my administration he s referring to what the bureau of labor statistics calls manufacturing establishments and most of the growth under trump has been in facilities with fewer than five employees trump compared apples to oranges in claiming a doubling of insurance premiums in five years before he took office and less expensive plans under his administration the president said he made an iron clad promise to always protect patients with preexisting conditions but that ignores the fact he has supported republican health plans that would reduce the current protections under the affordable care act he suggested misleadingly that his administration was responsible for the u s becoming the world s top producer of oil and natural gas but the u s has been no 1 in the world for natural gas for more than a decade and tops in petroleum since 2013 trump said 300 000 working age people left the workforce during obama s eight years actually the workforce grew by 5 4 million we also reviewed the democratic response and found that michigan gov gretchen whitmer got the story on wages wrong too when she said they have stagnated while ceo pay has skyrocketed pay at the top may have grown more rapidly over the long term but wages overall have gone up analysis trump delivered the state of the union on feb 4 a day before the senate is expected to acquit him in the impeachment trial and nine months before the presidential election trump s twisted comeback the president twisted the facts when he said his administration launched the great american comeback ending years of economic decay actually as we reported three years ago when he took office the economy was already experiencing steady growth in output jobs and incomes in the years before he took office gdp trump boasted that our economy is the best it has ever been which isn t true as of the most recent official estimate the nation s real inflation adjusted gross domestic product grew 2 3 last year it grew 2 9 in 2018 and also in 2015 before trump s tenure and it grew 3 8 in 2004 and 3 5 in 2005 most economists predict further slowing this year last month s wall street journal s monthly survey of business and university economists produced an average prediction of 1 9 growth for this year for example jobs since my election we have created 7 million new jobs trump said taking credit for thousands of jobs created after the election but while barack obama was still president the most recent figures show that in the 35 months after trump actually took office the economy added just under 6 7 million jobs in fact the rate of job growth has slowed down a bit under trump in the 35 months of supposed economic decay before he took office the economy added nearly 8 million jobs unemployment the president said the unemployment rate is the lowest in over half a century which is true enough it was 3 5 in december he was also correct when he said the average unemployment rate under my administration is lower than any administration in the history of our country the average rate during trump s first 35 months is 3 9 compared with an average monthly rate of 7 4 under obama 5 3 under george w bush and 5 2 under bill clinton but trump claimed too much credit for that when he claimed this wouldn t be true if we hadn t reversed the failed economic policies of the previous administration the fact is the jobless rate was down to 4 7 by the time trump took office well below the historical norm of 5 6 which is the median monthly rate for all the months since the start of 1948 women s unemployment rate trump also claimed that the unemployment rate for women reached the lowest level in almost 70 years that s true but as with the overall unemployment rate the unemployment rate for women has been trending down for nearly a decade the women s rate had reached a 10 year low of 4 6 under president obama in july november and december of 2016 it dropped further under trump falling to 3 4 in april and again in september of 2019 the lowest since september 1953 that s almost 70 years as trump said as of december 2019 the women s unemployment rate was 3 5 1 2 percentage points lower than what it was when trump took office under obama the women s unemployment rate declined 2 3 percentage points from 7 in january 2009 during the great recession to 4 7 in january 2017 when he left office usmca trump claimed that the new trade agreement with canada and mexico will create nearly 100 000 new high paying american auto jobs but the u s international trade commission estimates the job gains at 28 000 over five years the u s mexico canada agreement which trump signed into law jan 29 replaces the north american free trade agreement the trump administration has estimated that it will create 76 000 automotive jobs over five years however in its april 2019 analysis of the new trade deal the usitc said that the trump administration s estimate is too high the trade commission is an independent nonpartisan quasi judicial federal agency u s government officials who are familiar with usmca negotiations and have access to aggregate data from vehicle manufacturers estimate that the impact of usmca will be an increase of 76 000 vehicle and parts manufacturing jobs and investments totaling 34 billion over five years the analysis said this estimate is larger than the commission s estimate which predicts an increase of 28 000 jobs the usitc also reviewed three independent analyses of the trade deal and found that two of them were generally consistent with the commission s findings a third from the center for automotive research extended its analysis to include impacts on downstream service employees e g at dealerships which concludes with a more negative result than the usitc the commission said that one key difference between its estimate and the administration s is in the area of auto manufacturing the administration projects an increase in vehicle manufacturing jobs while the commission finds a decline due to decreased volume it s not at all clear that there is going to be a positive effect on jobs in the auto industry mary lovely a senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics which produced one of the reports reviewed by the usitc told the new york times last year this is the hard lesson of economics which is basically there s a lot of factors here wages have gone up under past presidents trump was wrong when claimed after decades of flat and falling incomes wages are rising fast wages have gone up under trump but they haven t been flat for decades real wages adjusted for inflation have gone up over the last several presidencies during obama s last four years in office the average weekly earnings for production and nonsupervisory workers went up 4 9 over his eight years in office wages went up 4 2 under president george w bush wages also increased by 4 2 and they rose by 6 4 under president bill clinton during trump s time in office those wages have gone up by 2 6 these figures come from the bureau of labor statistics the long term trend shows a u shaped curve not a flat line real wages hit their peak in the early 1970s and then generally dropped before beginning to rise again starting in the mid 1990s democratic response also wrong on wages michigan gov gretchen whitmer claimed in the democratic response to the state of the union in my own state our neighbors in wisconsin and ohio pennsylvania and all over the country wages have stagnated while ceo pay has skyrocketed as we explained wages adjusted for inflation have been rising whitmer has a point that wages for those at the top over the long term have grown more rapidly than for those in lower income groups the economic policy institute a think tank that advocates for low and middle income workers said in a 2019 report that every income percentile saw some growth in inflation adjusted hourly wages from 1979 to 2018 though the 50th percentile saw a 14 increase while the 95th percentile experienced a 56 1 increase household income trump claimed that real median household income is now at the highest level ever recorded that s true by one inflation adjusted measure but not by another as we wrote in our latest update of trump s numbers the census bureau s official measure of median household income reached 63 179 in 2018 which is the highest ever recorded but census officials said recent figures are due in part to a change in the survey questions in 2014 since then the annual survey has included additional sources of income that were previously left out according to the estimated adjusted figures census officials published to reflect the change the median household income in 2018 was less than it was in 1999 63 231 stocks 401 k s trump exaggerated the success of the stock market gains under his leadership claiming since my election united states stock markets have soared 70 percent and he said all of those millions of people with 401 k s and pensions are doing far better than they have ever done before with increases of 60 70 80 90 and 100 and even more as we wrote recently in trump s numbers january 2020 update stock prices continued their decade long rise with trump in office but he is overstating that success and he s goosing the numbers a bit by taking credit for gains while obama was still in office but after trump s election at the close on feb 4 the standard poor s 500 stock average was 45 2 higher than it was on the day of trump s inauguration over the same period the dow jones industrial average made up of 30 large corporations was up 45 3 under trump and the nasdaq composite index made up of more than 3 000 companies was up 70 4 it s certainly possible that some 401 k plans have increased dramatically even as high as 100 as the president said but those would be outliers according to an analysis by fidelity investments the average 401 k balance increased about 1 between the first quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019 and increased 8 between the first quarters of 2017 and 2018 and as we have written not everyone in the u s is enjoying the stock market gains only about half of u s households owned stocks directly or indirectly through mutual funds trust funds or pension plans in 2016 according to a paper published in november 2017 by the national bureau of economic research and only about a third of americans contribute to a 401 k according to the u s census border wall trump boasted that as we speak a long tall and very powerful wall is being built along the southern border we have now completed over 100 miles he said the administration has improved the barriers along the southern border but nearly all construction has been to replace existing barriers not extend the length of the miles of physical barriers between the u s and mexico as of fiscal year 2015 there were 654 miles of primary barriers on the southwest border including 354 miles of primary pedestrian barriers and 300 miles of primary vehicle barriers according to a july 2018 report by the government accountability office as of jan 24 u s customs and border protection has 655 miles of primary barriers on the southwest border according to a cbp fact sheet under trump approximately 99 miles of new border wall system constructed in place of dilapidated and or outdated designs and approximately 1 mile of new border wall system constructed in locations where no barriers previously existed the fact sheet said in addition to those primary barriers cbp said the administration has completed so far 10 miles of secondary barriers which are located behind the primary barriers border apprehensions trump said illegal crossings at the southwest border are down 75 since may but measured over a longer period of time border apprehensions under trump are up not down trump as a result of our unprecedented efforts illegal crossings are down 75 since may dropping eight straight months in a row there are technically no statistics for those who cross the border illegally but apprehensions by u s customs and border protection are used to measure such trends total southwest border apprehensions did decline by nearly 75 from 132 856 in may to 32 858 in december according to cbp but attempted border crossings tend to be highest in march april and may and lowest in december as we wrote in trump s numbers january 2020 update there were 799 669 total apprehensions at the southern border in 2019 the highest annual total since 2007 and 81 higher than in 2016 the year before trump took office factories boasting about growth in manufacturing trump claimed after losing 60 000 factories under the previous two administrations america has now gained 12 000 new factories under my administration but there s less here than meets the eye he s likely referring to bureau of labor statistics data on the number of establishments in private manufacturing which indicates there was a decline of 54 865 manufacturing establishments between the first quarter of 2001 and the first quarter of 2017 that was a roughly 13 decrease during the administrations of george w bush and barack obama and there has been an increase of 12 074 of those establishments 3 5 between the first quarter of 2017 and the second quarter of 2019 the last quarter for which such data is available however some context is in order the bls counts all establishments engaged in the mechanical physical or chemical transformation of materials substances or components into new products although manufacturing establishments are often described as plants factories or mills trump called them factories and characteristically use power driven machines and materials handling equipment they also include establishments that transform materials or substances into new products by hand or in the worker s home and those engaged in selling to the general public products made on the same premises from which they are sold such as bakeries candy stores and custom tailors the figures also include all sizes of establishments and when we looked into this claim in october caleb foote at the information technology and innovation foundation noted that the vast majority of gains under trump s watch have been establishments with fewer than five employees also the upward trend began before trump took office in obama s last four years the number of establishments grew by 10 407 health insurance premiums the president compared apples to oranges in claiming before i took office health insurance premiums had more than doubled in just five years i moved quickly to provide affordable alternatives our new plans are up to 60 percent less expensive and better the administration had claimed a doubling of the average premium from 2013 to 2017 but as we wrote that compares individual market premiums before the affordable care act s major provisions went into effect with 2017 healthcare gov exchange premiums the aca required insurers to charge the same premiums regardless of health status and include a minimum set of benefits so cheap barebones plans could no longer be offered to those who buy their own insurance also as we explained in detail the department of health and human services report that included these estimates said there were several limitations and caveats including relying on data for 2013 that hhs acknowledged wasn t a perfect comparison as for the affordable alternatives trump touted his administration has issued rules to expand cheaper less comprehensive insurance options such as short term insurance whether those plans would be better as trump claimed would be a matter of opinion as we ve said before they would cost less because they wouldn t have to cover certain benefits and could vary premiums more widely than the aca allows not so iron clad on preexisting conditions trump said he made an iron clad promise to americans we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions but he has backed republican health plans that would lessen the current protections for those with preexisting conditions and his administration has supported a lawsuit against the affordable care act by arguing the health law s preexisting condition protections would have to be eliminated as we ve explained under the aca insurers can t deny coverage or set premiums based on an individual s medical conditions the gop health plans debated in 2017 and supported by trump however could have caused some with health conditions to pay higher premiums see bloomberg trump spar on preexisting conditions for more the republican plaintiffs in the court case texas v united states say the entire aca should be found unconstitutional we don t know what the administration would do regarding preexisting conditions if the plaintiffs ultimately win that case but a 2018 justice department letter said that two provisions of the aca would need to be eliminated if the suit were successful those guaranteeing that people can t be denied coverage by insurers or charged more based on certain factors such as health status energy as he has done previously trump attributed the u s s position as the top producer of oil and natural gas to his administration s actions thanks to our bold regulatory reduction campaign he said the united states has become the no 1 producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world by far while energy production has risen under trump the hydraulic fracking boom that has propelled the u s to its current heights began under previous administrations and some of the top rankings were hit years ago as we have written on other occasions when trump has made similar claims including in last year s state of the union the u s outstripped russia to become the world s largest producer of natural gas more than a decade ago in 2009 according to the u s energy information administration the u s also took the top spot for petroleum production well before trump was in office in 2013 total petroleum eia explains is made up of several different types of liquid fuels including crude oil and lease condensate tight oil extra heavy oil and bitumen trump was president when the u s surpassed russia on crude oil production in the summer of 2018 that achievement however was long expected and based on a surge in crude that began about a decade ago the international energy agency s 2012 energy outlook for example predicted that the u s would become the largest crude oil producer by 2020 primarily because of advances in fracking technology trump also claimed the u s was energy independent saying with the tremendous progress we have made over the past three years america is now energy independent while there isn t necessarily a single definition for energy independence and as a concept it may be impossible given global markets one metric would be whether the u s produces more energy than it consumes the latest monthly data from eia which is current up to october 2019 shows that for six out of the 10 months of last year u s total primary energy production exceeded total consumption the u s however still has energy imports workforce trump made a puzzling and misleading claim when he said in eight years under the last administration over 300 000 working age people dropped out of the workforce in just three years of my administration 3 5 million people working age people have joined the workforce the fact is that the total civilian workforce grew during obama s eight years adding 5 4 million it has grown faster under trump adding 4 9 million during his first 35 months the workforce is made up of those age 16 and over who are either employed or seeking employment it s not clear what trump means by working age if he meant to refer to workers in what is commonly called the prime working years of 25 to 54 then he would be correct to say there was a decline but the loss was actually close to 1 6 million not 300 000 during obama s time and there has been a gain under trump in this age group but the figure is just under 2 5 million not 3 5 million sources bureau of economic affairs gross

has previously claimed to have saved insurance for people with pre existing conditions though the protections were in place from former president barack obama s affordable care act a law he has been trying to dismantle he also said his administration will always protect your medicare and we will always protect your social security but he s previously suggested cutting social security to shrink the country s growing budget deficit trump also highlighted his administration s efforts to cut regulations particularly environmental rules that had restricted oil and gas development he touted recent trade deals including his phase one china deal and a renegotiated pact with canada and mexico while his china deal has eased investor concern and likely warded off new trump tariffs it s

with brent d griffiths the ticker once again president trump s annual address was full of dubious claims video the washington post president trump kicked off a rollicking polarizing state of the union address with a demonstrably false argument that he inherited a failing economy from president obama and executed a swift u turn in just three short years we have shattered the mentality of american decline and we have rejected the downsizing of america s destiny trump said we are moving forward at a pace that was unimaginable just a short time ago and we are never going back trump s fact defying hyperbole sets up an arguably daunting case to make as he seeks to convince voters he delivered the nation from the american carnage he decried in his inaugural address to what his is now touting as the great american comeback just three years later and he drew boos from democrats in the chamber when he said if his administration had not reversed the failed economic policies of the previous administration the world would not now be witness to america s great economic success to the contrary many key economic indicators gdp growth the unemployment rate the stock market show gains in the trump era have simply continued along their trajectories from the obama years witness gdp growth and we we ve noted here recently economic expansion has been slowing growth registered at 2 3 percent last year and the congressional budget office projects it will further settle to 2 2 percent this year well below the rate trump promised to deliver in his first run a roughly 2 percent rate of growth is fine but unremarkable especially considering it merely maintains the trend trump inherited even after his 1 5 trillion tax cuts that package trump s signature domestic achievement has failed to goose business investment which the tax cuts proponents said would lead to productivity gains that spread new prosperity widely the president s trade war cast a pall of uncertainty over the economy the business leaders blame for sidelining corporate investments as this chart from deutsche bank securities demonstrates the tax cuts have helped add significantly to federal debt that trump promised to eliminate entirely over the course of two terms it s now projected to rise to record levels as a percentage of gross domestic product in a decade as the american enterprise institute s jim pethokoukis notes trump nevertheless is riding relatively high a new gallup poll shows his approval rating hitting a new high of 49 percent that finding is backed up by the latest washington post abc news poll which put his approval rating at 44 percent a high for that survey buoyed by a 56 approval rating for his economic stewardship another high watermark in the poll advertisement trump is still a president with an approval rating in the 40s and that s not ideal for a reelection campaign my colleague aaron blake notes in a wider look at his recent polling but he s also a president who won in 2016 despite only about 4 in 10 people liking him it s looking like he s now objectively in better shape than he was on election day 2016 and impeachment appears to have galvanized his base at least somewhat consumer confidence has gained steam in recent months though it is registering a small dip on coronavirus fears according to morning consult s survey the uptick in american sentiment about the economy comes from the fact that nearly 6 7 million more americans are employed today than when trump took office monthly job gains were stronger under obama than trump but the labor market has tightened further in recent years helping more people feel better off my colleague heather long writes a combination of higher wage gains in recent months and trump s tax cuts have helped most americans feel richer even though many still worry about how to pay for health care child care and college advertisement the gains have been spottier among the working class for whom trump claimed in his speech to have delivered a a blue collar boom over the last year the president s economic policies have not delivered anything close to the miracle that he has promised to white working class

donald trump said he is building the world s most prosperous and inclusive society in a triumphant state of the union address delivered on the eve of his likely acquittal in the senate s impeachment trial and as he reached the highest public approval of his presidency trump laid out his argument for re election centered on the strength of the u s economy and what he called the great american comeback during his first term in office in just three short years we have shattered the mentality of american decline and we have rejected the downsizing of america s destiny trump said tuesday from the house chamber we are moving forward at a pace that was unimaginable just a short time ago and we are never going back trump primarily sought to cast himself as the architect of an economy that has led to a streak of low unemployment the president will also appeal to working class voters who helped elect him in 2016 by saying the benefits of his economic policies are widespread countering criticism that they have primarily benefited the wealthy every citizen can join in america s unparalleled success trump said every community can take part in america s extraordinary rise widening income inequality the u s is in fact one of the most unequal nations among its peers with a growing share of wealth accrued to the top of the income ladder that s left not only the poorest but also the middle class behind a census bureau report last year found that income inequality in the u s had widened significantly in 2018 ahead of his speech trump was greeted by good news when gallup said his approval rating had reached 49 per cent among registered u s voters a high water mark for his presidency but the polling firm found 50 per cent of voters still disapprove of him as well as a yawning divide between republican and democratic support trump enjoys 94 per cent approval within his own party but just 7 among the opposition the largest such difference gallup has ever recorded it said venezuelan opposition leader juan guaido attended the speech as a guest of the white house providing a high profile platform for the national assembly leader as he seeks to revive support for his bid to oust president nicolas maduro in the speech trump referred to guaido as the true and legitimate president of venezuela conservative radio host rush limbaugh who recently announced he s suffering from lung cancer was also in the audience trump announced that he would give the commentator the presidential medal of freedom and first lady melania trump hung the medal around his neck the chamber provided a dramatic stage for nation s leaders who have been bitterly divided in a partisan fight over trump s impeachment vice president mike pence stood side by side with house speaker nancy pelosi in the center of the room though the two appeared to ignore each other partisanship was evident before trump s speech began pelosi extended her hand to trump but he turned away without shaking it republicans applauded the president and chanted four more years as democrats were silent acquittal expected on wednesday the gop led senate is expected to acquit trump of articles of impeachment brought by the democratic controlled house after he sought to pressure ukraine s government to investigate political rivals as trump spoke democrats were grappling with the botched iowa caucuses to determine who will challenge trump on the ballot in november the president used his address to criticize democrat proposals to expand medicare to all americans trump also made an ironclad pledge to protect patients with pre existing health conditions the president has previously claimed to have saved insurance for people with pre existing conditions though the protections were in place from former president barack obama s affordable care act a law he has been trying to dismantle he also said his administration will always protect your medicare and we will always protect your social security but he s previously suggested cutting social security to shrink the country s growing budget deficit cutting regulations trump also highlighted his administration s efforts to cut regulations particularly environmental rules that had restricted oil and gas development he touted recent trade deals including his phase one china deal and a renegotiated pact with canada and mexico while his china deal has eased investor concern and likely warded off new trump tariffs it s narrower in scope than first envisioned and has hit american farmers heavily in turn trump has shoveled us 28 billion in one time aid to farmers to make up for the trade war that s more than twice the cost of the auto industry bailout engineered in the great recession a decade ago trump s new continental trade deal is the u s mexico canada agreement a fundamentally modest rewrite of the north american free trade agreement it will eventually boost u s economic output by 0 35 per cent and raise u s employment by about 0 12 per cent according to an april 2019 analysis by the nonpartisan united states international trade commission an international monetary fund working paper analyzed five of the deal s key provisions and found only a negligible effect on gdp trump s next trade target is europe where he hopes to strike a new deal both with the european union and the united kingdom fresh off of brexit trump has threatened tariffs on german cars and french wine while campaigning against a french tax on digital companies and regularly complaining that europe doesn t pull its weight in nato or on foreign aid including to ukraine the u k france and germany are also working to hold together the iran nuclear deal which trump quit he s urged them to quit too and his china talks have shown how regional tensions can get dragged onto the negotiating table trump has said he wants an eu deal before the election economic focus trump s running on the economy and tuesday s speech made that clear though there are warning signs he echoed campaign speeches by citing the low unemployment figures but job gains slowed in december as wages rose at the weakest annual pace since 2018 the federal reserve has cut interest rates three times to respond to weakness and trump has urged more cuts trump has also cited the economy as a defense in the ongoing impeachment trial arguing that it s wrong to impeach a president during a time of growth trump has courted black voters as part of his re election bid hailing unemployment rates there are signs however that it remains an uphill battle a washington post ipsos poll last month of 1 088 black adults found that 83 per cent said trump is a racist and the same share said he s made racism worse in the country it found a job approval rating of 7 per cent in his state of the union speech trump singled out a black family from philadelphia who have sought to move their daughter from what the white house called low performing public schools and a black man the white house said benefited from the opportunity zone investment program created by his 2017 tax overhaul trump also recognized 100 year old charles mcgee one of the last surviving tuskegee airmen the first black military aviators to serve in the u s armed forces the president said he pinned stars on mcgee s shoulders earlier in the day marking his promotion to brigadier general trump has also tried to appeal to latino voters skirting divisive rhetoric he s otherwise aimed at migrants crossing into the u s from mexico in his speech he described record low unemployment among hispanics the pew research center projects latinos will surpass african americans in number of eligible voters in the 2020 election
the u s trade deficit fell for the first time in six years in 2019 as the white house s trade war with china curbed the import bill keeping the economy on a moderate growth path despite a slowdown in consumer spending and weak business investment the report from the commerce department on wednesday also showed the trump administration s america first agenda decreased the flow of goods last year with exports posting their first decline since 2016 president donald trump who has dubbed himself the tariff man has pledged to shrink the deficit by shutting out more unfairly traded imports and renegotiating free trade agreements trump has argued that substantially cutting the trade deficit would boost annual economic growth to 3 on a sustainable basis the economy has however failed to hit that mark growing 2 3 in 2019 which was the slowest in three years after expanding 2 9 in 2018 with tensions in the 19 month u s china trade war easing last year s narrowing in the deficit is unlikely to be repeated since that entire drop came from the huge change in the china deficit don t expect further declines in the years to come said joel naroff chief economist at naroff economic advisors in holland pennsylvania the trade deficit dropped 1 7 to 616 8 billion last year declining for the first time since 2013 that represented 2 9 of gdp down from 3 0 in 2018 goods imports plunged 1 7 last year also the first decrease in three years the united states imported 2 4 billion barrels of crude oil the fewest since 1992 as the country significantly reduced its dependence of foreign oil amid a surge in production and exploration it also imported fewer capital and other goods the 1 3 tumble in exports was led by decreases in shipments of capital goods industrial supplies and materials and other goods at the height of the u s china trade war last year washington slapped tariffs on billions worth of chinese goods including consumer products thumping imports the politically sensitive goods trade deficit with china plunged 17 6 to 345 6 billion in 2019 the white house has also sparred with other trading partners including the european union brazil and argentina accusing them of devaluing their currencies at the expense of u s manufacturers but those efforts did little to rein in the goods trade deficit with the eu which reached an all time high of 177 9 billion the deficit with mexico jumped to a record high of 101 8 billion washington and beijing signed a phase 1 trade deal last month the deal however left in place u s tariffs on 360 billion of chinese imports about two thirds of the total goods imports rebounded sharply in december boosting the trade deficit 11 9 to 48 9 billion that month economists polled by reuters had forecast the trade gap would widen to 48 2 billion in december temporary boost when adjusted for inflation the goods trade deficit increased 4 3 billion to 80 5 billion in december trade added almost 1 5 percentage points to gdp growth in the fourth quarter exceeding the 1 20 percentage points contribution from consumer spending which accounts for more than two thirds of u s economic activity the economy grew at a 2 1 annualized rate in the fourth quarter matching the pace notched in the july september period though the trade deficit is expected to swell the economy is likely to continue growing moderately with other reports on wednesday showing a pickup in activity in the services sector and private employers boosting hiring in january the institute for supply management ism said its non manufacturing activity index increased to a reading of 55 5 last month from 54 9 in december a reading above 50 indicates expansion in the services sector which accounts for more than two thirds of u s economic activity the report came on the heels of a survey from the ism on monday showing manufacturing rebounded in january after contracting for five straight months separately the adp national employment report showed private payrolls jumped by 291 000 jobs in january the most since may 2015 after increasing by 199 000 in december private payrolls were likely flattered by unusually mild weather and a seasonal quirk amid signs that overall job growth has slowed the adp report has a poor record predicting the private payrolls component of the government s more comprehensive employment because of methodology differences january s employment report is scheduled for release on friday we are always skeptical of the adp s accuracy and that skepticism is doubled every january because firms tend to purge names from the payroll at the start of the year even though those people may not have done and paid work for that firm for several months said paul ashworth chief u s economist at capital economics in toronto that distortion occasionally used to generate very weak readings at the start of the year but in this case it looks like the adp could have over compensated with an adjustment the dollar rose against a basket of currencies while prices of u s treasuries fell stocks on wall street were trading higher the 3 2 surge in imports to a seven month high of 207 5 billion in december came after three straight monthly declines and reflected a 1 7 billion increase in crude oil imports there was also a 1 2 billion rise in imports of other goods economists believe a 15 tariff on 110 billion worth of chinese goods that came into effect on sept 1 had weighed on imports in the prior months they also say anticipation that the phase 1 trade agreement would roll back the tariffs could have encouraged companies to hold off on imports in late 2019 goods exports rose 0 9 to 137 7 billion in december lifted by a 1 5 billion jump in shipments of crude oil as well as a 1 0 billion increase in exports of other goods at 17 1 billion petroleum exports in december were the highest on record but motor vehicle and parts exports fell 1 0 billion to 12 4 billion the lowest since november 2016

business features 05 02 2020 listen blessed are the young for they shall inherit the national debt says herbert hoover the 31st president of the united states of america on the issues of debt hoover will just be one of the billions of people in the world including famous economists and financial experts who do not hold any believe different from that expressed by him hoover consequently governments and central bank governors all over the world try as much to create enough fiscal space for their economies by borrowing less and spending reasonable amounts of income so as to stay afloat in fact international financial institutions like the bretton woods institutions are the front liners when it comes to issues of government spending where they discourage particularly developing countries from spending more whilst encouraging them to tax more and borrow less the issue of debt sustainability is so important because it has led to the crumbling of so many economies especially when it is not managed well ghana has had to resort to the imf 16 times since independence for bailout due to debt distress but this has not yielded significant results to propel the country to development debt has crushed so many economies like greece puerto rico argentina etc it has become a weapon in the hands of government critics and oppositions through out the world and in fact it equally but ignorantly serves as a marking scheme based on which the performance of a country or a certain government is assessed this has made governments alert on the issues of debt it is no wonder the government of ghana in 2019 accented to a bill that sought to cap government yearly deficit at 5 however the obsessiveness of countries to look good outwardly has made them pay less attention to the opportunities that they could harness through debt to catapult themselves to the league of developed nations in the world on the issues of debt sustainability the nominal figure of the debt is irrelevant and as a result economists prefer to use the debt to gdp as well as annual deficits though this is an important tool in debt sustainability analysis dsa it has been used wrongly in the sense that people immediately forget that it is not about how much you owe but about how able you are to pay back the loan at the stipulated time and whether you will be able to pay back the loan also depends on how you used the money this is simple borrow as much as you can so long as you have opportunities that will enable you pay back the loan as required without default or having to restructure the debt hence investors are mostly and mainly interested on how your future looks bright or bleak as mentioned earlier many of those countries that borrow a lot tend to be distressed by these debts thereby crushing their economies ironically though ghana has a lower debt to gdp ratio as compared to so many of the developed countries over 105 in us singapore 112 japan 253 etc international monetary organizations like the imf and the world bank complain often about the level of debt in ghana which is 62 than they do about the nature of debt in the developed world mainly because they consider the abilities of the countries to pay without having to resort to debt restructuring or default most of these developed countries especially europe and the us have had these high debt levels for a very long time after the world war ii wwii europe was devastated and needed help and the only country then that could help re build europe was the united states so this led to the formation of the bretton woods institutions namely the imf world bank and the international trade organization these same institutions today exist and fortunately for europe this really did help restore her but not africa which has been fed with several of billions of dollars ever since the difference in the success stories is nothing but institutions europe had the institutions to ensure that the money they received was used for the most critical projects that will put them to their feet even though those institutions were in havoc and only needed revamp developing countries are not suffering because they are economicallyignorant read why nations fail by acemoglu and robinson or due to over reliance on loans but because the loans that they take usually with high interests do not go to the right institutions if loans and aid were that deadly then a devastated europe should have remained devastated ever after the wwii this understanding of the dsa then leads us to analyze whether africa has those opportunities or not which merits more investments in our part of the world developing countries usually not much is done by the private sector the private sector is weak and thus unable to produce and provide enough jobs in the economy this means the amount of productivity in a particular economy sometimes depends mainly on government spending this is so because private spending in a country like ghana depends usually on government spending hence for us to provide more employment opportunities to the numerous unemployed graduates associations across the country we need to be able to invest massively in certain critical parts of the economy such as agriculture it is common knowledge that the private sector is normally the engine and driver of growth in almost every economy with the potential to develop but our continent unfortunately is plagued with low savings and therefore low internal investment contrary to the widely held notion that a government that borrows to spend discourages not only public savings but also private savings warren mosler an american post keynesian economist who is one of the leading pioneers of the modern monetary theory in his book the seven deadly innocent frauds of economic policy asserts that when government spends that part of the money which does not return to the government in the form of tax stays in the hands of private individuals which is either spent or kept as savings by cutting their spending this will then lead to more savings than would have been the case if the government had not ran a deficit thus if government deficit is not large enough to cater for these savings desires then people in their attempt to save will createunemployment since a cedi spent on a good keeps another person in employment this attempts to explain how government running a deficit is so important most especially in developing countries like ghana what will be the essence of not borrowing more when you know that borrowing more will only open up dormant sectors of the economy and scale up productivity running a zero deficit economy without much productivity would not lead to development than would borrowing to spend recklessly without vision lead to debt sustainability african countries still have so many important and highly profitable investment opportunities that have not been exploited therefore it is not surprising that a majority of our people are still unemployed and large proportion of our citizens still battling the age long curse of poverty that continue to lurk in every corner of this land of opportunities this means any government that is able to invest widely and wisely in the appropriate opportunities should be able to pay her debt not less than a good business will be able to pay its debt for instance the government of president akuffo addo has initiatednot just an ambitious but also a very laudable policy of 1 village 1 dam in all regions of the northern part of ghana which is usually dry for most part of the year issue of its implementation will be for another day this policy if well implemented will not just provide jobs for the youth but will be able to immediately provide government revenue through tax from the agricultural produce help the government reduce the numerous freebies that she doles out to the poor in the name of social interventions because living conditions would have improved which means a lot more money can actually be saved by merely borrowing to provide jobs to the people a clear example now is the government s planting for food and jobs it would be unbelievable to have any well meaning ghanaian push against the use of borrowed money for such a worthy course a famous concern among critics of sufficient government expenditure is that it will lead to an increase in the inflation and interest rates which is truly common among countries with high debt levels the reason is simple to grasp it is simply because spending goes with productivity and so if the loan is spent unproductively like was done in ghana in 2012 where government had to suddenly spend in excess of 12 of gdp so they could retain power that year then certainly such unguided and unyielding spending will only derail the economy and bring it to its knees no wonder rising inflation became prevalent and gdp growth rate dragged its feet below 5 this suffocated the fiscal space and even though the government had just ended an imf program in 2012 it had to run to the imf in 2015 for yet another credit facility thus a rising inflation can be averted by correspondingly increasing productivity remember demand pull inflation is simply too much money chasing too few goods but when too much money is chasing too much goods then surely the inflation rate will be stable and this increase in productivity will lead to an increase in savings as explained above and as is common knowledge this rising savings will slow down the interest rate externally the increase in investor confidence due to the prudent and productive use of borrowed money will still keep the interest on our external bonds at reasonable levels remember that the interest on loans becomes deadly only when such interest rates exceeds the gdp growth rate the reason most developing countries are usually unable to pay back their loans despite the opportunities that are as glaring as the numerous cases of malaria extreme poverty illiteracy and pockets of tribal conflicts etc is the huge level of corruption and embezzlements which are pervasive with borrowed funds investing borrowed funds into unyielding ventures such as the building of a presidential palace buying of chocolate for school children as is currently been done by cocobod use of borrowed funds meant for medical research for research into the electoral chances of a political party etc which will never yield anything to pay back the loan also the use of short term loans to invest in long term projects which will not yield returnsquickly to pay the debt these and many others will only suffocate the economy and not create enough fiscal space for the economy to thrive the 2001 nobel prize winner in economics joseph stiglitz puts it better when he said debt in itself is not bad it is just the channels through which they are expended and how fast they pile up sadly these are the realities of africa consequently the issues with developing countries are institutional and leadership but not debt and thus the needless arguments by politicians and policy makers in africa particularly ghana about which administration has borrowed more is misplaced the debate should be about how much confidence which is easily determined by the economic indicators has been earned both locally and externally which will affect future bonds and investments and what impact on the economy has been made by government through their prudent and wise use of the borrowed money for debt as suggested by the famous economist james galbraith is not a burden in the future contrary to herbert hoover s remark everything produced in the future will be consumed in the future how much will be produced depends on how productive the economy is at that time this has nothing to do with public debt today a higher public debt today does not reduce future production and if it motivates wise use of resources today which unfortunately eludes africa may increase productivity of the economy in the future abba lerner renowned for the lerner s index the champion of functional finance posits that public policy should be judged by its results in the real world employment productivity and price stability and not by whatever may be happening to budget and debt numbers jonathan mcmills ewusi

canadian net present value of future net revenues in usd 2p reserves discounted at 10 forecast pricing after tax of 102 mm is 13 lower compared to 2018 primarily due to reduced gas locations and commodity pricing egyptian net present value of future net revenues in usd 2p reserves discounted at 10 forecast pricing after tax decreased 11 year over year to 185 mm primarily due to higher royalties at west bakr randy neely chief executive officer of transglobe said we are pleased with the results of the 2019 drilling program and we aim to build upon this success in 2020 the 2020 plan is focused on the most value accretive projects within the portfolio to maximize free cash flow to fund future value growth opportunities and bolster the current production base in egypt the focus is on growing production in the eastern desert while we continue to evaluate the potential of the south ghazalat acreage in canada the focus is on developing south harmattan where we have made a potentially significant discovery of resources in a new effectively undrilled area where we already have a significant footprint our 2020 budget underlines the confidence we have in the potential of the transglobe portfolio 2020 capital guidance the company s 2020 capital program of 37 1 mm before capitalized g a includes 23 7 mm for egypt and 13 4 mm for canada the 2020 plan was prepared to focus on value accretive projects within its portfolio maximize free cash flow to direct at future value growth opportunities and to maintain the company s production base egypt the 23 7 mm egypt program has 5 4 mm 23 allocated to exploration and 18 3 mm 77 to development the primary focus of the 2020 egypt plan is to sustain eastern desert production and to evaluate the south ghazalat development lease in the western desert while we await finalization of the consolidation of our eastern desert pscs south ghazalat production has been forecast at a rate constrained by reservoir management considerations on the upper bahariya reservoir with additional production forecasted from the lower bahariya the 5 4 mm 2020 exploration program in egypt includes three exploration wells in the eastern desert one well in west bakr two wells in nw gharib and one exploration well in south ghazalat in the western desert the west bakr exploration well is in h block targeting the yusr reservoir in an adjacent fault block to the hw 2x discovery placed on production during 2019 the nw gharib exploration wells are targeting undrilled faults block north and west of the nwg 38a pool the south ghazalat exploration well targets a prospect to the east of the sgz 6x discovery placed on production during 2019 the 2020 development program is principally focused on the eastern desert and includes four development wells in west bakr two each in h and k pools one red bed appraisal well in the nw gharib 3x pool six development wells targeting the arta nukul reservoir in west gharib and

the sgz 6x well following the installation of production facilities at site initial oil production was in the range of a field estimated 800 1 000 bopd light and medium crude however the gas oil ratio rapidly increased to a level that interfered with the ability to separate oil from water in the facilities this combined with prudent management practices on the upper bahariya reservoir completed in this well has led to the well now being produced at a restricted field estimated 250 350 bopd of light and medium crude the lower bahariya reservoir also tested oil in this well and remains a future recompletion target the shams 2 rig contracted in egypt to drill hw 2a eastern desert appraisal well to hw 2x followed by sgz 6a western desert appraisal well on upper and lower bahariya to sgz 6x has mobilized to location at hw 2a and is undergoing inspection during rig up prior to the commencement of drilling eastern desert 100 wi as noted above the shams 2 rig has mobilized to the hw 2a location in west bakr where it will shortly drill a yusr reservoir appraisal well to the successful hw 2x exploration well which continues to produce in excess of a field estimated 700 bopd of heavy crude stimulation of nwg 38 d 1 has been completed and the well put on production the well is currently cleaning up psc consolidation constructive negotiations with egyptian general petroleum corporation egpc to amend extend and consolidate the company s eastern desert concession agreements continue in line with previous disclosure with the anticipated successful conclusion of negotiations likely to lead to a revised agreement in the second half of 2020 canada as a result of the initial success of the 2 mile appraisal outpost well in south harmattan details previously released on january 30 2020

forth below see forecast prices used in estimates net reserves are the company s working interest share after the deduction of royalties net reserves in egypt include the company s share of future cost recovery and production sharing oil after the government s royalty based interest but before reserves relating to income taxes payable under this method a portion of the reported reserves will increase as oil prices decrease and vice versa as the barrels necessary to achieve cost recovery change with prevailing oil prices possible reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain

reserves at 2019 year end were higher gross 2p reserves basis compared to 2018 year end due to drilling additions in both egypt and canada as well as positive technical revisions resulting from better performance due to production optimization projects drilling additions of 3 4 mmboe 2 4 mmboe from canada and 1 0 mmboe from egypt and positive technical revisions of 4 4 mmboe primarily from egypt more than offset annual production of 5 8 mmboe there were some minor negative revisions due to economic factors 0 8 mmboe in canada primarily due to a reduction in commodity price forecasts and the elimination of wabamun gas locations egypt in egypt the company replaced 121 of 2019 production on a 2p gross reserves basis 5 0 mmbbl and replaced 93 of 2019 production on a 1p gross reserves basis 2p drilling additions of 3 4 mmboe resulted from the successful extension of h field with the hw 2x well infill drilling at k field with k 63 and the conversion of undeveloped reserves at northwest gharib and m and h fields positive 2p technical revisions of 3 8 mmboe occurred at west bakr due to better performance resulting from production optimization projects optimization projects also resulted in positive technical revisions of 0 6 mmboe at west gharib and other concessions revisions were essentially neutral canada in canada the company replaced 2019 production by 124 on a 2p gross

drilled in the harmattan area representing undeveloped reserves conversions and one 2 mile horizontal well in the south harmattan area representing new drilling additions there were some negative technical revisions resulting from lower type curves lower gor trends and two sour gas wabamum locations were removed due to economics lower commodity price forecasts resulted in negative economic

among the barangays manila had indicated prominence much early on historical records show that the rulers of the barangays in pre colonial manila seemed to have formed the nucleus of a trading and commercial community at the mouth of the pasig river farming communities around manila and as far as pampanga sent their crops down the pasig river to the village of manila where these were traded with chinese products constantino 1975 however since trade was at a relatively small scale the economy of manila and surrounding barangays remained largely at subsistence level although the first spanish settlement in the philippines was established in cebu by miguel lopez de legaspi in 1565 the scarcity of food supplies forced him to move first to the island of panay and later to manila in may 1570 based on a favorable report from martin de goiti who learned of the busy port of manila from the chinese and other asian traders spanish domination was established with minimum use of force and control was secured largely by the evangelizing work of the spanish religious missionaries the spanish control and exploitation of manila and the rest of the country were facilitated enormously by three factors 1 the policy of reduccion or forced resettlement 2 the institution of private land ownership and 3 the manila acapulco galleon trade the policy of reduccion given the limited number of missionaries at the time the synod of manila adopted the policy of reduccion or deliberate resettlement of the population to facilitate mass conversion to catholicism the process involved requiring dispersed barangays to constitute into compact but larger communities and reducing their number thus the term reduccion so that they can be easily and quickly called to attend church rites and be accounted for their regular contributions the policy aimed at bringing the people debajo de las campanas within the hearing distance of the church bells part of the policy was to baptize the converts and give them spanish last names in alphabetical order by town so that evangelization would be well organized cushner 1976 reduccion greatly aided the organization of local government in the country it laid down the pattern of present urban settlements in the philippines with the church bell tower and convent occupying a prominent place in the town center together with the municipal hall which became known as the town plaza complex in 20th century urban design parlance privatization of land ownership perhaps the most significant far reaching and enduring instrument the spaniards introduced that has altered philippine economic and social structure is the institution of private land ownership before the spanish arrived land ownership was largely communal and land use was based on usufruct rights private property as established by the spanish colonizers is evidenced by the possession of a title which was a form of wealth this paved the way to the alienation of much of native landholdings individual as well as communal and their eventual concentration in private hands stringent rules governing real estate transactions were promulgated by the spanish colonial regime to prevent the fraudulent transfer of native landholdings and the sale of communal lands however the disruption of barangay communities due to the enforcement of the policy of reduccion often obscured the distinction between private and communal landholdings these rules were also frequently unenforced the spanish governors general gave land grants which often included communal lands to spaniards and native principales members of the principalia former datus their families and descendants also sold or donated lands over which they assumed private ownership but were actually communal lands ignorance of the new laws governing private land ownership coupled with traditional deference for the principalia who had become local officials in the colonial bureaucracy repeatedly resulted in the tagalogs natives of manila loss of hereditary individual and communal landholdings cushner 1971 the rise of large land estates around manila was stimulated by the increasing profitability of agricultural production because of the city s expanding population lack of interest in farming by most individual spaniards who enjoyed enormous profits from the galleon trade eventually left large scale agricultural production to the religious orders by the 18th century the religious orders were the biggest landowners around manila the friar estates were expanded through additional purchase donations from spaniards and filipinos and usurpation of contiguous tagalog landholdings usually communal lands the new landholdings by usurpation were easily legitimized by government resurvey and payment of a fee the conversion of land to private property exposed the native population to more economic exploitation fundamentally it changed the structure of indigenous society as the tagalogs lost their individual and communal lands they became tenants share croppers and paid or unpaid farm laborers who were ultimately pushed to revolt against their foreign exploiters the personal and economic insecurity that hounded the tagalogs became the harbinger of the land problems underneath whose weight the filipino peasantry is still struggling the manila galleon trade manila s initial wealth was derived from the profitable trade between acapulco mexico and manila known in colonial times as the manila acapulco galleon trade the galleon trade was the first and biggest monopolistic trade between asia and the americas bigger than the british french and dutch east india companies trade with europe it thrived for almost two and a half centuries the trade began in 1565 and until 1813 the galleons sailed regularly each year from manila to acapulco bringing oriental goods and returning with mail from spain and silver from mexico the philippine trade with china which antedated the spanish conquest was the foundation of the manila acapulco trade during the latter part of the 16th and early 17th centuries some 30 to 40 chinese junks came to manila each year laden with silk and other textiles porcelain fruits farm animals and others goods when the spanish and portuguese thrones were united ships from japan and portuguese ships from malacca india siam cambodia and borneo also came to manila bringing spices precious stones ivory silk and other products these products were loaded into the galleons and brought to acapulco it was this extremely profitable trade centered in manila that greatly determined the initial pattern of development for the philippines as a whole and manila in particular under spanish rule phelan 1959 direct participation in the galleon trade was limited to the spaniards in manila the merchants civil servants and religious orders who served as commercial intermediaries and the chinese traders at the parian the native population were excluded supposedly because of their lack of capital and trading experience as the spanish merchants kept their capital invested in manila the economic prosperity brought by the galleon trade was largely confined to manila and its suburbs the spanish manilans the insulares lived comfortably from the profits of the trade while the chinese in manila were the middlemen acting as consigners providing credit to merchants packing the merchandise for the galleons engaging in retail trade and providing a variety of skills needed by the urban population the continued influx and prosperity of the chinese was assured by the dependence of the spaniards on their services the chinese population outside intramuros walled city of manila remained large compared with the spanish community despite the massacres resulting from their periodic uprisings and consequent expulsions by the colonial authorities the chinese were confined in the community of binondo now binondo district of manila which is recognized as the first and biggest chinatown in the world nevertheless during most of the 250 years of the galleon trade the chinese were able to secure control of the internal retail trade and credit facilities in the country becoming a dominant economic group unlike the spaniards the chinese had more intermarriages with the native population the offspring of these marriages the chinese mestizo became the leading entrepreneurs during the period of economic development in the 19th century intramuros the walled city was built during the heyday of the galleon trade it was a section of manila that was fortified to secure the spaniards and keep out the native filipinos and local chinese it linked the philippines with spain and the outside world and served as the seat of government and administration ecclesiastical center military outpost and center of inter island commerce and foreign trade manila s rapid development and affluence during the 16th and 17th centuries depended totally on the prosperity of the galleon trade forced labor tribute tax and forced purchase of agricultural products from other parts of the country to support the colonial bureaucracy based in manila

added a further cut would help households balance sheet adjustment and bring forward the day that consumption strengthens it would also have a further effect on the exchange rate which would boost demand for our exports and therefore support jobs growth however there were global concerns on the resource allocation and confidence on very low interest rates it could also encourage more borrowing for house purchases and increase risk of problems down the track but the board will continue to look at both sides of the equation if the unemployment rate were to be trending in the wrong direction

emboldened by an impending acquittal in his impeachment trial a sputtering start to the democratic caucuses and his highest approval ratings to date u s president donald trump gave a rousing state of the union address tuesday aimed squarely at his base the mood may have started out ceremonial and civil in the hallways of the capitol but it became decidedly less so inside the house culminating in a walkout by several democratic legislators and speaker of the house nancy pelosi ripping up her copy of trump s speech later labelling it a manifesto of mistruths while state of the union addresses are supposed to unify the nation and energize supporters trump s speech tilted toward the latter while avoiding even a nod to his impeachment it was really a campaign speech said meena bose executive dean for public policy and public service programs at hofstra university in new york state it s consistent with the kind of turbulent times that we re in i think bipartisanship may be a bridge too far in 2020 the evening had all the trappings of a trump rally including chants of usa usa interspersed with four more years one of the more bizarre displays of pageantry of the night was a tribute to conservative talk radio host rush limbaugh who was recently diagnosed with cancer and received a presidential medal of freedom partway through the speech here are a few key themes that emerged from the state of the union watch speaker nancy pelosi can t hide her disdain and rips up her copy of trump s state of the union address speaker nancy pelosi reacts duration 0 08 speaker of the house nancy pelosi rips up a copy of u s president donald trump s state of the union address at the end of the speech economy trump had lots to brag about u s unemployment is at a 50 year low wages are rising and the stock market is booming but economists warn that there are some shades of grey to trump s blue collar boom the corporate tax cuts passed two years ago generated a fiscal stimulus and job growth but they haven t spurred businesses to invest economic growth at 2 1 per cent last quarter has been more modest than the four to six per cent trump promised at the start of his presidency have literally trillions of dollars on their balance sheets that they could invest if they wanted to what they re doing instead is they re buying back their stock said jacob kirkegaard senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics in washington d c watch this is a blue collar boom trump points to employment gains across the board employment gains duration 3 35 u s president donald trump highlights low unemployment and job growth in his state of the union address while that might benefit the markets the biggest boost from that boom has gone to the wealthiest 10 per cent of americans who own more than 80 per cent of stocks the deregulation trump highlighted in the speech has had a positive impact on investment and job creation in some sectors but carries an environmental cost which got no mention also noticeably absent was any mention of the country s 1 trillion us deficit and the more than 23 trillion in debt which is expected to reach 98 per cent of gdp by 2030 trade the new nafta and the recently negotiated first phase of a trade deal with china are big talking points for trump and tuesday night was no exception but trump s take no prisoners approach to trade wars is widely seen as having a negative impact not just on the u s economy but the global trading system retaliatory tariffs on steel aluminum and other products have hurt the u s manufacturing sector which is technically in a recession and the agricultural sector which in 2019 saw the highest number of farm bankruptcies in eight years watch trade tariffs a hallmark of trump economy fairer trade deals duration 1 42 u s president donald trump tauts greater fairness and reciprocity in the new trade deal he negotiated with canada and mexico to replace nafta the unpredictable nature in which trump wields tariffs as a negotiating tactic has injected uncertainty into the supply chain and made businesses reluctant to make long term investments business confidence has fallen across the board and not just in tradable sectors said kirkegaard on tuesday trump touted those tariffs saying our strategy has worked and calling the recently signed deal with china groundbreaking but kirkegaard and others say the deal is more of a detente and it s gains are modest it still preserves about 360 billion in tariffs on chinese goods for one and allows china to keep subsidizing some industries a ceremony at the white house can t hide the stark truth about the phase one china trade deal the deal does absolutely nothing to curtail china s subsidies to its manufacturers all those forgotten men and women in u s factories have once again been forgotten scottpaulaam health care health care has been a differentiating issue in the democratic race for president and trump seized on the medicare for all policies that some democrats have been advocating one hundred thirty two lawmakers in this room have endorsed legislation to impose a socialist takeover of our health care system wiping out the private health insurance plans of 180 million very happy americans he said watch trump attacks democrats socialist takeover of health care trump on health care duration 0 41 u s president donald trump makes a veiled jab at his democratic rivals by warning that he will never let socialism destroy american health care he warned that the coverage for undocumented immigrants that such plans include would raid the medicare benefits of our seniors and drew a line in the political sand if forcing american taxpayers to provide unlimited free health care to illegal aliens sounds fair to you then stand with the radical left trump stretched the truth several times in this part of his speech vowing for example to protect patients with pre existing conditions which is a protection guaranteed under the obama era affordable care act that has been challenged under the trump administration shefali luthra of kaiser health news who was fact checking the speech for the politifact website also found that his claims about drug prices falling last year did not pass muster prices may be stabilizing but they are not coming down and consumers are not experiencing that relief she wrote immigration on immigration trump repeated some familiar refrains that have defined his rhetoric on the issue since the 2016 presidential campaign highlighting specific cases of violent crimes committed by illegal aliens and decrying radical politicians who have declared their cities sanctuaries for undocumented immigrants he gave an accurate picture of the decrease in illegal border crossings in the last eight months although the total for 2019 was still the highest since 2007 but was less forthcoming about the wall on the mexico u s border that he has been promising since the start of his presidency watch trump promises overhaul of immigration system reasserting the culture of american freedom duration 0 35 u s president donald trump highlights his efforts to overhaul what he called an outdated immigration system trump told the assembled audience that 100 miles 161 km have been completed when in fact all but one mile of that was a rebuild of existing barriers the additional 500 miles 805 km he has promised by the end of the year could face hurdles when it comes to acquiring the private land needed to build even a semi contiguous barrier along the southwest border it s more of a symbol than a reality said ryan streeter director of domestic policy studies at the american enterprise institute most americans don t really know what the administration is constructing along the border wedge issues trump didn t shy away from some of the most polarizing wedge issues from abortion to religion to guns to supreme court judges he really doubled down on all of them said scott anderson a governance studies fellow at the brookings institution in washington he sees where his bread is buttered he s going back to his base anderson and other observers see it as a sign of what s to come in an election campaign catering to an electorate nearly evenly divided along partisan lines if you re running to your base in the state of the union which is usually an effort to put forward a kind of broad based positive vision that a lot of voters can sign on to then when you re in the middle of a more committed political race you re definitely running to the base trade specifically the canada u s mexico deal known as cusma or usmca was one area where it was thought trump might highlight the bipartisanship that went into reaching a consensus but that didn t happen national security national security came up in the latter half of the 80 minute long speech and contained few surprises trump highlighted the foreign policy accomplishments most observers had anticipated he would the recently announced israeli palestinian peace plan and the assassinations of iranian maj gen qasem soleimani and isis leader abu bakr al baghdadi as in other parts of the speech trump used the personal stories of some of his invited guests to underscore policy accomplishments in this case the presence of carl and marsha mueller whose daughter kayla an american aid worker was held captive in syria by isis and killed in 2015 in one orchestrated reveal worthy of day time tv he brought out a returning soldier to be reunited with his young family watch trump s vow to bring troops home earns applause ending american s longest war duration 3 08 u s president donald trump highlights his administration s national security accomplishments and vows to bring u s troops home from afghanistan perhaps sobered by the recent escalation of tensions with iran trump struck somewhat of a conciliatory tone urging the regime not to be too proud or too foolish to ask for help with the country s flagging economy we are here trump said while at the same time warning iran to stop spreading terror death and destruction although he avoided explicitly mentioning the controversial withdrawal of troops from syria which some in his administration criticized as premature trump highlighted the need to draw down american troops abroad specifically in afghanistan it is also not our function to serve other nations as law enforcement agencies he said we are working to finally end america s longest war and bring our troops back home it s an issue that would have resonated with a wide swath of americans eager to disentangle from the protracted conflict said bose trump punctuated it with a signature made for tv moment reuniting a young military family live on air in the middle of the state of the union address thank you mr president duration 1 11 u s president donald trump surprises the crowd at the state of the union address by introducing juan guaido the venezuelan opposition leader who has been trying to oust president nicolas maduro for the past year and whom the u s canada and other countries consider the rightful president one foreign policy surprise was the presence of juan guaido the venezuelan opposition leader who had been in miami days earlier rallying support to his cause he was an odd choice of guest at an event touting policy wins given that his year long attempt to overthrow president nicolas maduro has thus far been unsuccessful despite support from the u s canada and other western nations who ve declared him the rightful president guaido s presence as well as trump s earlier reference to reversals of the failing policies of the previous administration on cuba might score him points with latino voters in the key swing state of florida come november
by the plight of impoverished children anywhere should evoke sympathy exemplifying as it does the suffering of the innocent and defenseless poverty among children in a wealthy country like the united states however should summon shame and outrage as well unlike poor countries sometimes run by leaders more interested in lining their pockets than anything else what excuse does the united states have for its striking levels of child poverty after all it has the world s 10th highest per capita income at 62 795 and an unrivalled gross domestic product gdp of 21 3 trillion despite that in 2020 an estimated 11 9 million american kids 16 2 of the total live below the official poverty line which is a paltry 25 701 for a family of four with two kids put another way according to the children s defense fund kids now constitute one third of the 38 1 million americans classified as poor and 70 of them have at least one working parent so poverty can t be chalked up to parental indolence yes the proportion of kids living below the poverty line has zigzagged down from 22 when the country was being ravaged by the great recession of 2008 2009 and was even higher in prior decades but no one should crack open the champagne bottles just yet the relevant standard ought to be how the united states compares to other wealthy countries the answer badly it has the 11th highest child poverty rate of the 42 industrialized countries tracked by the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd winnow that list down to european union states and canada omitting low and middle income countries and our child poverty rate ranks above only spain s use the poverty threshold of the oecd 50 of a country s median income 63 178 for the united states and the american child poverty rate leaps to 20 the united states certainly doesn t lack the means to drive child poverty down or perhaps even eliminate it many countries on that shorter oecd list have lower per capita incomes and substantially smaller gdps yet as a unicef report makes clear have done far better by their kids our high child poverty rate stems from politics not economics government policies that since the 1980s have reduced public investment as a proportion of gdp in infrastructure public education and poverty reduction these were of course the same years when a belief that big government was an obstacle to advancement took ever deeper hold especially in the republican party today washington allocates only 9 of its federal budget to children poor or not that compares to a third for americans over 65 up from 22 in 1971 if you want a single fact that sums up where we are now inflation adjusted per capita spending on kids living in the poorest families has barely budged compared to 30 years ago whereas the corresponding figure for the elderly has doubled the conservative response to all this remains predictable you can t solve complex social problems like child poverty by throwing money at them besides government antipoverty programs only foster dependence and create bloated bureaucracies without solving the problem it matters little that the actual successes of american social programs prove this claim to be flat out false before getting to that however let s take a snapshot of child poverty in america sizing up the problem defining poverty may sound straightforward but it s not the government s annual official poverty measure opm developed in the 1960s establishes poverty lines by taking into account family size multiplying the 1963 cost for a minimum food budget by three while factoring in changes in the consumer price index and comparing the result to family income in 2018 a family with a single adult and one child was considered poor with an income below 17 308 20 2012 for two adults and one child 25 465 for two adults and two children and so on according to the opm 11 8 of all americans were poor that year by contrast the supplementary poverty measure spm published yearly since 2011 builds on the opm but provides a more nuanced calculus it counts the post tax income of families but also cash flows from the earned income tax credit eitc and the child tax credit ctc both of which help low income households it adds in government provided assistance through say the supplemental nutritional assistance program snap temporary aid to needy families tanf the children s health insurance program chip the national school lunch program nslp medicaid subsidies for housing and utilities and unemployment and disability insurance however it deducts costs like child care child support payments and out of pocket medical expenses according to the spm the 2018 national poverty rate was 12 8 of course neither of these poverty calculations can tell us how children are actually faring put simply they re faring worse in 2018 16 2 of americans under 18 lived in families with incomes below the spm line and that s not the worst of it a 2019 national academies of sciences engineering and medicine study commissioned by congress found that 9 of poor children belong to families in deep poverty incomes that are less than 50 of the spm but 36 of all american children live in poor or near poor families those with incomes within 150 of the poverty line child poverty also varies by race a lot the rate for black children is 17 8 for hispanic kids 21 7 for their white counterparts 7 9 worse more than half of all black and hispanic kids live in near poor families compared to less than a quarter of white children combine age and race and you ll see another difference especially for children under five a population with an overall 2017 poverty rate of 19 2 break those under fives down by race however and here s what you find white kids at 15 9 hispanic kids at an eye opening 25 8 and their black peers at a staggering 32 9 location matters too the child poverty rate shifts by state and the differences are stark north dakota and utah are at 9 for instance while new mexico and mississippi are at 27 and 28 nineteen states have rates of 20 or more check out a color coded map of geographic variations in child poverty and you ll see that rates in the south southwest and parts of the midwest are above the national average while rural areas tend to have higher proportions of poor families than cities according to the department of agriculture in rural america 22 of all children and 26 of those under five were poor in 2017 why child poverty matters imagine for a moment this scenario a 200 meter footrace in which the starting blocks of some competitors are placed 75 meters behind the others barring an olympic caliber runner those who started way in front will naturally win now think of that as an analogy for the predicament that american kids born in poverty face through no fault of their own they may be smart and diligent their parents may do their best to care for them but they begin life with a huge handicap as a start the nutrition of poor children will generally be inferior to that of other kids no surprise there but here s what s not common knowledge a childhood nutritional deficit matters for years afterwards possibly for life scientific research shows that by age three the quality of childrens diets is already shaping the development of critical parts of young brains like the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex in ways that matter that s worth keeping in mind because four million american kids under age six were poor in 2018 as were close to half of those in families headed by single women indeed the process starts even earlier poor mothers may themselves have nutritional deficiencies that increase their risk of having babies with low birthweights that in turn can have long term effects on children s health what level of education they reach and their future incomes since the quality of nutrition affects brain size concentration and cognitive capacity it also increases the chances of having learning disabilities and experiencing mental health problems poor children are likely to be less healthy in other ways as well for reasonsthat range from having a greater susceptibility to asthma to higher concentrations of lead in their blood moreover poor families find it harder to get good health care and add one more thing in our zip code influencedpublic school system such children are likely to attend schools with far fewer resources than those in more affluent neighborhoods our national opioid problem also affects the well being of children in a striking fashion according to the centers for disease control and prevention cdc between 2008 and 2012 a third of women in their childbearing years filled opioid based medication prescriptions in pharmacies and an estimated 14 22 of them were pregnant the result an alarming increase in the number of babies exposed to opioids in utero and experiencing withdrawal symptoms at birth which is also known as neonatal abstinence syndrome or nas in medical lingo its effects a penn state study found include future increased sensitivity to pain and susceptibility to fevers and seizures between 2000 and 2014 the incidence of nas increased by a multiple of four in 2014 34 000 babies were born with nas which as a cdc report put it is equivalent to one baby suffering from opioid withdrawal born approximately every 15 minutes given the ongoing opioid crisis it s unlikely that things have improved in recent years and the complications attributable to nas don t stop with birth though the research remains at an early stage the opioid crisis only began in the early 1990s it suggests that the ill effects of nas extend well beyond infancy and include impaired cognitive and motor skills respiratory ailments learning disabilities difficulty maintaining intellectual focus and behavioral traits that make productive interaction with others harder at this point you won t be surprised to learn that nas and child poverty are connected prescription opioid use rates are much higher for women on medicaid who are more likely to be poor than those with private insurance moreover the abuse of and overdose deaths from opioids whether obtained through prescriptions or illegally have been far more widespread among the poor combine all of this and here s the picture from the months before birth on poverty diminishes opportunity capacity and agency and its consequences reach into adulthood while that rigged footrace of mine was imaginary child poverty certainly does ensure a future rigged society the good news though not in donald trump s america the race to a half decent life or better doesn t have to be rigged it needn t be this way but will be as long as trump is president can children born into poverty defy the odds realize their potential and lead fulfilling lives conservatives will point to stories of people who cleared all the obstacles created by child poverty as proof that the real solution is hard work but let s be clear poor children shouldn t have to find themselves on a tilted playing field from the first moments of their lives individual success stories aside americans raised in poor families do markedly less well compared to those from middle class or affluent homes and it doesn t matter whether you choose college attendance employment rates or future household income as your measure and the longer they live in poverty the worse the odds that they ll escape it in adulthood for one thing they re far less likely to finish high school or attend college than their more fortunate peers conversely as harvard economist raj chetty and his colleagues have shown kids life prospects improve when parents with low incomes are given the financial wherewithal to move to neighborhoods with higher social mobility rates thanks to better schools and services including health care as in that imaginary footrace the starting point matters but here the news is grim the social progress index places the united states 75th out of 149 countries in access to quality education and 70th in access to quality health care and poor kids are of course at a particular disadvantage yet childhood circumstances can be and have been changed and the sorts of government programs that conservatives love to savage have helped enormously in that process child poverty plunged from 28 in 1967 to 15 6 in 2016 in significant part due to programs like medicaid and the food stamp act started in the 1960s as part of president lyndon johnson s war on poverty such programs helped poor families pay for housing food child care and medical expenses as did later tax legislation like the earned income tax credit and the child tax credit our own history and that of other wealthy countries show that child poverty is anything but an unalterable reality the record also shows that changing it requires mobilizing funds of the sort now being wasted on ventures like america s multitrillion dollarforever wars certainly an increase in jobs and earnings can reduce child poverty wall street journal odes to donald trump s tax cuts and deregulation policies highlight the present 3 5 unemployment rate the lowest in 60 years a surge in new jobs and wage growth at all levels notably for workers with low incomes who lack college degrees this storyline however omits important realities programs that reduce child poverty help even in years when poor or near poor parents gain and of course are critical in bad times since sooner or later booming job markets also bust furthermore the magic that trump fans tout occurred at a moment when many state and city governments were mandating increases in the minimum wage employers who hired especially in heavily populated states like california new york illinois ohio and michigan had to pay more as for cutting child poverty it hasn t exactly been a presidential priority in the trump years not like the drive to pass a 1 5 trillion corporate and individual income tax cut whose gains flowed mainly to the richest americans while inflating the budget deficit to 1 trillion in 2019 according to the treasury department then there s that impenetrable powerful beautiful wall its estimated price ranges from 21 billion to 70 billion excluding maintenance and don t forget the proposed extra 33 billion in military spending for this fiscal year alone part of president trump s plan to boost such spending by 683 billion over the next decade as for poor kids and their parents the president and congressional republicans are beginning to slash an array of programs ranging from the supplemental nutritional assistance program to medicaid 1 2 trillionworth over the next 10 years that have long helped struggling families and children in particular get by the trump administration has for good measure rewritten the eligibility rules for such programs in order to lower the number of people who qualify the supposed goal to cut costs by reducing dependence on government never mind the subsidies and tax loopholes trump s crew has created for corporations and the super wealthy which add up to many billions of dollars in spending and lost revenue these supposedly work ethic driven austerity policies batter working families with young kids that for example desperately need childcare which can take a big bite out of paychecks 10 or more for all households with kids but half in the case of poor families add to that the cost of unsubsidized housing median monthly rent increased by nearly a third between 2001 and 2015 put another way rents consume more than half the income of the bottom 20 of americans according to the federal reserve the advent of trump has also made the struggle of low income families with healthcare bills even harder the number of kids without health insurance jumped by 425 000 between 2017 and 2018 when according to the census bureau 4 3 million children lacked coverage even before donald trump s election only one sixth of eligible families with kids received assistance for childcare and a paltry one fifth got housing subsidies yet his administration arrived prepared to put programs that helped some of them pay for housing and childcare on the chopping block no point in such families looking to him for a hand in the future he won t be building any trump towers for them whatever make america great again may mean it certainly doesn t involve helping america s poor kids as long as donald trump oversees their race into life they ll find themselves ever farther from the starting line this article first appeared on tomdispatch

currencies bonds gold all get sold on tuesday a vaccine for the coronavirus is in the works good day and wonderful wednesday to you i have to apologize to one and all for my whining yesterday about how i felt i shouldn t have gone into detail and should have said instead that it was a tough night for yours truly ok now that s out of the way and in case you re wondering i got the wink an nod to go off the chemo for a week so by about the time i start to feel human again it ll be time to go back on i m still of the belief though that this chemo medicine has run its course with me i ve been taking chemo for nearly 13 years and this is the 5 different chemo drug that s i ve taken and i ve been on this one for 2 years this is when i contact md anderson for their advice as to what is the newest renal cell carcinoma drug available i think that this morning s song is telling me something it s the great godfather of soul james brown and his song get on the goodfoot oh and this is the last letter this week folks i have to be at the wound center very early tomorrow so no pfennig tomorrow sorry well the currencies can t stand prosperity every time in recent months that they appear to be ready to roll vs the dollar that probes to be a false dawn they may still build on their gains last week but it will have to come after giving back some gained ground like they did yesterday i say the currencies as a general statement there was a currency or two that gained yesterday the aussie dollar a is one of them and the other is the russian ruble a longtime reader asked me last week what was the currency vs the dollar last year and i responded that i believed the malaysian ringgit was the number one but it was a very illiquid currency that was difficult to own and then yesterday i learned that the russian ruble was the number one currency of the top 20 currencies in the world for 2019 the ruble s return currency only was 12 46 if you owned it the entire year you can add another 4 5 for interest so it s total return was over 17 and it should be the best performing currency for years to come until they get back to the level it traded vs the dollar 35 before the conflict with ukraine a few years ago when the currency plummeted you know the more i read the more i learn that more and more countries are weaning themselves from their dependency on the u s dollar russia and china are the leaders of this move but until the u s experiences a failed auction of treasuries this movement will take years to come around but the trend is in folks and can you blame these other countries by having the reserve currency of the world the u s is supposed to be above all others at shepherding their economies and balance sheet to keep the currency strong the report card on the u s s efforts to shepherd their economy and blance sheet to keep the reserve currency strong is not a good one folks the u s current debt stands at more than 23 trillion and the unfunded liabilities are 127 trillion add those together that s how well the u s has done folks if i were the teacher they would get a hard f but that s not all the debt we have in this country corporate debt is 15 5 trillion or 74 of gdp state and local debt is 1 6 trillion and consumer debt is 13 86 trillion this is really bad folks so go ahead and think the dollar is going to remain strong forever one of these days all this debt is going to come back and bite the dollar in the rear the early morning selling of gold yesterday carried through to the rest of the day with the shiny metal losing 23 on the day to close at 1 553 ouch now that s going to leave a mark but as i always say these brief sell offs in gold give the procrastinators or the johnny come lately to investing the opportunity to buy at much cheaper prices than was we saw late last week for if you believe that gold will remain at these levels forever you ll end up being wrong remember a few years ago when gold dropped to 1 100 and change and a very well know investment analyst said that gold would go to 700 well instead of dropping further at that time it began to rebound and then late last year it took a big step to the 1 500 level you know i wonder where that well known investment analyst has gone i haven t heard from him in a few years now ok enough of that did you hear that a cruise ship off the coast of japan has been ordered to remain there and not dock because there have been some confirmed cases of the coronavirus on the ship talk about the virus beginning to spead basically every person on that ship could have been exposed to the virus i would thing that news like that would boost the price of gold euros francs yen and bonds but in this day of opposites gold euros francs yen and bonds all suffered from selling go figure eh and speaking of the coronavirus a british scientist believes he has developed a vaccine to combat the coronavirus by the time it gets through all the hoops and goes to manufacturing it will be too late to help with the outbreak this time but at least the next time there will be an answer apparently that is i don t think the news of a vaccine to combat the coronavirus had anything to due with the boys in the band taking down gold yesterday but i m sure there s an excuse list out there that the boys in the band are reciting from that has the vaccine as one of the reasons they took gold down i mean they really whacked gold the u s data cupboard yesterday had december factory orders and i said yesterday that given the recovery in the ism data that i would expect that factory orders also recovered from their negative print in november and recover it did apparently that is for i m unaware of fidgeting in this number but given that all other numbers have some fidgeting one would think that this one did too the december print was 1 8 that wasn t enough to bring factory orders out of the red y t d for 2019 so the poor readings will continue with the december print a brief escape that s how i see it anyway today s data cupboard has the adp employment report for january and the precursor to friday s jobs jamboree is expected to show 175 000 which is in line with december s print i would think that the january temp help for december was all gone and that the january jobs number will be lower to recap the currencies for the most part suffered through a day of dollar buying on our tom terrific tuesday gold got whacked royally and that whacking is going to leave a mark the a and rubles were the only rallying currencies all the real data for december ism durables factory orders etc all showed improvement but couldn t bring the annual numbers out of the doldrums or here s your snippet macy s announced tuesday that it had adopted a three year plan designed to stabilize profits and continue company growth the new plan calls for a radical 1 5 billion cost cutting program that will axe upwards of 2 000 jobs and shutter 125 stores across the us the retailer which operates 680 stores under the macy s and bloomingdale s brands said the closure represents an 18 reduction in its brick and mortar footprint the layoffs of about 2 000 corporate jobs will account for 9 of its workforce there s also a plan to close several offices macy s said the cost savings would generate about 600 million in 2020 and 1 5 billion annually by 2022 we are taking the organization through significant structural change to lower costs bring teams closer together and reduce duplicative work this will be a tough week for our team as we say goodbye to great colleagues and good friends the changes we are making are deep and impact every area of the business but they are necessary i know we will come out of this transition stronger more agile and better fit to compete in today s retail environment macy s ceo jeff gennette said in a statement gennette said the company s least productive stores would be cut first there are already 30 stores in the process of closing he added under the consolidation program macy s nyc will become the company s sole corporate headquarters offices in san francisco cincinnati and lorain ohio will be closed within the next three years chuck again just another of the brick and mortar companies that are seeing less and less of foot traffic in their stores but it s not just the stores folks we ve seen oil companies file

by lucia mutikani washington reuters the u s trade deficit fell for the first time in six years in 2019 as the white house s trade war with china curbed the import bill keeping the economy on a moderate growth path despite a slowdown in consumer spending and weak business investment the report from the commerce department on wednesday also showed the trump administration s america first agenda decreased the flow of goods last year with exports posting their first decline since 2016 president donald trump who has dubbed himself the tariff man has pledged to shrink the deficit by shutting out more unfairly traded imports and renegotiating free trade agreements trump has argued that substantially cutting the trade deficit would boost annual economic growth to 3 on a sustainable basis the economy has however failed to hit that mark growing 2 3 in 2019 which was the slowest in three years after expanding 2 9 in 2018 with tensions in the 19 month u s china trade war easing last year s narrowing in the deficit is unlikely to be repeated since that entire drop came from the huge change in the china deficit don t expect further declines in the years to come said joel naroff chief economist at naroff economic advisors in holland pennsylvania the trade deficit dropped 1 7 to 616 8 billion last year declining for the first time since 2013 that represented 2 9 of gdp down from 3 0 in 2018 goods imports plunged 1 7 last year also the first decrease in three years the united states imported 2 4 billion barrels of crude oil the fewest since 1992 as the country significantly reduced its dependence of foreign oil amid a surge in production and exploration it also imported fewer capital and other goods the 1 3 tumble in exports was led by decreases in shipments of capital goods industrial supplies and materials and other goods at the height of the u s china trade war last year washington slapped tariffs on billions worth of chinese goods including consumer products thumping imports the politically sensitive goods trade deficit with china plunged 17 6 to 345 6 billion in 2019 the white house has also sparred with other trading partners including the european union brazil and argentina accusing them of devaluing their currencies at the expense of u s manufacturers but those efforts did little to rein in the goods trade deficit with the eu which reached an all time high of 177 9 billion the deficit with mexico jumped to a record high of 101 8 billion washington and beijing signed a phase 1 trade deal last month the deal however left in place u s tariffs on 360 billion of chinese imports about two thirds of the total goods imports rebounded sharply in december boosting the trade deficit 11 9 to 48 9 billion that month economists polled by reuters had forecast the trade gap would widen to 48 2 billion in december temporary boost when adjusted for inflation the goods trade deficit increased 4 3 billion to 80 5 billion in december trade added almost 1 5 percentage points to gdp growth in the fourth quarter exceeding the 1 20 percentage points contribution from consumer spending which accounts for more than two thirds of u s economic activity the economy grew at a 2 1 annualized rate in the fourth quarter matching the pace notched in the july september period though the trade deficit is expected to swell the economy is likely to continue growing moderately with other reports on wednesday showing a pickup in activity in the services sector and private employers boosting hiring in january the institute for supply management ism said its non manufacturing activity index increased to a reading of 55 5 last month from 54 9 in december a reading above 50 indicates expansion in the services sector which accounts for more than two thirds of u s economic activity the report came on the heels of a survey from the ism on monday showing manufacturing rebounded in january after contracting for five straight months separately the adp national employment report showed private payrolls jumped by 291 000 jobs in january the most since may 2015 after increasing by 199 000 in december private payrolls were likely flattered by unusually mild weather and a seasonal quirk amid signs that overall job growth has slowed the adp report has a poor record predicting the private payrolls component of the government s more comprehensive employment because of methodology differences january s employment report is scheduled for release on friday we are always skeptical of the adp s accuracy and that scepticism is doubled every january because firms tend to purge names from the payroll at the start of the year even though those people may not have done and paid work for that firm for several months said paul ashworth chief u s economist at capital economics in toronto that distortion occasionally used to generate very weak readings at the start of the year but in this case it looks like the adp could have over compensated with an adjustment the dollar rose against a basket of currencies while prices of u s treasuries fell stocks on wall street were trading higher the 3 2 surge in imports to a seven month high of 207 5 billion in december came after three straight monthly declines and reflected a 1 7 billion increase in crude oil imports there was also a 1 2 billion rise in imports of other goods economists believe a 15 tariff on 110 billion worth of chinese goods that came into effect on sept 1 had weighed on imports in the prior months they also say anticipation that the phase 1 trade agreement would roll back the tariffs could have encouraged companies to hold off on imports in late 2019 goods exports rose 0 9 to 137 7 billion in december lifted by a 1 5 billion jump in shipments of crude oil as well as a 1 0 billion increase in exports of other goods at 17 1 billion petroleum exports in december were the highest on record but motor vehicle and parts exports fell 1 0 billion to 12 4 billion the lowest since november 2016 reporting by lucia mutikani editing by paul simao

and our cfo mr daniel salazar now i will give the call to mr ramos rodolfo ramos arvizu chief executive officer thank you maria and good morning everyone as we mentioned in our press release issued yesterday we faced fourth quarter with challenging condition in poultry while the rest of our segments remain in good shape in poultry we observed pressure in prices in mexico due to the softer demand mainly as a result of the slow economic growth leading to oversupply conditions according to the last information released by banco de mexico economic growth in mexico is expected to be close to zero for the year in the u s we observed an improvement in prices particularly for leg quarters however adjustment in our sales mix result in lower volume sold which in combination with the appreciation of the mexican peso versus the u s dollar offset the improvement in prices in peso terms as a reference on average the appreciation of the mexican peso was around 3 when compared to the fourth quarter of 18 under the condition mentioned above we reached net sales of mxn15 138 million for the fourth quarter of 19 which is 1 8 lower when compared to the same period of 2018 sales in our poultry segment decreased 2 2 with respect to the fourth quarter of 18 our other segment on the other hand increased 2 versus the fourth quarter of 18 mainly as a result of higher volume sold in balanced feed for the full year our sales totaled mxn61 658 6 million 1 higher than the total sales reported for 2018 regarding our cost of sales efficiencies in live production and processing plant allow us to keep our total costs under control for both the quarter and full year when compared to 2018 our sg a was mxn1 571 6 million for the quarter which is 10 4 of total sales lower than compared to the mxn1 650 7 million and 10 7 of total sales for the full quarter of 18 for the full year we managed to keep our sg a at 9 9 of total sales compared with the 2018 this is a result of being very focused on capturing efficiencies across all our processes particularly in our distribution network we consider that being efficient is what allows us to be in better position for being comparative under uncertainties and volatility that comes along with our industry the aforementioned condition allow us to reach an operating income of mxn242 1 million for the quarter and mxn3 922 8 million for the year which compared to mxn489 6 million and mxn3 780 million for the same period of 2018 respectively with that we reached an ebitda of mxn571 5 million for the fourth quarter of 2019 at 3 8 margin which compares to an ebitda margin of 5 3 for the fourth quarter of 18 as for the full year of 2019 we reported an ebitda of mxn5 215 6 million at 8 5 margin versus 8 2 margin of 2018 our balance sheet remains strong as we reached a net cash level of mxn14 254 3 million which enable us to continue supporting our growth plan capex for 2019 was mxn2 025 1 million an increase of 2 1 when compared to 2018 which reinforces our growth strategy commitment part of our strategy was the announcement we made at the end of the year increase we share the plan of investing in the company sonora agropecuaria a swine processor and distributor here in mexico we consider that this vertical integration combined with our live swine operation will allow us to accelerate our rhythm of growth and continue to move forward in the diversification process toward other animal proteins we are working to fulfill the compliance requirement by the mexican authorities in order to move forward with the integration process and start to capitalize the benefits at this point i will turn the call over to daniel for a discussion of the financial results daniel salazar ferrer chief financial officer thank you rodolfo and good morning everyone as a result of the conditions rodolfo mentioned before our company s fourth quarter 19 net sales totaled mxn15 138 million mxn283 million or 1 8 lower than the mxn15 421 million reported in the fourth quarter of 18 this decrease was a result of lower prices in our main business lines and lower volume sold in poultry regarding the full year of 2019 we reported net sales of mxn61 658 6 million which is 1 higher than the net of 2018 in the quarter sales of our u s operations represented 27 9 of total sales which compared to the 28 7 we reported in the same quarter of 2018 this was a result of our higher sales in our mexican operation cost of sales in the fourth quarter of 19 was mxn13 171 4 million and mxn51 558 1 million for the full year this represents a reduction of 0 8 for the quarter and an increase of 0 3 for the year gross profit for the quarter was mxn1 966 6 million and gross margin of 13 which compares with a gross profit of mxn2 148 3 million and 13 9 margin reported in the fourth quarter of 2018 for the year we reached gross profit of mxn10 100 million with a margin of 16 4 this amount compares to the mxn9 629 7 million and 15 8 margin for 2018 total sg a for the fourth quarter of 19 was mxn1 571 6 million 4 8 lower than the mxn1 650 7 million reported in the fourth quarter of 18 for the full year sg a totaled mxn6 094 4 million or 9 9 of total sales compared to mxn6 024 4 million and 9 9 of total sales of 2018 this is a result of our efforts to continue being competitive and efficient operating income for the last quarter of 2019 totaled mxn242 1 million with an operating margin of 1 6 versus an operating income of mxn489 6 million with a margin of 3 2 reached in the same quarter of 2018 the operating income

reached in the fourth quarter 18 for the full year of 19 ebitda margin was 8 5 higher than the 8 2 reached in 2018 in the fourth quarter for 2019 we reported a net financial loss of mxn210 million compared to a net financial income of mxn403 8 million in the fourth quarter of 18 this decrease was mainly attributed to a lower exchange rate gains as the mexican peso appreciated versus 2018 for the full year our net financial income was mxn363 2 million versus the mxn808 6 million for the 2018 year our total taxes for the quarter were a credit of mxn128 8 million compared to income taxes of mxn182 million for the same quarter of 2018 for the full year our total tax was mxn1 117 7 million mxn33 3 million lower than the income taxes of 2018 all the above led us to a net income of mxn160 8 million for the quarter with a net margin of 1 1 this income compared to a net income of mxn711 4 million up 4 6 margin in the fourth quarter of 18 for 2019 net income totaled mxn3 168 4 quarter with

per share of mxn1 18 pesos and mxn5 58 for the same period of 2018 respectively going into our balance sheet we kept a healthy financial structure with an increase in total asset of 5 5 when compared to 2018 our net cash was mxn14 254 3 million at the end of the year higher than our net cash level of mxn13 420 9 million at the beginning of the year our capex was mxn2 025 1 million as we keep investing to support our organic growth and maintain our facilities at high level of productivity well that is all thank you and i will turn the call back to rodolfo for final remarks rodolfo ramos arvizu chief executive officer thank you daniel entering 2020 we are still observing some pricing pressures as we observed in the fourth quarter of 19 particularly in mexico we are working on efficiencies as well as improving our sales mix in order to offset some of those effects in the u s we have seen important improvement in labor prices year over year which is having a positive impact in the results of our u s operation we continue monitoring uncertainties related to the commercial trading and african swine fever effects which could potentially have an impact in our business regarding raw materials prices for corn and soybean meal have shown a stable behavior so far nonetheless we keep a close watch on the movement and continue with our discipline in our hedging strategy we will continue to focus on in attending to our markets keeping a healthy financial position and investing in capex above maintenance levels in order to grow and be close to our customers with that we will now take your questions questions and answers operator thank you and our first question comes from miguel tortolero from gbm miguel tortolero gbm analyst hi good morning thanks for the space for questions i got a couple the first one is regarding the u s you mentioned on your press that you started to see some price recovery by the end of the quarter so could you elaborate further on this and in general the present price dynamics that you re seeing in this market and the second one is regarding mexico given that the results are a bit complicated to follow chicken prices to the live chicken component could you give us some color on how you re seeing prices behaving at the start of this year is it fair to assume that the weakness in at the end of the of 2019 has remained during january thank you rodolfo ramos arvizu chief executive officer well thank you miguel and the second question about the mexican market january we observed the same trend at the last part of the year but at the end of the month and first week of february we have seen an improvement in the prices so we expect that we are going to have a better month of february and we are getting to the second quarter which normally is the best quarter of the year and i think we are going to arrive in a good position and u s market the price increase was mainly in the leg quarters and wings wings because of the super bowl and leg quarters because of the china lift the ban to export to china so prices in leg quarters are better than a year ago breast meat is boneless breast meat it s a little bit tough the price right now is lower than a year ago but we are going to start in the time with the seasonality we normally see prices increase in on this breast miguel tortolero gbm analyst perfect that s very clear thank you very much rodolfo ramos arvizu chief executive officer thank you miguel operator our next question comes from hector maya from santander hector maya santander analyst hi thanks for taking my questions the first one would be regarding mexico where is this poultry oversupply you mentioned here in mexico coming from is it from imports from the u s if you help me understand that it would be great that would be the first question and second question is i understand that volumes in the u s fell 2 and you mentioned that leg quarters and wings had improvements in price so just help me understand how the entire or the average price that you had in u s was also presenting price improvements because i m not seeing it that way if you could help me understand that i would also appreciate it thanks rodolfo ramos arvizu chief executive officer sure about mexico mexico is mainly our supply of the domestic production and mainly in the live segment of the market and you know the mexican market 37 of the market is live chicken so it s we saw an oversupply in that particular business line so it s domestic the oversupply in the other hand in the u s the commodity side of the industry it s mainly leg quarters are having that price recovery but our company there depends mainly in the foodservice sector which is more stable prices and all the year run so in terms of pricing i think that we are going to start in the commodity side to see the recovery of the boneless breast as normally occurs in the first quarter of the year and the rest of our mix is going to be stable because of our structure of pricing hector maya santander analyst so if i m understanding correctly pricing like seeing entirely in the u s as an average price over the u s was affected by foodservice pricing in foodservice the mix was bad there rodolfo ramos arvizu chief executive officer no not for the industry that s our mix our company mix we don t depend in a high percentage in the commodity side because we are more oriented to the foodservice business or segment of the market but the commodity the last part this the fourth quarter in particular the commodity prices were very very depressed or low so right now we saw a recovery in leg quarters and wings and breast meat still commodity boneless breast meat is still very low and our sales in the united states were a little bit lower in terms of pesos because the appreciation of the peso against the u s dollar that s the main cause and we were short in terms of total sales hector maya santander analyst so what was the overall pricing in u s dollar terms for your entire portfolio in the u s was the pricing in dollar terms for that in the us down overall rodolfo ramos arvizu chief executive officer yes and compare the quarter by quarter yes because leg quarters were a little bit lower than the fourth quarter of 2018 and even boneless breast meat both of them were cheaper in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared with the same with the fourth quarter of 19 but at the end of the quarter and the beginning of this the first quarter of 2020 we are seeing an improvement in leg quarters and wings and we are still below a year ago in boneless breast meat and we are expecting to start seeing an improvement in that particular product because of the seasonality of this product hector maya santander analyst got it and do you think price and volume trends in the u s reflect industry trends or are you losing or gaining share how is that rodolfo ramos arvizu chief executive officer about pricing or market share what do you mean with that hector maya santander analyst yeah i mean with these comments are you losing or gaining market share in the u s rodolfo ramos arvizu chief executive officer well because our growth was negative we lose some market share because the industry grew around 3 which is a little bit higher than normal daniel salazar ferrer chief financial officer but on the other hand hector we are very confident and in this year 2020 we can recover this share because we are growing in our contracts that we are now closing with our customers we have seen an important increase in volumes so we are very confident to be capable to recover that volume for the year hector maya santander analyst so just to wrap up this part is so if i understood this correctly prices in the u s fell for you and the entire portfolio you lose you lost share but you are planning on recovering it right daniel salazar ferrer chief financial officer that s correct hector maya santander analyst you lost market share and prices for you in the u s fell rodolfo ramos arvizu chief executive officer fourth quarter yes daniel salazar ferrer chief financial officer for the fourth quarter yes but for this year we have seen as rodolfo mentioned a recovery in the whole price mix because the leg quarters represent an important part of our portfolio so with this increase in leg quarters and wings in spite of the breast meat remained stable the overall prices increased compared with the fourth quarter right now rodolfo ramos arvizu chief executive officer and the other important thing is because of our mix in our operation in other deal we are buyers of commodity products so right now we are we have a very good position to acquire lower prices and boneless breast meat because we are net buyers of that product so right now we are having a good time in that facility daniel salazar ferrer chief financial officer yes we are rising breast meat at good prices and selling leg quarters and commodity products so in the mix we are improving hector maya santander analyst got it and sorry to take so much time but just daniel salazar ferrer chief financial officer no not at all thank you for your questions thank you very much hector hector maya santander analyst sorry talking about capital deployment what would you prefer to increase investments to integrate forward in mexico toward more value added products or acquisitions in the u s what are the main criteria for the acquisitions you re looking for in general terms would you be considering increasing dividends the suitable acquisitions in the short term daniel salazar ferrer chief financial officer well right now our first our priority is to continue growing organically because with further acquisition of our investment in sonora agropecuaria our capex will increase above our normal investment that we have had in the last year so it means that broadly with this plans we will increase our capex around mxn25 million above the mxn110 million capex that we have had in the last years so secondly we want to complete try to complete m a opportunities that we are pursuing and of course we have a big space to continue looking for opportunities not only in mexico but also in united states and also in latin america even that we haven t concrete acquisition in all these years we are actively looking for opportunities in those markets hector maya santander analyst got it and the very last one deceleration in mexican consumption 2019 versus 2020 how are you seeing that rodolfo ramos arvizu chief executive officer well the capita consumption is still growing the industry this year is going to expand around 2 so the per capita consumption is going to be better and right now because of the african swine fever the prices of other meats are very expensive so chicken is the best option so we are going to see an increase in the capita consumption here in mexico and in the united states the capita consumption has been going up to in 2018 and 2019 hector maya santander analyst got it perfect thank you very much thanks rodolfo ramos arvizu chief executive officer thank you hector operator our next question comes from ulises argote from jpmorgan ulises argote jpmorgan analyst hi guys good morning thank you for taking the questions just a follow up there on the mexico business but i was wondering if you can help us understand a bit better what is driving this improvement you mentioned now in late january and early february in terms of prices of mexico can you give us a bit more color on what s changing on the landscape or on the scenario versus what you were seeing late last year that is making you more optimistic for the price trends now in february and especially going into the second quarter which typically is better and the second one there can you give us a bit more clarity on what s behind the one time write off there on the intangible that you re reporting on the other expenses thank you rodolfo ramos arvizu chief executive officer okay i m going to answer the first question and daniel the second one we are seeing an improvement in prices and the prices here in mexico because of live chicken is the main market in china it s a supply and demand so right now we are seeing a more balanced supply compared to the demand normally the industry because of the that kind of commodity place more chickens for december because normally december used to be a very good month so this month i think we had an oversupply at the end of the year and right now we are seeing a better balance between supply and demand that s the main driver of the market prices daniel salazar ferrer chief financial officer okay now talking about the write off that we disclosed for our intangibles asset what i can tell you ulises is this came from our less acquisition of albertville quality foods when we acquired that company we recognized in that moment two different intangible assets a goodwill derived from the price and a customer and an intangible from customer contract we re a very conservative company in that regard we never in our history recognized intangible for that concept given that we have a significant contract with our customers but this was cost because when we acquired the company they actually have recognized that intangible and the write off comes from two customers two particular customer that we have no longer contracts with them even that we have a new contract with other customers and overall we are increasing our sales from that operation but we are recognizing this write off only for the customers that will stop to continue signing contracts with them ulises argote jpmorgan analyst okay perfect that is very clear and just one quick follow up on the first question there on the let s say the more normalized price trends on the live chicken channel or maybe other kind of balance there on supply demand but can you kind of help us understand because previously the data that we saw let s say on the components of the cpi or on the data that was reported by the economics ministry typically was closer let s say or was a better way to track kind of the overall price for mexico and on this quarter we saw that big disconnect so what changed this quarter versus previous quarters that we kind of saw that big gap in your reported prices and what we have been seeing in the market daniel salazar ferrer chief financial officer well the problem is that there is no public information that you can follow in order to see the trend in the live public market it s a problem for everybody to follow we follow the market through our sales people because they re in touch with our customers so through them we realize what the market is going is behaving in terms of pricing but we don t have official or public information to follow the market rodolfo ramos arvizu chief executive officer and in the other hand they don t have the capability to track the live prices in the different areas of mexico so sometimes the price and they are reporting is a different mix so when the live market drops like at the end of the fourth quarter so there is a kind of disconnect or seems to be a disconnect because is tracking the overall price in the whole country and the live market is very important and is located mostly in the south part of the country ulises argote jpmorgan analyst okay yeah perfect that makes sense thank you very much guys daniel salazar ferrer chief financial officer thank you rodolfo ramos arvizu chief executive officer thank you ulises operator

officer thank you darin good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today yesterday we reported fourth quarter earnings per share of 2 33 we also reported an adjusted operating return on equity of 12 1 for the full year looking back on 2019 we implemented a number of important actions to enhance our business and financial performance for the long term as a result we have begun 2020 with a clear set of initiatives against which we will execute with the renewed confidence that our businesses can deliver increased earnings performance i ll begin this morning by sharing a few accomplishments from 2019 first we launched a process talent and technology transformation initiative which is on track to realize 500 million in run rate cost savings by 2022 as part of this program we initiated a voluntary separation program for segments of our u s workforce during the fourth quarter which is reducing our cost base over the course of 2020 and creating a more agile and competitive workforce second we returned approximately 4 billion to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases the 10 increase in our dividend represents the 12th consecutive year of dividend increases and produces a yield on booked value in excess of 4 third we completed our acquisition of assurance iq in october adding a leading direct to consumer financial wellness solutions platform we re encouraged by the growth and customer demand the interest from carriers wanting to put their products on the platform and the level of talent we are attracting from well known technology companies finally we may progress in our ongoing efforts to reduce the variability of our quarterly earnings pattern and we added transparency to our quarterly financial performance in 2019 our financial performance was impacted by a low interest rate environment the annual assumption update in our individual life business and higher than typical expenses in our international businesses in 2020 we are implementing a number of initiatives to drive improved financial performance in the years ahead we re focused on executing three key initiatives first we remain focused on enhancing the customer experience to produce long term sustainable growth while generating 140 million in cost savings this year second in our international businesses we continue to focus on increasing the percentage of earnings coming from growth markets supporting this objective this quarter we closed on the acquisition of a colombian pension fund manager with habitat expanding our presence in latin america we also completed the sale of our italian insurance business and are exploring strategic options for operations in other markets including korea we ll share further details at the appropriate time and third we re continuing to take steps to mitigate the effects of the low interest rate environment such as adjusting the mix and pricing of our products turning to slide three i ll briefly touch upon some of the key drivers of our fourth quarter results which rob will cover in more detail our u s businesses benefited from record account values in retirement and individual annuities earnings increased from the prior year quarter reflecting higher net investment spread results partly offset by lower fees in our annuities business pgim our global asset manager reported record assets under management of 1 3 trillion as well as higher net asset management fees and other related revenues our international businesses increased earnings driven by higher net investment spread results and business growth partly offset by higher than typical expenses turning to slide four i d like to touch briefly on four ways we generate value to our stakeholders in a sustainable way first we are a purpose driven company we strive to make lives better by solving the financial challenges of our changing world and do so for a broad array of stakeholders second in december our board introduced a multi stakeholder framework that extends the board s accountability to investors employees customers and society at large reinforcing the board s commitment and ours to enabling positive change as well as strong financial returns third this multi stakeholder framework is reflected in our continued pursuit of exemplary environmental social and governance practices finally we provide transparency so investors can measure our progress we disclose metrics and targets related to the financial stability board s task force on climate related financial disclosures this includes quantifying greenhouse gas emissions recycling and water usage in addition we publish metrics in accordance with the sustainability accounting standards board we continue to be recognized for our commitment and standards we uphold just last month fortune included us on its list of world s most admired companies for the fifth consecutive year we are proud to have earned the first place distinction in the life and health insurance category each year in closing we continue to move quickly and with conviction to execute on our strategy that we put into place including the three initiatives i have outlined for 2020 with that i ll turn it over to rob for a closer look at our business performance for the quarter and our earnings outlook robert m falzon vice chairman thank you charlie i ll provide more color on how we are executing on our strategy within our u s pgim and international businesses and in our near term earnings growth outlook turning to slide five our u s businesses consist of the workplace solutions individual solutions and assurance iq divisions that produce a diversified source of earnings from fees investment spread and underwriting income our u s businesses have three key priorities for growth first we are investing in transforming our capabilities and the way we work to deliver a better customer experience while realizing efficiencies that will improve our margins second we will continue to pursue targeted growth opportunities including by way of example the non jumbo corporate segment of the full service retirement market and the premier segment of involuntary products offered by our group insurance business and third we remain committed to expanding our addressable market including through workplace financial wellness and assurance iq as a result of the continued thoughtful execution of these priorities over time we expect higher earnings growth and improved returns in the near term we expect underlying earnings in the us businesses to be relatively consistent with current levels as underlying business growth and retirement group insurance and assurance iq offset the impact from low interest rates and the net outflows in our individual annuities business as we maintain pricing discipline we have included a slide in the appendix that provides our expected underlying earnings outlook by business now turning to slide six pgim our asset management business continues to leverage its diversified multi manager model global distribution and affiliated flows to grow in higher value added strategies that serve investors globally with a record 1 3 trillion of assets under management as of year end pgim is a top 10 global asset manager it is the fifth largest investor in fixed income globally and one of the largest in alternative investments with significant real estate and private investment platforms we continue to broaden and globalize our products and capabilities by developing and launching private and alternative investment strategies and expanding in both retail and international markets and as the investment engine of prudential pgim benefits from a symbiotic relationship with our u s and international businesses our investment performance is a key driver of our business success more than 80 of assets under management have outperformed their benchmarks over the last three five and 10 year periods this performance helped us to generate 1 9 billion of net third party flows during the fourth quarter including 1 2 billion of institutional and 700 million of retail net flows in addition pgim rose to the seventh highest ranking mutual fund franchise based on 2019 net flows up from 14th in 2018 pgim s adjusted operating margin of 32 in the fourth quarter was 180 basis points higher than the year ago quarter and has grown over the last three years as we balanced business reinvestment with margin expansion for the full year 2019 pgim had a record level of adjusted operating income that was 4 higher than 2018 and 6 higher after adjusting for business acquisition related costs looking ahead we believe pgim is well positioned to deliver mid to high single digit earnings growth across the cycle driven by its deep asset class expertise while leveraging its scale and reach as a global asset manager and we expect to grow earnings in 2020 despite the absence of the wells fargo fee arrangement that ended last year turning to slide seven our international businesses continue to benefit from our world class japanese life insurance operation where we have a differentiated business model with unique distribution as well as from our focus on other operations in high growth markets life planner sales increased by 17 compared to the year ago quarter this increase was driven by record life planner count and higher sales in brazil korea and taiwan sales for gibraltar were 14 lower than the year ago quarter this primarily reflects lower single pay u s dollar fixed annuity sales in our life consultant and independent agency channels as the recent decline in u s interest rates led us to lower crediting rates in addition we continue to focus on quality distribution the number of life planners as a result has declined the lower life consultant sales were partially offset by higher bank channel sales we continue to innovate new products and implement pricing actions to maintain both sales and our targeted level of profitability total in force for international increased by 3 from the prior year including a 5 increase in life planner and a 1 increase in gibraltar in the near term we expect total in force to grow at a similar level we expect underlying earnings to be relatively consistent with current levels as business growth will offset the impact of low interest rates and with that i ll hand it over to ken ken tanji executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks rob i ll begin on slide eight which provides insight into the earnings for first quarter 2020 relative to our fourth quarter 2019 results we begin with pre tax adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter which was 1 2 billion and resulted in earnings per share of 2 33 on an after tax basis then we adjust for the following items first in the fourth quarter we had favorable variable investment income driven by equity market performance and prepayment income which was a benefit of 135 million second the first quarter is expected to have lower seasonal expenses and implementation costs which will result in a net benefit of 435 million or 0 85 per share and is comprised of two items the fourth quarter included 160 million of seasonally higher expenses and 365 million of implementation costs including the impact from the voluntary separation program as indicated in the 8 k filing on december 17 we expect implementation costs of 175 million in 2020 with about 20 million of these costs in the first quarter and long term compensation expense for retiree eligible employees is recognized when awards are granted which is typically in the first quarter of each year in the first quarter of 2020 we expect this expanse to be about 70 million split between pgim and corporate and another these items net to 0 85 per share third there are other considerations that we we expect will have a 20 million more favorable impact in the first quarter relative to our to the fourth quarter and fourth we anticipate net investment income will be reduced by 10 million assuming reinvestment rates are held flat with the fourth quarter combined this gets us to a baseline of 2 95 per share for the first quarter of 2020 before including the impact of share repurchases business growth and market impacts in 2020 the baseline also includes items specific to the first quarter that reduces eps by approximately 0 15 per share while we have provided these items to consider there may be other factors that affect earnings per share in the first quarter of 2020 i d also like to bring your attention to a few additional items that are included in the appendix on slide 18 we have provided additional information that shows the adjusted operating income roll forward by business and on slide 19 we provided updated information regarding seasonal items by business in addition we have included some other considerations for 2020 on slide 21 regarding corporate and other net costs the yen foreign exchange rate and the effective tax rate now turning to slide nine i ll provide an update on capital deployment liquidity and leverage we feel very good about the overall strength of our capital position we returned 900 million to shareholders during the fourth quarter through dividends and share repurchases which were largely funded by the cash flows generated by our businesses on december 19 we announced the board s authorization to repurchase up to 2 billion of common stock in 2020 in addition we increased the first quarter dividend to 1 10 per share which represents a 10 increase from our dividend in the fourth quarter of 2019 and a 4 4 yield on our adjusted book value we also continue to maintain a rock solid balance sheet our regulatory capital ratios continue to be above our aa financial strength targets and our financial leverage ratio remains better than our target our cash and liquid assets at the parent company were 4 1 billion at the end of the quarter and at the midpoint of our 3 billion to 5 billion liquidity target range we will continue to invest in the growth of our businesses assess acquisition opportunities to build scale or gain capabilities and return capital to shareholders turning to slide 10 and in summary we had numerous accomplishments in 2019 we are focused on executing our key initiatives in 2020 leading to greater earnings in 2021 now i ll turn it to the operator for your questions questions and answers operator thank you your first question comes from the line of nigel dally from morgan stanley please go ahead nigel dally morgan stanley analyst great thanks and good morning i had a question on annuities it s one of the areas that you do expect a decline in earnings in 2020 so i just wanted to check is that said just because of a modest decline in aum because of the anticipated outflows overwhelming market appreciation or is there also an underlying element of some deterioration in the return on assets and if is the latter what s driving that andy sullivan executive vice president and head of u s businesses so nigel thanks for your question this is andy there s really two major impacts that we re seeing in the annuities business one as you pointed out is the outflow that really is coming from we are being very disciplined in our pricing of product and in our return on new sales and if you look backward we had some pretty sizable blocks back in the 2010 to 2012 range so that s creating that outflow and the other thing i would point to though is as that business is rolling across its surrender period we are seeing business go to lower fee tiers and getting fee pressure from that effect ken tanji executive vice president and chief financial officer yes nigel this is ken i d just add i know there s been some questions about the roa our primary objective with the profitability of our annuity business is to achieve a high roe and our variable annuity business is very profitable and that is evident by the higher roe that s in the high teens and that high roe reflects our unique product design our robust risk management and disciplined pricing and our hedging program is highly effective and it results in very stable earnings capital and cash flow even with significant market moves so as a result our earnings capital and cash flow will be less sensitive to markets than the account values and the roa may move as market moves but again our earnings capital and cash flow will be stable and roa is simply an outcome so the decline in rates and the increase in the equity markets while it had an increase in account values had a less meaningful impact on our earnings again due to our robust risk management nigel dally morgan stanley analyst okay got it second question was just on dividends good to see the incremental dividends again this quarter i think that brings your payout ratio to around 35 is there a limit to how high you d like to go or is there incremental upside there ken tanji executive vice president and chief financial officer yes sure so maybe just a little bit of reflection of our capital management and shareholder distribution philosophy that s been very consistent over time and it starts with our free cash flow which is about 65 of after tax earnings this year a little bit better than that and this should we then distribute in both the forms of dividends and share repurchases our dividends have increased actually 12 years in a row now and if you looked at the average increase over the last five years it s been 11 and now that dividend represents as i mentioned in my opening comments a 4 4 yield on book value our board has also authorized 2 billion of share repurchases for 2020 so generally a very consistent approach to our shareholder distributions which balances both dividends and returns of excess capital through share repurchases nigel dally morgan stanley analyst very helpful thank you operator your next question comes from the line of andrew kligerman from credit suisse please go ahead andrew kligerman credit suisse analyst hey good morning so maybe a question on interest rates on last quarter s call you increased your guided interest rate sensitivity to 0 30 of eps impact for a 50 basis point drop in rates and now we ve seen in 2020 well maybe not today but i was estimating 30 basis points so far in 2020 so i just want to make sure there are no changes should we expect a 0 15 to 0 20 negative impact on 2020 eps based on that or are there some other factors at work and with that maybe you could tell us what your new money yields are too on the portfolio ken tanji executive vice president and chief financial officer yes sure so the sensitivity that we gave to interest rates of 50 basis points at 0 30 that s still good so that rough rule of thumb and how you applied it i think that still is appropriate our new money yields in the second half of the year were about 3 65 and you can think of that relative to our and that s in the u s relative to our u s portfolio yield of about 4 2 andrew kligerman credit suisse analyst okay thank you and then just shifting over to the individual life segment and kind of thinking back second quarter you had that 200 plus million charge third quarter there was about 30 million of underwriting income below expectations and in 4q it was about 15 million now below expectations so i m wondering if as we look forward are you comfortable with underwriting assumptions into the year and your sales were really robust at 209 million you cited it as a record since 2013 so what are you selling that you re excited about andy sullivan executive vice president and head of u s businesses yes so andrew it s andy thanks for your question so we would consider our actual to expected in the fourth quarter as in line with our expectations the result was 103 and i would encourage you to think of there s a quarter around that 100 million plus or minus a couple of percent so that we really think that s in line as far as you referenced the assumption updates we re seeing that our business performance has been consistent with the updates that we made in the second quarter shifting over to the new business sales we are very very pleased with the performance of sales in the individual life business as you cited it s best quarter in five years we re probably even more pleased that versus the absolute level in the mix of sales the mix has shifted pretty meaningfully away from guaranteed universal life which obviously is highly interest rate sensitive and over to where almost half of the sales are variable life which has much much less sensitivity to interest rates so pleased with what we re seeing the success is really coming from we have a very very strong brand name we believe our product portfolio is very strong and our distribution system is top notch andrew kligerman credit suisse analyst in term life is that the balance of the sales largely andy sullivan executive vice president and head of u s businesses yes awesome thanks so much operator your next question comes from the line of tom gallagher from evercore isi please go ahead tom gallagher evercore isi analyst good morning just a first question on the assurance iq deal in terms of how are you thinking about the results so far it looks to me based on the disclosure that the revenues are coming in below what was projected initially i think it was 500 million was the 2019 guide and looks closer to maybe 300 million on a full year basis i guess first question is that right and secondly does that cause you to rethink revenue and earnings projections 2020 2021 andy sullivan executive vice president and head of u s businesses so maybe tom this is andy i ll start and then i ll hand it off to ken so as you d imagine these are early days we just closed the acquisition in october but i ll tell you there s a lot of things that we re excited about we re as we sit here today even more excited about the strategic growth potential of this business in fourth quarter we saw very very strong consumer demand flow across the platform we saw 6 5 million shoppers and just to define that for you we define a shopper as an individual that has an absolute intention to buy a financial service product and that s willing to share their contact information with us so we saw 6 5 million shoppers across the platform in 4q that s compared against 3 5 million in the year ago quarter so we re very pleased with the level of consumer flow and consumer demand a very positive for us on that is we have product providers literally lining up of every shape and size that want to go ahead and get on the platform so from a revenue potential perspective we re every bit as strong as we were we are in kind of where we re focused right now is getting those additional products on to the platform as far as your numbers around revenue yes our revenue for the year came in just north of 300 million and really what i would tell you there is we had a lot more consumer demand than we had appointed agents we ll call it capacity on the platform we learned some lessons in the quarter around the effort and energy and time line it takes to get the medicare advantage and under 65 healthcare agents onto the platform i will tell you that we re already well underway in getting those agents appointed for 4q of 2020 so it s a completely rectifiable situation and we re well out in front of it ken tanji executive vice president and chief financial officer yes the only thing i d add there is as you had heard from andy describe this business is in a very high growth phase and we were not expecting meaningful earnings in the near term or in 2020 as a result and so it s early days and we ll report this information to you each quarter and just as andy indicated just a reminder that is a seasonal business primarily fourth quarter loaded tom gallagher evercore isi analyst got it and ken would you say you re sticking to the 700 million revenue projection for 2020 still or is that sort of tbd ken tanji executive vice president and chief financial officer yes given the high growth nature of this business we don t want to get into the practice of updating each and every quarter so again we re going to you re going to see the results as they occur in a separate segment tom gallagher evercore isi analyst okay thanks and then just my follow up is is pru planning on early adopting variable annuity reform at year end 2019 and if not is the plan to do full implementation in 2020 or a three year phase in ken tanji executive vice president and chief financial officer we re going to adopt on the effective date which is january 1 2020 but remind you that we made big structural changes that were very much aligned with the new reform many years ago so we re well positioned and we expect to be very well capitalized before the reform and after the reform tom gallagher evercore isi analyst okay and ken no three year phasing you d fully adopt in 2020 ken tanji executive vice president and chief financial officer fully adopt january 1 tom gallagher evercore isi analyst okay thanks operator next we ll go to the line of erik bass from autonomous research please go ahead erik bass autonomous research analyst hi thank you um so you ve clearly taken some big steps to accelerate the timing of realizing the expense savings you ve talked about can you just help us think about when we ll start to see these in results and where they ll come through i guess whether in terms of the business segments or through in corporate ken tanji executive vice president and chief financial officer yes sure in our 8 k that we filed we gave some information of our belief of the progression of the saves they were modest in 2019 and we provided an estimate for 2020 that 140 million would be realized in the p l in the year those results you can expect to build as we go through the year and you can expect to see them emerge with primarily in the u s businesses and in corporate but throughout those businesses but again because it s a company it s a u s business wide program erik bass autonomous research analyst got it and when you re giving sort of your walk through in the slides of kind of future earnings trajectory am i right that there s nothing really explicitly contemplated there from savings in the businesses ken tanji executive vice president and chief financial officer only what was accomplished in the through 2019 or the first and the fourth quarter and then any future improvement whether it s from business growth or share repurchases or additional expense saves incremental expense saves would not be included in that baseline that s all in the future erik bass autonomous research analyst got it and then you mentioned in the remarks potential actions to continue streamlining your business portfolio and realize that it s premature to say much specific but how would you think of redeploying any proceeds you potentially generate would you look to reinvest these in the businesses or potentially would they be available to return to shareholders charles f lowrey chairman and chief executive officer the answer is yes so what we mean is we ll cross that bridge when we come to it but let me take a step back for a moment and make a more general comment on how we think about capital in particular the optimization of our capital which i think we ve been doing for years so we always look across our businesses both domestically and internationally to ensure that we re optimizing capital deployment and when we see attractive opportunities you ve seen us invest in growth and make acquisitions and you ve also seen us scale back or look for divestitures over the years when there are better uses of capital and then put that capital to use either in growing the franchise or if there aren t opportunities returning it to shareholders so we ll continue to look for ways to optimize capital deployment and to maximize outcomes for our shareholders whether that be in investing in new business opportunities which again you ve seen us do or return capital to shareholders erik bass autonomous research analyst thank you operator your next question comes from the line of ryan krueger from kbw please go ahead ryan krueger kbw analyst hi good morning i guess first have you completed the year end cash flow testing analysis and if so can you give us any indication of the impact ken tanji executive vice president and chief financial officer the statutory filings will come out at the end of the month and so yes that will include our updated cash flow testing or asset adequacy testing you ll see those results when we report them what i d offer you now is given lower rates we would expect some strengthening in our aat reserves or cash flow testing but we have derivative gains or interest rate hedges that offset that and we expect to have rbc ratios that are above our aa financial strength objectives ryan krueger kbw analyst got it thanks and then when you did the second quarter assumption review and had some impacts to the individual life business at the time you talked about reinsurance as being a potential option to improve returns in that business so that s something that you re still contemplating and can you give us any update there andy sullivan executive vice president and head of u s businesses yes ryan this is andy so i would broaden your question and say we re taking a number of actions to strengthen the performance of our life business first and foremost we are working diligently on expense efficiencies and you can think about that in the context of the broader work going on at the company and the 500 million in outcomes we expect over the next couple of years we already talked about the sales which we think is a meaningful will be a meaningful contributor to giving earnings lift over time in the business and then yes you are correct we have been looking at options and we ll continue to look at options from a reinsurance perspective on with the block and what we re looking for there obviously is the right partner and the right terms that make economic sense for us there s nothing currently that we want to report but we ll keep you posted as we go forward ryan krueger kbw analyst all right thank you operator your next question comes from the line of suneet kamath from citi please go ahead suneet kamath citi analyst thanks just focusing on slide 20 of your deck in the international businesses it looks like at least over the next 12 months life planner and gibraltar are expected to be flat which is lower than that intermediate earnings growth guidance you gave at investor day of mid single digits so just want to get a sense of if we stay in this interest rate environment what kind of gets us from flat back up to the mid single digits and sort of over what time frame scott sleyster executive vice president and head of international businesses hi suneet this is scott let me take that so as you pointed out the underlying business fundamentals for our international businesses actually look quite strong as rob pointed out our in force block is growing at about 4 4 to 5 in lp and about 1 in gibraltar unfortunately given the low rate environment for the most part we re giving back a lot of the earnings growth associated in the block and we re continuing to make some portfolio investments on technology and the like so right now i would say over the certainly looking out to this year we think we re going to be closer to flat we hope over time as we make adjustments that ll start to build but i would say even right now looking at the intermediate term we d say we re looking at low single digit growth suneet kamath citi analyst okay thanks and then a follow up is just on assurance iq i think it was mentioned that there are about 6 5 million shoppers in the fourth quarter what should we expect to be the conversion rate of the of that balance in other words of the 6 5 million how many would you expect to actually buy a product andy sullivan executive vice president and head of u s businesses so suneet it s andy i ll take your question conversion rate is a very complex topic so it very much depends on the product mix that s on the platform and as we talked about we are in a phase of rapidly looking out looking to roll new products onto the platform so the conversion rates that we re currently experiencing are going to change quite a bit with that product mix shift as well as as you can imagine with the shopper demand we had but the mismatch with our agent capacity our conversion was lower than we would expect going forward at this point we re not going to put out explicit numbers but hopefully that gives you a way to think about it suneet kamath citi analyst and have you put any pru products on that platform yet i know that was one of your objectives when you announced the deal andy sullivan executive vice president and head of u s businesses yes so it absolutely is one of our primary objectives we have been working diligently to get our simply term life product onto the platform we are ahead of schedule on those plans and we will get that product on the platform in the second quarter of this year and we re very encouraged with our brand name and the quality of our products that will give both assurance and obviously other prudential some lift suneet kamath citi analyst okay thanks operator next we ll go to the line of john barnidge from sandler o neill please go ahead john barnidge sandler o neill analyst thank you have you seen any meaningful acceleration in pgim s u k business post election or demand for product from that market in continental europe andy sullivan executive vice president and head of u s businesses so john this is andy i ll take that question so what i would tell you is in the short term with all the flux that s been going on we haven t seen any meaningful change or lift i would kind of frame it as in many ways the marketplace is a bit hunkered down so as an example on the real estate side we haven t seen a whole lot of capital fundraising and deployment we are absolutely ready no matter how that plays out we have licenses in all the right places and people in all the right places to continue not only serving our current clients but to capitalize on potential opportunities if and when the dust settles john barnidge sandler o neill analyst okay and then my follow up as we look back to sars over 15 years ago in light of the coronavirus do you see any increased demand for your products on the benefits side to note scott sleyster executive vice president and head of international businesses this is scott again on the specific question i would say history would show that any time there s a widespread illness it creates a greater sensitivity among the customer base about the kinds of products that we sell in particular as you know on the international side especially we re very focused on death protection products and so anytime you have something like this that goes on you re very concerned about your employees and your customers and you re taking lots of actions there but i do think there is a follow on effect of greater sensitivity to the products that we offer john barnidge sandler o neill analyst great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of humphrey lee from dowling partners please go ahead humphrey lee dowling and partners analyst good morning and thank you for taking my questions a question related to pgim so looking at your retail flows it looks very strong from an inflows perspective i think it may be even a record number but then at the same time it seems like you have record withdrawals as well i was just wondering if you can provide some color in terms of where you see the inflows and what happened in the outflows and how do you think about it in 2020 andy sullivan executive vice president and head of u s businesses so yes this is andy humphrey so we are very pleased and proud of the retail flows that we saw as i think rob mentioned in his opening we moved up to number seven in the quarter the retail flows are really coming from an expansion of our product portfolio on that platform as well as the work that we ve done around usage from an outflow perspective what i d say is that will tend to be episodic and i think over the long term we feel very very good that due to our investment performance and our range of strategies that we will see a continued upward trend over time charles f lowrey chairman and chief executive officer and humphrey i would just add on the institutional side that those flows can be a little bit lumpy and we saw a couple of clients who want to consolidate this year and sometimes we re the beneficiary of consolidation sometimes we re not and a couple of dominoes tilted against us this year but that doesn t affect how we think about our institutional capability or the quality of flows that we can have going forward humphrey lee dowling and partners analyst that makes sense and then just a clarification of regarding assurance iq so i think ken was talking about the given the growth that you re expecting and then you re not necessarily expecting any earnings from assurance iq in 2020 i just want to make sure that i heard that correctly because i think originally at the time of the announcement you were expecting maybe a 0 10 eps accretion for 2020 so i just wanted to kind of bridge the differences ken tanji executive vice president and chief financial officer yes no i didn t mean to say no earnings i said not meaningful earnings again because of the high growth nature of the phase that they re going through humphrey lee dowling and partners analyst so the 0 10 still kind of i understand you re not going to update guidance or anything like that but is 0 10 still a reasonable expectation ken tanji executive vice president and chief financial officer again we don t want to get in the practice of having to update this every quarter humphrey lee dowling and partners analyst okay all right thank you operator and i d now like to turn the call back to charlie lowrey for any closing comments charles f lowrey

the u s trade deficit fell for the first time in six years in 2019 as the white house s trade war with china curbed the import bill keeping the economy on a moderate growth path despite a slowdown in consumer spending and weak business investment the report from the commerce department on wednesday also showed the trump administration s america first agenda decreased the flow of goods last year with exports tumbling for the first time since 2016 president donald trump who has dubbed himself the tariff man has pledged to shrink the deficit by shutting out more unfairly traded imports and renegotiating free trade agreements trump has argued that substantially cutting the trade deficit would boost annual economic growth to 3 on a sustainable basis the economy has however failed to hit that mark growing 2 3 in 2019 which was the slowest in three years after expanding 2 9 in 2018 the trade deficit dropped 1 7 to 616 8 billion last year declining for the first time since 2013 that represented 2 9 of gdp down from 3 0 in 2018 goods imports tumbled 1 7 last year amid steep declines in industrial materials and supplies consumer goods and other goods the 1 3 drop in exports was led by decreases in shipments of capital goods industrial supplies and materials as well as other goods at the height of the u s china trade war last year washington slapped tariffs on billions of dollars worth of chinese goods including consumer products leading to a decline in imports the politically sensitive goods trade deficit with china plunged 17 6 to 345 6 billion in 2019 the white house has also sparred with other trading partners including the european union brazil and argentina accusing them of devaluing their currencies at the expense of u s manufacturers the goods trade deficit with mexico jumped to a record high of 101 8 billion last year the deficit with the european union also reached an all time high of 177 9 billion tensions in the 19 month u s china trade war have eased with washington and beijing signing a phase 1 trade deal last month the deal however left in place u s tariffs on 360 billion of chinese imports about two thirds of the total as a result goods imports rebounded sharply in december boosting the trade deficit 11 9 to 48 9 billion that month data for november was revised to show the gap tightening to 43 7 billion instead of 43 1 billion as previously reported economists polled by reuters had forecast the trade gap would widen to 48 2 billion in december u s stock index futures were trading higher while prices of u s treasuries were lower the dollar was slightly stronger against a basket of currencies imports rebound in december when adjusted for inflation the goods trade deficit increased 4 3 billion to 80 5 billion in december trade added almost 1 5 percentage points to gdp growth in the fourth quarter exceeding the 1 20 percentage points contribution from consumer spending which accounts for more than two thirds of u s economic activity the economy grew at a 2 1 annualized rate in the fourth quarter matching the pace notched in the july september period in december goods imports surged 3 2 to a seven month high of 207 5 billion after declining for three straight months goods imports were boosted by a 1 7 billion increase in crude oil imports which contributed to a 4 0 billion jump in imports of industrial supplies and materials there was also a 1 2 billion increase in imports of other goods economists believe a 15 tariff on 110 billion worth of chinese goods that came into effect on sept 1 had weighed on imports in the prior months they also say anticipation that the phase 1 trade agreement would roll back the tariffs could have encouraged companies to hold off on imports in late 2019 goods exports rose 0 9 to 137 7 billion in december they were lifted by a 1 5 billion jump in shipments of crude oil as well as a 1 0 billion increase in exports of other goods but motor vehicle and parts exports fell 1 0 billion to 12 4 billion the lowest since november 2016 at 17 1 billion petroleum exports in december were the highest on record

arrived at the podium 2020 election trump plans to use tonight s speech to underscore what he views as his most notable accomplishments including the state of the u s economy expect to hear little from him about his would be agenda for a second term advertisement applause our agenda is relentlessly pro worker pro family pro growth and most importantly pro american applause thank you we are advancing with unbridled optimism and lifting our citizens of every race color religion and creed very high since my election we have created 7 million new jobs 5 million more than government experts projected during the previous administration cheers and applause the unemployment rate is the lowest in over half a century economy while unemployment rate has continued to drop steadily since the obama administration the pace of job creation is beginning to slow as the labor market tightens and businesses hold back on new investments cheers and applause and very incredibly the average unemployment rate under my administration is lower than in any administration in the history of our country cheers and applause if we hadn t reversed the failed economic policies of the previous administration the world would not now be witnessing this great economic success advertisement cheers and applause the unemployment rate for african americans hispanic americans and asian americans has reached the lowest levels in history cheers and applause african american youth unemployment has reached an all time low african american poverty has declined to the lowest rate ever recorded cheers and applause the unemployment rate for women reached the lowest level in almost 70 years and last year women filled 72 percent of all new jobs added cheers and applause the veteran unemployment rate dropped to a record low cheers and applause the unemployment rate for disabled americans has reached an all time low advertisement cheers and applause workers without a high school diploma have achieved the lowest unemployment rate recorded in u s history cheers and applause a record number of young americans are now employed applause under the last administration more than 10 million people were added to the food stamp rolls under my administration 7 million americans have come off food stamps and 10 million people have been lifted off of welfare the trump admin has tightened up the rules for food stamps people are being kicked off the program not necessarily because they re now better off economically cheers and applause in eight years under the last administration over 300 000 working age people dropped out of the workforce in just three years of my administration three and a half million people working age people have joined the workforce cheers and applause since my election the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased by 47 three times faster than the increase for the top 1 advertisement cheers and applause after decades of flat and falling incomes wages are rising fast and wonderfully they are rising fastest for low income workers who have seen a 16 pay increase since my election despite impeachment the economy has been a major boon for president trump a recent indicator of that is the latest gallup poll which has trumpâ s rating at a personal best of 49 percent one of the items gallup pointed to as a factor in trumpâ s personal best approval rating americans have the highest confidence in the economy since 2000 according to gallup cheers and applause this is a blue collar boom blue collar boom is a new campaign line for trump he first used it during his speech at the world economic forum in davos switzerland last month cheers and applause real median household income is now at the highest level ever recorded cheers and applause since my election u s stock markets have soared 70 percent adding more than 12 trillion to our nation s wealth transcending anything anyone believed was possible this is a record it is something every country in the world is looking up to they admire cheers and applause consumer confidence has just reached amazing new highs all of those millions of people the 401 k s and and pensions are doing far better with increases of 60 80 100 and even more jobs and investments are pouring into 9 000 previously neglected neighborhoods thanks to opportunity zones a plan spearheaded by sen tim scott as part of our republican tax cut advertisement cheers and applause in other words wealthy companies are pouring money into areas that have not seen investments in many decades creating jobs energy and excitement applause this is the first time that these deserving communities have seen anything like this it is all working opportunity zones are helping americans like army veteran tony rankins from cincinnati ohio after struggling with drug addiction tony lost his job his house and his family he was homeless but then tony found a construction company that invested in opportunity zones he is now a top tradesman drug free reunited with his family and he is here tonight keep up the great work tony economy trump will end this packed news week by traveling to charlotte n c on friday to speak at a summit focused on the opportunity zones program created by the white house under the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act opportunity zones are â economically distressed that can receive preferential tax treatment under certain circumstances trumpâ s daughter ivanka trump has been a big proponent of opportunity zones cheers and applause thank you tony our roaring economy has for the first time ever given many former prisoners the ability to get a great job and a fresh start this second chance at life is made possible because we passed landmark justice reform into law everybody said criminal justice reform couldn t be done but i got it done and the people in this room got it done 2020 election one of the reasons trump devoted a section of his speech to criminal justice reform is political his campaign believes the issue resonates with black voters a demographic he has long struggled to court behind the scenes white house adviser and trumpâ s son in law jared kushner has been a fierce defender of the first step act â the bipartisan criminal justice reform bill congress passed last year â even when the president has had his own doubts about its saliency with voters for more on trumpâ s push for african american support read this recent story in the new york times cheers and applause thanks to our bold regulatory reduction campaign the united states has become the no 1 producer of oil and natural gas anyway in the world by far cheers and applause with the tremendous progress we have made over the past three years america is now energy independent and energy jobs like so many elements of our country are at a record high advertisement cheers and applause we are doing numbers that no one would have thought possible just three years ago likewise we are restoring our nation s manufacturing might even though predictions were as you all know that this could never be done after losing 60 000 factories under the previous two administrations america has now gained 12 000 new factories under my administration with thousands of thousands of plants and factories being planned or being built economy the u s manufacturing sector actually slid into a decline last year with 12 000 jobs lost in december compared to the month before manufacturing companies added just 46 000 jobs last year overall factory activity had also been in decline for five straight months before just barely slipping into expansion in january according to new data released this week cheers and applause companies are not leaving they are coming back to the u s a cheers and applause the fact is that everybody wants to be where the action is and the united states of america is indeed the place where the action is cheers and applause one of the biggest promises i made to the american people was to replace the disastrous nafta trade deal trade trumpâ s trade agreement with canada and mexico is one of his top legislative accomplishments but its overall economic benefits are expected to be minimal largely because the u s mexico canada deal simply renews and replaces the original nafta which had already eliminated most tariffs in north america its chief economic benefit is shoring up certainty that trade will continue to flow freely on the continent applause in fact unfair trade is perhaps the single biggest reason i decided to run for president following naftaâ s adoption our nation lost 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs many politicians came and went pledging to change or replace nafta only to do so and absolutely nothing happened but unlike so many who came before me i keep my promises we did our job advertisement cheers and applause six days ago i replaced nafta and signed the brand new u s mexico canada agreement into law the usmca will create nearly 100 000 new high paying american auto jobs and massively boost exports for our farmers ranchers and factory workers trade trump has given some behind the scenes insight into picking the name usmca for his trade agreement he said it was easy to remember because of the village people song ymca nobody could remember usmca trump said in january i said think of the song ymca now everybody says it trade the independent u s international trade commission found the pact would create 176 000 jobs across all sectors and raise u s gdp by 0 35 percent by the sixth year after it enters into force that study also found however that when excluding the provisions that reduce policy uncertainty the effect on u s gdp is actually 0 12 percent applause it will also bring trade with mexico and canada to a much higher level but also to a much greater degree of fairness and reciprocity we will have that fairness and reciprocity i say that finally because it has been many years since we were treated fairly on trade cheers and applause this is the first major trade deal in many years to earn the strong backing of america s labor unions trade this is true â the afl cio the nation s largest labor federation â â backed the usmca in the final days but that was only after house democrats worked with trump s trade representative robert lighthizer for several months to negotiate changes to the pact ultimately making it one of the most progressive trade deals ever applause i also promised citizens i would impose tariffs to confront china s massive theft of america s jobs our strategy has worked days ago we signed a groundbreaking new agreement with china that will defend our workers protect our intellectual property bring billions of dollars into our treasury and open vast new markets for products made and grown here in the u s a trade the first phase of trumpâ s new china deal did help calm relations between the two economic giants but it does not address beijingâ s industrial policies or harmful state subsidies â â several of the thorniest issues that led the administration to launch the trade war in the first place it also leaves in place steep tariffs on some 370 billion worth of chinese imports which are hurting consumers and dragging on the u s economy trade increased purchases of american goods are at the heart of trumpâ s preliminary china deal but critics have questioned from the start whether beijing will be able to buy as much as it has promised since the outbreak of the coronavirus even trump administration officials are acknowledging that it will be harder for china to meet those purchasing commitments and implement other reforms it agreed to as part of the first phase of the deal cheers and applause for decades china has taken advantage of the united states now we have changed that at the same time we have the best relationship we have ever had with china including president xi they respect what we have done because quite frankly they could never believe they were able to get away with what they were doing year after year decade after decade without someone in our country stepping up and saying â that s enough â trade the white house had hinted that the president might use part of his speech tonight to lay out the next steps on china trade talks but we didnâ t get any of that here trump had previously said he would be going to beijing to launch the second phase of negotiations â but that was before the coronavirus began to spread widely advertisement cheers and applause now we want to rebuild our country and that is exactly what we are doing we are rebuilding our country as we restore american leadership throughout the world we are once again standing up for freedom in our hemisphere applause that s why my administration reversed the failing policies of the previous administration on cuba much of the trump agenda has been about reversing barack obama s policies on foreign policy trade and environmental regulations anti obama sentiment drives more than you would imagine cheers and applause we are supporting the hopes of cubans nicaraguans and venezuelans the united states is leading a 59 nation diplomatic coalition against the socialist dictator of venezuela nicolas maduro foreign policy edited over a year ago the u s was the first country to recognize venezuelan national assembly leader juan guaido as interim president of venezuela after he declared nicholas maduroâ s re election as illegitimate in an effort to force out maduro the u s has put serious economic pressure on the leader via sanctions yet maduro remains in power cheers and applause maduro is an illegitimate ruler a tyrant who abuses his people but his tyranny will be smashed and broken here this evening is a very brave man who carries with him the hopes dreams and aspirations of all venezuelans joining us in the gallery is the true legitimate president of venezuela juan guaido cheers and applause thank you mr president great honor thank you very much please take this message back that all americans are united with the venezuelan people in their righteous struggle for freedom foreign policy the inclusion of guaido is partly targeted at winning over cuban american and venezuelan american voters in florida a key state in 2020 guaido who is barred from traveling to venezula gave a speech in miami florida this past weekend to a large crowd of venezuelan americans the white house has not announced whether guaido will be meeting with trump while in washington advertisement cheers and applause thank you very much socialism destroys nations but always remember freedom unifies the soul 2020 election part of trumpâ s re election strategy hinges on making the â socialistâ tag stick to his eventual democratic opponent knowing tonightâ s address will attract millions of viewers aides told trump it would be a golden opportunity to underscore his capitalism vs socialism 2020 campaign theme this is a more subdued attack line than what trump supporters normally hear at the presidentâ s rallies thatâ s because the white house wants it to resonate with a broader coalition of voters cheers and applause to safeguard american liberty we have invested a record breaking 2 2 trillion in the united states military defense despite several hefty defense budget increases over the past three years military spending is set to plateau the defense budget would increase by just a few billion dollars in the next fiscal year under an agreement struck last summer cheers and applause we have purchased the finest planes missiles rockets ships and all other military equipment and it is made right here in the u s a cheers and applause we are also getting our allies finally to help pay their fair share cheers and applause i have raised contributions from other nato members by over 400 billion and the number of allies meeting the minimum obligations has more than doubled foreign policy trump came into office attacking nato like many traditional international alliances but he has expressed much more support for the military alliance recently at a nato meeting in london last december trump boasted that he had forced other nations to spend a greater share of their economic output on military obligations it gives him a rare talking point on a foreign policy success just weeks ago for the first time since president truman established the air force more than 70 years earlier we created a brand new branch of the u s armed forces it is called the space force very important defense before space force became a common chant at trumpâ s rallies both democrats and republicans in the house proposed creating a new military space service early in the trump administration still trumpâ s pentagon initially opposed the idea before ultimately embracing a reorganization of the space mission cheers and applause in the gallery tonight we have a young gentleman what he wants so badly â 13 years old â iain lanphier he is an eighth grader from arizona iain please stand up iain has always dreamed of going to space he was the first in his class and among the youngest at an aviation academy he aspires to go to the air force academy and then he has his eye on the space force most people look up at space iain says â i want to look down on the world â cheers and applause but sitting behind iain tonight is his greatest hero of them all charles mcgee who was born in cleveland ohio one century ago charles is one of the last surviving tuskegee airmen the first black fighter pilots and he also happens to be ian s great grandfather cheers and applause incredible story after more than 130 combat missions in world war ii he came back home to a country still struggling for civil rights and went on to serve america in korea and vietnam on dec 7 charles celebrated his 100th birthday cheers and applause cheers a few weeks ago i signed a bill promoting charles mcgee to brigadier general and earlier today i pinned the stars on his shoulders in the oval office gen mcgee our nation salutes you thank you sir cheers and applause from the pilgrims to the founders from the soldiers at valley forge to the marchers at selma and from president lincoln to the reverend martin luther king americans have always rejected limits on our children s future members of congress we must never forget the only victories that matter in washington are victories that deliver for the american people cheers and applause the people are the heart of our country their dreams are the soul of our country and their love is what powers and sustains our country we must always remember that our job is to put america first cheers and applause the next step forward in building an inclusive society is making sure every young american gets a great education and the opportunity to achieve the american dream yet for too long countless american children have been trapped in failing government schools to rescue these students 18 states have created school choice in the form of opportunity scholarships the programs are so popular that tens of thousands of students remain on a waiting list one of those students is janiyah davis a fourth grader from philadelphia education one of the trump administrationâ s most vocal proponents of school choice programs is vice president mike pence who told a crowd of students in wisconsin just last week that he â was for school choice before it was cool â unlike trade immigration and the economy trump has rarely made the school choice a focal point of his stump speech but that appears to be changing tonight the presidentâ s push for a tax break for private and parochial school scholarships is meant to appeal to his fans in socially conservative circles other conservative groups however have criticized the proposal as an unnecessary expansion of the federal governmentâ s role in education cheers and applause janiyah s mom stephanie is a single parent she would do anything to get her daughter a better future but last year that future was put further out of reach when pennsylvania s governor vetoed legislation to expand school choice to 15 000 children janiyah and stephanie are in the gallery stephanie thank you so much for being here with your beautiful daughter cheers and applause but janiyah i have some good news for you i am pleased to inform you your long wait is over i can proudly announce tonight that an opportunity scholarship is going to you and you will soon be headed to the school of your choice cheers and applause now i call on congress to give one million american children the same opportunity janiyah has just received pass the education freedom scholarships and opportunities act because no parent should be forced to send their child to a failing government school cheers and applause every young person should have a safe and secure environment in which to learn and to grow for this reason our magnificent first lady has launched the be best initiative to support a safe and drug free life for the next generation online in school and in our communities thank you melania for your love and profound care for america s children thank you very much this is the first time trump has mentioned his wife s east wing anti cyberbullying campaign be best his modern predecessors each spotlighted their wives projects in their first state of the union speeches read more here cheers and applause my administration is determined to give our citizens the opportunities they need regardless of age or background through our pledge to american workers over 400 companies will provide new jobs and education opportunities to almost 15 million americans my budget also contains an exciting vision for our nation s high schools tonight i ask congress to support our students and back my plan to offer vocational and technical education in every single high school in america cheers and applause to expand equal opportunity i am also proud that we achieved record and permanent funding for our nation s historically black colleges and universities the trump campaign wants to make inroads with african american voters in 2020 viewing even just a few extra percentage points as a potentially major boon in states like pennsylvania wisconsin and florida cheers and applause a good life for american families also requires the most affordable innovative and high quality health system on earth i moved quickly to provide affordable alternatives our new plans are up to 60 less expensive and better cheers and applause i have also made an ironclad pledge to american family we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions health care that protection is currently in limbo the trump administration has actually joined a lawsuit by republican governed states to scrap the affordable care act which includes protections for pre existing conditions the fate of that law wonâ t be decided until after the 2020 elections cheers and applause and we will always protect your medicare and we will always protect your social security always cheers and applause the american patient should never be blindsided by medical bills that is why i signed an executive order requiring price transparency health care the administration recently finalized a rule on forcing hospitals to disclose negotiated rates with insurers cheers and applause many experts believe that transparency which will go into full effect at the beginning of next year will be even bigger than health care reform 2020 election health care has been a dicey political issue for the president he recently lashed out at his hhs secretary in the oval office over bad polling for republicans on health care heading into 2020 cheers and applause it will save families massive amounts of money for substantially better care but as we work to improve american s health care there are those who want to take away your health care take away your doctor and abolish private insurance entirely health care thatâ s a hit at medicare for all the government run health insurance plan that has consumed hours of democratic debates in the 2020 primaries here is how the candidatesâ proposals break down boos 132 lawmakers in this room have endorsed legislation to impose a socialist takeover of our health care system wiping out the health insurance plans of 180 million very happy americans boos to those watching at home tonight i want you to know we will never let socialism destroy american health care cheers and applause over 130 legislators in this chamber have endorsed legislation that would bankrupt our mission by providing free taxpayer funded health care to millions of illegal aliens forcing taxpayers to subsidize free care for anyone in the world who unlawfully crosses our borders the president and his re election campaign have seized on this proposal which gained the support of some 2020 contenders at the first cnn democratic presidential primary debate in a nbc news wall street journal poll conducted last september 62 percent of registered voters rejected the policy of providing taxpayer subsidized health care to undocumented immigrants these proposals would raid the medicare benefits of our seniors and that our seniors depend on while acting as a powerful lure for illegal immigration that is what is happening in california and other states their systems are out of control costing taxpayers vast and unaffordable amounts of money if forcing american taxpayers to provide free health care to illegal immigrants sounds fair to you stand with the radical left if you think we should defend patients and seniors stand with me to pass legislation to prohibit free health care for illegal aliens cheers and applause this will be a tremendous boon to our already strongly guarded southern border where as we speak a long tall and powerful wall is being built cheers and applause we have now completed over 100 miles and have over 500 miles fully completed in a very short period of time early next year we will have substantially more than 500 miles completed 2020 election as the 2020 election kicks into high gear expect to hear trump talk more and more about the building of his long promised border wall even though sections of the wall have proven incapable of standing up to the elements the president sees the growing steel barrier along americaâ s southern border as one of his greatest achievements â and one that his core supporters love to hear about my administration is also taking on the big pharmaceutical companies we have approved a record number of affordable generic drugs and medicines are being approved by the fda at a faster clip than ever before health care thatâ s true but itâ s largely because the fda got a big staffing and resource boost under the generic drug user fee act signed into law by president barack obama cheers and applause and i was pleased to announce last year that for the first time in 51 years the cost of prescription drugs actually went down health care questionable pharmaceutical companies have slowed down their price hikes in the past year but prices definitely havenâ t dropped for the majority of pricey brand name meds one thing we know prices for more than 470 drugs people pick up at the pharmacy rose roughly five percent at the beginning of this year cheers and applause and working together congress can reduce drug prices substantially from current levels i have been speaking to sen chuck grassley of iowa and others in congress in order to get something on drug pricing done and done quickly and properly i am calling for bipartisan legislation that achieves the goal of dramatically lowering prescription drug prices get a bill on my desk and i will sign it into law immediately health care this is the shout out that sen chuck grassley has been waiting for on his bill s 2453 grassley has struggled to rally gop support and pleaded for some white house support for the measure seen as essentially the only bipartisan effort on drug prices right now but the president s words were not quite an endorsement at these remarks house democrats stood holding up three fingers a reference to the house passed drug pricing bill h r 3 the white house doesn t support the measure and sen majority leader mitch mcconnell has said it is dead on arrival in the senate cheers and applause chanting h r 3 this unyielding commitment â drug overdose deaths declined for the first time in nearly 30 years u s life expectancy recently increased for the first time in four years largely due to big drops in fatal overdoses and cancer deaths itâ s a bright spot for trump who has made fighting the opioid crisis a big part of his presidency but itâ s not over tens of thousands of people still overdose each year increasingly from the super potent opioid fentanyl also experts point to rising deaths from other drugs like meth and cocaine as a problem on the horizon applause among the states hardest hit ohio is down 22 pennsylvania is down 18 wisconsin is down 10 we will not quit until we have beaten the opioid epidemic once and for all true but progress has been uneven rust belt states saw some of the biggest overdose death declines while california new jersey missouri and south carolina actually saw big upticks cheers and applause protecting american s health also means fighting infectious diseases we are coordinating with the chinese government and working closely together on the coronavirus outbreak in china tension has actually been building with the chinese government with beijing saying this week that the u s has overreacted and spread panic my administration will take all necessary steps to safeguard our citizens from this threat we have launched ambitious new initiatives to substantially improve care for americans with kidney disease alzheimer s and those struggling with mental health and because congress was so good as to fund my request new cures for childhood cancer we will eradicate the aids epidemic in america by the end of this decade health care trump announced a plan to conquer childhood cancer in last yearâ s sotu roughly a month later he issued a budget proposal that would have slashed 897 million from the national cancer institute but put 50 million more a year toward childhood cancer over the next decade congress ultimately passed a budget that gave the national institutes of health including nci a 2 6 billion increase health care this was also one of the big announcements in last yearâ s sotu â â a pledge to end hiv transmission within the next decade the government is only one year into its plan so itâ s too early to say whether progress has been made but the initiative got a big funding bump in this year s budget cheers and applause almost every american family knows the pain when a loved one is diagnosed with a serious illness here tonight is a special man beloved by millions of americans who just received a stage 4 advanced cancer diagnosis this is not good news but what is good news is that he is the greatest fighter and winner that you will ever meet rush limbaugh thank you for your decades of devotion to our country cheers and applause and rush in recognition of all you have done for our nation â the millions of people today that you speak to and that you inspire and all of the incredible work you have done for charity â i am proud to announce tonight you will be receiving our country s highest civilian honor the presidential medal of freedom this past monday rush limbaugh told his radio audience he has advanced lung cancer â news that rattled the president who is a close friend of the radio host in an emotional moment trump surprised limbaugh who was a last minute guest of the president by awarding him the presidential medal of freedom melania trump placed the medal around limbaugh s next trump told news anchors at the white house for today that he planned to honor limbaugh with the award read more here cheers and applause i will now ask the first lady of the united states to present you with the honor please applause cheers and applause applause rush congratulations thank you kathryn as we pray for all who are sick we know america is constantly achieving new medical breakthroughs in 2017 doctors at st luke s hospital in kansas city delivered one of the earliest premature babies to ever survive born at 21 weeks and six days and weighing less than a pound ellie schneider was a born fighter little ellie kept on winning the battle of life today ellie is a strong and healthy 2 year old girl sitting with her amazing mother robin in the gallery we are glad to have you with us tonight cheers and applause ellie reminds us every child is a miracle of life thanks to modern medical wonders 50 of premature babies delivered at the hospital where ellie was born now survive just an incredible thing thank you very much cheers and applause our goal should be to ensure that every baby has the best chance to thrive and grow just like ellie that is why i am asking congress to provide an additional 50 billion to fund neonatal research for america s youngest patients cheers and applause that is why i am also calling upon numbers of congress tonight to pass legislation finally banning the late term abortion of babies trump has routinely called on congress to pass the pain capable unborn child protection act a bill that would make abortion after 20 weeks unlawful in most cases his latest call for the bill s passage comes two weeks after trump made history as the first sitting u s president to address participants of the annual anti abortion march for life on the national mall late term abortion is not a medical term the senate already voted on a 20 week abortion ban and it didnâ t pass and lawmakers couldnâ t pass another anti abortion bill to ban abortion funds that the president has backed cheers and applause whether we are republican democrat or independent surely we must all agree that every human life is a sacred gift from god as we support america s moms and dads i was proud to sign the new law offering parents in the federal workforce paid family leave serving as a model for the rest of the country much of the federal workforce was granted 12 weeks of paid parental leave as part of the annual defense policy legislation that trump signed in december a proposal initially rolled into the bill by house democrats cheers and applause now i call on congress to pass the bipartisan advancing support for working families act extended family leave to mothers and fathers all across our nation cheers and applause 40 million american families have an average 2 200 extra thanks to our child tax credit cheers and applause i ve also overseen historic funding increases for high quality child care enabling 17 states to help

officers arrested more than 120 000 criminal aliens charged with nearly 10 000 burglaries 5 000 sexual assaults 45 000 violent assaults and 2 000 murders tragically there are many cities in america where radical politicians have chosen to provide sanctuary for these criminal illegal aliens boos in sanctuary cities local officials ordered police to release dangerous criminals to prey upon the public instead of handing them over to ice to be safely removed just 29 days ago a criminal alien freed by the sanctuary city of new york was charged with the brutal rape and murder of a 92 year old woman the killer had been previously arrested for assault but under new york sanctuary policies he was set free if the city had honored iceâ s detainer request his victim would still be alive today the state of california passed an outrageous law declaring their whole state to be a sanctuary for criminal illegal immigrants a terrible sanctuary with catastrophic results in december 2018 california police detained an illegal alien with five prior arrests including convictions for robbery and assault as required by california sanctuary laws local authorities released him days later the criminal alien went on a gruesome spree of deadly violence he viciously shot one man going about his daily work he approached a woman sitting in her car and shot her in the arm and chest he walked into a convenience store and wildly fired his weapon he hijacked a truck and smashed the vehicle critically injuring innocent victims one of the victims is a terrible terrible situation died 51 year old american named rocky jones rocky was at a gas station when this vile criminal fired eight bullets at him from close range murdering him in cold blood rocky left behind a devoted family including his brothers who loved him more than anything else in the world one of his grieving brothers is here with us tonight please stand jody applause jody our hearts weep for your loss and we will not rest until you have justice senator thom tillis is introducing legislation that will allow people like jody to sue sanctuary cities and states when a loved one is hurt or killed as a result of these deadly practices the united states of america should be a sanctuary for law abiding americans not criminal aliens immigration we have entered the stephen miller influenced portion of the state of the union miller is one of trump s main speechwriters but a primary architect of trump s immigration policies and talking points applause in the last three years ice has arrested over 5 000 wicked human traffickers and i have signed legislation to stamp out the menace of human trafficking domestically and all around the globe my administration has undertaken an unprecedented effort to secure the southern border of the united states last week trump announced the creation of a new position inside the white house domestic policy council solely devoted to combatting sex and labor trafficking the president s daughter senior white house adviser ivanka trump has worked closely with outside groups members of the president s cabinet and lawmakers on anti human trafficking policies applause before i came into office if you showed up illegally at our southern border and were arrested you were released and allowed into our country never to be seen again my administration has ended catch and release applause if you come illegally you will now be promptly removed from our country very importantly we entered into historic cooperation agreements with the government of mexico honduras el salvador and guatemala as a result of our unprecedented efforts illegal crossings are down 75 since may dropping eight months in a row applause as the wall rapidly goes up drug seizures rise and the border crossings are going down and going down very rapidly last year i traveled to the border in texas and met chief patrol agent raul ortiz over the last 24 months agent ortiz and his team have seized more than 200 000 pounds of poisonous narcotics arrested more than 3 000 human smugglers and rescued more than 2 000 migrants agent ortiz was promoted to deputy chief of border patrol and joins

applause my administration is also defending religious liberty that includes the constitutional right to pray in public schools applause in america we don t punish prayer we don t ban symbols of faith we don t muzzle preachers and pastors in america we celebrate faith we cherish religion we lift our voices in prayer and we raise our sights to the glory of god just as we believe in the first amendment we also believe in another constitutional right that is under siege all across our country so long as i am president i will always protect your second amendment right 2020 election trump mentions his support for the second amendment as ex new york mayor mike bloomberg â â whose nascent campaign trump has been closely tracking â is making increased gun control a key part of his platform applause in reaffirming our heritage as a free nation we must remember that america has always been a christian nation now we must embrace the next frontier america s manifest destiny in the stars i am asking congress to fully fund the artemis program to ensure that the next man and first woman on the moon will be american astronauts using this as a launching pad to ensure that america is the first nation to plant its flag on mars applause my administration is also strongly defending national security and combating radical islamic terrorism applause last week i announced a groundbreaking plan for peace between israel and the palestinians recognizing that all past attempts have failed we must be determined and creative in order to stabilize the region and give millions of young people a chance to realize a better future foreign policy trump put his son in law jared kushner in charge of crafting a middle east peace plan â â something the president said is one of the toughest deals to make but so far the peace to prosperityâ plan which was introduced last week has not had much momentum critics note it favors israel and places unrealistic conditions on the palestinian people palestinian leader mahmoud abbas called the plan â nonsenseâ and said he was cutting all ties with israel and the united states still kushner defended it as a real offer and said the ball is now in the palestinian s court three years ago the barbarians of isis held over 20 000 square miles of territory in iraq and syria today the isis territorial caliphate has been 100 destroyed and the founder and leader of isis a bloodthirsty killer known as al baghdadi is dead defense u s backed forces early last year retook the last of the territory once held by isis in iraq and syria though officials warn that the terrorist group still poses a threat in the region applause we are joined this evening by carl and marsha mueller their beautiful daughter became a humanitarian aid worker she once wrote â some people find god in church some people find god in nature some people find god in love i find god in suffering i have known for some time what my life s work is using

baghdadi murdered young beautiful kayla she was just 26 years old on the night that united states special forces operators ended his miserable life we received a call in the situation room we were

thousands of american servicemembers in iraq as the world s top terrorists soleimani orchestrated the deaths of countless men women and children he directed the december assault and went on to assault u s forces in iraq he was actively planning new attacks the u s military executed a flawless precision strike that killed soleimani and terminated his evil reign of terror forever the trump administration s strike against soleimani drove the u s to the brink of war with iran â yet it was immensely popular with republican voters eighty five percent said they supported the decision in a politico morning consult poll conducted shortly after the deadly strike last month applause our message to terrorists is clear you will never escape american justice if you attack our citizens you forfeit your life in recent months we have seen proud iranians raise against the oppressive rulers the iranian regime must abandon its pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and needs to work for the good of its own people because of our powerful sanctions the iranian economy is doing very poorly we can help them make a very good and short recovery it can all go quickly â let s see which road they choose it is totally up to them applause as we defend american lives we are working to end american wars in the middle east we have made tremendous progress and peace talks are underway i am not looking to kill hundreds of thousands of people in afghanistan many of them totally innocent trump campaigned on concluding u s wars in the middle east and launched negotiations to end the war in afghanistan at the same time trump has drawn criticism for sending thousands more troops to the middle east over the past year amid heightened tensions with iran it is also not or function to serve other nations as law enforcement agencies these are war fighters that we have the best in the world they either want to fight to win or not fight at all we are working to finally end america s longest

by lucia mutikani washington feb 5 reuters the u s trade deficit fell for the first time in six years in 2019 as the white house s trade war with china curbed the import bill keeping the economy on a moderate growth path despite a slowdown in consumer spending and weak business investment the report from the commerce department on wednesday also showed the trump administration s america first agenda decreased the flow of goods last year with exports posting their first decline since 2016 president donald trump who has dubbed himself the tariff man has pledged to shrink the deficit by shutting out more unfairly traded imports and renegotiating free trade agreements trump has argued that substantially cutting the trade deficit would boost annual economic growth to 3 on a sustainable basis the economy has however failed to hit that mark growing 2 3 in 2019 which was the slowest in three years after expanding 2 9 in 2018 with tensions in the 19 month u s china trade war easing last year s narrowing in the deficit is unlikely to be repeated since that entire drop came from the huge change in the china deficit don t expect further declines in the years to come said joel naroff chief economist at naroff economic advisors in holland pennsylvania the trade deficit dropped 1 7 to 616 8 billion last year declining for the first time since 2013 that represented 2 9 of gdp down from 3 0 in 2018 goods imports plunged 1 7 last year also the first decrease in three years the united states imported 2 4 billion barrels of crude oil the fewest since 1992 as the country significantly reduced its dependence of foreign oil amid a surge in production and exploration it also imported fewer capital and other goods the 1 3 tumble in exports was led by decreases in shipments of capital goods industrial supplies and materials and other goods at the height of the u s china trade war last year washington slapped tariffs on billions worth of chinese goods including consumer products thumping imports the politically sensitive goods trade deficit with china plunged 17 6 to 345 6 billion in 2019 the white house has also sparred with other trading partners including the european union brazil and argentina accusing them of devaluing their currencies at the expense of u s manufacturers but those efforts did little to rein in the goods trade deficit with the eu which reached an all time high of 177 9 billion the deficit with mexico jumped to a record high of 101 8 billion washington and beijing signed a phase 1 trade deal last month the deal however left in place u s tariffs on 360 billion of chinese imports about two thirds of the total goods imports rebounded sharply in december boosting the trade deficit 11 9 to 48 9 billion that month economists polled by reuters had forecast the trade gap would widen to 48 2 billion in december temporary boost when adjusted for inflation the goods trade deficit increased 4 3 billion to 80 5 billion in december trade added almost 1 5 percentage points to gdp growth in the fourth quarter exceeding the 1 20 percentage points contribution from consumer spending which accounts for more than two thirds of u s economic activity the economy grew at a 2 1 annualized rate in the fourth quarter matching the pace notched in the july september period though the trade deficit is expected to swell the economy is likely to continue growing moderately with other reports on wednesday showing a pickup in activity in the services sector and private employers boosting hiring in january the institute for supply management ism said its non manufacturing activity index increased to a reading of 55 5 last month from 54 9 in december a reading above 50 indicates expansion in the services sector which accounts for more than two thirds of u s economic activity the report came on the heels of a survey from the ism on monday showing manufacturing rebounded in january after contracting for five straight months separately the adp national employment report showed private payrolls jumped by 291 000 jobs in january the most since may 2015 after increasing by 199 000 in december private payrolls were likely flattered by unusually mild weather and a seasonal quirk amid signs that overall job growth has slowed the adp report has a poor record predicting the private payrolls component of the government s more comprehensive employment because of methodology differences january s employment report is scheduled for release on friday we are always skeptical of the adp s accuracy and that scepticism is doubled every january because firms tend to purge names from the payroll at the start of the year even though those people may not have done and paid work for that firm for several months said paul ashworth chief u s economist at capital economics in toronto that distortion occasionally used to generate very weak readings at the start of the year but in this case it looks like the adp could have over compensated with an adjustment the dollar rose against a basket of currencies while prices of u s treasuries fell stocks on wall street were trading higher the 3 2 surge in imports to a seven month high of 207 5 billion in december came after three straight monthly declines and reflected a 1 7 billion increase in crude oil imports there was also a 1 2 billion rise in imports of other goods economists believe a 15 tariff on 110 billion worth of chinese goods that came into effect on sept 1 had weighed on imports in the prior months they also say anticipation that the phase 1 trade agreement would roll back the tariffs could have encouraged companies to hold off on imports in late 2019 goods exports rose 0 9 to 137 7 billion in december lifted by a 1 5 billion jump in shipments of crude oil as well as a 1 0 billion increase in exports of other goods at 17 1 billion petroleum exports in december were the highest on record but motor vehicle and parts exports

key tronic corporation nasdaq ktcc q2 2020 earnings conference call february 4 2020 5 00 pm et company participants brett larsen cfo craig gates president and ceo conference call participants william dezellem tieton capital michael hughes sgf capital george melas mkh management operator good day and welcome to the q2 fiscal 2020 key tronic corporation conference call today s conference is being recorded at this time i would like to turn the conference over to brett larsen please go ahead sir brett larsen thank you good afternoon everyone i am brett larsen chief financial officer of key tronic i would like to thank everyone for joining us today for our investor conference call joining me here in the spokane valley headquarters is craig gates our president and chief executive officer as always i would like to remind you that during the course of this call we might make projections or other forward looking statements regarding future events or the company s future financial performance please remember that such statements are only predictions actual events or results may differ materially for more information you may review the risk factors outlined in the documents the company has filed with the sec specifically our latest 10 k quarterly 10 qs and 8 ks please note that on this we will discuss historical financial and other statistical information regarding our business and operations some of this information is included in today s press release and a recorded version of this call will be available on our website today we released our results for the quarter ended december 28 2019 for the second quarter of fiscal year 2020 we reported total revenue of 116 7 million compared to 123 million in the same period of fiscal year 2019 for the first six months of fiscal year 2020 total revenue was 220 million compared to 250 5 million in the same period of fiscal year 2019 however sequentially we did see a 12 million increase in revenue when compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 and we expect revenue growth to continue into the third quarter for the second quarter of fiscal year 2020 net income was 0 8 million or 0 08 per share compared to 1 6 million or 0 15 per share for the same period of fiscal year 2019 for the first six months of fiscal year 2020 net income was 2 4 million or 0 22 per share compared to 3 2 million or 0 29 per share for the same period of fiscal year 2019 as previously announced in january the lower than anticipated earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 was primarily a result of increased factory spending in our juarez metal fabrication departments this spending was necessitated by both new and existing customers exiting their manufacturing arrangements in china and ramping their production in juarez while the near term financial impact was significant the long term relationship with these customers was strengthened by the performance of the juarez facility under extreme pressure additionally we incurred unfavorable foreign currency losses related to the unhedged portion of our mexican labor expenses as a result of the strengthening mexican peso over the quarter we anticipate the unanticipated increase in factory spending adversely impacted our margins for the second quarter of fiscal year 2020 our gross margin was 7 and our operating margin was 1 3 compared to 8 and 2 1 respectively in the same period of fiscal year 2019 nevertheless it is important to note that we have made significant improvements in our operating efficiencies in recent quarters through investments in new equipment several of these investments were made in the metals area and the resulting efficiencies combined with the completion ramps of several new metals programs lead us to expect our margins to improve in the coming periods turning to the balance sheet we continue to maintain a strong financial position despite the production delays in the second quarter and the continued ramp and transfer the new programs we did see a sequential reduction in our inventory including revenue recognition contract assets by 12 2 million or 8 8 from the prior quarter in the third quarter of fiscal year 2020 we expect to see our net inventory levels continue to come more in line with revenue levels at the end of the second quarter trade receivables were up by 3 4 million from the prior period reflecting the increased revenue and dsos remained about 54 days total capital expenditures in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 were approximately 2 3 million we continue to invest in our production facilities smt equipment and sheet metal and plastic molding capabilities as well as improvements in our facilities we plan to make a total of approximately 10 million in capital expenditures during the full fiscal year 2020 moving into the third quarter of fiscal 2020 with the addition of new production capacity we expect more of our new customer programs to ramp and move into production the workload balancing challenges and capacity issues experienced in recent quarters have been largely resolved and we expect revenue to increase taking these factors into consideration we expect that the third quarter of fiscal 2020 will have revenue in the range of 117 million to 121 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 we expect to see some drag on gross margin as we continue to invest in enabling and accelerating the successful ramp of our new vietnam facility we anticipate earnings in the range of 0 13 to 0 17 per diluted share this assumes an effective tax rate of approximately 20 i would like to note that key tronic is working closely with its employees customers and key suppliers to ascertain delays attributable to the recent outbreak of the coronavirus in china potential delays and production and extended trends at times of critical parts could significantly affect results in each of our production facilities in summary while we are disappointed by the disruptions to our earnings in the first half of the year we remain encouraged by our prospects for the future growth our overall financial health of the company is strong and we believe that we are well positioned to win new ems programs and to continue to profitably expand our business over the longer term that s it for me craig craig gates okay thanks brett moving into the third quarter of fiscal 2020 the issues impeding our production efficiencies in the first half of the year have diminished and we see potential revenue and earnings growth in coming periods furthermore uncertainty over tariffs and trade tensions between the u s and china continues to drive a number of existing and new customers to accelerate their plans to transition from china facilities to our expanding facilities in mexico and vietnam we see it as a very positive trend over the longer term as customers see the increasing advantages of our north american and vietnam based production while this transition caused delays in production during the first half of the year many of our current customers are experiencing a positive transition of their business out of china facilities facilitated by our centralized command and control this centralization drastically reduces the risk in time associated with the transfer to our north american in vietnam sites and this allow some leeway to respond to the rapidly changing political and health landscape we significantly advanced the efficiencies of our mexico and u s based facilities in recent quarters and we re increasingly well positioned for the returning tide of north american based customers as they appropriately analyze total cost for overseas production and as a result push production in the both mexico and the u s also we continue to ramp up our production in vietnam while our marketplace remains very competitive we continue to win significant new businesses both from ems competitors and existing customers during the second quarter of fiscal 2020 we won new programs involving consumer medical devices wifi enabled signage and temperature control devices our broader and more diversified customer base lowers the potential future impact of a slowdown by any one customer while we are carefully managing our expenses we have been preparing for growth in coming periods during fiscal 2020 we have continued to invest in our facilities including the expansion of smt sheet metal and plastic molding capabilities in mexico and the u s with respect to integrated electronics and sheet metal centric programs we see very strong growth and few real competitors of our size in north america we also deployed innovative new manufacturing equipment in each of our facilities which has improved efficiencies and has made our production less labor intensive result of this effort has been decreased manufacturing and operating expenses of approximately 3 million annually moving into the third quarter we are continuing to ramp production in our new 86 000 square foot manufacturing facility in vietnam to augment our asian footprint and reduce production costs as well as provide an additional hedge against uncertainty lingering or future trade war with china our steady pipeline of new business opportunities continues to be boosted by our unmatched level of vertical integration our multi country footprint and the excellence our manufacturing sites in comparison to other ems competitors of our size as oems face an increasingly uncertain geopolitical landscape we re uniquely equipped to offer risk mitigation with our vertical integration and manufacturing facilities located in mexico vietnam and u s while industry supply chain shortages pandemic risks and uncertainties about terrorists continue to be a factor we expect revenue growth in the third quarter and remain optimistic about our opportunities for growth going forward this concludes the formal portion of our presentation breton and i will now be pleased to answer your questions question and answer session operator and our first question comes from bill dezellem with tieton capital william dezellem i would like to start with my normal question you have the three three new customers that you referenced what is the size of those and would you also share with us the timing at which you re expecting production to ramp for each of the three craig gates health care one is about 15 million annually should start building that sometime in june find it s pretty hard to get a handle on because it s a new products and new categories we quoted it at around 5 million in the middle of the volume range and the third one is about 5 million also william dezellem let me if i may shift to kind of something that you mentioned there in your remarks relative to the metal shop and reducing your cost i think i heard that you had installed equipment that would reduce costs by 3 million and if that s correct would you talk in some more detail around that craig gates well we talked about an overall reduction of 3 million there was a sizable portion of that in the metal shop and that equipment included some new laser turret combos that are used for cutting sheet metal and the new machines are very expensive but they re also very fast so they cut a lot of labor out by how quickly they can run the lasers through the metal and make yourself part william dezellem and would you kind of relate that to the challenges that you had this quarter with the extra cost in the metal shop i think that was called out and maybe you could actually highlight the size of the or the magnitude of the extra cost in the metal shop and then what this equipment will or won t do to help that challenge in the future craig gates this is going to be a little bit of a story so i m going to have to put it in context for you william dezellem thank you craig gates we had three big customers in the metal shop one of which was completely new one of which was a transfer out of our chinese facility into mexico and out of somebody else s chinese facility in mexico we had split the business in china and the third was an existing one that was ramping a new product the new one that we had never built before was a classic case of a company trying to move a product out of china that they had never really built themselves so as we tried to ramp it starting way back in the june july timeframe we found that the specifications and requirements were not well understood so the ramp was delayed as our new customer started to analyze and understand their specifications and their market requirements for their product and unfortunately even though production startup was delayed the requirements for getting the product installed that their customer weren t delayed so we got squeezed in between when we could actually start to build and when we had to finish the build at the same time we had the customer that was moving part of his business out of china as well as bringing us new business from our competitor out of china trying to ramp their programs in vietnam i mean in mexico and then the third customer had a new product that was launching and all this was happening with the backdrop of the tariffs driving everyone to move in particular lot of metals were back into mexico and or specifically so the competition for employees was intense the availability of skilled employees to run some of the higher tech equipment was intense and the demand for product was also intense and unrelenting so we made the decision that these three customers were part of our future and had been two of them part of our past for quite some time so we decided that we had no choice but to invest in a large amount of overtime a large amounts of hiring expenses large amount of training costs at the same time as we re trying to buy the equipment that would allow us to decrease the amount of skilled labor required to operate the facility under this type of load so when we looked at what we had done when we got done with the quarter we indeed had met the customers requirements they were and are happy with us and continue to bring us business but we had spent somewhere between 1 5 million and 2 million in scrap over time hiring costs training costs and the like that should not repeat in the current quarter our q3 so the equipment we bought and is on which is online now would have diminished the effects of this rush of additional business but it certainly would not have fully mitigated it and we didn t want to buy enough equipment to have managed a peak like this because the peak was largely caused by one customerâ s delay and being able to start his ramp with us william dezellem so would have partially offset but not totally and if i heard you right you said 1 million to 2 million of extra cost and if i just to make the math easy for myself and go with 2 million that 0 16 of earnings impact and so that implies you would have done 16 on top of eight or something like 0 24 in the quarter versus the year range of 13 to 18 is that i am thinking about that right craig gates well it seems like that s possible you took the two rather than the 15 so i d say it s more like the 15 but yes maybe william dezellem okay so if i take the 15 and we add 12 to eight and end up with somewhere closer to 20 versus your 0 13 to 0 18 range craig gates yes william dezellem so big impact and what proportion of that extra cost would you have been able to offset with the new equipment had it been fully installed and you had this confluence of events craig gates probably half william dezellem and then i am curious relative to your customer skybell that previously talked about have all of the ring ads over the course of the holiday season did they benefit skybell their demand in any way that s obvious to you or does that really not applicable for some reason craig gates i believe it is applicable i think that the business schools talk about market creation versus a mature market and when you re talking about creating a new market and you add about the products that go in that market benefit every product in the market so i think that every ring ad benefits the general category of internet doorbells and certainly skybell demand continues to be strong william dezellem iâ ll let someone else ask about skybell iâ ll step back in queue and come back craig gates okay operator our next question comes from mike hughes with sgf capital michael hughes first on china i think you said in the june quarter the chinese facility was responsible for generating about 6 to 7 of your revenue where does that stand at this point brett larsen it s down closer to 4 to 5 now michael hughes okay and back in june when it was up 6 to 7 level i think you said the facility was basically breakeven is it losing a little bit of money at this point brett larsen no it tends to be breakeven michael hughes and where do you envision that percentage a few quarters from now is it going to continue to decline brett larsen we are aggressively looking at new opportunities there to be able to continue to keep the current workforce in china occupied and with enough capacity some of the current 5 to 6 that they are building today is being transferred to that norm as we speak michael hughes and your interest in keeping that facility open is that because you have your purchasing function there brett larsen yes craig gates yes brett larsen regardless the purchasing function will remain michael hughes so is the purchase function can i think that is wholly independent from actually manufacturing product in the facility or not brett larsen yes michael hughes okay brett larsen in fact we support all of our global facilities michael hughes okay and then on the vietnam facility i think in the september quarter you had some revenue did that number ramp sequentially into december brett larsen it did but not meaningful yet we need to continue to accelerate and continue to invest in vietnam michael hughes what are the main gating factors there craig gates so what s going on right now in vietnam again another context for you the product that s coming out of china its going into vietnam is for one customer that customer has hundreds of different products and listings so the cool part about that is that customer made the decision nine months ago that they wanted to be our partner they wanted to pull us into vietnam so they will be moving the vast majority of their business from china to vietnam but it s a process that has to be deliberate as we ramped down the production of those various listings in china and ramp them up in vietnam we have to go through and do a call run on each one of those listings so not only are we hiring people a pace with those call runs we re also relying upon our customer to do the qualification of that product when we ship it to him and say here we go here is your first set out of vietnam do they match what you want so it s an orderly and scheduled process with this one customer that s going along at the pace we want so we re not seeing a big disaster in costs in china nor are we seeing a big disaster in costs in vietnam with having a mismatch of people in each place but the speed in which it goes is limited by how fast that we can create the new listings in vietnam and get them qualified by our customer michael hughes and it s just the one customer that s producing it that one you re producing for it that plan craig gates correct michael hughes and where do you envision that over the next couple of quarters are you going to add customers or is this going to be the principal customer for that facility craig gates the intention is that we will be adding customers there were four tours scheduled over there in the next two months for prospective customers to tour the facility and make their decisions on what they re going to do with their products with what s going on with the virus those tours have been delayed so we re in a state of kind of suspended animation right now but the intent for sure is to ramp vietnam with more customers and certainly the interest has been very high from the day we announced it we had customers theyâ ll tour the empty building so iâ m confident there will be quite a bit of business and growth in vietnam it s just going to be on a hold until everybody gets done being sick michael hughes and did that facility put a bit of money in the december quarter brett larsen it did michael hughes and will that loss be larger in the march quarter brett larsen it will be michael hughes materially brett larsen probably a penny or two worst than it was this last quarter michael hughes and then i asked this question last quarter i ll ask it again i don t know this is i think the third or fourth quarter in a row where there have been issues and i think bill just ran through the math on what the earnings would have been if you hadn t had the issues in mexico and he came up with about 0 20 and you re saying maybe there s a penny or two in vietnam this quarter that gets you to 0 18 so is there more conservatism in the guidance for the current march quarter then you ve put in the guidance for the past few quarters craig gates we re getting sick i haven t just barely squeaked by so i hope there s more conservative as you say the last four quarters have been one damn thing after another we re hoping that doesn t happen but we ve already got the coronavirus staring us in the face that we didn t plan on when we issued the guidance so michael hughes sure craig gates so this will be the fifth or one damn thing after another michael hughes right right and then one last question from me the 3 million number that you talked about just so iâ m clear on that are you saying kind of starting in the march quarter rather you ll start to save 750 000 a quarter is that how to think about it or i m not understanding that correctly craig gates we actually started to save that in the beginning of this current quarter so october timeframe but it got swarmed out by our overtime and other expenses so that s weâ re expecting to get some help from that as we look at what happens in q3 also michael hughes and i have one last metric that you ve provided over the last couple quarters what s the new customer revenue that s expected to ramp over the next 12 months do you have that number handy i think you said it was 75 million last quarter craig gates i didn t recalculate it again because it s gotten bigger and i m happy about it so i forgot to calculate it but it has improved rather than diminished michael hughes and any success bidding out that businesses at higher margins yet or is it just the competitive landscape is such that hasn t happened craig gates i would say in general there is a little bit less pressure and a little bit less of you know what an ebit is do you want that michael hughes no craig gates no okay michael hughes somewhat like a reserve auction craig gates yes there doing the same thing so i d say there s less of an ebit feel to the marketplace right now as many many people are having their ceos and boards make proclamations that goes something like we will have 25 of our business relocated from china by this time next year we hear and see a lot of that going on and that makes it a little bit less of a buyerâ s market and a little bit more of a seller s market it s not like happy days are here again and we re all running to the bank but it is a little differen6t than it was a year ago operator and our next question comes from george melas with mkh management george melas i have a few questions hey and maybe that just sort of a corollary question to one question that was just asked if you anticipate 75 million of new revenue in the next 12 months do you have a sense so of how much revenue are going to flow out of your topline brett larsen we have a sense of it but we don t talk about it because anytime we try to make predictions that are longer than a quarter away well you ve seen we can t even make predictions a quarter out one damn thing after another so we stay away from talking about what s going to happen in the next year george melas but can you give us sort of a sense i mean do you expect it to be meaningfully less than 75 million or if you look at historically what is and i know that historically probably is there is no real historical pattern that is there sort of an attrition rate that is something that you think is normal for you or your industry craig gates if you look at the history of the company and the industry if you try to put averages on attrition rates it doesn t really do any good because they tend to happen lumps lumpily if that s a word george melas yes craig gates i can tell you that there have been times when you guys have asked me the question do we see risks of a big customer leaving or significantly diminishing and we say yes we re concerned about a couple and there been times when you all have asked me that same question and then i say i don t see anything that s what i would call a significant near in risk so when we look out right now we see no big customer who has had a significant competitive risk of leaving us i do see risks of marketplaces changing and customers failing or succeeding as some of that 75 million plus is new pieces of business that are that are young companies but we can t say for sure what s going to happen with them but right now i don t see any big significant piece of business that s at risk of competitive threat george melas three quick questions regarding numbers in particular and brett i ll just scale three of them and then maybe you can answer them the sg a was down quite a bit sequentially and i m just wondering if there was to need any sort of benefits in there or is that s a good runway going forward the interest expense also was down i think 180 000 sequentially so same question for that and then the impact of the strengthening pay so how much was that and does that flow primarily to cost of goods sold and what do you expect in coming quarters brett larsen great so i think as far as sg a it was down slightly sequentially looks like about 150 000 i wouldn t give a lot of credence to that there was no really one time offsets that went through during the quarter i would anticipate a slight uptick back to similar levels as we did in the first quarter roughly just under 5 or about 5 million roughly for sg a george melas okay brett larsen interest expense some of that is due to the fact that we were able to decrease the level of inventory that we re carrying during the quarter that of course has a direct relationship on the average amount of debt that will carry i m hoping to continue to drive less of our dollars tied up in inventory going forward but i would expect again that this quarter we re going to have roughly 0 5 million of interest expense george melas okay craig gates now george you didn t really ask the question but i kind of i want to say this so everybody at least is on the phone call hears it we don t know what s going to happen because china is not back from chinese new year so we already see that shipments of parts have been missed boats that should have left the dock and have not left the dock as this could be quite troublesome i guess for everybody in the world including us because if we can t get one part we can t build all the skybellâ s in the world or whatever else it is we re trying to build so we re in quite a bit more of a unknown situation today than we normally are during these calls based upon what s going to happen with parts and how fast all of the chinese suppliers are going to come back online george melas and then just maybe on brett on the higher labor costs that you mentioned due to the unhedged portion of your base or exposure can you say brett larsen sure george melas how much that was i mean if the base are we going to have these levels does that continue brett larsen so we try to hedge a majority of our mexican peso risk it so happens that this last quarter we had roughly two thirds of those expenses hedged so that remaining third we ended up having to spend more for those mexican pesos by roughly 4 and ended up having about a 0 02 impact on our earnings we re looking similarly to this third quarter the mexican peso has not really moved from the first of the calendar year so i would expect a drag on earnings of that roughly 200 000 250 000 during the quarter during this quarter as well operator our next question comes from bill dezellem with tieton capital william dezellem brett you mentioned something in your opening remarks that i didn t fully follow and it sounded like it could have been important but you made reference to something happening with inventory i thought you mentioned a 12 million number would you go back and tell us what it was that you said and what the significance is of that brett larsen sure sequentially we re able to reduce the amount of inventory and contract assets by 12 2 million so contract assets are essentially finished goods that weâ re able to recognize the revenue on due to the fact of new revenue recognition standards that were recently passed this last year really if you look at that as just inventory working capital that key tronic has invested in we really were able to reduce that working capital by 12 2 million or 8 8 during the quarter william dezellem so i m following the inventory reduction contract asset reduction but then you mentioned asc 606 revenue recognition where does that come into play brett larsen so that is what causes that contract asset so contract asset is essentially a future receivable it really is the amount of inventory that you have still in your possession that youâ ve recognized as revenue william dezellem and so if you reduce and i apologize for being a slow pony here but if you reduce that contract asset the implication on revenue is what brett larsen it s a decrement to revenue william dezellem so make this easy for me if you would brett contract assets went down how much sequentially brett larsen 5 million william dezellem so am i understanding correctly that that implies that you that your revenue was 5 million lower than it otherwise would have been had your contract assets been flat brett larsen yes that is correct william dezellem so hold on here so that means instead of having 117 million revenue you would have had closer to 122 million revenue brett larsen that is correct william dezellem and is that revenue that we should apply a normal margin to and meaning that you would have had earnings that would have been typical of your income statement on that extra 5 million in revenue brett larsen i have to be careful there because of the fact that essentially we shipped more product than what we built so you re not going to get the absorption the manufacturing absorption on that 5 million william dezellem okay brett larsen yes the portion of the typical 3 gross margin i d say probably 5 incremental william dezellem so basically if we take 5 of 5 million thatâ s 250 000 somewhere in that neighborhood and if we tax affect that and divide by 10 9 million shares that s another couple of pennies impact on the quarter brett larsen yes william dezellem and is that something that we re going to need to deal with now going forward or is there something special about the initial implementation of asc 606 that â then kind of evens out here with time brett larsen unfortunately that s probably some something we re going to have to look at each and every quarter william dezellem okay brett larsen so it does impact the amount of recognized revenue based on the level of finished goods that you have on hand at the end of the quarter william dezellem understood okay and it s only finished goods or does it include wip brett larsen it does include wip william dezellem and does it include raw materials brett larsen it does not so wip and finished goods that you have substantially completed before quarter end that you have a customer purchase order for under the new asc 606 revenue recognition your record the revenue william dezellem okay so you just said that if you had a purchase order for it so you re saying if â you re building inventory whether it be wip or finished goods but you do not have a purchase order you may have a handshake or some other sort of contractual agreement but not a purchase order then it does not come into play brett larsen that is correct william dezellem okay so i won t debate the wisdom of the accountants here let me shift to a new line of questioning if i may relative to the announcement that you had this quarter about being named one of the top 10 metal manufacturers have you seen any benefit from that yet where potential new customers are calling you simply because they now know that you re one of the top 10 according to one survey brett larsen no william dezellem so it makes for a nice press release but no business benefit brett larsen you canâ t say you have no business benefit you just â i can t tell you with 100 degrees percent of sure this â that somebody who called us didn t do it because it was they read it nor can i tell you that they did do it because they read it william dezellem fair point okay thank you and then lastly one of the earlier questioners talked about the amount of business ramping in the next 12 months i d like to go further back into the prospect pipeline how would you characterize that prospect pipeline today versus one year ago brett larsen i d say as for my comments on pricing and competitive pressures the prospect pipeline continues to strengthen pressures on people to come out of china the availability of vietnam are all adding up to improvement in the pipeline along with the additional sales expenses that we started to put in place about a year and a half ago william dezellem craig what sort of magnitude are you looking at here in terms of increasing that pipeline craig gates well it s pretty hard to say to give you a magnitude number started trying to probability weight all of the open quotes and that number keeps getting bigger it s probably 20 30 bigger than it was a year ago william dezellem great thank you both and good luck with not having the coronavirus cause a hiccup here operator our next question comes from mike hughes with sgf capital michael hughes thanks for taking my follow ups question for you just on your customers demand forecasts could you just speak to how they look today versus maybe a few quarters ago and kind of break it up between consumer and markets and then industrial craig gates i ll try so one of our larger customers is heavily in the consumer health care market and they re right now are looking for a massive upside which we don t know if we can fulfill because we don t know if we can get the parts to do that our industrial customers are you know what i m not going to try this i m going to give you the metric that i actually use to figure out what s going on at any given time if you look at a couple of weeks and look at the phone calls we get and i get from our customers i classify that as a positive week a neutral week or negative week a year ago this time just about every week was negative everybody who called was trying to push business out cancel orders delay orders flow down ramps try to cut their inventory back for the past three months it s been a better than a neutral i d say a slight positive probably at two out of a scale of 10 of how positive i ve seen it in terms of the incoming calls for people looking to pull stuff in speed it up or get more michael hughes so you referenced the healthcare customer and just curious you might not be able to fulfill that because of the coronavirus issue or just their expectations aren t reasonable given the capacity you have in place or what s the issue craig gates its parts and its parts due to the coronavirus issues so it s kind of the world s biggest ironic situation is the coronavirus has driven all this demand that the coronavirus may standing us from fulfilling the demand michael hughes so something like a thermometer or something like that might be driven by the coronavirus and you can t get the parts for it craig gates any kind of a consumer healthcare item same boat michael hughes and then on the operations side can you just speak to not by name but it s the same individual that s been running mexico over the last few years still in place i m just wondering if there been any operational changes there as you ve ramped the business craig gates the person on site has been there for almost two years now we had our vp of ops retired at christmas and we had orchestrated that chain so it began at the beginning of the christmas quarter so that guy is been around the company for 20 years but it s stepping into a new role and taking on vp of ops for job michael hughes okay and who will fulfill his position craig gates he had two new tenants that are both getting promoted michael hughes and then just last question for you do you have the operating cash flow and capex number for the quarter brett larsen yes i do just one second capex was roughly 2 million for the quarter cash provided got a year to date of 8 million from operations michael hughes and what s the capacity on the revolver if revenue actually ramps here over the next few quarters let s say i know you re not putting us out there but let s say it ramps still 130 million level do you have the wherewithal on the revolver to finance that growth brett larsen we actually were able to increase the revolver during the quarter so we feel confident in the amount of capital that weâ ll have available michael hughes but can you say where it went from and to brett larsen 45 million to 55 million in the resolver michael hughes and was that in response to what you re seeing your pipeline or what drove that decision brett larsen with the expectation of some revenue growth weâ ll require some additional investments michael hughes on the capex side brett larsen no on the working capital side operator our next question comes from george melas with mkh management george melas i m just looking at the revenue decline year to date versus a year ago and craig as you look at that are there areas there were you very surprised and are there clearly you ve grown your metal shop and your metal fabrication are there specific identifiable part of the business that have declined or is it pretty much sort of or across the board or was there no real pattern craig gates it was mainly due to two customers both of whom have lost market share in their business and as we were a large part of their production our revenue went down accordingly george melas so it s very much there their sort of their performance that is impacting you craig gates well there is those two those two were identifiable but then across and then across the business as i talked about before that the gates factor of positive versus negative because we had across the board softness at the during the may through october timeframe there is general delays and people our customers anyway pretty much across the board wanting to push everything out that turned round in terms of the calls coming in like i said about october but what i found to be really interesting is we visited one of our largest electronic components distributor who are into billions of dollars of revenue per year and got to spend some time with their head economist and got into a room interesting discussion because he recognizes that the contract manufacturers of the world are kind of a leading indicator so he does a lot of modeling and data gathering on their order patterns and he was seeing the beginning of an upturn in october broad based and we were both pretty interested to see that the gates factor was kind of matching all of the economic analysis he was doing and so now he is giving me his analysis every month and his analysis is kind of matching up with what we see as the calls come in positive negative or neutral george melas can we call that the craig gates index from now on craig gates i m not sure i want my name associated it so maybe we should call it something else george melas okay we ll call it the brett larsen index okay so in a way and i m sort of it seems like you re getting more competitive on the metal fabrication side but youâ re not losing ground in other areas of the business or youâ re not shedding or deemphasizing other areas of the business are you brett larsen no craig gates no brett larsen not at all operator gentlemen there are no further questions in the queue at this time craig gates okay well we thank everybody for joining us today and look forward to talking with you next quarter end operator this concludes today s call thank you for your participation you may now disconnect

rick richard h fleming director chairman of the board interim chief executive officer thank you deb i m pleased to be joining all of you today let me take a moment to introduce myself i have been with columbus mckinnon as a director for almost two decades so i m quite familiar with the company its products and its market before my retirement from usg corporation in 2012 i was its executive vice president and chief financial officer usg had about 3 2 billion in revenues at that time i was usg s cfo for about 18 years and i was employee of the company or its subsidiary masonite corporation for approximately 38 years so most of my career has been spent in the building materials and construction industry i m currently a director of boise cascade company which is listed on the new york stock exchange as well as oe holdings a private company while my role as the interim ceo of columbus mckinnon was not expected i m honored to be leading this team while we are conducting our search for a new ceo these are exciting times at columbus mckinnon we have a solid motivated leadership team at the helm we are delivering on our promises and we have excellent momentum with our blueprint for growth strategy in short our future is bright so with that let s turn to our review of the quarter we have deployed our blueprint for growth strategy for about three years and the solid results of our third quarter demonstrate its continued effectiveness margins expanded and earnings and return on invested capital increase despite the headwinds related to the contraction of the industrial market even though we experienced lower volumes we achieved our 11th consecutive quarter of year over year margin expansion with our gross margin increasing 20 basis points to 34 earnings per share were 0 63 and adjusted earnings per share grew 5 to 0 64 earnings growth was driven by our 80 20 process which contributed approximately 5 7 million to operating income as a reminder contributions from 80 20 are not only reflected in our cost structure but also in our top line with strategic pricing and our priority customer account program with the 80 20 process we have been able to offset industrial market headwinds and continue to invest in our growth initiatives our strategy plus great execution by the team to achieve our financial targets adjusted ebitda margin expanded 100 basis points to 15 2 for the quarter and 16 1 year to date roic also improved by 140 basis points to 11 9 the third quarter also demonstrated our ability to generate substantial cash flow over the cycle in total we generated 32 4 million in cash from operations during q3 and as greg will discuss we have raised our expected free cash flow target for the year to 75 million to 80 million we have used this cash to further reduce debt our leverage ratio is now just 1 3 times adjusted ebitda which is well ahead of our target so our balance sheet provides excellent financial flexibility to pursue our blueprint for growth strategy to strengthen our earnings power and to continue to transform our business model now turning to slide 4 i will discuss in more detail the progress we re making on phase ii of our strategy as noted the simplification of our business with 80 20 contributed approximately 5 7 million and operating income during the quarter and although we have been deploying the 80 20 process for several years we still have quite a bit of runway left and a long list of projects to further strengthen our earnings power we have realized approximately 14 8 million in contributions operating income year to date and we are very confident that we will achieve our goal of 18 million for fiscal 20 while it is sometimes difficult to see the impact of 80 20 in the face of the income statement due to the many factors that affect the p l it s contributions can be seen in our margin performance and ability to manage through the headwinds we believe that our performance is measurably improved over where we would have done historically our blueprint for growth strategy has provided us with strategic direction and focus while e pas which is our operating business system that incorporates 80 20 has us with the tools and discipline to execute well as a result during the third quarter we were able to offset much of the impact of lower volume and under absorption in our factories while continuing to realign our cost to focus on growth through our product development activities new marketing programs and our investment in our digital initiatives so progress we continues to be made on the transformation of our earnings profile turning to slide 5 i ll cover in more detail some of our investments in organic growth to ramp the growth engine in december we announced that we have formed a controls and automation center of excellence that is dedicated to globally expanding our automation product and service portfolio the center combines our skills of lifting specialist with the technology of our magnetek brand that enables smart movement to create solutions to solve our customers high value problems with the creation of the center we can leverage these capabilities across more customers and markets of note the center will have both testing facilities and the ability to provide our customers with hands on experience with our solutions we are also launching new products such as our intelli crane systems which incorporates controls that can provide up to 30 improvements in productivity for critical applications in addition our addressable market has been expanded by the certification in the us of our explosion proof hoists and related products the increased lifting capacity gain with the stahl brand of wire rope hoist and unique offerings of our magnetek drives and controls also it s important to note that not all new products are digital we are bringing innovation to our manual industrial products as well the utility lever hoist that we will be launching this summer has an integrated safety brake that eliminates the requirement for manual installation of chain safety stock if you can imagine being a lineman working dozens of feet in the air replacing transmission lines you would appreciate the safety features that our new tool provides with that i will now turn it over to greg to review our financial results in greater detail gregory p rustowicz vice president finance and chief financial officer thank you rick good morning everyone on slide 6 net sales in the third quarter were 199 4 million as you know we completed three divestitures last fiscal year which reduced sales this quarter by 9 million compared to last year foreign currency also continue as a headwind and reduced our sales by 1 7 million adjusted for fx and the divestitures we saw sales volume declined by 10 6 million or 5 2 while volume was down our pricing power was evident as we saw pricing improve by 1 6 which was the same amount as last quarter about half of this pricing was a result of our 80 20 strategic pricing initiatives let me provide a little color regarding sales by region for the third quarter we saw sales volume decline in the us by 4 2 this was partially offset by price increases of 1 7 sales outside of the us were down 6 5 adjusting for the effects of divestitures solid price improvement of 1 4 partially offset a volume decline of 6 2 sales volume was down in emea latin america and canada but up in the apac region as a result of a large rail project the weakness we saw in emea was in both our short cycle and project businesses let s now review orders and backlog our short cycle business continued to be affected by the contraction of industrial markets this headwind impacted our project business during the december quarter as well adjusted for divestitures orders were down year over year by 9 5 overall it is important to note that quoting activity remains high in both the number of quotes and dollar value but our sense is that projects are being somewhat delayed especially in the us as a result backlog was reduced to 125 million at the end of december while the markets are certainly a headwind we believe that our strong market position and leading brands will dampen the effect of the industrial market slowdown we continue to focus on customer responsiveness and ramping the growth engine as rick discussed we have formed an automation division which will introduce new products that will expand our addressable market and grow share in key markets on slide 7 our gross margin was 34 in the quarter this is 20 basis point expansion in gross margin from a year ago and our 11th consecutive quarter of year over year margin expansion on a gaap basis as rick mentioned earlier we benefited from the 80 20 process which drove 5 7 million of gross profit expansion through strategic pricing indirect overhead reductions and certain volume gains at our targeted accounts this benefit was more than offset by the impact of the divestitures lower sales volume and mix and higher medical cost and lower fixed cost absorption or factories due to inventory reductions which are included in the productivity net of other cost changes category on the bridge let s now review the quarters gross profit bridge third quarter gross profit of 67 9 million was down 3 5 million compared to the prior year adjusted for the divestitures we did see gross profit expansion from pricing net of material cost inflation and tariffs were lower than the prior year as we imported less chinese products we incurred 500 000 of one time costs for the factory closures in ohio and china foreign currency translation also reduced gross profit by 600 000 productivity net of other cost changes was negative 2 2 million this was the result of 1 1 million of higher medical costs and the impact of reducing the inventories by 7 million which negatively affected fixed cost absorption in our factories as shown on slide 8 rsg a was 43 8 million in the quarter or 21 9 of sales rsg a was 3 8 million lower than the previous year period the reduction in rsg a was due to several factors the impact of the divestitures reduced rsg a by 1 million and the benefit of fx of approximately 400 000 in addition our g a costs benefited from a 2 million reduction in stock compensation expense from the departure of our previous ceo while we are controlling rsg a costs as macroeconomic conditions create headwinds we are also actively investing for growth in key initiatives we continue to invest in product development marketing and digital projects while reducing costs in other parts of the organization taking this into account we are forecasting our third quarter rsg a to be in a range of 45 million to 45 5 million turning to slide 9 adjusted operating income grew 1 1 when you normalize for the divestitures adjusted operating income grew 5 7 to 23 1 million adjusted operating margin was 11 6 of sales 110 basis point improvement over the prior year with our blueprint for growth strategy and specifically our 80 20 process we were able to grow adjusted operating income despite an overall decline in revenue of 8 3 which is outstanding operating leverage as you can see on slide 10 gaap earnings per diluted share for the quarter was 0 63 adjusted earnings per diluted share was 0 64 compared with 0 61 in the previous year an increase of 0 03 per share or about 5 on a gaap basis our effective tax rate for the quarter was 12 8 as we partially reverse the deferred tax asset valuation allowance in the amount of 1 9 million this valuation allowance was originally recorded in fiscal 2019 relating to certain foreign tax credits generated by the one time transition tax as a result of the tax cuts and jobs act we reversed the valuation allowance and the foreign tax credits utilized in our fiscal 2019 federal income tax return with this benefit we are now expecting this year s full year tax rate to be approximately 21 to 22 on slide 11 we continue to expand our adjusted ebitda margin for the quarter our adjusted ebitda margin was 15 2 an increase of 100 basis points over last year we re also making progress and driving our roic higher and are now at 11 9 an increase of 140 basis points from last year s third quarter this progress demonstrates that we are tracking our blueprint for growth strategic goals to achieve a 19 adjusted ebitda margin in fiscal 22 and achieve an adjusted roic in the mid teens moving to slide 12 one of the hallmarks of columbus mckinnon is its ability to generate cash throughout this business cycle net cash from operating activities for the quarter was 32 million which was a year over year increase of 6 million or 24 year to date we have generated 63 5 million of free cash flow this represents about 94 of the free cash flow we generated last fiscal year and we still have one quarter to go consequently we are raising our free cash flow guidance to 75 million to 80 million for this fiscal year turning to slide 13 our total debt at the end of the quarter was approximately 252 million and our net debt was 168 million our net debt to net total capitalization is now approximately 26 we repaid 20 million of debt in the third quarter and reduced our term loan debt by nearly 185 million since acquiring stahl in january of 2017 we made excellent progress delevering and have achieved a net debt to adjusted ebitda leverage ratio of 1 3 times while providing us the financial flexibility to advance into phase three of our strategy we expect our leverage ratio to be 1 1 times to 1 2 times by fiscal year end let me reiterate on page 14 our thoughts on capital allocation we will continue to use our financial flexibility to invest in growth initiatives we also invest in capex projects to provide good cost savings as these will be accretive to our overall financial objectives while we have achieved our net leverage target we will continue to use our surplus cash to pay down debt and delever the balance sheet for the remainder of this fiscal year we plan to deploy capital for smart m a as we move into phase three of our blueprint for growth strategy we also plan to pay a dividend that is consistent and grows over time our final priority will be share repurchases that we would consider opportunistically as we weigh our other capital allocation priorities please turn to slide 15 and i will turn it back over to rick richard h fleming director chairman of the board interim chief executive officer thanks greg i would now like to discuss our fourth quarter fiscal 20 outlook since half of our business is short cycle it is our policy to give top line guys only one quarter out right now based on the continuing softness in the manufacturing economy and our order trends and backlog as we entered the fourth quarter we expected that our q4 revenue will be essentially flat with the third quarter and in the range of 196 million to 201 million this level implies a reduction of 5 to 7 from the fourth quarter of last year however i want to assure you that we are working hard to mitigate these headwinds on both our top and bottom lines and to continue to deliver strong performance during the slowdown finally i should mention that there are a few early indications that suggest market conditions are starting to improve for fiscal 21 for example we recently received a large automation system order a large crane order and several rail project orders it is too early to call it a trend but does suggest that confidence levels maybe firming having said that we re not waiting for the recovery as mentioned it is our job to maximize our performance under any and all economic conditions here are a few examples of what i m talking about we completed the closure of our china facility at the end of december ahead of schedule we expect about 1 million in annualized savings beginning in the fourth quarter from that effort we are on track with the closure of our second facility in ohio by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 21 there ll be an additional 5 million in annualized savings when that is completed since implementing the blueprint for growth strategy we have reduced the number of facilities by six from 22 to 16 including the lisbon ohio consolidation which is in process in total these factory consolidations would generate about 8 million in reduced cost and as noted earlier we believe that we are well on track to achieve our goal of 18 million in contributions to operating income from the 80 20 process in fiscal 20 we also have further business realignment efforts under way that we expect will provide additional cost savings including projects to drive operational excellence improve our customer responsiveness and reduce indirect costs especially we expect that 80 20 will continue to provide solid incremental contributions again in fiscal 21 that will further enhance our earnings power longer term we believe that the simplification of the business and our focus on operational excellence combined with our self funded investments in talent innovation and growth initiatives will enable us to achieve our goals with a 19 ebitda margin and mid teens roic by fiscal year 22 now let me take a moment to update you on our search for a new ceo which is well under way we re looking for a high performance chief executive officer who can continue the momentum that we ve built with our blueprint for growth strategy and who can lead our simplification operational excellence and ramping the growth engine initiatives our new ceo will also be tasked with taking our operating disciplines and business operating system e pas to the next level in addition to a strong operator we re looking for an individual who s experienced in developing and executing organic growth opportunities portfolio optimization and m a to date we are encouraged by the interest in this position and we ll be starting in person interviews shortly with that we ll now open the line for questions questions and answers operator our first question is from mike shlisky with dougherty company please proceed mike shlisky dougherty company analyst good morning everybody mike shlisky here so wanted to first ask about the 80 20 benefits for the fourth quarter i appreciate that you maintained your outlook for the full year but i mean that implies that based on the first few quarters the benefits will actually slowdown in the fourth quarter you know below the 5 million we just got in the third quarter so can we outline some of the major moving parts there and is there any potential for some upside in the fourth quarter gregory p rustowicz vice president finance and chief financial officer yeah hi mike it s greg so we did have as you know we measure it on an incremental basis so year over year so we have no in the fourth quarter we didn t have any carry over impact from the previous year so this is all new activities that we expect i would think that there could be some upside opportunity for us to exceed the 18 million targeted 80 20 savings mike shlisky dougherty company analyst okay great i also want to ask about your rsg a outlook for the fourth quarter in that number is there some placeholder for a new ceo that person s salary and you know benefits and stock grants in the fourth quarter or is that an area that you have not fully accounted for yet richard h fleming director chairman of the board interim chief executive officer there s no placeholder for this is rick fleming there s no placeholder mike for a new ceo in the fourth quarter but clearly that will be something to be considered in fiscal 21 and having said that as interim ceo my compensation is being charged during the fourth quarter and half of my compensation by the way is in stock gregory p rustowicz vice president finance and chief financial officer and mike let me just add on too so there are other costs involved as well like executive search costs so we did incur some of those in the fiscal third quarter and we ll have more of that in the fiscal fourth quarter and that s taken into account in the guidance mike shlisky dougherty company analyst that so that s included not ok perfect just one last one for me and then i ll hop back in the queue wanted to ask about one of the talks of the day again that the issues in china on the coronavirus just kind of your thoughts as to whether anyone from columbus has been affected by that whether your business has changed at all in china due to that and your facilities over there are they still operating at the current time richard h fleming director chairman of the board interim chief executive officer well that s a great question mike first let me say that we re pleased to our knowledge none of our team has been impacted by the virus itself we have taken the same precaution as many companies have to effectively halt travel to china by team members and those in china have been asked during the lunar holidays to work from home our factory in hangzhou is shut down currently but we expect it will reopen around february 10th but having said that it s kind of being watched on it as you can appreciate a day by day basis stepping back and looking at the bigger picture i think we all have been grappling with the uncertainty associated with this epidemic and right now i m sure you ve had the same experience i ve had where we look at the newspaper and we see 800 cases go to 1 000 go to 5 000 go to 9 000 go to 17 000 go to 20 000 and so it s really a situation that s evolving as we speak and evolving both in terms of our knowledge of this disease as well as it s ability to infect populations so we clearly have to take that uncertainty into account having said all that as you know china is a relatively small part of columbus mckinnon in total and that if you just looked at the what we know today in terms of the factory shut down and with the expectation that we ll be getting back to business in the latter part of february we look at about 0 5 million of revenue impact in the fourth quarter but i think it s in fairness we have to stay to be continued and we re watching it very closely mike shlisky dougherty company analyst okay thanks very much i will hop back in the queue operator our next question is from chris howe with barrington research please proceed with your question chris howe barrington research analyst good morning everyone deborah k pawlowski investor relations kei advisors llc good morning chris good morning good morning i wanted to dive a little bit deeper into phase three as we consider the search for a new ceo in the interim can you comment on just the underlying activity that you re seeing within m a candidates and perhaps how that s developed over the course of the past six months and as we assess phase three and we move toward your target of 19 ebitda margin in fiscal year 2022 is there the potential for upside to this margin target as you look toward automation or other opportunities richard h fleming director chairman of the board interim chief executive officer well thanks chris this is rick fleming that s a very good question first let me say that we have not paused our activity on phase three that we have been conducting which as mark explained i m sure in previous calls has been largely associated with us thinking through in a thoughtful and really quantitative matter as well as qualitative our criteria for looking at opportunities in phase three from an m a standpoint as well as thinking through our costs these our adjacencies that are of interest getting market research on adjacent opportunities and really conducted as mentioned literally a strategic review and i think mark has contrasted that in the past to what the company did and perhaps many companies do where you re more opportunistic about your m a thought process and as i try to emphasize this is really more strategic so as part of that a lot of dialogue a lot of looking at opportunities a lot of reading if you will with the possibility some early on conversations with possible companies we have noticed you know just do the economic circumstances in one or two cases there may have been interest previously by a potential target that now they ve kind of putting on the back burner till things settle down in the industrial market so it s fair to say right now most of the work is planning oriented the new ceo will really have the benefit when he comes in or she comes in to have a lot of that work in place and as mentioned we are looking for an individual that has really the background and as well as the opportunity to grow columbus mckinnon in addition being a solid operator gregory p rustowicz vice president finance and chief financial officer yeah hey chris it s greg let me add on to it so as we think about phase three and acquisitions we ve centered on really two major themes one being a lifting specialist and the other is smart movement so we ve identified and have a pipeline of over 400 companies that we re evaluating against this criteria and doing a screening process now once we do identify those then an outreach begins so this is a bit of a different approach than just taking inbound calls from investment bankers this is really more of an outreach programmatic approach so we re going to continue forward with that strategy and as you can appreciate it s very difficult to predict timing but clearly the balance sheet is in great shape and you know we re optimistic that we will see the fruits of our labor here sometime in the next fiscal year chris howe barrington research analyst and has the pricing environment at all shifted versus your prior expectations or any comments there gregory p rustowicz vice president finance and chief financial officer yeah so multiples are very rich right now for sure and that s something that as we think about m a you know the one thing you can t change about a deal is the price you pay for that and so it s very important that we buy smart and that we have opportunities that either provide the technology we re looking for or have outstanding synergy capabilities for us richard h fleming director chairman of the board interim chief executive officer and in addition to multiples being a variable ebitda has been a variable and some companies that we have been in dialogue with are actually hit the pause button because i think they have some internal issues because they re thinking through relative to their ebitda chris howe barrington research analyst okay that s all very helpful and just didn t want it to be overlooked could you provide some more color on this large automation deal as well as this large crane order more specifically the automation deal and perhaps the size of the deal and how the pricing was there and how we could expect automation or other innovative opportunities to play into your margin expectations as we move into next fiscal year richard h fleming director chairman of the board interim chief executive officer well first i ll start and then greg can jump in but first let me say that the automation center for excellence is still being staffed up we are putting people in place we are creating if you will the operating systems and getting the management team in place but having said all that we were very pleased to get the order i ve mentioned which is about 600 000 and more to come i mean the quoting activities is built nicely in that area so we re encouraged so far and month of january was sort of a proof point that we re on the right track do you want to add to that greg gregory p rustowicz vice president finance and chief financial officer yeah so you know that s clearly an area that we believe has higher margins than our average business so to the extent we can drive our automation activities and grow them substantially that will help our overall gross margin profile chris howe barrington research analyst okay thanks for the color that s all i have for right now appreciate it operator our next question is from greg palm with craig hallum capital group please proceed greg palm craig hallum capital group analyst all right thanks and good morning to everybody there maybe just starting out with a little bit of commentary on the macro itself any commentary on the end markets and specifically sounds like you know kind of project based business you know fell down i know that was a little bit stronger this past fiscal year so can you just talk about sort of the differences and what you re seeing out there richard h fleming director chairman of the board interim chief executive officer sure well december was obviously a period where we had a decline in orders and we also saw a somewhat of a decline in hoist been turned into orders due to the overall industrial caution on the marketplace to give you a sense for the order pattern i think this may be helpful november orders were about 90 of october level and december orders about 84 of october november of october level excuse me so with that as the backdrop january however has seen an uptick in orders it s relatively small but positive about 1 but nonetheless up and that s good i would say the important thing is to look at the short cycle which had been really the weaker part of our book of business and that s up a 11 it is the project side down 9 that continues now to be softening and maybe will take a while to firm up but when you then look at the next level of data which is closed you do see some bright spots even on the project side as we speak europe has seen a pretty good activity in the quote area asia is still very soft as you can appreciate north america however it s picking up and particularly in several verticals steel in north america has started to pick up after a seasonal slowdown in december construction utility power generation and government segments are relatively strong and waste energy activity is picking up so we feel pretty good about how things are starting to normalize i had a chance to meet with our sales team the other day we got some feedback on just what many of our top 10 customers are saying and the word that came back was basically that we seem to be stabilizing at this lower level and the good news is we re not seeing further decline it looks like things are trying to slowly but surely move in the right direction so it s early january basically now moving into february but we see some green shoots and positive signs greg palm craig hallum capital group analyst okay great that s really helpful so thinking about the top line guidance specifically for the march quarter then you know are you maybe some what are the underlying assumptions behind that is it that you know it falls off again in february and march because it s on a reconcile your comments on january than looking at the specific guidance for the quarter gregory p rustowicz vice president finance and chief financial officer yeah so like what really drove us to it is the fact that orders were down in the quarter by about just under 9 when you adjust for the divestitures and fx and so we re starting the quarter with a backlog of about 125 million which is down about 12 sequentially from where it was in september so you know what it really implies is that the book and build business picks up in the fourth quarter which we typically do see a bit of an uptick you know people buying in advance of price increases in the u s and we have some incentive programs for our larger customers that incent them to buy inventory and get it on the shelves for the for the summer season so we think that our guidance of down 5 to 7 given where we are with our backlog is really prudent guidance for the quarter richard h fleming director chairman of the board interim chief executive officer yeah and i think one way to think about it is that in the fourth quarter we still have a declining project business based on the order trends that we saw in the backlog and we do expect an improvement in short cycle business as greg mentioned a lot of that often comes about because of pre buying before a price increase or our partners in performance programs and then maybe a general firming of industrial confidence but having said that the two are sort of offsetting each other and that s why we end up with kind of a flattish view for the fourth quarter versus the third greg palm craig hallum capital group analyst got it makes sense and then just kind of shifting gears to the ebitda margin targets for fiscal 22 what are the underlying macro assumptions behind that i mean do we have to get some pickup in growth between now and then in order to achieve those targets gregory p rustowicz vice president finance and chief financial officer yeah so when we set the 19 ebitda target in fiscal 22 as you recall we originally came out with a 15 target but we got there in a year and certainly we had some benefits over the last two years on the top line with kind of mid to high single digit growth so the presumption is that the 19 was achievable in kind of a low growth gdp kind of a environment so we clearly are working hard on the margin side with both 80 20 operational excellence footprint consolidation and then just really trying to lift the margins of our business with investments the new product development automation that rick spoke about as well so you know this year we should end north of 16 or right around 16 we re 16 1 on a year to date basis so still have a little bit of a gap to close but we ve got two years to do it and we re not giving up on that goal and we think that s an achievable number for us but it does not assume that there is a downturn or a recession greg palm craig hallum capital group analyst got it and the delta between the 16 and the 19 does the majority of that come from gross margin expansion from here richard h fleming director chairman of the board interim chief executive officer yes gregory p rustowicz vice president finance and chief financial officer yeah richard h fleming director chairman of the board interim chief executive officer yep and you ll see it in the 80 20 and the operational excellence categories greg palm craig hallum capital group analyst yep okay all right that s it for me thanks richard h fleming director chairman of the board interim chief executive officer thank you operator our next question is from jon tanwanteng with cjs securities please proceed jon tanwanteng cjs securities analyst good morning gentlemen thanks for taking my questions maybe to start the growth in operating margins as we head into q4 given roughly flat expectations for revenue are they biased to the upside or downside and kind of what are the puts and takes going into that richard h fleming director chairman of the board interim chief executive officer well i would say jon that you know we did take inventories down 7 million sequentially from september to december and that had an impact on our gross margin and we also saw a negative 1 1 million impact due to higher medical costs and with our medical plans in essence they reset january 1st of every year their high deductible plans so we would expect there to be positive gross margin in q4 relative to q3 i think the rsg a guidance is about the same as it was i mean it was a little bit lower this quarter but we think the 45 million to 45 5 million level is kind of the right landing spot for q4 jon tanwanteng cjs securities analyst great thank you very much and then you also mentioned additional activities and realignments going on under the hood i understand 80 20 plan hasn t been implemented across all your geographies and product lines so what kind of further accretion could we see in fiscal 21 above the 18 million that you plan to realize in 20 richard h fleming director chairman of the board interim chief executive officer as you can appreciate we re working on our budget for fiscal 21 right now and we re in discussion with our business units on that very topic having said that there are a number of efficiencies that we are working on our early view is that could be something in the area of 9 million alone and then in addition we are looking at additional 80 20 opportunities but they are still in discussion i think our hope and our and desire is that we will have a pretty good numbers similar to what we had in the past going into that budget cycle gregory p rustowicz vice president finance and chief financial officer yeah let me give you a little bit more color jon too just to remind everybody on the phone that we do we will have the consolidation of our of our lisbon ohio facility done in the first quarter and that s about 5 million annualized savings number we won t get all of those savings this coming fiscal year but that s a big accretive number for us as we reduce our footprint and the one thing the management team is absolutely committed to is driving double digit earnings growth and so we re looking at developing a plan that does that jon tanwanteng cjs securities analyst great thank you and then in future after you close the the two plants is there room for more consolidation or are you at the asset base and size that you want to be out in the future richard h fleming director chairman of the board interim chief executive officer there is definitely room for more consolidation and i can t give specifics as you can appreciate that would be premature we have a lot of discussion to do internally but we see opportunity let me put it that way not only in the us but overseas jon tanwanteng cjs securities analyst okay great thank you and then just finally on the ceo search i assume there hasn t been any appreciable significant impact but how is anything if anything has there been any change in the morale or in the operations of the company due to mark leaving richard h fleming director chairman of the board interim chief executive officer no the team is intact morale is good as you can appreciate one of my first orders of business was to meet with each individual team member and i feel really good about the conversation and i ll be with the team that we can charlotte as we go through our planning for the budget i can just say right now it s all positive and i appreciate really the work and the support of the team our mantra internally has been same strategy same team and same results and that s what we re working on jon tanwanteng cjs securities analyst great thank you operator our next question is from walter liptak with seaport global please proceed walter liptak seaport global analyst hi thanks good morning guys richard h fleming director chairman of the board interim chief executive officer good morning walt walter liptak seaport global analyst it s good to hear about the green shoots and so i wanted to ask one more question on that and as you were talking about these projects and some of the short cycle specifically where are you seeing the green shoots on a geographic basis the us europe or just where do you think that we get things coming back what region first richard h fleming director chairman of the board interim chief executive officer well north america is where we ve seen really a more of a firming if you will and activity for quotes and it s early on signs that we re getting quotes turned into orders so that s basically the major focal point of my comments asia up in the air right now with coronavirus clearly and then europe some of our project business in europe particularly as it relates to mid east oil and gas still pretty good but i d say north america has been the early area for the green shoots walter liptak seaport global analyst okay good and then thinking about the work that you re doing from 80 20 if i recall the us started first and followed by international and so my question is in the non us sales was there some of that decline related to pls and some of the 80 20 activity or maybe if you could help us understand how much of the decline was divestiture or related to market versus kind of richard h fleming director chairman of the board interim chief executive officer yeah so when we think about sales outside of the us we did see volume declines of about 6 million in total or roughly 6 2 and where we see the larger volume declines was emea was double digits latin america was double digits we had a little bit of we saw some nice growth in apac but that s off of a small base and canada was down a little bit as well so the 80 20 impact i would say were not in europe specific to your question we are not yet seeing a negative impact due to product line simplification i think there is that work is under way and it s being looked at but that particular part of the 80 20 process takes a little bit longer walter liptak seaport global analyst okay got it and then the last one for me i think we re all very impressed with the e pas strategy and what you guys are doing it s impressive with the margin the profits coming up even with your revenue down or the profits flat and as you re doing a ceo search or as the board is going through this it sounds based on the information that you gave like you re getting high interest and the ceo that the board is going to pick is someone who can fit into the e pas strategy and i want to make sure i understand that that s kind of the the focus of the search is not changing the e pas strategy and that ceos that are in the running understand this and that they are accepting of it because usually a ceo tries to imprint his own business plan on to a company richard h fleming director chairman of the board interim chief executive officer rick fleming again i d be happy to give you some additional information let me first kind of set the table on where we are in the search process and then i ll answer your question more directly but i ll just to give you a sense that we hit the ground running basically before christmas we had hired search firm korn ferry who also did the search for mark morelli and we got our specification documents completed in terms of what we re looking for and out in the marketplace so we moved pretty fast as you can appreciate in december before the holidays and we ve been having number of calls with our search firm literally every week and are now scheduled as i alluded to to have our first round of interviews with some candidates who have risen to the top by mid february so it s early in the process still often as you can appreciate you have several rounds of interviews you have vetting and you certainly have other people that come into the process after the first wave but we feel pretty good that we re on track to get somebody on board as we ve always said within six months and my gut says sooner and we re certainly working on that now what kind of individual are we looking for as you can appreciate we are very pleased with the 80 20 process we re very pleased with the discipline that it brought to the company and we certainly want that to be part of the new individual s portfolio but we also want as i alluded to an individual that also has experience growing companies both organically and through m a and portfolio optimization and you ll probably have a smile on your face when i say here s a laundry list of what we re looking for because it almost sounds like the perfect individual but there are people out there that can touch a lot of these basis so let me discrete that we re looking for people that have strategy development experience operational excellence as i mentioned organic growth with a commercial track record of growing businesses people understand mergers and alliances experienced leading the dedication due diligence negotiation of potential acquisitions and joint ventures global accountability we are a global firm that person has to have the opportunity in their background that had experience with that aspect of running the company mobile operating units new markets channels innovation and normally leadership which is talent management and attracting and developing the right talent in the team so it s a long list but we are pleased with what we re seeing so far and we ve got as i mentioned a pretty high level of interest so more to come on it walter liptak seaport global analyst okay thanks for the detail on that and good luck with the search richard h fleming director chairman of the board interim chief executive officer thank you operator our next question is from joe mondillo with sidoti company please proceed joe mondillo sidoti company analyst hi guys good morning richard h fleming director chairman of the board interim chief executive officer good morning joe gregory p rustowicz vice president finance and chief financial officer good morning joe joe mondillo sidoti company analyst most of my questions have been answered but just a couple maybe a follow up question to some of the comments you ve made the 9 million of savings that you sort of roughly estimated for next year is that including the china and the ohio facility closures gregory p rustowicz vice president finance and chief financial officer yeah so when we think about we haven t fully formed all of our plans yet for 80 20 but clearly as we think about our budget for next year we would expect yes we are going to include roughly 5 million from the facility consolidation richard h fleming director chairman of the board interim chief executive officer that is absolutely correct having said that we re going to drive the number higher joe mondillo sidoti company analyst okay so just to clarify those comments that you made 9 million includes the facility closures and then potentially some additional 80 20 savings that you haven t exactly determined at this point richard h fleming director chairman of the board interim chief executive officer yeah greg is absolutely correct 5 million of the savings in 2021 comes from the ohio facility closure now in my capacity as leading the team we re looking for 9 million as well joe mondillo sidoti company analyst okay and i just wanted to also clarify the comments that you made on sort of january business trends you stated that orders were up 1 is that 1 year over year change richard h fleming director chairman of the board interim chief executive officer it is gregory p rustowicz vice president finance and chief financial officer yes deborah k pawlowski investor relations kei advisors llc adjusted joe for divestitures and fx richard h fleming director chairman of the board interim chief executive officer yes joe mondillo sidoti company analyst right ok and then one thing that was not touched on exactly with pricing i m just curious given sort of the weaker trends or some of the slowing in just the end markets overall what kind of pricing you think you ll get going forward gregory p rustowicz vice president finance and chief financial officer yeah so what we ve got in the quarter and year to date is about 1 6 price and that includes about half of that is 80 20 related so call it strategic pricing where you re surgically going in and raising prices on certain products that you sell so in the upcoming year we think it s going to be somewhat of a weaker environment but nonetheless we would expect positive price and we ve historically have had price exceed inflation so i think it s going to be probably in a similar sort of a level joe richard h fleming director chairman of the board interim chief executive officer in industrial products north america went out with their price increase for february gregory p rustowicz vice president finance and chief financial officer so they re about a month earlier than they have been historically joe mondillo sidoti company analyst okay great thanks a lot just lastly you stated that your search cost for the new ceo was baked into the sg a guide for the fourth quarter how much do you have baked in there for that richard h fleming director chairman of the board interim chief executive officer yeah so it s in the neighborhood of 0 25 million joe mondillo sidoti company analyst all right great thanks a lot operator and our next question is a follow up from greg palm with craig hallum capital group please proceed greg palm craig hallum capital group analyst yeah thanks one last one on capital allocation i guess you re generating massive amounts of free cash flow here and it sounds like m a will become a big focus here especially with the eventual appointment of a new ceo correct me if i m wrong but my guess is that you could buy back your own stock at current levels at a much cheaper price or i guess valuation and doing any m a especially if prices for potential targets remain elevated so i guess my question is at some point do you approach share repurchases differently and if that s not the case why won t you gregory p rustowicz vice president finance and chief financial officer yeah so we have a we thought about it similar to you greg in that we didn t have that ability in the past but the board recently authorized 20 million share repurchase authorization earlier in the fiscal year and we look at it as more of an opportunistic lever for us our focus has been on delevering this year and we said we would delever 65 million and we will do that we re planning to do that and clearly our balance sheet is below our targeted leverage ratio but the other factor we think about in regards to share repurchase is that our float is quite low and so we really would look at share repurchases more from an opportunistic perspective if for some reason there was anomaly in the capital markets and our price dropped to a level that just didn t make sense we could see that as an opportunity to go back in and perhaps offset some of the dilution that we have every year from our outset plan richard h fleming director chairman of the board interim chief executive officer and let me just mentioned too greg that we will be having a discussion as we do each year at our march board meeting on capital allocation and it will be a priority this year to have that discussion because of the fact that our cash flow generation has been so positive and still ahead of schedule so in a a good way to summarize it is it s under discussion right now gregory p rustowicz vice president finance and chief financial officer and it s a good problem to have richard h fleming director chairman of the board interim chief executive officer it s a good problem to have right gregory p rustowicz vice president finance and chief financial officer yeah richard h fleming director chairman of the board interim chief executive officer and we all have to go back to this and it was implicit in greg s comments our highest and best return is investing in our company either through capital spending and opportunities to reduce costs or through organic growth and obviously inorganic growth gets in that equation as well greg palm craig hallum capital group analyst yeah it makes sense can you give us any sense for what your valuation criteria might be when looking at m a going out or is it really going to be kind of a case by case basis gregory p rustowicz vice president finance and chief financial officer yeah it s going to have to be on a case by case basis as you think about lifting specialists our stahl acquisition fit that category as you think about smart movement magnetek acquisition fit that category so they each have different profiles from a business perspective on the smart movement there could be a smaller company that offers the right sort of technology that would allow us to move forward much quicker than developing a technology by ourselves so it s going to be a case by case basis richard h fleming director chairman of the board interim chief executive officer in general how do you create value growth and return on capital greg palm craig hallum capital group analyst all righty thanks richard h fleming director chairman of the board interim chief executive officer thank you operator we have reached the end of our question and answer session i would like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks richard h fleming director chairman of the board interim chief executive officer well thank you very much

by ameer ali president gotabaya rajapaksa pgr coined the phrase prosperity with splendour and promulgated it as the chief objective of his presidency it is a tacit acceptance that seventy two years of independence had neither brought prosperity nor splendour why did a nation endowed with so much natural resources and human talent gained its independence on a platter without shedding a drop of blood but with ample foreign reserves inherited a highly efficient civil service and public administration and managed to establish with pride one of the most successful welfare states in asia fail to build on that enviable edifice a modern economic powerhouse like a few of her asian neighbours economists may theorise the causes of this failure ad nauseam but the most fundamental of reasons that prevented such a transformation goes beyond economics and enters deep into the nation s politics it was the metastasis of communal politics that sowed the seeds of national disunity and inter communal discontent which ultimately deprived the economy of the vitally needed synergy emanating from a united citizenry sri lanka s ethno religious and cultural diversity is a blessing in disguise contrary to what present day buddhist supremacists seem to believe the ancient rulers of this nation realised this fact and harnessed that diversity to create prosperity with splendour the difference between now and then is that those monarchs with true commitment to their buddhist faith and its values treated every component of that plurality with equal dignity respect and tolerance although every community had its own social hierarchy and stratification each community in the eyes of the ruler carried the same status the sangha of course advised those rulers when needed to make the realm virtuous and in conformity with buddhist ethos in short and to put it in modern political parlance every subject under those monarchs was an equal citizen the kingdom was a united but plural entity in which every community and every subject lived in peace and contributed to the best of their ability to the success of the realm political and economic rationalism and not religious bigotry ruled the day today s supremacists are deliberately hiding this beautiful chapter of sri lanka s golden history in order to thrust their own twisted version history is prostituted to satisfy the demands of power hungry chauvinists the western concept of nation state and nationalism which were originally devised to unite warring petty kingdoms in medieval christendom later became in the hands of european colonizers a divisive and poisonous instrument to divide and rule several plural societies that remained peaceful and cosmopolitan until the colonialists arrived the disintegration and destruction of the ottoman empire is proof par excellence of the handy work of poisonous nationalism similarly sinhala and tamil ethno nationalism which sapped the economic vitality of this island and dragged it into a foolish and futile civil war were a by product of the same so called westphalian synthesis as an outgrowth of this ethno nationalism is the idea of buddhist supremacy which is now dictating the political and economic agenda of pgr and his caretaker government pgr s strategy of political exclusion with economic inclusion of minorities is a clear expression of supremacist thinking how could he or any government under him achieve prosperity with splendour by empowering one group at the expense of another is beyond any sense of political rationality and economic justice a few days ago it was reported that one of the militant members of the sangha while addressing a gathering in jaffna called on tamil leaders and their people to learn the sinhalese language and join the majority to develop the nation he did not even have the courtesy to say that he was willing to learn the tamil language at least to communicate with tamils and understand their feelings grievances and aspirations it is the same ven thera who also wants to homogenise different marriage laws and traditions in the country in favour of one common law people of his ilk insisted and won prohibiting the national anthem to be sung in tamil at independence day celebrations with this type of racism they are also indirectly advocating that tamil speakers need not espouse patriotic emotions what a dangerous attitude especially at a time when foreign powers are vying to gain a long term foothold in the country a divided nation is an inviting terrain for scheming outsiders similarly on a different occasion a budding muslim leader was calling members of his own community to join the sinhala majority and be part of pgr s race for economic development this native informer should know very well that the supremacists who are behind pgr while not prepared to consider the tamils as co owners of this land are also questioning the indigenousness of muslims in this country in other words to the supremacists members of the two minority communities are virtually non citizens at best or second class citizens at worst how could any leader expect to promote genuine political partnership on such unequal terms such a partnership would eventually lead to a master servant relationship which seems to be the objective behind pgr s authoritarianism with soft militarization of government s high powered administrative and managerial sectors and with the posting of security personnel in every district apparently to assist in development work a police state seems to be looming on the horizon a workable solution to the national question and post war reconciliation is possible if supremacists and their opponents stop using the heart to do the work of brain let reason prevail over emotion and consider a solution in the context of the gravity of situation confronting the country today of the manifold issues facing the nation two are critical and they need a united effort from the entire population to tackle successfully one is the economy and the other is national security on the economic front behind the massaged statistics dished out by ministers and their appointees an unbiased review of the real economy depicts a worrying future sky rocketing cost of living amidst ad hoc populist handouts increasing unemployment worsen by underemployment chronic budget deficits caused by wasteful expenses and falling public revenue mounting national debt depreciating rupee and resulting inflationary pressures are problems that cannot be solved without massive increase in domestic output with surplus to export foreign direct investment fdi can certainly be of assistance though not the solution but even fdi will not flow in unless the home ground is attractive and safe to investors that attraction depends on the quality of domestic infrastructure quality of domestic labour and associated factors of production and above all a peaceful political and social environment the last of these is rarely stressed by theoretical economists but assumed away at best under the all inclusive ceteris paribus in sri lanka especially peace and security is precondition to achieve prosperity with splendour modern economies are not built on science and technology alone although they are crucial but with the co operative effort of the people who contribute to and benefit from those economies that co operation cannot be bought or forced it has to be spontaneous and that spontaneity depends on how free independent and happy people feel about the socio political surrounding in which they live this is why popular democracy is such an attractive political model especially for plural societies it provides opportunities for a numerical minority to become a political majority and vice versa depending on the policies they advocate and programs they represent having denuded democracy of its inner substance while preserving it carapace of political parties and periodic elections ethno nationalism in this country has destroyed socio political peace which in turn has thwarted prosperity with splendour that peace cannot be recovered by relying on security forces alone increasing the size of police army air and naval personnel that are imbued with supremacist thoughts equipping them with expensive and state of the art weapons and allowing them to roam around in every city town and village may succeed in injecting fear and anxiety among masses but will not promote societal peace and the necessary confidence in the future especially among communities that had been grievously hurt by past injustices at the hands of these forces without peace and confidence economic efforts will remain suboptimal at best this is why pgr s strategy of political exclusion and economic inclusion will not work once again it should be stressed that our policy makers study closely how pluralist singapore built its singaporean identity that turned that resource poor tiny island into a regional economic giant in a public address delivered by lee kwan yew in the mid 1980s he warned the chinese chauvinists in his country not to commit the error of sri lanka by advocating ethno nationalism it was the same lee who envied the development of this island when he visited in early 1950s with reference to security pgr and his caretaker government need not be reminded of the fact that the art of warfare has changed dramatically in recent years we are living in an age of drone attacks and cyber terrorism to protect an island like ours against such misfortunes requires international cooperation that cooperation has now become a complex matter because of geopolitical developments in the indian ocean to trumpet that sri lanka adopts a neutral foreign policy is simply for public consumption bereft of substance because of the strategic developments in the indian ocean there is always a possibility that sri lanka may become a new theatre of war in asia and that war will not be fought with conventional weapons the nation is well and truly trapped by the geostrategic manoeuvrings of india china and the usa how our own civil war itself contributed to this tragic situation is a sordid chapter altogether which the supremacists may not want to read about or listen to given this scenario at least a united sri lanka can help to minimise possible damages the old adage united we stand and divided we fall is no more appropriate than it is now this is why it is time that pgr and his supremacists from the political economic and religious circles address the national question without delay and with open mind what the country needs is unity with equality among its plural constituents with that unity prosperity with splendour is certainly within our reach

philip lowe s speech twelve months ago i reminded you that we do not have a crystal ball that can be used to see the future with certainty since then some things have turned out as expected but there have been plenty of surprises as well no doubt the same will be true this year today though i would like to talk about the reserve bank s central scenario for the global and australian economies and some of the factors that we will be watching over the year ahead i would also like to touch on monetary policy the global economy the central scenario for the global economy over the next couple of years remains reasonable and growth is expected to be a little stronger than it was in 2019 the imf estimates that the global economy expanded by 2 9 per cent last year and in its latest published forecasts is predicting economic growth to lift to 3 3 per cent this year and 3 4 per cent in 2021 graph 1 looking back though global growth in 2019 was not as strong as we had expected this was largely because the trade and technology disputes between the united states and china and the brexit debate had a sobering effect on investment around the world the trade disputes also led to some reconfiguration of global supply chains and resulted in very soft conditions in the manufacturing sector and a contraction in international trade some of these dark clouds that were hanging over the global economy last year have lightened a little recently with the progress on the trade and brexit issues there have been some signs that the downswing in manufacturing activity and international trade is coming to an end graph 2 the down cycle in the global semiconductor industry also looks to be running its course these are encouraging developments and provide a reasonable basis to expect that this year will be better than last year having said that it remains possible that the expected pick up in growth is derailed by a re escalation of the trade and technology disputes another more recent source of uncertainty is the outbreak of the coronavirus which i will discuss shortly one other unexpected development over the past year was the easing of monetary policy by most central banks this easing was in response to both the disappointing growth outcomes in some countries and the continuing accumulation of evidence of low and stable inflation this evidence suggests that the previous relationship between the unemployment rate and inflation has changed many countries have unemployment at the lowest level in decades in the united states it is the lowest since 1969 and in the united kingdom it is the lowest since 1974 graph 3 yet inflation remains subdued the reasons for this change are complicated but my view is that it largely reflects some structural changes related to technology and globalisation which together have increased competition and uncertainty about the future with our economies seemingly less inflation prone than they once were it is now possible to sustain lower rates of unemployment than previously thought to be the case this is a good thing partly as a result of this shift investors have a high degree of confidence that interest rates will stay low for a long time this assessment is reinforced by the fact that the global desire to save is high relative to the desire to invest in new capital when a lot of people want to save and there is weak demand by businesses to use those savings the return to savers that is the interest rate is going to be low this means that we find ourselves in a world of low unemployment low inflation and low interest rates i expect that we are going to remain here for quite some time given the structural factors at work although it does remain possible that a re acceleration of growth in economies with little spare capacity could see inflation re emerge one consequence of interest rates being lower for longer is that asset prices have increased as investors discount future returns by less the most obvious example of this is global equity prices which have recorded strong gains over recent times graph 4 some investors are also taking on more risk as they search for higher returns in a low interest rate world both higher asset prices and a willingness to take more risk can be good for the global economy especially if they lead to more investment not just more borrowing we do though need to remember that it is possible to have too much of a good thing so this is also an issue that international bodies including the financial stability board are keeping a close eye on the australian economy i would now like to turn to the australian economy we will be releasing an updated full set of forecasts on friday in the statement on monetary policy ahead of that i can provide you with the main numbers and highlight some of the issues shaping the outlook our central forecast is for the australian economy to expand by 2¾ per cent over 2020 and 3 per cent the following year graph 5 these growth rates are a little above our current estimate of medium term growth in australia so some inroad into spare capacity should be made these growth rates are also higher than the outcomes for 2018 and 2019 as i have been saying for some time we are passing through a gentle turning point for the better graph 5 there are a number of factors contributing to this outlook the expected pick up in world growth should help us the resources sector is in expansion mode again and we are expecting consumer spending to pick up the outlook is also being supported by ongoing high levels of investment in infrastructure and the likelihood that the downswing in residential construction will come to an end later this year further increases in resource exports and continuing solid growth in public demand will also help in terms of the labour market we are expecting the unemployment rate to remain around its current level for a while yet before declining below 5 per cent late next year as growth picks up graph 6 one consideration here is the outlook for labour force participation over the past couple of years we have seen a very large lift in participation especially by women and older australians this is a positive development but it has meant that very strong employment growth has not resulted in a lower unemployment rate strong demand for labour has been met with strong supply of labour in terms of inflation we continue to expect a gradual increase with underlying inflation expected to approach 2 per cent over the next couple of years graph 7 the recent inflation data were in line with our expectations and show contrasting trends with higher prices for groceries and continued subdued outcomes for housing especially rents and utilities with that broad overview i would like to focus on three issues the ongoing adjustment in household balance sheets the bushfires the drought and the coronavirus outbreak the importance of continuing to invest in our future household balance sheet adjustment looking back at last year economic growth was weaker than we had expected the global slowdown is part of the story but the most important factor is a domestic one and that is subdued consumer spending as households adjusted to slow wages growth and falling housing prices the downswing in residential construction was also a factor over 2019 household consumption looks to have increased by only around 1 per cent graph 8 given that australia s population is growing at 1 5 per cent a year this represents a decline in per capita terms this is a highly unusual outcome in an economy that has recorded the type of strong jobs growth that we have experienced in australia for some time now households had been gradually adjusting their spending to the slower trend rate of income growth this adjustment accelerated last year in response to falling housing prices faced with the reality of slow growth in wages and falling housing prices many households scaled back their spending to put their finances and their balance sheets on a sounder footing and the effects have been felt across the economy on the wages front australians have been getting used to increases of 2 point something graph 9 this is a noticeable step down from the 3 4 per cent range we experienced previously and we are forecasting the current rate of wages growth to continue for the next couple of years as this period of low wages growth has run on many people have adjusted down their expectations of how fast their own income will grow in future at the same time households have been dealing with another adjustment that is in housing prices between late 2017 and mid last year nationwide housing prices fell by 8 per cent and in sydney and melbourne housing prices fell an average of 13 per cent graph 10 the speed and extent of this decline came as a shock to many people although it did follow an earlier very large run up in prices it reminded us all that housing prices can and do fall substantially for some people the salutary effect of that reminder has been amplified by lower wage increases and high levels of debt as part of the reserve bank s efforts to understand how households are adjusting we have been looking carefully at the data on mortgage repayments and i would like to share these updated data with you this graph shows housing loan repayments as a share of outstanding credit broken down into interest payments and repayments of principal including through higher balances in offset accounts graph 11 there are three points that i would draw your attention to the first is that as monetary policy has been eased since late 2011 interest payments as a share of credit have come down top panel this has freed up income to be spent on other purposes the second is that the rate of repayment of principal bottom panel has moved up and down over time these fluctuations partly reflect trends in the housing market in particular the increase in repayments around 2014 and 2015 was associated with strong growth in offset accounts and coincided with a period of high turnover in the housing market and strong growth in loan refinancing and the third point is that over the second half of 2019 principal payments have increased more than offsetting the decline in interest payments households have made larger voluntary repayments and they have also maintained higher balances in their offset accounts partly this has been made possible by the higher tax refunds for low and middle income earners which have boosted disposable income it is entirely understandable that households faced with low growth of wages and falling housing prices sought to repay their debts a bit faster i am going to speak about monetary policy shortly but ahead of that i would like to address one point that i hear frequently that the reserve bank s decision to cut interest rates last year dented consumer confidence and that this is what lies behind the weak consumption growth i certainly understand that having interest rates at very low levels has unsettled some people but i don t accept the idea that this is what is driving weak consumption there is something deeper going on while the reserve bank s decisions reminded people of what is going on australians were already adjusting their spending to the reality of a combination of subdued wages growth the fall in housing prices and high debt levels consumer confidence and monetary policy were both responding to this reality my judgement is that if the reserve bank had not eased monetary policy last year this adjustment by households would have been harder the balance sheet repair would have been more difficult and the economy would have been weaker the lower interest rates have assisted with both sides of the balance sheet they have allowed people to pay down their liabilities more easily and they have also boosted asset prices so they are helping not hampering the process of balance sheet adjustment in doing so they are also bringing forward the day when households feel comfortable to lift their spending again as i said when discussing the global situation we need to remember that it is possible to have too much of a good thing we are aware of the risk of low interest rates encouraging too much borrowing and driving excessive asset valuations so we will continue to watch borrowing in particular very carefully the main point here though is that we expect consumption growth to strengthen as households become more comfortable with their balance sheet positions assisting with this disposable income is expected to grow more strongly over the next couple of years than it has over the past couple of years housing prices are also now rising not falling and a pick up in residential construction activity is in prospect the unemployment rate is also expected to decline which should give people the confidence to spend so it is reasonable to expect that things improve from here although it is hard to be precise about how much longer this period of balance sheet adjustment will continue the fires the drought and the coronavirus outbreak other issues that we have examined carefully in putting together the forecasts are the devastating bushfires over the summer and the drought on behalf of the reserve bank board and staff i would like to extend our thoughts to all those who have been affected especially to those who have so tragically lost loved ones i would also like to extend our deep gratitude to all those who have worked so tirelessly to control the fires the economic impact of the fires in the areas affected is very large there have been very significant disruptions to normal activity in these areas and there has been large scale destruction of homes farms and businesses as well as public infrastructure in assessing the impact of this on the australian economy as a whole we have taken into account that there will be a material rebuilding effort and that government grants and insurance payments will assist many people on this basis our assessment is that gdp growth for 2020 as a whole will be largely unaffected there is however likely to be a noticeable effect across the december quarter last year and the current quarter while it is still difficult to be precise we estimate that the effects of the bushfires will reduce gdp growth by around 0 2 percentage points across the two quarters we are also continuing to assess the effects of the drought on the economy farm output declined by 16 per cent between 2017 and 2019 and farm exports fell by 13 per cent a further decline of around 10 per cent in farm output is expected in 2020 representing a drag on gdp growth of around a quarter of a percentage point this is a stark reminder that the economic effects of these climate events are material a new uncertainty affecting the outlook is the outbreak of the coronavirus it is too early to tell what the overall impact will be but the sars outbreak in 2003 may provide a guide on that occasion there was a sharp slowing in output growth in china for a few months before a sharp bounce back as the outbreak was controlled and economic stimulus measures were introduced today china is a larger part of the global economy and it is more closely integrated including with australia so the international spillovers could be larger than they were back in 2003 much will depend on the success of the various efforts to control the virus so we are monitoring developments closely the importance of continuing to invest in our future the third issue i would like to discuss is the importance of continuing to invest in our future australia s economic fundamentals remain very strong and they provide a solid foundation for us to be optimistic about our future the strong fundamentals include world class endowments of natural resources a highly skilled and innovative workforce an established and predictable regulatory system sound public finances a diverse and growing population and being well placed to benefit from the strong growth in asia not just in china but also in the populous countries of indonesia and india so we have a lot to feel fortunate about we enjoy a set of fundamentals and a standard of living that few other countries enjoy it s important that we do not lose sight of this strong fundamentals though can take us only so far if we are to turn these fundamentals into strong and consistent growth we need to keep investing in our future the level of investment spending relative to the size of the economy has trended lower over recent years although there has been some increase in public investment graph 12 we have also experienced a troubling decline in productivity growth while the reasons for this are complex it is hard to escape the conclusion that higher levels of investment spending would promote productivity growth and our collective living standards the list of areas where further investment would improve our future prospects is well known it includes investments in infrastructure in human capital in energy production and distribution in new data technologies and in measures to deal with climate change and its effects businesses as well as governments across australia are addressing these areas and it is important that they remain focused on them both public and business sector balance sheets are in good shape and so are strong enough to take advantage of these investment opportunities as i have said on other occasions low interest rates should make it easier for both the public and business sectors to contemplate long term investments given that future returns don t need to be discounted as much they also mean that financing costs are lower with interest rates at record lows and likely to remain low for quite some time there are plenty of opportunities here monetary policy i would like to finish by returning to monetary policy at its meeting yesterday the reserve bank board decided that given the current outlook the best course was to hold the cash rate steady at 0 75 per cent the recent inflation and unemployment data were both in line with our expectations and show things moving in the right direction although only very gradually over the next couple of years we expect further progress to be made towards full employment and the inflation target although that progress is likely to remain quite slow the gradual nature of this progress reflects some significant structural shifts in the global economy related to technology and globalisation and as i discussed earlier a period of adjustment in household finances in australia monetary policy has already responded to this and is providing considerable support to the australian economy given the outlook i have outlined today the board has however continued to discuss the merits of further monetary stimulus in an effort to speed the pace of progress and to make it more assured on balance though the board has decided to hold the cash rate steady recognising the significant monetary stimulus already in place and the long and variable lags associated with monetary policy this decision also reflects a judgement about the benefits from a further reduction in interest rates against some of the costs and risks associated with very low interest rates it certainly remains the case that a further reduction in interest rates would help with the balance sheet adjustment by households with existing debt which should help bring forward the day that consumption strengthens it would also have a further effect on the exchange rate which would boost demand for our exports and therefore support jobs growth on the other side of the equation though there are risks in having interest rates at very low levels internationally there are increased concerns about the effect of very low interest rates on resource allocation and their effect on the confidence of some people lower interest rates could also encourage more borrowing by households eager to buy residential property at a time when there is already a strong upswing in housing prices in place if that occurs this could increase the risk of problems down the track so there is a balance to be struck here the board recognises that the nature of this balance can change over time and that it depends very much upon the state of the economy so it is continually looking at both sides of the equation if the unemployment rate were to be trending in the wrong direction and there was no further progress being made towards the inflation target the balance of arguments would change in those circumstances the board would see a stronger case for further monetary easing we will continue to monitor developments carefully including in the labour market as we seek to strike the right balance in the interests of the community as a whole philip lowe is the governer of the rba

begin our presentation let me caution you that our discussion will include forward looking statements these statements that relate to future results and events are based on our current expectations our actual results in future periods may differ materially from those currently expected because of a number of risks uncertainties and assumptions the risks uncertainties and assumptions that we believe are material are outlined in our press release issued this morning with that i ll turn the call over to chief executive officer brian kingston brian kingston chief executive officer thank you matt and good morning everyone and thank you for joining our call today with me on the call are ric clark chairman of bpy and bryan davis our cfo in my prepared remarks i ll recap our operating performance from the quarter and the year as well as providing an update on our various ongoing strategic initiatives bryan will then provide a more detailed update on our quarterly and annual financial results and after that we d be happy to take questions from any of our analysts on the call today so as you may have seen in our disclosure this morning bpy earned company ffo and realized gains of 459 million or 0 48 per unit in the fourth quarter closing the year with a strong performance in our office business good performance in retail and continued active recycling of our capital for the full year of 2019 cash flow from operations and realized gains was 1 5 billion or 1 57 per unit and that compares to 1 6 billion or 1 97 per unit in 2018 the prior year having benefited from several unusually large realizations in our opportunistic fund strategy in light of this performance our board approved the declaration of a quarterly dividend of 0 3325 per unit which represents a 1 increase over 2019 we ve continued to utilize cash flow generated from the expansion of our business to but understand the importance of this dividend to many of our investors since our initial launch in 2013 we have increased the distribution by 5 on a compound annual basis and is more of our development activities become cash generating in the years ahead this will enable us to continue to increase the dividend in line with that earnings growth consistent with prior years we completed 3 3 billion of asset sales at prices that were 6 higher than our ifrs carrying values generating net proceeds of 1 8 billion to bpy which were redeployed into our business last year at much higher returns we utilized some of the proceeds from sales to repurchase over 500 million of our units in 2019 and expect to remain active should our units continue to trade at a meaningful discount to their intrinsic value over the next several years as we continue to monetize investments in our real estate opportunity funds as well as mature stable assets on our balance sheet we expect to generate between 1 5 billion and 2 billion of net proceeds each year which can then be reinvested into our business performance in our core office business was strong in 2019 in total we leased 7 8 million square feet of office space at rents that were 32 higher than our expiring leases we achieved same store growth of 3 in this business and occupancy finished the year at 93 up 90 basis points over last year our retail portfolio remains resilient we finished the year at over 96 occupancy no decline from the prior year and completed 10 5 million square feet of new leases in 2019 demonstrating the continued demand for high quality well located retail space importantly we continue to see positive rent spreads and growing tenant sales at our centers as presented at our annual investor day in september we ve identified 15 near and long term value creation initiatives at several of our best performing centers that will add 1 8 billion of value when they re completed we look forward to providing you with updates and milestones on these projects as they progress the year was also highlighted by the delivery of several of our largest development projects including one manhattan west 100 bishopsgate and the sono collection in norwalk connecticut these assets are best in class premier properties in their respective markets office tenants began occupying space at one manhattan west and 100 bishopsgate in late 2019 and sono opened its stores just in time for the holiday shopping season with most retailers reporting sales that were above expectations these newly developed assets and others that are nearing completion will begin contributing meaningfully to bpy s earnings in 2020 and moving forward furthermore our development pipeline remains active with major projects under way in new york toronto london dubai sydney melbourne and perth completion of these substantially pre let office projects will continue to drive above average earnings growth in our core office portfolio for the foreseeable future we remained active in capital markets in 2019 as the environment offered favorable terms to well capitalized asset owners and corporate issuers in our core office and core retail businesses we raised over 10 billion of non recourse property mortgages while reducing our average cost of debt by 30 basis points we also issued 434 million of perpetual preferred shares and cad600 million of five year unsecured notes while sustainability and other esg initiatives have been in great focus within the business environment over the past 12 months they ve always been an integral part of how we do business by constructing energy efficient buildings we ve reduced energy demand through our operations and lowered annual associated operating costs by over 30 million since 2008 specifically in 2019 we were able to maintain our green star rating under the annual global real estate sustainability benchmark we issued the first ever perpetual green units in our industry and continued our commitment to build 100 of our new office developments to a minimum leed gold standard in december we announced that we will construct the largest mass timber building in the united states at pier 70 in san francisco demonstrating how we re applying emerging technologies and innovative design to create environmentally sustainable solutions our core retail business is ranked sixth in the us in terms of corporate installed on site solar capacity and generates over 25 of our portfolio s common area electricity needs we re committed to continuing to set the standard for sustainable real estate in 2020 and beyond with that i ll turn the call over to bryan for the detailed financial report bryan davis chief financial officer thank you brian during the fourth quarter of 2019 bpy earned company ffo and realized gains of 459 million compared with 749 million for the same period in 2018 and compared to 324 million earned in the prior quarter our earnings this quarter consisted of 185 million earned from our core office business 217 million earned from our core retail business and 150 million earned from our lp investments these investment level earnings were offset by 93 million of corporate level interest and administrative costs in the current quarter our core office results benefited from earnings of 26 million related to the delivery of condominium units at our principal place in southland projects in london as well as 80 million in realized gains from our lp investment strategy i will provide some more detail on these shortly in the prior year we benefited from land sales gains and investment income of 28 million in our core retail business and 333 million of realized gains in our lp investment strategy as we completed the sale of our north american logistics business on a per unit basis company ffo and realized gains for the current quarter was 0 48 compared with 0 77 earned in the prior year for the full year in 2019 we earned 1 51 billion or 1 57 per unit compared with 1 57 billion or 1 97 per unit earned in 2018 net income attributable to unitholders for the quarter was 1 billion or 1 07 per unit and that compares to 534 million or 0 55 per unit earned in the prior year in the current quarter we recorded unrealized fair value gains of 773 million which included 595 million in gains from our investment properties related to higher cash flow forecast and improved valuation metrics from both our core operations and our lp investments and gains in our active developments as we hit a number of construction milestones and progress leasing on a number of our projects our core office business had a strong fourth quarter our same store operating properties benefited from 4 1 same property noi growth on a natural currency basis and 3 5 in us dollars reflecting the recent strength of the uk pound and canadian dollar lastly investment and other income increased to reflect earnings from our condominium projects as i had previously mentioned at our 299 unit principal place project in london we have sold 269 of those units as of the end of the fourth quarter or 90 and we delivered 199 units to their owners recognizing a gain of 22 million on this project the remaining profit is expected to be expected to be realized as 12 million the majority of which we will earn in q1 as the units are delivered to their owners with the balance throughout 2020 as the remaining 30 units are sold and delivered at our 476 unit tower at south bank in london we have sold 436 of those units as of the end of the fourth quarter or 92 and delivered 61 units to their owners recognizing a gain of 4 million the remaining profit that is expected to be realized is 23 million which we expect the majority to be received in the first half of 2020 as units are delivered we have one more condominium project in london in wood wharf that will impact earnings in 2020 it is a 346 unit tower with 80 of the units already pre sold construction is expected to be complete by the middle of the year with our estimated profit of between 15 million and 20 million reflected in earnings in the last half of the year as units are delivered to their owners in addition included in investment and other income we earned 12 million this quarter related to the monetization of tax credits associated with the affordable units at our four rent residential property the eugene in new york these increases in earnings were partially offset by the impact of asset sales over the past 12 month where proceeds were either reinvested into another business segment used to reduce leverage or were invested in our development and redevelopment projects that are not yet generating a similar level of current earnings in our core retail business we earned 217 million of company ffo compared with 270 million earned in the prior year a few things are contributing to this year over year decline first off same store results this quarter continue to be impacted by the bankruptcies that took place over the last 24 months and was down 3 these bankruptcies which aggregate about 3 2 million square feet have put pressure on our same property results which otherwise were flat on a period over period basis we have made significant progress in releasing 75 of that space at higher rental rates so we expect this impact to be only temporary in addition the prior year benefited from a favorable acquisition related straight line rent adjustment lower operating costs particularly related to insurance and property taxes and higher investment in other income primarily due to prior year condo sales at ala moana prior year investment income and also a prior year land sale gain lastly we had an incremental 7 million in general and administrative expenses this quarter as a result of the requirement to expense internal leasing costs that were previously capitalized company ffo for our lp investments was 70 million in the quarter and reflects 60 million earned from our investment in the three series of real estate opportunity funds that we highlight on page 32 of our supplemental and 10 million from our investment in real estate finance funds multifamily funds and our brazil retail fund investment level earnings were in line with expectations and variances over prior year results is largely due to the sale of stabilized investments in earlier vintage funds with the reinvestment of capital into newer investments where operations are not yet stabilized in addition in the prior year we benefited from a merchant build gain of 11 million from the sale of a residential development project in our multifamily fund investment as i previously mentioned we earned realized gains of 80 million this quarter these gains came from the sale of a multifamily investment in new york where we earned an 18 irr and a 2 1 times multiple of capital on the investment that was made in our first real estate opportunity fund and from our second real estate opportunity fund on the sale of two office towers in brazil where we earned an irr in the mid 20 range in a multiple of capital of over two times a proportionate balance sheet ended the quarter with equity attributable to unit holders of 28 5 billion or 29 72 per unit our overall assets increased to 88 billion to reflect an increase in value of investment properties stronger foreign currencies relative to the us dollar particularly the pound and the acquisition of joint venture partner interests in london wall and at a portfolio of four mall properties in our core retail business we executed a number of financings during the quarter that raised incremental capital added term and reduced our overall cost of debt we highlight these financings in our press release assets held for sale this quarter include one hospitality property in our first real estate opportunity fund investment and one office property in our second real estate opportunity fund investment we expect to close on both those transactions by the end of the second quarter we continue to hold 100 bishopsgate and one manhattan west and one bank street in development properties on our balance sheet even though we ve completed construction as of the end of q3 of the last year we will do so until their tenants make further progress in building out and occupying their space which we would expect will take until the middle of this year once these properties are stabilized they ll earn about 160 million in net operating income lastly and this will be the last quarter i refer to this as we will no longer see any impact to comparable results we did adopt the new leasing standard ifrs 16 which resulted in an increase in our proportionate assets and liabilities of a little over 630 million to reflect land lease liabilities in an offsetting right of use asset the impact to the p l in addition to the expense of direct leasing costs as i previously mentioned is an increase in net operating income of 10 million and a corresponding increase to interest expense to reflect the reit characterization of land lease payments to principal and an associated interest charge with that it s my planned remarks i ll turn the call back over to you brian brian kingston chief executive officer thanks bryan before we open the line to any questions from our analysts i wanted to reiterate our strategic priorities for 2020 which remain largely unchanged from this year first we ll continue to monetize stable mature assets and redeploy that capital into higher returning strategies including unit buybacks we will also continue to access capital markets to try to optimize our cost of capital and keep our balance sheet flexible we have a number of new developments on track for completion in 2020 in cities including new york london and dubai and continue to progress our mall redevelopment repositioning intensification strategies to unlock values in that portfolio properties and as always we ll work to keep our core portfolios highly occupied and marking rents to market as those leases mature so with those as our prepared remarks we re happy to take any questions from analysts on the call today so operator if i could turn it back over to you questions and answers operator and our first question comes from sheila mcgrath with evercore your line is now open sheila mcgrath evercore isi analyst yes brian i was wondering if you could give us your insights on how we should think about the retail performance in 2020 do you think that new bankruptcies or store closings that were recently announced like macy s for example make you more cautious in the near term and will the 75 of the lease up of bankrupt space that you mentioned will that start to impact positively in 2020 brian kingston chief executive officer yeah thanks sheila so as bryan mentioned over the last two years 2018 and 2019 we had about 3 5 million square feet 3 3 million specifically square feet of closures due to bankruptcies which we ve released about 75 and that s a pretty elevated number compared to historical and it s always difficult to say in january how the year is going to pan out but i do think it feels as though the holiday season was pretty good this year and so our expectation is that 2019 probably was sort of peak for that and we re anticipating the 2020 may get a little better you mentioned macy s they came out with an announcement yesterday on 125 closures between rouse and the ggp portfolio the former ggp portfolio we have about 14 of those locations we knew about all of them we obviously work closely with all of the major department stores around which stores are performing which ones aren t so i don t think there is anything that was a surprise in there and those closures are happening over a very long period of time we ve got plans in place for most of them so i don t expect that that will have as large an impact of some of the in line retail bankruptcies that we saw last year and in fact that s typically where we see the biggest impacts around leasing up but as you mentioned we did manage to get 75 we should have the rest of it leased up this year and on the assumption that we have something less than 1 5 million feet which is what we ve average last couple of years of store closures then you should start to see the bounce back this year sheila mcgrath evercore isi analyst okay and then could you talk about your thoughts on leverage levels over the next one or two years and balancing the desire to reduce leverage some with how we should think about share buyback brian kingston chief executive officer yes so i think as bryan has talked about a number of times our focus on reducing leverage very specifically is focused on most particularly the acquisition debt on ggp and as we said the repayment there is through a combination of asset level financing as well as some asset sales and so when we think about deleveraging that s really the primary focus and that really gets driven by those two items right asset sales and as some of these lower levered mortgages rollover and we refinanced them we re able to take that down so i don t think it s necessarily a decision around dedicating capital to de levering versus buying back units i think we ve got a pretty well set out plan as far as where that deleveraging capital comes from and it will continue to be a focus but it s sort of naturally occurring i think the unit buybacks are really just part of our normal capital allocation decision when we have a dollar that we can put to work we compare the relative returns of putting it into developments or new acquisitions or investments in our funds or indeed buying back our units and so i think we continue to believe where the shares trade today it s a very attractive particularly when you adjust it for the risk around that these are assets that we know very well a very attractive place for us to put capital work i think you ll see us continue to be active on both buybacks as well as the leverage reduction sheila mcgrath evercore isi analyst okay one more question i ll get back in line if you could just give us an update on how leasing progress is going at two manhattan west and also manhattan west retail ric clark chairman hi sheila it s ric so i think as you ve probably seen we signed a large lease at two manhattan west with accrued assets for about 25 of the 2 million square feet building lots of activity on the remaining space the building won t be delivered until 2023 ish so we ve got lots of time to finish the leasing and our expectations are we ll make a lot of progress during the year just given the level of activity on the retail front at manhattan west we have as of we have about 240 000 square feet as of today about 80 of that at leased we have a lease out with another restaurant which will take us to about 85 hopefully that will be done in the next 30 days and we ve got about a year left until the retail that really starts to come online it will start to come online over the course of next year and again activity on pretty much every single piece of retail space that we have left there so it s i just on all the leasing has been a great success at manhattan west sheila mcgrath evercore isi analyst okay thank you operator thank you our next question comes from mario saric with scotiabank your line is now open mario saric scotiabank analyst thanks good morning just maybe maybe coming to the to distribution and to buybacks it s sometimes dangerous and not appropriate to kind of two points in time but with your q4 results kind of a 5 distribution increase in sib how would you compare your sentiment today versus a year ago in terms of allocating capital to those two exercises and why not perhaps being more aggressive in the share buybacks today as you were last year brian kingston chief executive officer yeah i mean you re right it s sort of dangerous just to pick a particular day of the year around the buyback i think it s that what in particular was driving the thinking on the sib a year ago was the the shares were dramatically lower than they are today and we thought that it was a good opportunity to put a lot of capital to work in that buyback and it s not to say that we may not do that again at some point in the future but where we are today i think the focus really is around the normal course issuer bid and as we said on the dividend i think what we were trying to do is make sure that we re growing that dividend in line with earnings growth and given the headlines that we had over the course of 2019 so there we would see prudent to keep it in line with the earnings growth we saw this year mario saric scotiabank analyst got it so would it be fair to say that with your targeted of 5 to 8 distribution growth per year over time hasn t really changed brian kingston chief executive officer that s right that s right i think it s and as we sort of pointed out i think we re that s what we have been doing for the last five or six years i mean we would anticipate that earnings growth gets back on track once we clear some of the headwinds around retail cutter and then the distribution moves in line with that mario saric scotiabank analyst all right ok and then maybe switching gears to retail can you talk about how much of the almost 4 negative same store put in q4 related to forever 21 and the issues there potential restructurings the leases and how may that impact your 2020 outlook brian kingston chief executive officer so i m not sure i can split it out necessarily but it was not a material amount of that 3 7 a lot of the as bryan discussed 3 7 was due to store closures which we have not had any forever 21 i don t think we got any forever 21 store closures within the portfolio anywhere so i guess the simple answer is zero of it is due to that but there were a number of other bankruptcies and closures including pay less and a few others earlier on in the year and that s really where the bulk of that impact came from mario saric scotiabank analyst got it and over the year of the 3 3 million square feet of identified bankruptcies of which 70 75 is released how much of that would be income producing to start next year in q1 of 2020 brian kingston chief executive officer virtually we ll i m sorry at some point in 2020 all of it will be it i don t know off hand exactly in q1 but certainly by q2 it should all be in general that once the space is leased up you might have six months at the most of sort of the free rent or fitting out time so by q2 all of that 75 will be online and i d expect by the end of the year all 100 of it will be mario saric scotiabank analyst okay so given that color and you ve been successful in kind of maintaining occupancies in the mid 60s in the portfolio how your how has your outlook changed in terms of same store growth in 2020 from the retail performance brian kingston chief executive officer yeah no look i think we re still anticipating for 2020 positive same store noi growth but it s it will be modestly above 0 somewhere between 0 and 1 5 mario saric scotiabank analyst okay great and then as i know 21 is a bit further out but given the releasing success that you ve had with the anticipation that number should get better in 21 versus 20 assuming that the level of bankruptcies declined 20 versus 19 brian kingston chief executive officer yeah i think when we do get back to a sort of stable long term market the expectation is our same store noi growth in that business should be 2 5 to 3 so i won t get too specific about 2021 but i think it s going to move from that 0 to 1 5 to 2 5 to 3 over time and 2021 should be in that direction mario saric scotiabank analyst right ok and then just my last question just on the realized gains the net proceeds from asset sales totaled 1 8 billion in 19 it sounds like you re expecting something similar for the next couple of years the the disclosed realized gains per unit were 0 18 kind of below the 0 50 that you delivered over the last couple of years and i think you re kind of annual target on a longer term basis is that just a mix issue timing increase in units outstanding last year and do you expect to return to that kind of 0 50 per unit growth brian kingston chief executive officer yes it s almost entirely timing related so we had a number of large realizations toward the end of 2018 and we had fewer in 2019 and i think there s a number of things in the works early for early 2020 that sort of gets it back on so i think that 0 40 0 50 on a long term basis is a good stabilized measure but it is lumpy as you point out because these transactions don t necessarily follow calendar years mario saric scotiabank analyst got it ok thank you brian kingston chief executive officer okay operator thank you and our next question is a follow up from sheila mcgrath with evercore your line is now open sheila mcgrath evercore isi analyst i guess a couple of modeling questions can you give us insight on 100 bishopsgate one manhattan west and the sono collection when did they hit within for the full quarter or fourth quarter and then similar question on the releasing of the 3 2 million square feet of bankruptcies has the releasing of that has that already impacted the income statement or is that something that should impact some time in 2020 brian kingston chief executive officer yeah sheila i will just take a 100 bishopsgate and one manhattan west first i d say they actually had a negative impact to our earnings this quarter although construction is finished tenants are still moving in at 100 bishopsgate we re only about 20 of physical occupancy and at about at one manhattan west i think we re only 5 physical occupancy and typically rent tracks the tenants moving in so we don t expect until toward the end of 2020 to reach stabilization on those two properties sono had about 85 physical occupancy when it opened but i ll remind you that we now only own 19 of that property because we sold the balance to partners so it didn t really have that much impact on our current period results the one other one i may mention is one bank street that again was another property that we completed construction in 2000 or in q3 it s at 40 physical occupancy so it s about breakeven but will start contributing to earnings in the early part of 2020 of this year and i think just to reiterate bryan s comments on the 3 2 million square feet there may be elements of it that were contributing to results but on an overall basis as you saw from our same store performance in q4 not a lot of it was contributing to our results and our expectation is that by the end of 2020 that will be fully leased on that space and that will be contributing to noi sheila mcgrath evercore isi analyst okay great and then on you have a couple through forest city acquisition a couple in san francisco developments pier 70 and 5m i know you announced a new timber building at pier 70 but then there were reports that you were in discussions with a single tenant for the entire project can you just update us on what s going on at pier 70 and 5m brian kingston chief executive officer yeah so it would be a little premature to comment specifically on any tenants but what i will say as the san francisco market is virtually fully occupied there s a lot of demand for this and as i think you know pier 70 is is a pretty unique offering for large scale tenants in that market particularly with the transportation links it has so we ve got a lot of a lot of interest on that and i anticipate over the course of this year we ll probably have more to say but it s little early to comment specifically on any tenants sheila mcgrath evercore isi analyst and do you need prop m allocation for either 5m or pier 70 or are there already brian kingston chief executive officer they re both they re both fully allocated yeah sheila mcgrath evercore isi analyst okay okay and then just on the london wall acquisition of buying out your partner can you just give us some insight on what drove that transaction brian kingston chief executive officer yeah well it was a 50 50 partnership and our partner on that one had decided to take their interest to market they got offers that we thought were below the value of the asset and so as a 50 50 owner we had last look at the price and so we elected to buy it rather than see somebody else purchased at that price i think the expectation was and you ll sort of roll back the clock this was at a pretty uncertain time with respect to brexit and we thought the bids were discounted as a result of that my expectations over the course of this year you re going to see values move pretty much early in london and that s we think it s going to be a pretty attractive basis that we ve got on that asset sheila mcgrath evercore isi analyst okay great thank you brian kingston chief executive officer okay operator thank you and our next question is a follow up from mario saric with scotiabank your line is now open mario saric scotiabank analyst hi sorry just one more from me the ifrs nav was up 4 quarter over quarter which is for your strongest increase that we ve seen in three plus years albeit some of it was due to the stronger british pound and brian as you mentioned how much specifically related to one manhattan west and 100 bishopsgate how much additional fair value increase do you see in those two assets going forward in terms of recognizing fair value gains in ifrs bryan davis chief financial officer there will be a fair bit i m going to avoid giving exact percentages or exact numbers because we don t specifically talk about values on assets but i d say a little bit less for 100 bishopsgate because we are farther along in terms of occupancy and getting our tenants in place but as you can imagine with these ifrs models as the cash flows and the free rent periods burn off that really drops to the bottom line value of these underlying properties so i d say that we still expect to see a fair bit more of unrealized gains associated with both of these properties as the tenant fill up and ultimately the tenants cash or free rent period start to burn off mario saric scotiabank analyst got it would it be fair to say that of the roughly 500 million of fair value gains in core office this quarter a modest amount of that would be related to those two bryan davis chief financial officer yeah and you can specifically see in our supplemental where we do break out fair value gains associated with our development properties in the continuity so you could probably get a sense that those values are attributed to the projects at one bank 100 bishopsgate and five manhattan west in particular but then almost two thirds of the value of the fair value gains that we had related to our operating properties just related to sort of our core office core retail and operating lp investment properties mario saric scotiabank analyst got it okay thank you operator ladies and gentlemen this concludes our question and answer session i would now like to turn the call back over to brian kingston chief executive officer for any closing remarks brian kingston chief

investor relations please go ahead sir matt cherry senior vice president of investor relations thank you daniel and good morning before we begin our presentation let me caution you that our discussion will include forward looking statements these statements that relate to future results and events are based on our current expectations our actual results in future periods may differ materially from those currently expected because of a number of risks uncertainties and assumptions the risks uncertainties and assumptions that we believe are material are outlined in our press release issued this morning with that i ll turn the call over to chief executive officer brian kingston brian kingston chief executive officer thank you matt and good morning everyone and thank you for joining our call today with me on the call are ric clark chairman of bpy and bryan davis our cfo in my prepared remarks i ll recap our operating performance from the quarter and the year as well as providing an update on our various ongoing strategic initiatives bryan will then provide a more detailed update on our quarterly and annual financial results and after that we d be happy to take questions from any of our analysts on the call today so as you may have seen in our disclosure this morning bpy earned company ffo and realized gains of 459 million or 0 48 per unit in the fourth quarter closing the year with a strong performance in our office business good performance in retail and continued active recycling of our capital for the full year of 2019 cash flow from operations and realized gains was 1 5 billion or 1 57 per unit and that compares to 1 6 billion or 1 97 per unit in 2018 the prior year having benefited from several unusually large realizations in our opportunistic fund strategy in light of this performance our board approved the declaration of a quarterly dividend of 0 3325 per unit which represents a 1 increase over 2019 we ve continued to utilize cash flow generated from the expansion of our business to but understand the importance of this dividend to many of our investors since our initial launch in 2013 we have increased the distribution by 5 on a compound annual basis and is more of our development activities become cash generating in the years ahead this will enable us to continue to increase the dividend in line with that earnings growth consistent with prior years we completed 3 3 billion of asset sales at prices that were 6 higher than our ifrs carrying values generating net proceeds of 1 8 billion to bpy which were redeployed into our business last year at much higher returns we utilized some of the proceeds from sales to repurchase over 500 million of our units in 2019 and expect to remain active should our units continue to trade at a meaningful discount to their intrinsic value over the next several years as we continue to monetize investments in our real estate opportunity funds as well as mature stable assets on our balance sheet we expect to generate between 1 5 billion and 2 billion of net proceeds each year which can then be reinvested into our business performance in our core office business was strong in 2019 in total we leased 7 8 million square feet of office space at rents that were 32 higher than our expiring leases we achieved same store growth of 3 in this business and occupancy finished the year at 93 up 90 basis points over last year our retail portfolio remains resilient we finished the year at over 96 occupancy no decline from the prior year and completed 10 5 million square feet of new leases in 2019 demonstrating the continued demand for high quality well located retail space importantly we continue to see positive rent spreads and growing tenant sales at our centers as presented at our annual investor day in september we ve identified 15 near and long term value creation initiatives at several of our best performing centers that will add 1 8 billion of value when they re completed we look forward to providing you with updates and milestones on these projects as they progress the year was also highlighted by the delivery of several of our largest development projects including one manhattan west 100 bishopsgate and the sono collection in norwalk connecticut these assets are best in class premier properties in their respective markets office tenants began occupying space at one manhattan west and 100 bishopsgate in late 2019 and sono opened its stores just in time for the holiday shopping season with most retailers reporting sales that were above expectations these newly developed assets and others that are nearing completion will begin contributing meaningfully to bpy s earnings in 2020 and moving forward furthermore our development pipeline remains active with major projects under way in new york toronto london dubai sydney melbourne and perth completion of these substantially pre let office projects will continue to drive above average earnings growth in our core office portfolio for the foreseeable future we remained active in capital markets in 2019 as the environment offered favorable terms to well capitalized asset owners and corporate issuers in our core office and core retail businesses we raised over 10 billion of non recourse property mortgages while reducing our average cost of debt by 30 basis points we also issued 434 million of perpetual preferred shares and cad600 million of five year unsecured notes while sustainability and other esg initiatives have been in great focus within the business environment over the past 12 months they ve always been an integral part of how we do business by constructing energy efficient buildings we ve reduced energy demand through our operations and lowered annual associated operating costs by over 30 million since 2008 specifically in 2019 we were able to maintain our green star rating under the annual global real estate sustainability benchmark we issued the first ever perpetual green units in our industry and continued our commitment to build 100 of our new office developments to a minimum leed gold standard in december we announced that we will construct the largest mass timber building in the united states at pier 70 in san francisco demonstrating how we re applying emerging technologies and innovative design to create environmentally sustainable solutions our core retail business is ranked sixth in the us in terms of corporate installed on site solar capacity and generates over 25 of our portfolio s common area electricity needs we re committed to continuing to set the standard for sustainable real estate in 2020 and beyond with that i ll turn the call over to bryan for the detailed financial report bryan davis chief financial officer thank you brian during the fourth quarter of 2019 bpy earned company ffo and realized gains of 459 million compared with 749 million for the same period in 2018 and compared to 324 million earned in the prior quarter our earnings this quarter consisted of 185 million earned from our core office business 217 million earned from our core retail business and 150 million earned from our lp investments these investment level earnings were offset by 93 million of corporate level interest and administrative costs in the current quarter our core office results benefited from earnings of 26 million related to the delivery of condominium units at our principal place in southland projects in london as well as 80 million in realized gains from our lp investment strategy i will provide some more detail on these shortly in the prior year we benefited from land sales gains and investment income of 28 million in our core retail business and 333 million of realized gains in our lp investment strategy as we completed the sale of our north american logistics business on a per unit basis company ffo and realized gains for the current quarter was 0 48 compared with 0 77 earned in the prior year for the full year in 2019 we earned 1 51 billion or 1 57 per unit compared with 1 57 billion or 1 97 per unit earned in 2018 net income attributable to unitholders for the quarter was 1 billion or 1 07 per unit and that compares to 534 million or 0 55 per unit earned in the prior year in the current quarter we recorded unrealized fair value gains of 773 million which included 595 million in gains from our investment properties related to higher cash flow forecast and improved valuation metrics from both our core operations and our lp investments and gains in our active developments as we hit a number of construction milestones and progress leasing on a number of our projects our core office business had a strong fourth quarter our same store operating properties benefited from 4 1 same property noi growth on a natural currency basis and 3 5 in us dollars reflecting the recent strength of the uk pound and canadian dollar lastly investment and other income increased to reflect earnings from our condominium projects as i had previously mentioned at our 299 unit principal place project in london we have sold 269 of those units as of the end of the fourth quarter or 90 and we delivered 199 units to their owners recognizing a gain of 22 million on this project the remaining profit is expected to be expected to be realized as 12 million the majority of which we will earn in q1 as the units are delivered to their owners with the balance throughout 2020 as the remaining 30 units are sold and delivered at our 476 unit tower at south bank in london we have sold 436 of those units as of the end of the fourth quarter or 92 and delivered 61 units to their owners recognizing a gain of 4 million the remaining profit that is expected to be realized is 23 million which we expect the majority to be received in the first half of 2020 as units are delivered we have one more condominium project in london in wood wharf that will impact earnings in 2020 it is a 346 unit tower with 80 of the units already pre sold construction is expected to be complete by the middle of the year with our estimated profit of between 15 million and 20 million reflected in earnings in the last half of the year as units are delivered to their owners in addition included in investment and other income we earned 12 million this quarter related to the monetization of tax credits associated with the affordable units at our four rent residential property the eugene in new york these increases in earnings were partially offset by the impact of asset sales over the past 12 month where proceeds were either reinvested into another business segment used to reduce leverage or were invested in our development and redevelopment projects that are not yet generating a similar level of current earnings in our core retail business we earned 217 million of company ffo compared with 270 million earned in the prior year a few things are contributing to this year over year decline first off same store results this quarter continue to be impacted by the bankruptcies that took place over the last 24 months and was down 3 these bankruptcies which aggregate about 3 2 million square feet have put pressure on our same property results which otherwise were flat on a period over period basis we have made significant progress in releasing 75 of that space at higher rental rates so we expect this impact to be only temporary in addition the prior year benefited from a favorable acquisition related straight line rent adjustment lower operating costs particularly related to insurance and property taxes and higher investment in other income primarily due to prior year condo sales at ala moana prior year investment income and also a prior year land sale gain lastly we had an incremental 7 million in general and administrative expenses this quarter as a result of the requirement to expense internal leasing costs that were previously capitalized company ffo for our lp investments was 70 million in the quarter and reflects 60 million earned from our investment in the three series of real estate opportunity funds that we highlight on page 32 of our supplemental and 10 million from our investment in real estate finance funds multifamily funds and our brazil retail fund investment level earnings were in line with expectations and variances over prior year results is largely due to the sale of stabilized investments in earlier vintage funds with the reinvestment of capital into newer investments where operations are not yet stabilized in addition in the prior year we benefited from a merchant build gain of 11 million from the sale of a residential development project in our multifamily fund investment as i previously mentioned we earned realized gains of 80 million this quarter these gains came from the sale of a multifamily investment in new york where we earned an 18 irr and a 2 1 times multiple of capital on the investment that was made in our first real estate opportunity fund and from our second real estate opportunity fund on the sale of two office towers in brazil where we earned an irr in the mid 20 range in a multiple of capital of over two times a proportionate balance sheet ended the quarter with equity attributable to unit holders of 28 5 billion or 29 72 per unit our overall assets increased to 88 billion to reflect an increase in value of investment properties stronger foreign currencies relative to the us dollar particularly the pound and the acquisition of joint venture partner interests in london wall and at a portfolio of four mall properties in our core retail business we executed a number of financings during the quarter that raised incremental capital added term and reduced our overall cost of debt we highlight these financings in our press release assets held for sale this quarter include one hospitality property in our first real estate opportunity fund investment and one office property in our second real estate opportunity fund investment we expect to close on both those transactions by the end of the second quarter we continue to hold 100 bishopsgate and one manhattan west and one bank street in development properties on our balance sheet even though we ve completed construction as of the end of q3 of the last year we will do so until their tenants make further progress in building out and occupying their space which we would expect will take until the middle of this year once these properties are stabilized they ll earn about 160 million in net operating income lastly and this will be the last quarter i refer to this as we will no longer see any impact to comparable results we did adopt the new leasing standard ifrs 16 which resulted in an increase in our proportionate assets and liabilities of a little over 630 million to reflect land lease liabilities in an offsetting right of use asset the impact to the p l in addition to the expense of direct leasing costs as i previously mentioned is an increase in net operating income of 10 million and a corresponding increase to interest expense to reflect the reit characterization of land lease payments to principal and an associated interest charge with that it s my planned remarks i ll turn the call back over to you brian brian kingston chief executive officer thanks bryan before we open the line to any questions from our analysts i wanted to reiterate our strategic priorities for 2020 which remain largely unchanged from this year first we ll continue to monetize stable mature assets and redeploy that capital into higher returning strategies including unit buybacks we will also continue to access capital markets to try to optimize our cost of capital and keep our balance sheet flexible we have a number of new developments on track for completion in 2020 in cities including new york london and dubai and continue to progress our mall redevelopment repositioning intensification strategies to unlock values in that portfolio properties and as always we ll work to keep our core portfolios highly occupied and marking rents to market as those leases mature so with those as our prepared remarks we re happy to take any questions from analysts on the call today so operator if i could turn it back over to you questions and answers operator and our first question comes from sheila mcgrath with evercore your line is now open sheila mcgrath evercore isi analyst yes brian i was wondering if you could give us your insights on how we should think about the retail performance in 2020 do you think that new bankruptcies or store closings that were recently announced like macy s for example make you more cautious in the near term and will the 75 of the lease up of bankrupt space that you mentioned will that start to impact positively in 2020 brian kingston chief executive officer yeah thanks sheila so as bryan mentioned over the last two years 2018 and 2019 we had about 3 5 million square feet 3 3 million specifically square feet of closures due to bankruptcies which we ve released about 75 and that s a pretty elevated number compared to historical and it s always difficult to say in january how the year is going to pan out but i do think it feels as though the holiday season was pretty good this year and so our expectation is that 2019 probably was sort of peak for that and we re anticipating the 2020 may get a little better you mentioned macy s they came out with an announcement yesterday on 125 closures between rouse and the ggp portfolio the former ggp portfolio we have about 14 of those locations we knew about all of them we obviously work closely with all of the major department stores around which stores are performing which ones aren t so i don t think there is anything that was a surprise in there and those closures are happening over a very long period of time we ve got plans in place for most of them so i don t expect that that will have as large an impact of some of the in line retail bankruptcies that we saw last year and in fact that s typically where we see the biggest impacts around leasing up but as you mentioned we did manage to get 75 we should have the rest of it leased up this year and on the assumption that we have something less than 1 5 million feet which is what we ve average last couple of years of store closures then you should start to see the bounce back this year sheila mcgrath evercore isi analyst okay and then could you talk about your thoughts on leverage levels over the next one or two years and balancing the desire to reduce leverage some with how we should think about share buyback brian kingston chief executive officer yes so i think as bryan has talked about a number of times our focus on reducing leverage very specifically is focused on most particularly the acquisition debt on ggp and as we said the repayment there is through a combination of asset level financing as well as some asset sales and so when we think about deleveraging that s really the primary focus and that really gets driven by those two items right asset sales and as some of these lower levered mortgages rollover and we refinanced them we re able to take that down so i don t think it s necessarily a decision around dedicating capital to de levering versus buying back units i think we ve got a pretty well set out plan as far as where that deleveraging capital comes from and it will continue to be a focus but it s sort of naturally occurring i think the unit buybacks are really just part of our normal capital allocation decision when we have a dollar that we can put to work we compare the relative returns of putting it into developments or new acquisitions or investments in our funds or indeed buying back our units and so i think we continue to believe where the shares trade today it s a very attractive particularly when you adjust it for the risk around that these are assets that we know very well a very attractive place for us to put capital work i think you ll see us continue to be active on both buybacks as well as the leverage reduction sheila mcgrath evercore isi analyst okay one more question i ll get back in line if you could just give us an update on how leasing progress is going at two manhattan west and also manhattan west retail ric clark chairman hi sheila it s ric so i think as you ve probably seen we signed a large lease at two manhattan west with accrued assets for about 25 of the 2 million square feet building lots of activity on the remaining space the building won t be delivered until 2023 ish so we ve got lots of time to finish the leasing and our expectations are we ll make a lot of progress during the year just given the level of activity on the retail front at manhattan west we have as of we have about 240 000 square feet as of today about 80 of that at leased we have a lease out with another restaurant which will take us to about 85 hopefully that will be done in the next 30 days and we ve got about a year left until the retail that really starts to come online it will start to come online over the course of next year and again activity on pretty much every single piece of retail space that we have left there so it s i just on all the leasing has been a great success at manhattan west sheila mcgrath evercore isi analyst okay thank you operator thank you our next question comes from mario saric with scotiabank your line is now open mario saric scotiabank analyst thanks good morning just maybe maybe coming to the to distribution and to buybacks it s sometimes dangerous and not appropriate to kind of two points in time but with your q4 results kind of a 5 distribution increase in sib how would you compare your sentiment today versus a year ago in terms of allocating capital to those two exercises and why not perhaps being more aggressive in the share buybacks today as you were last year brian kingston chief executive officer yeah i mean you re right it s sort of dangerous just to pick a particular day of the year around the buyback i think it s that what in particular was driving the thinking on the sib a year ago was the the shares were dramatically lower than they are today and we thought that it was a good opportunity to put a lot of capital to work in that buyback and it s not to say that we may not do that again at some point in the future but where we are today i think the focus really is around the normal course issuer bid and as we said on the dividend i think what we were trying to do is make sure that we re growing that dividend in line with earnings growth and given the headlines that we had over the course of 2019 so there we would see prudent to keep it in line with the earnings growth we saw this year mario saric scotiabank analyst got it so would it be fair to say that with your targeted of 5 to 8 distribution growth per year over time hasn t really changed brian kingston chief executive officer that s right that s right i think it s and as we sort of pointed out i think we re that s what we have been doing for the last five or six years i mean we would anticipate that earnings growth gets back on track once we clear some of the headwinds around retail cutter and then the distribution moves in line with that mario saric scotiabank analyst all right ok and then maybe switching gears to retail can you talk about how much of the almost 4 negative same store put in q4 related to forever 21 and the issues there potential restructurings the leases and how may that impact your 2020 outlook brian kingston chief executive officer so i m not sure i can split it out necessarily but it was not a material amount of that 3 7 a lot of the as bryan discussed 3 7 was due to store closures which we have not had any forever 21 i don t think we got any forever 21 store closures within the portfolio anywhere so i guess the simple answer is zero of it is due to that but there were a number of other bankruptcies and closures including pay less and a few others earlier on in the year and that s really where the bulk of that impact came from mario saric scotiabank analyst got it and over the year of the 3 3 million square feet of identified bankruptcies of which 70 75 is released how much of that would be income producing to start next year in q1 of 2020 brian kingston chief executive officer virtually we ll i m sorry at some point in 2020 all of it will be it i don t know off hand exactly in q1 but certainly by q2 it should all be in general that once the space is leased up you might have six months at the most of sort of the free rent or fitting out time so by q2 all of that 75 will be online and i d expect by the end of the year all 100 of it will be mario saric scotiabank analyst okay so given that color and you ve been successful in kind of maintaining occupancies in the mid 60s in the portfolio how your how has your outlook changed in terms of same store growth in 2020 from the retail performance brian kingston chief executive officer yeah no look i think we re still anticipating for 2020 positive same store noi growth but it s it will be modestly above 0 somewhere between 0 and 1 5 mario saric scotiabank analyst okay great and then as i know 21 is a bit further out but given the releasing success that you ve had with the anticipation that number should get better in 21 versus 20 assuming that the level of bankruptcies declined 20 versus 19 brian kingston chief executive officer yeah i think when we do get back to a sort of stable long term market the expectation is our same store noi growth in that business should be 2 5 to 3 so i won t get too specific about 2021 but i think it s going to move from that 0 to 1 5 to 2 5 to 3 over time and 2021 should be in that direction mario saric scotiabank analyst right ok and then just my last question just on the realized gains the net proceeds from asset sales totaled 1 8 billion in 19 it sounds like you re expecting something similar for the next couple of years the the disclosed realized gains per unit were 0 18 kind of below the 0 50 that you delivered over the last couple of years and i think you re kind of annual target on a longer term basis is that just a mix issue timing increase in units outstanding last year and do you expect to return to that kind of 0 50 per unit growth brian kingston chief executive officer yes it s almost entirely timing related so we had a number of large realizations toward the end of 2018 and we had fewer in 2019 and i think there s a number of things in the works early for early 2020 that sort of gets it back on so i think that 0 40 0 50 on a long term basis is a good stabilized measure but it is lumpy as you point out because these transactions don t necessarily follow calendar years mario saric scotiabank analyst got it ok thank you brian kingston chief executive officer okay operator thank you and our next question is a follow up from sheila mcgrath with evercore your line is now open sheila mcgrath evercore isi analyst i guess a couple of modeling questions can you give us insight on 100 bishopsgate one manhattan west and the sono collection when did they hit within for the full quarter or fourth quarter and then similar question on the releasing of the 3 2 million square feet of bankruptcies has the releasing of that has that already impacted the income statement or is that something that should impact some time in 2020 brian kingston chief executive officer yeah sheila i will just take a 100 bishopsgate and one manhattan west first i d say they actually had a negative impact to our earnings this quarter although construction is finished tenants are still moving in at 100 bishopsgate we re only about 20 of physical occupancy and at about at one manhattan west i think we re only 5 physical occupancy and typically rent tracks the tenants moving in so we don t expect until toward the end of 2020 to reach stabilization on those two properties sono had about 85 physical occupancy when it opened but i ll remind you that we now only own 19 of that property because we sold the balance to partners so it didn t really have that much impact on our current period results the one other one i may mention is one bank street that again was another property that we completed construction in 2000 or in q3 it s at 40 physical occupancy so it s about breakeven but will start contributing to earnings in the early part of 2020 of this year and i think just to reiterate bryan s comments on the 3 2 million square feet there may be elements of it that were contributing to results but on an overall basis as you saw from our same store performance in q4 not a lot of it was contributing to our results and our expectation is that by the end of 2020 that will be fully leased on that space and that will be contributing to noi sheila mcgrath evercore isi analyst okay great and then on you have a couple through forest city acquisition a couple in san francisco developments pier 70 and 5m i know you announced a new timber building at pier 70 but then there were reports that you were in discussions with a single tenant for the entire project can you just update us on what s going on at pier 70 and 5m brian kingston chief executive officer yeah so it would be a little premature to comment specifically on any tenants but what i will say as the san francisco market is virtually fully occupied there s a lot of demand for this and as i think you know pier 70 is is a pretty unique offering for large scale tenants in that market particularly with the transportation links it has so we ve got a lot of a lot of interest on that and i anticipate over the course of this year we ll probably have more to say but it s little early to comment specifically on any tenants sheila mcgrath evercore isi analyst and do you need prop m allocation for either 5m or pier 70 or are there already brian kingston chief executive officer they re both they re both fully allocated yeah sheila mcgrath evercore isi analyst okay okay and then just on the london wall acquisition of buying out your partner can you just give us some insight on what drove that transaction brian kingston chief executive officer yeah well it was a 50 50 partnership and our partner on that one had decided to take their interest to market they got offers that we thought were below the value of the asset and so as a 50 50 owner we had last look at the price and so we elected to buy it rather than see somebody else purchased at that price i think the expectation was and you ll sort of roll back the clock this was at a pretty uncertain time with respect to brexit and we thought the bids were discounted as a result of that my expectations over the course of this year you re going to see values move pretty much early in london and that s we think it s going to be a pretty attractive basis that we ve got on that asset sheila mcgrath evercore isi analyst okay great thank you brian kingston chief executive officer okay operator thank you and our next question is a follow up from mario saric with scotiabank your line is now open mario saric scotiabank analyst hi sorry just one more from me the ifrs nav was up 4 quarter over quarter which is for your strongest increase that we ve seen in three plus years albeit some of it was due to the stronger british pound and brian as you mentioned how much specifically related to one manhattan west and 100 bishopsgate how much additional fair value increase do you see in those two assets going forward in terms of recognizing fair value gains in ifrs bryan davis chief financial officer there will be a fair bit i m going to avoid giving exact percentages or exact numbers because we don t specifically talk about values on assets but i d say a little bit less for 100 bishopsgate because we are farther along in terms of occupancy and getting our tenants in place but as you can imagine with these ifrs models as the cash flows and the free rent periods burn off that really drops to the bottom line value of these underlying properties so i d say that we still expect to see a fair bit more of unrealized gains associated with both of these properties as the tenant fill up and ultimately the tenants cash or free rent period start to burn off mario saric scotiabank analyst got it would it be fair to say that of the roughly 500 million of fair value gains in core office this quarter a modest amount of that would be related to those two bryan davis chief financial officer yeah and you can specifically see in our supplemental where we do break out fair value gains associated with our development properties in the continuity so you could probably get a sense that those values are attributed to the projects at one bank 100 bishopsgate and five manhattan west in particular but then almost two thirds of the value of the fair value gains that we had related to our operating properties just related to sort of our core office core retail and operating lp investment properties mario saric scotiabank analyst got it okay thank you operator ladies and gentlemen this concludes our question and answer session i would now like to turn the call back over to brian kingston chief executive officer for any closing remarks brian kingston chief executive officer okay thank you everyone for joining the call today and we look forward to providing you further updates over the course of 2020 and obviously in the meantime should you have any

spread the love harare trafigura pte limited has parted ways with its zimbabwean partners sakunda holdings owned by businessman mr kuda tagwirei according to state media trafigura pte limited now owns 100 percent of trafigura zimbabwe after acquiring sakunda holdings 51 percent stake trafigura zimbabwe supplies fuel through puma redan and sakunda service stations and reportedly has interests in the feruka oil pipeline however the deal awaits regulatory approval further trafigura expects the transaction to improve clarity on the company s local operations imf has privately warned zimbabwe that state payouts to a company linked to global commodities trader trafigura were pushing the shortages plagued economy to the brink reviving fears of corruption at the highest level of government trafigura pte which is head quartered in switzerland held a minority 49 percent stake in trafigura zimbabwe through puma energy while sakunda petroleum had the controlling stake of 51 percent in line with local content laws that applied at the time of the investment the second republic has since tweaked the local content laws to attract more investors under the policy zimbabwe is open for business trafigura zimbabwe was only involved in petroleum supply and distribution the joint venture company was renamed from sakunda supplies to trafigura zimbabwe to differentiate the joint activities of marketing fuel from those of the wider sakunda group of companies mr tagwirei s mobile phone went unanswered last night and had not responded to a text message by the time of going to print however a trafigura pte ltd spokesperson yesterday confirmed trafigura tagwirei part ways the transaction in december 2019 trafigura pte ltd signed an agreement to become the 100 percent owner of fuel supply business trafigura zimbabwe this follows the purchase of sakunda holding s 51 percent stake in the company which is currently awaiting final regulatory approval said the spokesperson this will bring improved clarity on trafigura s activities in the country an opportunity for more robust financing of trafigura zimbabwe and aims to help improve the security of supply of fuel to zimbabwe trafigura zimbabwe will continue to ensure that petroleum products are made available in line with zera the zimbabwe energy regulatory authority s regulated price build up and quality standards usd liquidity remains tight contributing to a challenging business environment for suppliers and consumers nevertheless trafigura is committed to continuing to work closely with the reserve bank of zimbabwe to provide credit and flexibility notwithstanding its limited commercial role in the country the trafigura spokesperson assured interested parties in zimbabwe that the ownership change will not cause any interruption to trafigura s supply of fuel to zimbabwe zera acting chief executive officer mr eddington mazambani could neither confirm nor deny the transaction trafigura is not a licensee so zera wouldn t have their shareholding structure trafigura or sakunda are best placed to comment he said he referred further questions to the competition and tariff commission ctc which handles mergers and de mergers to check on potential monopolies that could arise ctc director ms ellen ruparanganda asked for written questions and had not responded by the time of going to print secretary for energy and power development dr gloria magombo said she was not aware of the transaction payouts to sakunda holdings a fuel company owned by an ally of president emmerson mnangagwa were in effect met by the central bank s printing money the transactions severely undermined the country s currency the zimbabwe dollar only months after it was introduced the washington based institution told harare this month according to two people with knowledge of the discussions the payments have shed light on the financial links between the state and sakunda s chief executive kudakwashe tagwirei a businessman close to the ruling zanu pf party sakunda also owns a stake in trafigura zimbabwe a joint venture with trafigura one of the world s largest oil traders sakunda received 366m in government bonds as payments for supplying command agriculture a state farm subsidy scheme that mr mnangagwa has championed however when sakunda redeemed some of the bonds the payouts were made in zimbabwe dollars at an exchange rate that translated into massive money printing the redemptions led to a 80 per cent surge in zimbabwe s monetary base money in circulation including bank reserves the imf s programme with harare has set a target of 8 to 10 per cent for this year mnangagwa welcomed the account freeze saying it would stop people from trying to undermine the currency following the imf warning zimbabwe s regulators froze the bank accounts of sakunda and other companies the move temporarily halted a sharp decline in the zimbabwe dollar also known as the rtgs dollar however the consequences of the payments to sakunda added to disquiet in zimbabwe over allegations of state capture the exploitation of public institutions and funds for private interests opposition politicians have accused mr tagwirei of using his connections to the ruling party and the central bank to build his business tendai biti a former finance minister and lawmaker with the opposition said if ever there was state capture it is sakunda since replacing the late dictator robert mugabe following a 2017 coup mr mnangagwa has vowed to make zimbabwe open for business in february last year he reintroduced the zimbabwe dollar a decade after its abolition in the aftermath of hyperinflation but the currency has since fallen more than 60 per cent against the us dollar fuelling triple digit inflation and dire shortages the 366m bonds were issued in us dollars in january the latest of hundreds of millions of us dollars in government bonds issued to sakunda in recent years when the new currency was created a month later zimbabwean contracts in us dollars were generally converted one to one into the new currency recommended david pilling zimbabwe s economic crisis has reached a breaking point but in july sakunda was paid by the central bank on the basis of eight to nine rtgs dollars per dollar of original face value people with knowledge of the financial transactions said mr mnangagwa welcomed the account freeze saying it would stop people from trying to undermine the currency the government has denied any wrongdoing zimbabwe s finance ministry the country s central bank and mr tagwirei and sakunda did not respond to many requests for comment trafigura also declined to comment on the allegations against mr tagwirei a spokesperson for trafigura said trafigura zimbabwe is only involved with petroleum distribution and has no involvement with the activities of sakunda holdings in zimbabwe the imf has been monitoring economic reforms in zimbabwe since may last year part of a cautious testing of the waters by western nations on future financial support for mr mnangagwa s government abuses by mr mnangagwa s security forces have made international investors and leaders warier of mugabe s successor in a statement about the performance of the programme the imf said that weakening confidence policy uncertainty a continuation of fx market distortions and a recent expansionary monetary stance had increased pressure on the currency there is also a need to strengthen fx market operations and improve transparency on monetary statistics the fund added share this share twitter facebook email
