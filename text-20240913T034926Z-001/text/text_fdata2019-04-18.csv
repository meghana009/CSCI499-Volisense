dublin business wire regulatory news mainstay medical international plc mainstay ou la société euronext paris msty pa et euronext dublin msty ie une société de dispositifs médicaux dédiée à la commercialisation de reactiv8 un dispositif de neurostimulation implantable destiné à traiter une cause sous jacente de la lombalgie chronique invalidante fait aujourd hui le point sur ses avancées et annonce la publication de ses résultats de l exercice 2018 et de son rapport annuel jason hannon président directeur général de mainstay déclare je suis fermement convaincu de la pertinence de reactiv8 en tant qu option thérapeutique pour les patients souffrant de lombalgie chronique invalidante les mois et les années à venir apporteront la preuve de l importance de notre dispositif tant pour notre clientèle de médecins que pour leurs patients comme pour les investisseurs sur le marché le principal paramètre d évaluation de notre essai clinique reactiv8 b n a pas été atteint du fait d une réponse du groupe de contrôle après 120 jours plus élevée qu attendue nous estimons toutefois que les résultats globaux de l essai constituent une démonstration convaincante de l efficacité et de l innocuité de reactiv8 notre opinion repose notamment sur une analyse préspécifiée du paramètre principal après ajustement pour prendre en compte les augmentations de médication antalgique des patients pour des raisons qui ne sont pas en lien avec leur lombalgie pour mémoire le taux de réponse correspond à une amélioration de la réduction de la douleur de 30 telle que signalée par le patient sur l échelle visuelle analogique eva sans renforcement du traitement antalgique au cours des derniers 120 jours des écarts statistiquement significatifs entre le groupe de traitement et le groupe de contrôle pour les principaux paramètres secondaires d efficacité à 120 jours un taux de réponse de 72 chez les patients du groupe de traitement et du groupe de contrôle combinés implantés depuis un an et une diminution significative de l utilisation d antalgiques y compris les opioïdes un an après l implantation du dispositif ces résultats devraient selon nous stimuler la croissance des ventes en allemagne et sur les autres marchés bénéficiant actuellement de notre marquage ce et étayer notre demande de mise sur le marché américain nous projetons de déposer cette demande auprès de la fda mi 2019 dans la perspective d une décision fin 2020 faits marquants en novembre 2018 mainstay a annoncé les résultats préliminaires de l essai clinique reactiv8 b un essai prospectif international multicentrique randomisé activement contrôlé en aveugle avec permutation réalisé dans le cadre d une dispense investigational device exemption ide des autorités américaines us food and drug administration fda au total 204 patients ont reçu reactiv8 en implant dans des centres de recherche de pointe aux états unis en europe et en australie et ont été randomisés à parité pour traitement ou contrôle ces patients souffraient de lombalgie depuis 14 ans en moyenne dans le groupe de traitement le générateur d impulsions reactiv8 a été programmé pour délivrer des stimulations électriques stimulant la contraction du muscle multifidus dans le groupe de contrôle l appareil a été programmé pour des stimulations électriques de faible niveau suite à l évaluation du paramètre principal à 120 jours les patients du groupe de contrôle ont rejoint le groupe de traitement pour y recevoir le même protocole de traitement voici une synthèse des résultats cliniques de l essai le principal paramètre d évaluation de l essai consistait à comparer le taux de réponse du groupe de traitement avec celui du groupe de contrôle tel que mesuré sur l échelle de douleur visuelle analogique eva la réponse s entendant comme une amélioration d au moins 30 120 jours après la date de randomisation sans augmentation des analgésiques et ou relaxants musculaires au cours des deux semaines précédant l évaluation dans le groupe de traitement le taux de réponse à 120 jours s établit à 57 contre 47 dans le groupe de contrôle soit un écart non significatif statistiquement des écarts statistiquement significatifs entre le groupe de traitement et le groupe de contrôle pour les principaux paramètres secondaires d efficacité à 120 jours notamment l amélioration de la capacité fonctionnelle sur l échelle d incapacité d oswestry l amélioration de la qualité de vie mesurée par eq 5d european quality of life score on five dimensions le pourcentage de diminution de la douleur par rapport au moment de la pause de l implant et l impression globale du patient sur l évolution de son état le pourcentage de patients faisant état de diminutions de la douleur a continué de s améliorer après l évaluation à 120 jours jusqu à un an dans les deux groupes un an après la pause du stimulateur 72 des 116 patients du groupe de traitement et du groupe de contrôle rapportaient une diminution d au moins 30 de leur lombalgie sur l échelle eva sans augmentation significative de leur traitement analgésique ces données ne sont pas encore définitives car tous les patients n ont pas encore passé la visite d évaluation à un an le protocole autorisait les patients à ajuster leur traitement analgésique après l évaluation à 120 jours au bout d un an 44 des 50 patients des deux groupes combinés sous opioïdes au jour de la pause avaient volontairement éliminé 28 ou réduit significativement 16 l utilisation de ces antalgiques ces données ne sont pas encore définitives car tous les patients n ont pas encore passé la visite d évaluation à un an l incidence des evénements indésirables ei bénins ou graves et leur type sont comparables à ceux des essais cliniques rapportés pour d autres dispositifs de neurostimulation sans ei imprévu ni ei grave lié à l appareil au traitement ou à la procédure ide des autorités américaines us food and drug administration fda au total 204

de mise sur le marché américain étayée par la totalité de ses données cliniques pour reactiv8 la société espère rencontrer la fda au deuxième trimestre afin de recueillir des conseils et commentaires sur le contenu et la stratégie du dépôt la demande d autorisation de mise sur le marché devrait être déposée mi 2019 dans le sillage de cette réunion préalable dans la perspective d une décision fin 2020 dans le cadre de son examen de la demande de mise sur le marché l interprétation des données cliniques par la fda pourra diverger de celle de mainstay notamment sur le point de savoir si la signification statistique a été atteinte pour un ou plusieurs paramètres en allemagne premier marché de mainstay historiquement la force de vente a été réaffectée pour mieux cibler les référents clés cette nouvelle stratégie commerciale a été réellement mise en œuvre à partir de fin 2018 elle commence à porter ses fruits de nouveaux chirurgiens rejoignant régulièrement le protocole cette dynamique précoce devrait selon nous se poursuivre nous incitant à tabler sur un chiffre d affaires significatif à la fin de cette année et au début de 2020 situation financière depuis le début de 2018 mainstay

par le biais d un ou plusieurs placements d actions avant le 30 juin 2019 l échéancier de remboursement de cette nouvelle tranche sera le même que l échéancier amendé de remboursement des trois tranches existantes toutes les tranches portent intérêt à un taux annuel de 8 les intérêts étant échus mais capitalisés avant le 1 er janvier 2021 la pénalité de remboursement de 5 applicable à chacune des tranches existantes a été éliminée le montant en principal et les intérêts échus de l ensemble des tranches seront automatiquement convertis en actions ordinaires de la société à un cours

corporate trust 1 3 place valhubert 75013 paris france mainstay medical international plc chairman s statement dear shareholder i am pleased to present the 2018 annual report for mainstay medical and its subsidiaries 2018 was challenging year but we believe the company is positioned for success in 2019 and beyond business review we announced headline results from the reactiv8 b clinical trial in november whilst the difference between the treatment and control groups on the primary endpoint of responder rate at 120 days as measured on the visual analog scale vas of pain was not statistically significant due to a higher than expected response rate in the control group we believe the overall results from the trial represent solid evidence of the efficacy and safety of reactiv8 these overall results include additional pre specified analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint as well as high responder rates in the patients that have reached one year since implantation and a significant reduction in the use of pain medications by patients at one year we believe these results will support sales growth in germany and other markets under our existing ce mark as well as our plan to file a pre market approval pma application with the u s food and drug administration a detailed review of the company s corporate activity in 2018 can be found in the directors report on page 8 of this annual report finance review cash on hand as at 31 december 2018 was 15 5 million 2017 10 million operating expenses were 29 6 million during the year ended 31 december 2018 2017 27 9 million and the change relates primarily to commercialization activities outlook the completion of and results from the reactiv8 b trial have caused us to set two main corporate objectives for 2019 continuing to make progress growing sales in germany and other markets and pursuing regulatory approval in the u s on the commercial front we have been encouraged by the reaction of implanting physicians to the reactv8 b trial clinical data on the regulatory front we plan to submit a pma to the fda in mid 2019 with an approval decision expected in late 2020 directors and staff i would like to thank our current and former staff consultants clinical trial investigators and all my fellow directors for their support and dedication which has enabled the continued success of the company of course we also owe a debt of gratitude to all those people who agreed to be subjects in our clinical trials and helped to advance reactiv8 as an option for the millions of people suffering from chronic low back pain i look

conducted under an ide from the fda the reactiv8 b trial is intended to gather data in support of a pma application a key step towards the commercialization of reactiv8 in the us information about the clinical trial can be found at a total of 204 subjects were implanted with reactiv8 at leading clinical sites in the u s europe and australia and randomized 1 1 to therapy or control 14 days after implant in the treatment group the reactiv8 pulse generator was programmed to deliver electrical stimulation expected to elicit contractions of the multifidus muscle in the control group the reactiv8 device was programmed to provide a low level of electrical stimulation following assessment of the primary endpoint at 120 days subjects in the control group crossed over to receive levels of electrical stimulation similar to those in the treatment group the subjects in the study had an average age of 47 and an average duration of chronic low back pain of 14 years this patient population had tried many other treatment alternatives including physical therapy and drugs with limited success and 79 of the subjects were on pain medication at baseline the primary efficacy endpoint of the study was a comparison of responder rates between the treatment and control groups as measured on the visual analog scale vas of pain consisting a 0 10 scale with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worse imaginable pain responders defined as having a 30 or greater improvement on this measure between baseline and 120 days after baseline without any increase in pain medication and or muscle relaxants taken in the two weeks prior to the primary endpoint assessment visit the following table shows the result on the primary efficacy endpoint primary efficacy endpoint treatment n 102 control

sensitivity analysis assessing the impact of medication changes to treat acute unrelated pain conditions on the primary endpoint the company in consultation with statistical advisors determined that a valid way to handle the subjects with pain medication increases for reasons unrelated to low back pain would be to analyze the endpoint with these subjects removed as pain medication use for reasons unrelated to low back pain was an exclusion criterion in the study by doing so inference is limited to the population of subjects taking pain medication only for reasons related to low back pain as intended by the patient selection criteria in the trial protocol six subjects had increases in pain medications for reasons other than low back pain the following table presents the results of the primary efficacy endpoint in the subjects not requiring an increase in pain medications for reasons other than for low back pain showing a clinically meaningful and statistically significant

expects to hold a pre pma meeting with the fda within the second quarter of 2019 to obtain guidance on its filing content and strategy commercialization in germany mainstay s initial european market the commercial team was repositioned in 2018 to better focus efforts on key physician targets the german sales team consisted of 6 members at the end of 2018 two of whom are new to the company the team s focus is driving adoption in a select number of high volume spine care centres we have continued to add to our investment in commercial infrastructure to expand commercialization in europe and in preparation to enter other markets in the future we also increased our investment in the training of physicians the education of referring physicians regarding the potential of reactiv8 and the

trial was an international multi center prospective single arm clinical trial of reactiv8 that formed the basis of our ce mark for reactiv8 following ce marking approval a range of activities is required for post market clinical follow up to gather additional data on the long term performance and safety of reactiv8 the reactiv8 a pmcf study is a continuation of the reactiv8 a clinical trial but using ce marked reactiv8 subjects enrolled in the reactiv8 a clinical trial in the uk were converted to the reactiv8 a pmcf study physicians commenced with these implants in late 2017 and 43 implants were completed by the end of 2018 reactiv8 c registry in addition to the reactiv8 a pmcf study the company is maintaining the reactiv8 c registry an international multi centre data collection registry all centres that use the product commercially are invited to participate in the registry program all patients who are implanted with reactiv8 at the centres participating in the registry will be invited to enroll in the registry until the target enrolment numbers have been reached the purpose of the registry is to gather additional summary data on long term performance of reactiv8 in at least 50 patients funding on 15 february 2018 we announced the completion of a 30 1 million financing approximately 37 5 million through a placement of 2 151 332 new ordinary shares to new and existing shareholders on 4 may 2018 we announced the publication of a prospectus the prospectus in connection with the placement and admission to trading on esm now euronext growth and euronext paris

development clinical and regulatory activities selling general and administrative activities research and development expenditure during the 2018 period included the salaries of engineers technicians

quality system research and development expenses were 3 5 million during the year ended 31 december 2018 2017 4 2 million a decrease of 0 7 million is primarily driven by the reduction of certain quality and regulatory costs to support the group s commercial strategy and a reclassification of 2018 ip legal costs of 0 4 million to selling general and administrative expenses clinical and regulatory expenses were 11 million during the year ended 31 december 2018 and decreased by 1 9 million from 12 9 million during the same period in 2017 this is primarily driven by decreased direct trial costs relating to activities for the reactiv 8 b trial following the announcement in july 2018 on the completion of all implants our selling general and administrative expenses were 15 1 million during year ended 31 december 2018 and 10 9 million during the same period in 2017 the increase of 4 2 million is primarily driven by commercialization and the related increase in our direct sales force impacting payroll travel and training costs as well as marketing reimbursement consulting and market research costs this increase is also impacted by a non cash expense for share options granted statement of financial position total assets of the group at year end were 19 4 million 2017 13 3 million cash on hand at 31 december 2018 was 15 5 million 2017 10 million cash used in operating activities was 27 4 million during the year ended 31 december 2018 2017 24 9 million this operating cash outflow reflects the cost of the research and development of reactiv8 undertaking our clinical trials commercialization expenditure the ongoing costs of being a public company and running the group the group s debt facility provided by ipf was announced on 24 august 2015 for up to 15 million the group had drawn down 4 5 million on 9 september 2015 6 million on 3 december 2015 and 4 5 million on 28 july 2016 during 2018 the group made principal repayments of 3 million since inception the group has funded its operations primarily through the issuance of equity securities and debt funding the group continues to explore funding strategies e g equity debt partnering to support its activities into the future principal risks and uncertainties a summary of the principal risks relating to the group and company and or its industry include the following we have incurred significant operating losses and may not be able to achieve or subsequently maintain profitability we expect to require additional funds in the future in order to meet our capital and expenditure needs and further financing may not be available when required or if available could require us to agree to terms which are dilutive to current investors specifically favorable to new investors or to restrictions significantly limiting our access to additional capital or other activities our future financial performance is entirely dependent on the commercial success of reactiv8 our only product as of the date of this report obtaining adequate reimbursement for reactiv8 and rates of product adoption and market penetration we operate in a highly regulated environment and regulatory approval is required before we can market or sell reactiv8 in any market to date the only regulatory approval to market reactiv8 is our ce mark relating to the european economic area or eea and switzerland seeking and obtaining regulatory approval for medical devices in the united states and elsewhere can be a long and uncertain process the failure to achieve regulatory approval in the united states or in other key markets the loss of our ce mark or strict or changing regulatory regimes government policies and legislation in any of our target markets may delay prohibit or reduce potential sales failure to comply with debt covenants or failure to make repayments on our debt facility could have a material adverse effect we are required to conduct clinical trials for regulatory approvals and other purposes clinical trials carry substantial risks and are costly and time consuming with uncertain results any inability to fully protect and exploit our intellectual property may adversely impact our financial condition business prospects and results of operations a more extensive description of the existing and future potential risks to mainstay s business and to the company s ordinary shares are outlined in the risk factors section of this report on pages 24 to 56 and should be considered carefully by shareholders and prospective investors financial risk management the group is exposed to a variety of financial risks including credit risks liquidity risks interest rate risks and foreign currency risks further information can be reviewed in note 21 risk management framework mainstay s board of directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the group s risk management framework the group s risk management policies are established to identify and analyze the risks faced by the group to set appropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor risks and adherence to the limits risk management systems and policies will be reviewed regularly as conditions affecting the group change the group has no significant concentrations of financial risk other than concentration of cash with individual banks other than liquidity risk based on the company s use of cash during the year there has been no significant change during the year or since the year end to the types or quantum of financial risks faced by the group or the group s approach to the management of those risks liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk that the group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due since inception the group has funded its operations primarily through i the issuance of equity securities and ii debt funding the group continues to explore funding strategies e g equity debt partnering to support its activities into the future adequate additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all the group s inability to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on the group s financial position and its ability to pursue its business strategy credit and financial risk credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet contractual obligations and arises principally from the group s cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables credit risk is managed on a group basis the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each asset the carrying value of receivables is a reasonable approximation of fair value foreign currency risk the group s reporting currency is the us dollar the group s exposure to foreign currency risk arises through expenditure incurred in euro and australian dollars the group s australian subsidiary has an australian dollar functional currency and three of the group s subsidiaries located in ireland germany and the netherlands have a euro functional currency interest rate risk the group s cash balances are maintained in short term access accounts and carry a floating rate of interest the group s debt carries a variable rate of 3 month euribor plus a margin ranging from 10 5 to 12 5 any change in the euribor rate above zero will directly affect the amount of interest repayable on this debt outlook and future developments the completion of and results from the reactiv8 b trial have caused us to set two main corporate objectives for 2019 continuing to make progress growing sales in germany and other markets and pursuing regulatory approval in the u s on the commercial front we have been encouraged by the reaction of implanting physicians to the reactv8 b trial clinical data on the regulatory front we plan to submit a pma to the fda in mid 2019 with an approval decision expected in 2020 directors and secretary

notes 1 includes ordinary shares held by barrymore investments limited a company controlled by seamus mulligan going concern the directors have evaluated whether there are conditions and events considered in aggregate that raise doubt about the group s ability to continue as a going concern the directors note the following relevant matters the group had cash of 15 5 million as at 31 december 2018 10 million as at 31 december 2017 the group had operating cash out flows of 27 3 million for the year ended 31 december 2018 year ended 31 december 2017 24 9 million due to the phase of development of the group the group expects to continue to incur losses in the medium term due to the ongoing investment required in research and development clinical and commercial activities and expects to continue to seek funding from investors or other finance providers as required the group has funded operations to date through the proceeds of equity funding of approximately 123 5 million and debt with an outstanding principal of 10 2 million as at 31 december 2018 subsequent to the year end the group has successfully extended the repayment terms of its debt arrangements to 2021 and will seek additional equity financing in 2019 in order to continue to fund its ongoing research and development clinical and commercial activities under the terms of its amended debt facility if the group raises at least 10 million in equity financing prior to june 30 2019 an additional 3 million will become available to the group from its lender as of the date of approval of these financial statements the terms of any such additional equity finance have not yet been finalised as there can be no certainty that this finance will be raised or of the terms on which such finance will be raised and because the group is reliant on such finance in order to continue to operate at its current level into the future this represents an uncertainty that may impact on the group s ability to continue as a going concern however the directors are confident based on discussions with investors that additional equity funding and resultant debt funding will be received and that the amount of such funding will be sufficient to enable to the company to continue its current level of activity and to ensure that the group is in a position to service its liabilities as they fall due for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of these financial statements as a result the directors have prepared the financial statements on the going concern basis dividends the directors

diversity policy the board is keen to ensure the group benefits from the existence of a high quality board comprising of individuals with an appropriate balance of skills and experience in considering nominations to the board the nomination committee takes into account the benefit of board diversity including diversity of business background geographical diversity and gender diversity the board does not currently have a formal diversity policy in place due to the early stage of development of the group during 2019 the board will continue to focus attention on considering nominations to the board that re affirms the board s commitment to diversity across the group mainstay medical international plc risk factors this section addresses the existing and future material risks to mainstay s business however the following does not set out an exhaustive list or explanation of all risks that shareholders or prospective investors may face when making an investment in the ordinary shares and should be used as guidance only as further risks and uncertainties not currently known to the board or that the board currently deems immaterial may also have an adverse effect on the company s or the group s financial condition business prospects and or results of operations in such a case the market price of ordinary shares could decline and investors may lose all or part of their investment risks relating to our business we have incurred significant operating losses and may not be able to achieve or subsequently maintain profitability or meet our financial obligations we have incurred significant net losses since we were founded for the year ended 31 december 2018 we had a comprehensive loss of 31 million and a comprehensive loss of 30 million for the year ended 31 december 2017 we have funded our operations through equity capital and debt we have devoted substantially all of our resources to the research and development of reactiv8 including to our feasibility study our reactiv8 a clinical trial and our reactiv8 b clinical trial initial commercialization efforts and expansion of our intellectual property portfolio even if we do become profitable in the short or medium term we may be unable to sustain or increase our profitability on a quarterly or annual basis over the medium to long term in any case we will need to obtain additional capital to fund commercialization including expanding reimbursement to fund continuing research and development and to run additional clinical trials we expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future as we continue to pursue these objectives in addition a failure to raise sufficient capital could cause us to fail to meet contractual or other financial obligations which could lead to legal liability or insolvency if we are unable to obtain or maintain additional regulatory approvals for reactiv8 in the united states and elsewhere we may never generate significant revenue or become profitable reactiv8 is an active implantable medical device or aimd which requires regulatory approval before it can be marketed or sold by us the only regulatory approval we have received is the ce conformity assessment or ce marking for reactiv8 which allows commercialization of reactiv8 in the european economic area or eea and in switzerland there is no guarantee that further regulatory approval will be obtained for reactiv8 or any other product we develop either now or in the future or that commercialization in the eea switzerland or any other jurisdiction will be successful or will generate sufficient revenue and profits to cover expenses or fund future growth any such regulatory approval may also experience delays the reactiv8 b trial did not achieve statistical significance on its primary endpoint but it did achieve statistical significance on a pre specified alternative analysis of that endpoint and on multiple secondary endpoints we cannot be certain whether the totality of the data from the reactiv8 b trial will be sufficient to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the fda to allow for the granting of a pma or that it will be sufficient to maintain our current ce marking since our inception we have devoted substantially all of our efforts to the development and commercialization of reactiv8 for the treatment of clbp failure to obtain fda regulatory approval or other additional regulatory approvals or the failure to maintain regulatory approvals once obtained may result in our financial condition being adversely affected and our ability to grow domestically and internationally would likely be limited because we do not have any other products currently in development if we are unable to market reactiv8 as a result of a failure to obtain fda approval or to obtain or maintain additional regulatory approvals we would lose our only source of revenue and our business would be materially adversely affected the fda requires manufacturers of medical devices to obtain regulatory approval prior to commercializing products in the united states failing to obtain approval from the fda could result in significant costs for us and consume management s time and other resources the fda could ask us to improve or augment manufacturing processes or generate and provide additional data on the quality efficacy or safety of reactiv8 which could include additional clinical data additionally even if we obtain fda approval to commercialize reactiv8 in the united states we would be required to obtain further fda approval prior to making any modification to reactiv8 and we may be required to generate and provide additional data on the quality efficacy or safety of reactiv8 as a condition to maintaining approval there can be no assurance that fda approval will be ever obtained for reactiv8 regulatory approval in the united states is via a pre market approval or pma issued by the fda we plan to submit a pma to the fda for reactiv8 in mid 2019 but the timing of the pma process is uncertain the process typically takes significantly longer than ce marking once granted the pma does not have an expiry date however regulatory approvals may be withdrawn if for example a new and unexpected risk emerges that would make continued marketing of reactiv8 no longer acceptable to the fda the pma process requires an applicant to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device based in part on extensive data including but not limited to technical preclinical clinical trial manufacturing and labeling data the fda can delay limit or deny approval of a device for many reasons including inability to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the fda or the applicable regulatory entity or notified body that products are safe or effective for their intended uses the disagreement of the fda or the applicable foreign regulatory body with the design or implementation of clinical trials or the interpretation of data from pre clinical studies or clinical trials serious and unexpected adverse device effects experienced by participants in our clinical trials data from pre clinical studies and clinical trials may be insufficient to support clearance or approval where required inability to demonstrate that the clinical and other benefits of the device outweigh the risks the manufacturing process or facilities used may not meet applicable requirements and the potential for approval policies or regulations of the fda or applicable foreign regulatory bodies to change significantly in a manner rendering clinical data or regulatory filings insufficient for clearance or approval in addition the fda s policies and policies of foreign regulatory agencies may change and additional regulations may be enacted that could prevent limit or delay regulatory approval of our devices such policy or regulatory changes could impose additional requirements upon us that could delay our ability to obtain new approvals increase the costs of compliance or restrict our ability to maintain our current approval for example as part of the food and drug administration safety and innovation act enacted in 2012 congress reauthorized the medical device user fee amendments with various fda performance goal commitments and enacted several medical device regulatory improvements and miscellaneous reforms which are further intended to clarify and improve medical device regulation both pre and post clearance and approval in addition the planned withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union commonly known as brexit could cause additional or changed regulatory requirements relating to our products in the united kingdom some of these proposals and reforms could impose additional regulatory requirements upon us that could delay our ability to obtain new approvals increase the costs of compliance or restrict our ability to maintain our current approval the regulatory approval process may delay or prevent the launch of reactiv8 in our target markets which would negatively impact or prevent our ability to achieve our objectives if we fail to obtain further approval of reactiv8 in a timely manner or at all sales of reactiv8 may be delayed or may not be achieved thereby adversely affecting our ability to generate revenues or fund our on going activities the success of reactiv8 depends on its acceptance and adoption by medical professionals our success will require acceptance and adoption by medical professionals of reactiv8 as a new treatment for people with clbp such acceptance will depend on medical professionals being convinced of the clinical performance benefits safety and cost effectiveness of reactiv8 and being prepared to undertake special training in certain cases acceptance of reactiv8 depends on educating physicians as to the distinctive characteristics perceived benefits safety and ease of use of reactiv8 as compared to alternative solutions and communicating to physicians the proper application of reactiv8 the reactiv8 b trial did not achieve statistical significance on its primary endpoint but it did achieve statistical significance on a pre specified alternative analysis of that endpoint and on multiple secondary endpoints we cannot be certain whether the totality of the data from the reactiv8 b trial will be sufficient to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of physicians if we are not successful in convincing physicians of the merits of reactiv8 or educating them on the use of reactiv8 they may not use reactiv8 and we may be unable to increase our sales sustain our growth or achieve profitability medical professionals may be hesitant to change their medical treatment practices or accept and adopt reactiv8 including for the following reasons general conservatism about adoption of new and innovative treatment practices lack of awareness or acceptance of the role of inhibition of the multifidus muscle in causing clbp and the suitability of neurostimulation therapy to address this inhibition lack of experience with reactiv8 and with neurostimulation as a treatment alternative lack or perceived lack of long term evidence including that provided by the results of our reactiv8 b trial supporting additional patient benefits perceived clinical risk of a new treatment inability to convince key opinion leaders to provide recommendations regarding reactiv8 or to convince patients physicians or payers that reactiv8 is an attractive alternative to other products a lack of willingness to tolerate the surgical procedure required to implant reactiv8 perceived liability risks associated with the use of new a product and procedures limited or lack of coverage or inadequate reimbursement within healthcare payment systems preference to provide other treatments which may be more lucrative for the medical professional cost associated with the purchase of new product and equipment other procedures competing for physician time and attention and the time commitment that may be required for special training to use reactiv8 communicating the benefits of reactiv8 to these physicians and hospitals requires a significant commitment by our commercial organization physicians and hospitals may be slow to change their practices because of perceived risks arising from the use of a new system physicians may not recommend or use reactiv8 until there is more long term commercial experience to convince them to alter their existing treatment methods or until they receive additional recommendations from other physicians that our product is effective we cannot predict when if ever physicians and hospitals may adopt use of our product we only recently began commercializing reactiv8 in the eea and have no history of commercializing reactiv8 in the united states reactiv8 has been ce marked since 2016 enabling us to commercialize it throughout the eea we have not yet obtained approval from the fda to commercially market in the united states as a result we have a limited history of commercializing reactiv8 generally and no history of selling reactiv8 in the united states as an organization we have never commercially launched a product in the united states nor commenced a sales representative training program or conducted a launch of a similar expected size a commercial launch and training program of this size is a significant undertaking that requires substantial financial and managerial resources we may be unable to gain broader market acceptance in the countries in which we have already begun to commercialize reactiv8 or successfully commercialize it in the united states for a number of reasons including established alternatives to reactiv8 with strong relationships with customers including physicians hospitals and third party suppliers limitations in our
dublin business wire mainstay medical provides company update and publishes 2018 full year results reactiv8 b study results received pre pma submission meeting with fda expected during the second quarter european commercialization continues to advance cash on hand of 15 5m at 31 december 2018 mainstay medical international plc mainstay or the company euronext paris msty pa and euronext growth operated by euronext dublin msty ie a medical device company focused on bringing to market reactiv8 an implantable restorative neurostimulation system to treat disabling chronic low back pain today provides a company update and announces the publication of its 2018 full year results and annual report jason hannon ceo of mainstay said i believe fully in reactiv8 as a therapeutic option for patients suffering from disabling chronic low back pain and i believe that the value we can deliver to both our physician customers and their patients as well as the investing market will be demonstrated in the months and years to come the primary endpoint of our reactiv8 b clinical trial was not achieved due to a higher response at 120 days in the control active sham patient group than was expected however we believe the overall results from the trial represent solid evidence of the efficacy and safety of reactiv8 this belief is based on among other things a pre specified analysis of the primary endpoint where we adjusted for patients who increased their pain medications for reasons unrelated to their back pain as a reminder to be considered a responder in the clinical trial a patient must have reported 30 or greater pain relief on the vas scale and not increased their pain medications leading up to the 120 day measurement point statistically significant differences between the treatment and control groups on key secondary efficacy endpoints at 120 days a responder rate of 72 in the patients in the treatment and control groups combined that have reached one year since implantation and a significant reduction in the use of pain medications including opioids by patients at one year we believe these results will support sales growth in germany and other markets under our existing ce mark as well as our plan to file a pre market approval application with the u s food and drug administration we plan to submit a pma to the fda in mid 2019 with a decision on approval expected in late 2020 business update in november 2018 mainstay announced top line results from the reactiv8 b clinical study its international multi center prospective randomized active sham controlled blinded trial with one way cross over conducted under an investigational device exemption ide from the u s food drug administration fda a total of 204 patients with chronic low back pain refractory to physical therapy were implanted with reactiv8 at leading clinical sites in the u s europe and australia and randomized 1 1 to therapy or control the average duration of symptoms was 14 years in the treatment group the reactiv8 pulse generator was programmed to deliver electrical stimulation expected to elicit contractions of the multifidus muscle in the control group the reactiv8 device was programmed to provide a low level of electrical stimulation following assessment of the primary endpoint at 120 days patients in the control group crossed over to receive levels of electrical stimulation similar to those in the treatment group a summary of the clinical trial results is as follows the primary efficacy endpoint of the study was a comparison of responder rates between the treatment and control groups as measured on the visual analog scale vas of pain with responders defined as having a 30 or greater improvement on this measure between baseline and 120 days after randomization without any increase in pain medication and or muscle relaxants taken in the two weeks prior to the primary endpoint assessment visit in the treatment group the responder rate at 120 days was 57 compared to 47 in the control group resulting in a difference that is not statistically significant statistically significant differences on a number of key secondary endpoints were observed in the treatment group as compared to the control group at 120 days including change from baseline in disability measured by the oswestry disability index odi change from baseline in quality of life measured by the european quality of life score on five dimensions eq 5d percent pain relief ppr compared to baseline and subject global impression of global change sgic improvements in the percentage of patients reporting pain reduction continued beyond the 120 day assessment through one year for both groups the percentage of the 116 patients in the treatment group and control groups that had completed the one year assessment having a 30 or greater reduction in low back pain vas at that assessment without a significant increase in pain medication was 72 these data are subject to change as the remaining patients reach the one year assessment the protocol permitted patients to adjust their back pain medication usage after the 120 day assessment point at one year 44 of the 50 patients in both groups combined who were on opioids at baseline had voluntarily eliminated 28 or significantly reduced 16 their use of opioids these results are subject to change as the remaining patients reach the one year assessment the incidence and type of adverse events aes including serious aes were comparable to aes in clinical trials reported for other neurostimulation devices with no unanticipated aes related to the device procedure or stimulation mainstay is preparing to submit a pma application to the fda based upon the totality of its clinical data for reactiv8 the company expects to have a pre pma submission meeting with the fda during the second quarter to obtain feedback on its filing content and strategy a pma application filing is expected in mid 2019 after that meeting with a decision on approval expected in late 2020 the fda s review of the pma may result in the fda not agreeing with mainstay s interpretation of its clinical data including whether statistical significance was achieved for one or more endpoints in germany mainstay s initial european market the commercial team was repositioned in order to better focus efforts on key physician targets commercialization efforts in line with this strategy began in earnest in late 2018 we are beginning to see the early fruits of these efforts as we regularly onboard new implanting physicians

medical and its subsidiaries 2018 was challenging year but we believe the company is positioned for success in 2019 and beyond business review we announced headline results from the reactiv8 b clinical trial in november whilst the difference between the treatment and control groups on the primary endpoint of responder rate at 120 days as measured on the visual analog scale vas of pain was not statistically significant due to a higher than expected response rate in the control group we believe the overall results from the trial represent solid evidence of the efficacy and safety of reactiv8 these overall results include additional pre specified analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint as well as high responder rates in the patients that have reached one year since implantation and a significant reduction in the use of pain medications by patients at one year we believe these results will support sales growth in germany and other markets under our existing ce mark as well as our plan to file a pre market approval pma application with the u s food and drug administration a detailed review of the company s corporate activity in 2018 can be found in the directors report on page 8 of this annual report finance review cash on hand as at 31 december 2018 was 15 5 million 2017 10 million operating expenses were 29 6 million during the year ended 31 december 2018 2017 27 9 million and the change relates primarily to commercialization activities outlook the completion of and results from the reactiv8 b trial have caused us to set two main corporate objectives for 2019 continuing to make progress growing sales in germany and other markets and pursuing regulatory approval in the u s on the commercial front we have been encouraged by the reaction of implanting physicians to the reactv8 b trial clinical data on the regulatory front we plan to submit a pma to the fda in mid 2019 with an approval decision expected in late 2020 directors and staff i would like to thank our current and former staff consultants clinical trial investigators and all my fellow directors for their support and dedication which has enabled the continued success of the company of course we also owe a debt of gratitude to all those people who agreed to be subjects in our clinical trials and helped to advance reactiv8 as an option for the millions of people suffering from

during the year business review us pivotal reactiv8 b clinical trial the reactiv8 b trial is an international multi center prospective randomized sham controlled triple blinded trial with one way crossover conducted under an ide from the fda the reactiv8 b trial is intended to gather data in support of a pma application a key step towards the commercialization of reactiv8 in the us information about the clinical trial can be found at a total of 204 subjects were implanted with reactiv8 at leading clinical sites in the u s europe and australia and randomized 1 1 to therapy or control 14 days after implant in the treatment group the reactiv8 pulse generator was programmed to deliver electrical stimulation expected to elicit contractions of the multifidus muscle in the control group the reactiv8 device was programmed to provide a low level of electrical stimulation following assessment of the primary endpoint at 120 days subjects in the control group crossed over to receive levels of electrical stimulation similar to those in the treatment group the subjects in the study had an average age of 47 and an average duration of chronic low back pain of 14 years this patient population had tried many other treatment alternatives including physical therapy and drugs with limited success and 79 of the subjects were on pain medication at baseline the primary efficacy endpoint of the study was a comparison of responder rates between the treatment and control groups as measured on the visual analog scale vas of pain consisting a 0 10 scale with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worse imaginable pain responders defined as having a 30 or greater improvement on this measure between baseline and 120 days after baseline without any increase in pain medication and or muscle

sensitivity analysis assessing the impact of medication changes to treat acute unrelated pain conditions on the primary endpoint the company in consultation with statistical advisors determined that a valid way to handle the subjects with pain medication increases for reasons unrelated to low back pain would be to analyze the endpoint with these subjects removed as pain medication use for reasons unrelated to low back pain was an exclusion criterion in the study by doing so inference is limited to the population of subjects taking pain medication only for reasons related to low back pain as intended by the patient selection criteria in the trial protocol six subjects had increases in pain medications for reasons other than low back pain the following table presents the results of the

expects to hold a pre pma meeting with the fda within the second quarter of 2019 to obtain guidance on its filing content and strategy commercialization in germany mainstay s initial european market the commercial team was repositioned in 2018 to better focus efforts on key physician targets the german sales team consisted of 6 members at the end of 2018 two of whom are new to the company the team s focus is driving adoption in a select number of high volume spine care centres we have continued to add to our investment in commercial infrastructure to expand commercialization in europe and in preparation to enter other markets in the future we also increased our investment in the training of physicians the education of referring physicians regarding the potential of reactiv8 and the collection and dissemination of clinical data regarding use of reactiv8 us patents since our last annual report we were issued four new us patents bringing the total current number of issued us issued patents in the mainstay portfolio to thirteen mainstay continues to add to its portfolio of issued patents and pending patent applications reactiv8 a clinical trial pmcf study the reactiv8 a clinical trial was an international multi center prospective single arm clinical trial of reactiv8 that formed the basis of our ce mark for reactiv8 following ce marking approval a range of activities is required for post market clinical follow up to gather additional data on the long term performance and safety of reactiv8 the reactiv8 a pmcf study is a continuation of the reactiv8 a clinical trial but using ce marked reactiv8 subjects enrolled in the reactiv8 a clinical trial in the uk were converted to the reactiv8 a pmcf study physicians commenced with these implants in late 2017 and 43 implants were completed by the end of 2018 reactiv8 c registry in addition to the reactiv8 a pmcf study the company is maintaining the reactiv8 c registry an international multi centre data collection registry all centres that use the product commercially are invited to participate in the registry program all patients who are implanted with reactiv8 at the centres participating in the registry will be invited to enroll in the registry until the target enrolment numbers have been reached the purpose of the registry is to gather additional summary data on long term performance of reactiv8 in at least 50 patients funding on 15 february 2018 we announced the completion of a 30 1 million financing approximately 37 5 million through a placement of 2 151 332 new ordinary shares to new and existing shareholders on 4 may 2018 we announced the publication of a prospectus the prospectus in connection with the placement and admission to trading on esm now euronext growth and euronext paris the funds are being used to complete the reactiv8 b clinical trial seek regulatory approval in the u s and other markets and advance the initial commercialization of reactiv8 in germany and other markets the prospectus comprises a summary document a securities note and a registration document these documents are available on our website www mainstay medical com financial review income statement revenue during the twelve month period ending 31 december 2018 was 0 7 million 2017 0 3 million revenue was primarily generated from sales of reactiv8 systems to customers in germany and ireland operating expenses related to on going activities were 29 6 million during the year ended 31 december 2018 2017 27 9 million on going activities during the financial year included research and development clinical and regulatory activities selling general and administrative activities research and development expenditure during the 2018 period included the salaries of engineers technicians and quality and regulatory specialists the cost of outsourced development and manufacturing activities biocompatibility and pre clinical studies and quality costs including the maintenance of our quality system research and development expenses were 3 5 million during the year ended 31 december 2018 2017 4 2 million a decrease of 0 7 million is primarily driven by the reduction of certain quality and regulatory costs to support the group s commercial strategy and a reclassification of 2018 ip legal costs of 0 4 million to selling general and administrative expenses clinical and regulatory expenses were 11 million during the year ended 31 december 2018 and decreased by 1 9 million from 12 9 million during the same period in 2017 this is primarily driven by decreased direct trial costs relating to activities for the reactiv 8 b trial following the announcement in july 2018 on the completion of all implants our selling general and administrative expenses were 15 1 million during year ended 31 december 2018 and 10 9 million during the same period in 2017 the increase of 4 2 million is primarily driven by commercialization and the related increase in our direct sales force impacting payroll travel and training costs as well as marketing reimbursement consulting and market research costs this increase is also impacted by a non cash expense for share options granted statement of financial position total assets of the group at year end were 19 4 million 2017 13 3 million cash on hand at 31 december 2018 was 15 5 million 2017 10 million cash used in operating activities was 27 4 million during the year ended 31 december 2018 2017 24 9 million this operating cash outflow reflects the cost of the research and development of reactiv8 undertaking our clinical trials commercialization expenditure the ongoing costs of being a public company and running the group the group s debt facility provided by ipf was announced on 24 august 2015 for up to 15 million the group had drawn down 4 5 million on 9 september 2015 6 million on 3 december 2015 and 4 5 million on 28 july 2016 during 2018 the group made principal repayments of 3 million since inception the group has funded its operations primarily through the issuance of equity securities and debt funding the group continues to explore funding strategies e g equity debt partnering to support its activities into the future principal risks and uncertainties a summary of the principal risks relating to the group and company and or its industry include the following we have incurred significant operating losses and may not be able to achieve or subsequently maintain profitability we expect to require additional funds in the future in order to meet our capital and expenditure needs and further financing may not be available when required or if available could require us to agree to terms which are dilutive to current investors specifically favorable to new investors or to restrictions significantly limiting our access to additional capital or other activities our future financial performance is entirely dependent on the commercial success of reactiv8 our only product as of the date of this report obtaining adequate reimbursement for reactiv8 and rates of product adoption and market penetration we operate in a highly regulated environment and regulatory approval is required before we can market or sell reactiv8 in any market to date the only regulatory approval to market reactiv8 is our ce mark relating to the european economic area or eea and switzerland seeking and obtaining regulatory approval for medical devices in the united states and elsewhere can be a long and uncertain process the failure to achieve regulatory approval in the united states or in other key markets the loss of our ce mark or strict or changing regulatory regimes government policies and legislation in any of our target markets may delay prohibit or reduce potential sales failure to comply with debt covenants or failure to make repayments on our debt facility could have a material adverse effect we are required to conduct clinical trials for regulatory approvals and other purposes clinical trials carry substantial risks and are costly and time consuming with uncertain results any inability to fully protect and exploit our intellectual property may adversely impact our financial condition business prospects and results of operations a more extensive description of the existing and future potential risks to mainstay s business and to the company s ordinary shares are outlined in the risk factors section of this report on pages 24 to 56 and should be considered carefully by shareholders and prospective investors financial risk management the group is exposed to a variety of financial risks including credit risks liquidity risks interest rate risks and foreign currency risks further information can be reviewed in note 21 risk management framework mainstay s board of directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the group s risk management framework the group s risk management policies are established to identify and analyze the risks faced by the group to set appropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor risks and adherence to the limits risk management systems and policies will be reviewed regularly as conditions affecting the group change the group has no significant concentrations of financial risk other than concentration of cash with individual banks other than liquidity risk based on the company s use of cash during the year there has been no significant change during the year or since the year end to the types or quantum of financial risks faced by the group or the group s approach to the management of those risks liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk that the group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due since inception the group has funded its operations primarily through i the issuance of equity securities and ii debt funding the group continues to explore funding strategies e g equity debt partnering to support its activities into the future adequate additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all the group s inability to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on the group s financial position and its ability to pursue its business strategy credit and financial risk credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet contractual obligations and arises principally from the group s cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables credit risk is managed on a group basis the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each asset the carrying value of receivables is a reasonable approximation of fair value foreign currency risk the group s reporting currency is the us dollar the group s exposure to foreign currency risk arises through expenditure incurred in euro and australian dollars the group s australian subsidiary has an australian dollar functional currency and three of the group s subsidiaries located in ireland germany and the netherlands have a euro functional currency interest rate risk the group s cash balances are maintained in short term access accounts and carry a floating rate of interest the group s debt carries a variable rate of 3 month euribor plus a margin ranging from 10 5 to 12 5 any change in the euribor rate above zero will directly affect the amount of interest repayable on this debt outlook and future developments the completion of and results from the reactiv8 b trial have caused us to set two main corporate objectives for 2019 continuing to make progress growing sales in germany and other markets and pursuing regulatory approval in the u s on the commercial front we have been encouraged by the reaction

notes 1 includes ordinary shares held by barrymore investments limited a company controlled by seamus mulligan going concern the directors have evaluated whether there are conditions and events considered in aggregate that raise doubt about the group s ability to continue as a going concern the directors note the following relevant matters the group had cash of 15 5 million as at 31 december 2018 10 million as at 31 december 2017 the group had operating cash out flows of 27 3 million for the year ended 31 december 2018 year ended 31 december 2017 24 9 million due to the phase of development of the group the group expects to continue to incur losses in the medium term due to the ongoing investment required in research and development clinical and commercial activities and expects to continue to seek funding from investors or other finance providers as required the group has funded operations to date through the proceeds of equity funding of approximately 123 5 million and debt with an outstanding principal of 10 2 million as at 31 december 2018 subsequent to the year end the group has successfully extended the repayment terms of its debt arrangements to 2021 and will seek additional equity financing in 2019 in order to continue to fund its ongoing research and development clinical and commercial activities under the terms of its amended debt facility if the group raises at least 10 million in equity financing prior to june 30 2019 an additional 3 million will become available to the group from its lender as of the date of approval of these financial statements the terms of any such additional equity finance have not yet been finalised as there can be no certainty that this finance will be raised or of the terms on which such finance will be raised and because the group is reliant on such finance in order to continue to operate at its current level into the future this represents an uncertainty that may impact on the group s ability to continue as a going concern however the directors are confident based on discussions with investors that additional equity funding and resultant debt funding will be received and that the amount of such funding will be sufficient to enable to the company to continue its current level of activity and to ensure that the group is in a position to service its liabilities as they fall due for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of these financial statements as a result the directors have prepared the financial statements on the going concern basis dividends the directors

nominations to the board the nomination committee takes into account the benefit of board diversity including diversity of business background geographical diversity and gender diversity the board does not currently have a formal diversity policy in place due to the early stage of development of the group during 2019 the board will continue to focus attention on considering nominations to the board that re affirms the board s commitment to diversity across the group mainstay medical international plc risk factors this section addresses the existing and future material risks to mainstay s business however the following does not set out an exhaustive list or explanation of all risks that shareholders or prospective investors may face when making an investment in the ordinary shares and should be used as guidance only as further risks and uncertainties not currently known to the board or that the board currently deems immaterial may also have an adverse effect on the company s or the group s financial condition business prospects and or results of operations in such a case the market price of ordinary shares could decline and investors may lose all or part of their investment risks relating to our business we have incurred significant operating losses and may not be able to achieve or subsequently maintain profitability or meet our financial obligations we have incurred significant net losses since we were founded for the year ended 31 december 2018 we had a comprehensive loss of 31 million and a comprehensive loss of 30 million for the year ended 31 december 2017 we have funded our operations through equity capital and debt we have devoted substantially all of our resources to the research and development of reactiv8 including to our feasibility study our reactiv8 a clinical trial and our reactiv8 b clinical trial initial commercialization efforts and expansion of our intellectual property portfolio even if we do become profitable in the short or medium term we may be unable to sustain or increase our profitability on a quarterly or annual basis over the medium to long term in any case we will need to obtain additional capital to fund commercialization including expanding reimbursement to fund continuing research and development and to run additional clinical trials we expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future as we continue to pursue these objectives in addition a failure to raise sufficient capital could cause us to fail to meet contractual or other financial obligations which could lead to legal liability or insolvency if we are unable to obtain or maintain additional regulatory approvals for reactiv8 in the united states and elsewhere we may never generate significant revenue or become profitable reactiv8 is an active implantable medical device or aimd which requires regulatory approval before it can be marketed or sold by us the only regulatory approval we have received is the ce conformity assessment or ce marking for reactiv8 which allows commercialization of reactiv8 in the european economic area or eea and in switzerland there is no guarantee that further regulatory approval will be obtained for reactiv8 or any other product we develop either now or in the future or that commercialization in the eea switzerland or any other jurisdiction will be successful or will generate sufficient revenue and profits to cover expenses or fund future growth any such regulatory approval may also experience delays the reactiv8 b trial did not achieve statistical significance on its primary endpoint but it did achieve statistical significance on a pre specified alternative analysis of that endpoint and on multiple secondary endpoints we cannot be certain whether the totality of the data from the reactiv8 b trial will be sufficient to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the fda to allow for the granting of a pma or that it will be sufficient to maintain our current ce marking since our inception we have devoted substantially all of our efforts to the development and commercialization of reactiv8 for the treatment of clbp failure to obtain fda regulatory approval or other additional regulatory approvals or the failure to maintain regulatory approvals once obtained may result in our financial condition being adversely affected and our ability to grow domestically and internationally would likely be limited because we do not have any other products currently in development if we are unable to market reactiv8 as a result of a failure to obtain fda approval or to obtain or maintain additional regulatory approvals we would lose our only source of revenue and our business would be materially adversely affected the fda requires manufacturers of medical devices to obtain regulatory approval prior to commercializing products in the united states failing to obtain approval from the fda could result in significant costs for us and consume management s time and other resources the fda could ask us to improve or augment manufacturing processes or generate and provide additional data on the quality efficacy or safety of reactiv8 which could include additional clinical data additionally even if we obtain fda approval to commercialize reactiv8 in the united states we would be required to obtain further fda approval prior to making any modification to reactiv8 and we may be required to generate and provide additional data on the quality efficacy or safety of reactiv8 as a condition to maintaining approval there can be no assurance that fda approval will be ever obtained for reactiv8 regulatory approval in the united states is via a pre market approval or pma issued by the fda we plan to submit a pma to the fda for reactiv8 in mid 2019 but the timing of the pma process is uncertain the process typically takes significantly longer than ce marking once granted the pma does not have an expiry date however regulatory approvals may be withdrawn if for example a new and unexpected risk emerges that would make continued marketing of reactiv8 no longer acceptable to the fda the pma process requires an applicant to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device based in part on extensive data including but not limited to technical preclinical clinical trial manufacturing and labeling data the fda can delay limit or deny approval of a device for many reasons including inability to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the fda or the applicable regulatory entity or notified body that products are safe or effective for their intended uses the disagreement of the fda or the applicable foreign regulatory body with the design or implementation of clinical trials or the interpretation of data from pre clinical studies or clinical trials serious and unexpected adverse device effects experienced by participants in our clinical trials data from pre clinical studies and clinical trials may be insufficient to support clearance or approval where required inability to demonstrate that the clinical and other benefits of the device outweigh the risks the manufacturing process or facilities used may not meet applicable requirements and the potential for approval policies or regulations of the fda or applicable foreign regulatory bodies to change significantly in a manner rendering clinical data or regulatory filings insufficient for clearance or approval in addition the fda s policies and policies of foreign regulatory agencies may change and additional regulations may be enacted that could prevent limit or delay regulatory approval of our devices such policy or regulatory changes could impose additional requirements upon us that could delay our ability to obtain new approvals increase the costs of compliance or restrict our ability to maintain our current approval for example as part of the food and drug administration safety and innovation act enacted in 2012 congress reauthorized the medical device user fee amendments with various fda performance goal commitments and enacted several medical device regulatory improvements and miscellaneous reforms which are further intended to clarify and improve medical device regulation both pre and post clearance and approval in addition the planned withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union commonly known as brexit could cause additional or changed regulatory requirements relating to our products in the united kingdom some of these proposals and reforms could impose additional regulatory requirements upon us that could delay our ability to obtain new approvals increase the costs of compliance or restrict our ability to maintain our current approval the regulatory approval process may delay or prevent the launch of reactiv8 in our target markets which would negatively impact or prevent our ability to achieve our objectives if we fail to obtain further approval of reactiv8 in a timely manner or at all sales of reactiv8 may be delayed or may not be achieved thereby adversely affecting our ability to generate revenues or fund our on going activities the success of reactiv8 depends on its acceptance and adoption by medical professionals our success will require acceptance and adoption by medical professionals of reactiv8 as a new treatment for people with clbp such acceptance will depend on medical professionals being convinced of the clinical performance benefits safety and cost effectiveness of reactiv8 and being prepared to undertake special training in certain cases acceptance of reactiv8 depends on educating physicians as to the distinctive characteristics perceived benefits safety and ease of use of reactiv8 as compared to alternative solutions and communicating to physicians the proper application of reactiv8 the reactiv8 b trial did not achieve statistical significance on its primary endpoint but it did achieve statistical significance on a pre specified alternative analysis of that endpoint and on multiple secondary endpoints we cannot be certain whether the totality of the data from the reactiv8 b trial will be sufficient to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of physicians if we are not successful in convincing physicians of the merits of reactiv8 or educating them on the use of reactiv8 they may not use reactiv8 and we may be unable to increase our sales sustain our growth or achieve profitability medical professionals may be hesitant to change their medical treatment practices or accept and adopt reactiv8 including for the following reasons general conservatism about adoption of new and innovative treatment practices lack of awareness or acceptance of the role of inhibition of the multifidus muscle in causing clbp and the suitability of neurostimulation therapy to address this inhibition lack of experience with reactiv8 and with neurostimulation as a treatment alternative lack or perceived lack of long term evidence including that provided by the results of our reactiv8 b trial supporting additional patient benefits perceived clinical risk of a new treatment inability to convince key opinion leaders to provide recommendations regarding reactiv8 or to convince patients physicians or payers that reactiv8 is an attractive alternative to other products a lack of willingness to tolerate the surgical procedure required to implant reactiv8 perceived liability risks associated with the use of new a product and procedures limited or lack of coverage or inadequate reimbursement within healthcare payment systems preference to provide other treatments which may be more lucrative for the medical professional cost associated with the purchase of new product and equipment other procedures competing for physician time and attention and the time commitment that may be required for special training to use reactiv8 communicating the benefits of reactiv8 to these physicians and hospitals requires a significant commitment by our commercial organization physicians and hospitals may be slow to change their practices because of perceived risks arising from the use of a new system physicians may not recommend or use reactiv8 until there is more long term commercial experience to convince them to alter their existing treatment methods or until they receive additional recommendations from other physicians that our product is effective we cannot predict when if ever physicians and hospitals may adopt use of our product we only recently began commercializing reactiv8 in the eea and have no history of commercializing reactiv8 in the united states reactiv8 has been ce marked since 2016 enabling us to commercialize it throughout the eea we have not yet obtained approval from the fda to commercially market in the united states as a result we have a limited history of commercializing reactiv8 generally and no history of selling reactiv8 in the united states as an organization we have never commercially launched a product in the united states nor commenced a sales representative training program or conducted a launch of a similar expected size a commercial launch and training program of this size is a significant undertaking that requires substantial financial and managerial resources we may be unable to gain broader market acceptance in the countries in which we have already begun to commercialize reactiv8 or successfully commercialize it in the united states for a number of reasons including established alternatives to reactiv8 with strong relationships with customers including physicians hospitals and third party suppliers limitations in our ability to demonstrate differentiation and advantages of reactiv8 compared to alternative methods for treating clbp and the relative safety efficacy and ease of use of reactiv8 the limited size of our sales force and the learning curve required to gain experience selling reactiv8 the inability to obtain sufficient supply of the components for the reactiv8 system or secure second source suppliers if our main suppliers are unable to fulfill our orders insufficient financial or other resources to support our commercialization efforts necessary to reach profitability and the introduction and market acceptance of new more effective or less expensive competing products and technologies if we do not achieve significantly greater market acceptance of our product do not gain momentum in our sales activities or fail to significantly grow our market share we will not be able to grow our revenue and our business and financial condition will be adversely affected our success will be heavily contingent on third party payment from government providers healthcare insurance providers or other public or private sources the existence of coverage and the adequacy of reimbursement for reactiv8 or procedures using reactiv8 by government and private payers will be critical to market adoption for our existing and future products medical professionals and hospitals will be unlikely to use reactiv8 at all or to a great extent if the product is not covered by third party payers or if they do not receive adequate reimbursement for the procedures utilizing reactiv8 and potential patients may be unwilling to pay for the product themselves a substantial portion of our current and potential future revenue depends or will depend in part on the extent to which the costs of reactiv8 or procedures using reactiv8 purchased by our customers are reimbursed by third party payers including medicare medicaid other u s government sponsored programs non u s governmental payers and private payers our customers ability to obtain adequate reimbursement for products and services from these third party payers affects the selection of products they purchase and the prices they are willing to pay some of our target customers may be unwilling to adopt reactiv8 in light of the additional associated cost if we are forced to lower the price we charge for reactiv8 our profit margins will decrease which will adversely affect our ability to invest in and

dublin business wire regulatory news mainstay medical international plc mainstay or the company euronext paris msty pa and euronext growth operated by euronext dublin msty ie a medical device company focused on bringing to market reactiv8 an implantable restorative neurostimulation system to treat disabling chronic low back pain today provides a company update and announces the publication of its 2018 full year results and annual report jason hannon ceo of mainstay said i believe fully in reactiv8 as a therapeutic option for patients suffering from disabling chronic low back pain and i believe that the value we can deliver to both our physician customers and their patients as well as the investing market will be demonstrated in the months and years to come the primary endpoint of our reactiv8 b clinical trial was not achieved due to a higher response at 120 days in the control active sham patient group than was expected however we believe the overall results from the trial represent solid evidence of the efficacy and safety of reactiv8 this belief is based on among other things a pre specified analysis of the primary endpoint where we adjusted for patients who increased their pain medications for reasons unrelated to their back pain as a reminder to be considered a responder in the clinical trial a patient must have reported 30 or greater pain relief on the vas scale and not increased their pain medications leading up to the 120 day measurement point statistically significant differences between the treatment and control groups on key secondary efficacy endpoints at 120 days a responder rate of 72 in the patients in the treatment and control groups combined that have reached one year since implantation and a significant reduction in the use of pain medications including opioids by patients at one year we believe these results will support sales growth in germany and other markets under our existing ce mark as well as our plan to file a pre market approval application with the u s food and drug administration we plan to submit a pma to the fda in mid 2019 with a decision on approval expected in late 2020 business update in november 2018 mainstay announced top line results from the reactiv8 b clinical study its international multi center prospective randomized active sham controlled blinded trial with one way cross over conducted under an investigational device exemption ide from the u s food drug administration fda a total of 204 patients with chronic low back pain refractory to physical therapy were implanted with reactiv8 at leading clinical sites in the u s europe and australia and randomized 1 1 to therapy or control the average duration of symptoms was 14 years in the treatment group the reactiv8 pulse generator was programmed to deliver electrical stimulation expected to elicit contractions of the multifidus muscle in the control group the reactiv8 device was programmed to provide a low level of electrical stimulation following assessment of the primary endpoint at 120 days patients in the control group crossed over to receive levels of electrical stimulation similar to those in the treatment group a summary of the clinical trial results is as follows the primary efficacy endpoint of the study was a comparison of responder rates between the treatment and control groups as measured on the visual analog scale vas of pain with responders defined as having a 30 or greater improvement on this measure between baseline and 120 days after randomization without any increase in pain medication and or muscle relaxants taken in the two weeks prior to the primary endpoint assessment visit in the treatment group the responder rate at 120 days was 57 compared to 47 in the control group resulting in a difference that is not statistically significant statistically significant differences on a number of key secondary endpoints were observed in the treatment group as compared to the control group at 120 days including change from baseline in disability measured by the oswestry disability index odi change from baseline in quality of life measured by the european quality of life score on five dimensions eq 5d percent pain relief ppr compared to baseline and subject global impression of global change sgic improvements in the percentage of patients reporting pain reduction continued beyond the 120 day assessment through one year for both groups the percentage of the 116 patients in the treatment group and control groups that had completed the one year assessment having a 30 or greater reduction in low back pain vas at that assessment without a significant increase in pain medication was 72 these data are subject to change as the remaining patients reach the one year assessment the protocol permitted patients to adjust their back pain medication usage after the 120 day assessment point at one year 44 of the 50 patients in both groups combined who were on opioids at baseline had voluntarily eliminated 28 or significantly reduced 16 their use of opioids these results are subject to change as the remaining patients reach the one year assessment the incidence and type of adverse events aes including serious aes were comparable to aes in clinical trials reported for other neurostimulation devices with no unanticipated aes related to the device procedure or stimulation mainstay is preparing to submit a pma application to the fda based upon the totality of its clinical data for reactiv8 the company expects to have a pre pma submission meeting with the fda during the second quarter to obtain feedback on its filing content and strategy a pma application filing is expected in mid 2019 after that meeting with a decision on approval expected in late 2020 the fda s review of the pma may result in the fda not agreeing with mainstay s interpretation of its clinical data including whether statistical significance was achieved for one or more endpoints in germany mainstay s initial european market the commercial team was repositioned in order to better focus efforts on key physician targets commercialization efforts in line with this strategy began in earnest in late

france mainstay medical international plc chairman s statement dear shareholder i am pleased to present the 2018 annual report for mainstay medical and its subsidiaries 2018 was challenging year but we believe the company is positioned for success in 2019 and beyond business review we announced headline results from the reactiv8 b clinical trial in november whilst the difference between the treatment and control groups on the primary endpoint of responder rate at 120 days as measured on the visual analog scale vas of pain was not statistically significant due to a higher than expected response rate in the control group we believe the overall results from the trial represent solid evidence of the efficacy and safety of reactiv8 these overall results include additional pre specified analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint as well as high responder rates in the patients that have reached one year since implantation and a significant reduction in the use of pain medications by patients at one year we believe these results will support sales growth in germany and other markets under our existing ce mark as well as our plan to file a pre market approval pma application with the u s food and drug administration a detailed review of the company s corporate activity in 2018 can be found in the directors report on page 8 of this annual report finance review cash on hand as

activities outlook the completion of and results from the reactiv8 b trial have caused us to set two main corporate objectives for 2019 continuing to make progress growing sales in germany and other markets and pursuing regulatory approval in the u s on the commercial front we have been encouraged by the reaction of implanting physicians to the reactv8 b trial clinical data on the regulatory front we plan to submit a pma to the fda in mid 2019 with an approval decision expected in late 2020 directors and staff i would like to thank our current and former staff consultants clinical trial investigators and all my fellow directors for their support and dedication which has enabled the continued success of the company of course we also owe a debt of gratitude to all those people who

total of 204 subjects were implanted with reactiv8 at leading clinical sites in the u s europe and australia and randomized 1 1 to therapy or control 14 days after implant in the treatment group the

low level of electrical stimulation following assessment of the primary endpoint at 120 days subjects in the control group crossed over to receive levels of electrical stimulation similar to those in the treatment group the subjects in the study had an average age of 47 and an average duration of chronic low back pain of 14 years this patient population had tried many other treatment alternatives including physical therapy and drugs with limited success and 79 of the subjects were on pain medication at baseline the primary efficacy endpoint of the study was a comparison of responder rates between the treatment and control groups as measured on the visual analog scale vas of pain consisting a 0 10 scale with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worse imaginable pain responders defined as

development expenses were 3 5 million during the year ended 31 december 2018 2017 4 2 million a decrease of 0 7 million is primarily driven by the reduction of certain quality and regulatory costs to

during the year ended 31 december 2018 and decreased by 1 9 million from 12 9 million during the same period in 2017 this is primarily driven by decreased direct trial costs relating to activities for

10 9 million during the same period in 2017 the increase of 4 2 million is primarily driven by commercialization and the related increase in our direct sales force impacting payroll travel and

expenditure the ongoing costs of being a public company and running the group the group s debt facility provided by ipf was announced on 24 august 2015 for up to 15 million the group had drawn down 4

operations primarily through the issuance of equity securities and debt funding the group continues to explore funding strategies e g equity debt partnering to support its activities into the future principal risks and uncertainties a summary of the principal risks relating to the group and company and or its industry include the following we have incurred significant operating losses and may not be able to achieve or subsequently maintain profitability we expect to require additional funds in the future in order to meet our capital and expenditure needs and further financing may not be available when required or if available could require us to agree to terms which are dilutive to current investors specifically favorable to new investors or to restrictions significantly limiting our access to additional capital or other activities our future financial performance is entirely dependent on the commercial success of reactiv8 our only product as of the date of this report obtaining adequate reimbursement for reactiv8 and rates of product adoption and market penetration we operate in a highly regulated environment and regulatory approval is required before we can market or sell reactiv8 in any market to date the only regulatory approval to market reactiv8 is our ce mark relating to the european economic area or eea and switzerland seeking and obtaining regulatory approval for medical devices in the united states and elsewhere can be a long and uncertain process the failure to achieve regulatory approval in the united states or in other key markets the loss of our ce mark or strict or changing regulatory regimes government policies and legislation in any of our target markets may delay prohibit or reduce potential sales failure to comply with debt covenants or failure to make repayments on our debt facility could have a material adverse effect we are required to conduct clinical trials for regulatory approvals and other purposes clinical trials carry substantial risks and are costly and time consuming with uncertain results any inability to fully protect and exploit our intellectual property may adversely impact our financial condition business prospects and results of operations a more extensive description of the existing and future potential risks to mainstay s business and to the company s ordinary shares are outlined in the risk factors section of this report on pages 24 to 56 and should be considered carefully by shareholders and prospective investors financial risk management the group is exposed to a variety of financial risks including credit risks liquidity risks interest rate risks and foreign currency risks further information can be reviewed in note 21 risk management framework mainstay s board of directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the group s risk management framework the group s risk management policies are established to identify and analyze the risks faced by the group to set appropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor risks and adherence to the limits risk management systems and policies will be reviewed regularly as conditions affecting the group change the group has no significant concentrations of financial risk other than concentration of cash with individual banks other than liquidity risk based on the company s use of cash during the year there has been no significant change during the year or since the year end to the types or quantum of financial risks faced by the group or the group s approach to the management of those risks liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk that the group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due since inception the group has funded its operations primarily through i the issuance of equity securities and ii debt funding the group continues to explore funding strategies e g equity debt partnering to support its activities into the future adequate additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all the group s inability to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on the group s financial position and its ability to pursue its business strategy credit and financial risk credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet contractual obligations and arises principally from the group s cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables credit risk is managed on a group basis the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each asset the carrying value of receivables is a reasonable approximation of fair value foreign currency risk the group s reporting currency is the us dollar the group s exposure to foreign currency risk arises through expenditure incurred in euro and australian dollars the group s australian subsidiary has an australian dollar functional currency and three of the group s subsidiaries located in ireland germany and the netherlands have a euro functional currency interest rate risk the group s cash balances are maintained in short term access accounts and carry a floating rate of interest the group s debt carries a variable rate of 3 month euribor plus a margin ranging from 10 5 to 12 5 any change in the euribor rate above zero will directly affect the amount of interest repayable on this debt outlook and future developments the completion of and results from the reactiv8 b trial have caused us to set two main corporate objectives for 2019 continuing to make progress growing sales in germany and other markets and pursuing regulatory approval in the u s on the commercial front we have been encouraged by the reaction of implanting physicians to the reactv8 b trial

barrymore investments limited a company controlled by seamus mulligan going concern the directors have evaluated whether there are conditions and events considered in aggregate that raise doubt about the group s ability to continue as a going concern the directors note the following relevant matters the group had cash of 15 5 million as at 31 december 2018 10 million as at 31 december 2017 the group had operating cash out flows of 27 3 million for the year ended 31 december 2018 year ended 31 december 2017 24 9 million due to the phase of development of the group the group expects to continue to incur losses in the medium term due to the ongoing investment required in research and development clinical and commercial activities and expects to continue to seek funding from investors or other finance providers as required the group has funded operations to date through the proceeds of equity funding of approximately 123 5 million and debt with an outstanding principal of 10 2 million as at 31 december 2018 subsequent to the year end the group has successfully extended the repayment terms of its debt arrangements to 2021 and will seek additional equity financing in 2019 in order to continue to fund its ongoing research and development clinical and commercial activities under the terms of its amended debt facility if the group raises at least 10 million in equity financing prior to june 30 2019 an additional 3 million will become available to the group from its lender as of the date of approval of these financial statements the terms of any such additional equity finance have not yet been finalised as there can be no certainty that this finance will be raised or of the terms on which such finance will be raised and because the group is reliant on such finance in order to continue to operate at its current level into the future this represents an uncertainty that may impact on the group s ability to continue as a going concern however the directors are confident based on discussions with investors that additional equity funding and resultant debt funding will be received and that the amount of such funding will be sufficient to enable to the company to continue its current level of activity and to ensure that the group is in a position to service its liabilities as they fall due for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of these financial statements as a result the directors have prepared the financial statements on the going concern basis dividends the directors do not recommend the payment of a dividend research

ensure the group benefits from the existence of a high quality board comprising of individuals with an appropriate balance of skills and experience in considering nominations to the board the nomination committee takes into account the benefit of board diversity including diversity of business background geographical diversity and gender diversity the board does not currently have a formal diversity policy in place due to the early stage of development of the group during 2019 the board will continue to focus attention on considering nominations to the board that re affirms the board s commitment to diversity across the group mainstay medical international plc risk factors this section addresses the existing and future material risks to mainstay s business however the following does not set out an exhaustive list or explanation of all risks that shareholders or prospective investors may face when making an investment in the ordinary shares and should be used as guidance only as further risks and uncertainties not currently known to the board or that the board currently deems immaterial may also have an adverse effect on the company s or the group s financial condition business prospects and or results of operations in such a case the market price of ordinary shares could decline and investors may lose all or part of their investment risks relating to our business we have incurred significant operating losses and may not be able to achieve or subsequently maintain profitability or meet our financial obligations we have incurred significant net losses since we were founded for the year ended 31 december 2018 we had a comprehensive loss of 31 million and a comprehensive loss of 30 million for the year ended 31 december 2017 we have funded our operations through equity capital and debt we have devoted substantially all of our resources to the research and development of reactiv8 including to our feasibility study our reactiv8 a clinical trial and our reactiv8 b clinical trial initial commercialization efforts and expansion of our intellectual property portfolio even if we do become profitable in the short or medium term we may be unable to sustain or increase our profitability on a quarterly or annual basis over the medium to long term in any case we will need to obtain additional capital to fund commercialization including expanding reimbursement to fund continuing research and development and to run additional clinical trials we expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future as we continue to pursue these objectives in addition a failure to raise sufficient capital could cause us to fail to meet contractual or other financial obligations which could lead to legal liability or insolvency if we are unable to obtain or maintain additional regulatory approvals for reactiv8 in the united states and elsewhere we may never generate significant revenue or become profitable reactiv8 is an active implantable medical device or aimd which requires regulatory approval before it can be marketed or sold by us the only regulatory approval we have received is the ce conformity assessment or ce marking for reactiv8 which allows commercialization of reactiv8 in the european economic area or eea and in switzerland there is no guarantee that further regulatory approval will be obtained for reactiv8 or any other product we develop either now or in the future or that commercialization in the eea switzerland or any other jurisdiction will be successful or will generate sufficient revenue and profits to cover expenses or fund future growth any such regulatory approval may also experience delays the reactiv8 b trial did not achieve statistical significance on its primary endpoint but it did achieve statistical significance on a pre specified alternative analysis of that endpoint and on multiple secondary endpoints we cannot be certain whether the totality of the data from the reactiv8 b trial will be sufficient to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the fda to allow for the granting of a pma or that it will be sufficient to maintain our current ce marking since our inception we have devoted substantially all of our efforts to the development and commercialization of reactiv8 for the treatment of clbp failure to obtain fda regulatory approval or other additional regulatory approvals or the failure to maintain regulatory approvals once obtained may result in our financial condition being adversely affected and our ability to grow domestically and internationally would likely be limited because we do not have any other products currently in development if we are unable to market reactiv8 as a result of a failure to obtain fda approval or to obtain or maintain additional regulatory approvals we would lose our only source of revenue and our business would be materially adversely affected the fda requires manufacturers of medical devices to obtain regulatory approval prior to commercializing products in the united states failing to obtain approval from the fda could result in significant costs for us and consume management s time and other resources the fda could ask us to improve or augment manufacturing processes or generate and provide additional data on the quality efficacy or safety of reactiv8 which could include additional clinical data additionally even if we obtain fda approval to commercialize reactiv8 in the united states we would be required to obtain further fda approval prior to making any modification to reactiv8 and we may be required to generate and provide additional data on the quality efficacy or safety of reactiv8 as a condition to maintaining approval there can be no assurance that fda approval will be ever obtained for reactiv8 regulatory approval in the united states is via a pre market approval or pma issued by the fda we plan to submit a pma to the fda for reactiv8 in mid 2019 but the timing of the pma process is uncertain the process typically takes significantly longer than ce marking once granted the pma does not have an expiry date however regulatory approvals may be withdrawn if for example a new and unexpected risk emerges that would make continued marketing of reactiv8 no longer acceptable to the fda the pma process requires an applicant to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device based in part on extensive data including but not limited to technical preclinical clinical trial manufacturing and labeling data the fda can delay limit or deny approval of a device for many reasons including inability to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the fda or the applicable regulatory entity or notified body that products are safe or effective for their intended uses the disagreement of the fda or the applicable foreign regulatory body with the design or implementation of clinical trials or the interpretation of data from pre clinical studies or clinical trials serious and unexpected adverse device effects experienced by participants in our clinical trials data from pre clinical studies and clinical trials may be insufficient to support clearance or approval where required inability to demonstrate that the clinical and other benefits of the device outweigh the risks the manufacturing process or facilities used may not meet applicable requirements and the potential for approval policies or regulations of the fda or applicable foreign regulatory bodies to change significantly in a manner rendering clinical data or regulatory filings insufficient for clearance or approval in addition the fda s policies and policies of foreign regulatory agencies may change and additional regulations may be enacted that could prevent limit or delay regulatory approval of our devices such policy or regulatory changes could impose additional requirements upon us that could delay our ability to obtain new approvals increase the costs of compliance or restrict our ability to maintain our current approval for example as part of the food and drug administration safety and innovation act enacted in 2012 congress reauthorized the medical device user fee amendments with various fda performance goal commitments and enacted several medical device regulatory improvements and miscellaneous reforms which are further intended to clarify and improve medical device regulation both pre and post clearance and approval in addition the planned withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union commonly known as brexit could cause additional or changed regulatory requirements relating to our products in the united kingdom some of these proposals and reforms could impose additional regulatory requirements upon us that could delay our ability to obtain new approvals increase the costs of compliance or restrict our ability to maintain our current approval the regulatory approval process may delay or prevent the launch of reactiv8 in our target markets which would negatively impact or prevent our ability to achieve our objectives if we fail to obtain further approval of reactiv8 in a timely manner or at all sales of reactiv8 may be delayed or may not be achieved thereby adversely affecting our ability to generate revenues or fund our on going activities the success of reactiv8 depends on its acceptance and adoption by medical professionals our success will require acceptance and adoption by medical professionals of reactiv8 as a new treatment for people with clbp such acceptance will depend on medical professionals being convinced of the clinical performance benefits safety and cost effectiveness of reactiv8 and being prepared to undertake special training in certain cases acceptance of reactiv8 depends on educating physicians as to the distinctive characteristics perceived benefits safety and ease of use of reactiv8 as compared to alternative solutions and communicating to physicians the proper application of reactiv8 the reactiv8 b trial did not achieve statistical significance on its primary endpoint but it did achieve statistical significance on a pre specified alternative analysis of that endpoint and on multiple secondary endpoints we cannot be certain whether the totality of the data from the reactiv8 b trial will be sufficient to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of physicians if we are not successful in convincing physicians of the merits of reactiv8 or educating them on the use of reactiv8 they may not use reactiv8 and we may be unable to increase our sales sustain our growth or achieve profitability medical professionals may be hesitant to change their medical treatment practices or accept and adopt reactiv8 including for the following reasons general conservatism about adoption of new and innovative treatment practices lack of awareness or acceptance of the role of inhibition of the multifidus muscle in causing clbp and the suitability of neurostimulation therapy to address this inhibition lack of experience with reactiv8 and with neurostimulation as a treatment alternative lack or perceived lack of long term evidence including that provided by the results of our reactiv8 b trial supporting additional patient benefits perceived clinical risk of a new treatment inability to convince key opinion leaders to provide recommendations regarding reactiv8 or to convince patients physicians or payers that reactiv8 is an attractive alternative to other products a lack of willingness to tolerate the surgical procedure required to implant reactiv8 perceived liability risks associated with the use of new a product and procedures limited or lack of coverage or inadequate reimbursement within healthcare payment systems preference to provide other treatments which may be more lucrative for the medical professional cost associated with the purchase of new product and equipment other procedures competing for physician time and attention and the time commitment that may be required for special training to use reactiv8 communicating the benefits of reactiv8 to these physicians and hospitals requires a significant commitment by our commercial organization physicians and hospitals may be slow to change their practices because of perceived risks arising from the use of a new system physicians may not recommend or use reactiv8 until there is more long term commercial experience to convince them to alter their existing treatment methods or until they receive additional recommendations from other physicians that our product is effective we cannot predict when if ever physicians and hospitals may adopt use of our product we only recently began commercializing reactiv8 in the eea and have no history of commercializing reactiv8 in the united states reactiv8 has been ce marked since 2016 enabling us to commercialize it throughout the eea we have not yet obtained approval from the fda to commercially market in the united states as a result we have a limited history of commercializing reactiv8 generally and no history of selling reactiv8 in the united states as an organization we have never commercially launched a product in the united states nor commenced a sales representative training program or conducted a launch of a similar expected size a commercial launch and training program of this size is a significant undertaking that requires substantial financial and managerial resources we may be unable to gain broader market acceptance in the countries in which we have already begun to commercialize reactiv8 or successfully commercialize it in the united states for a number of reasons including established alternatives to reactiv8 with strong relationships with customers including physicians hospitals and third party suppliers limitations in our ability to demonstrate differentiation and advantages of reactiv8 compared to alternative methods for treating clbp and the relative safety efficacy and ease of use of reactiv8 the limited size of our sales force and the learning curve required to gain experience selling reactiv8 the inability to obtain sufficient supply of the components for the reactiv8 system or secure second source suppliers if our main suppliers are unable to fulfill our orders insufficient financial or other resources to support our commercialization efforts necessary to reach profitability and the introduction and market acceptance of new more effective or less expensive competing products and technologies if we do not achieve significantly greater market acceptance of our product do not gain momentum in our sales activities or fail to significantly grow our market share we will not be able to grow our revenue and our business and financial condition will be adversely affected our success will be heavily contingent on third party payment from government providers healthcare insurance providers or other public or private sources the existence of coverage and the adequacy of reimbursement for reactiv8 or procedures using reactiv8 by government and private payers will be critical to market adoption for our existing and future products medical professionals and hospitals will be unlikely to use reactiv8 at all or to a great extent if the product is not covered by third party payers or if they do not receive adequate reimbursement for the procedures utilizing reactiv8 and potential patients may be unwilling to pay for the product themselves a substantial portion of our current and potential future revenue depends or will depend in part on the extent to which the costs of reactiv8 or procedures using reactiv8 purchased by our customers are reimbursed by third party payers including medicare medicaid other u s government sponsored programs non u s governmental payers and private payers our customers ability to obtain adequate reimbursement for products and services from these third party payers affects the selection of products they purchase and the prices they are willing to pay some of our target customers may be unwilling to adopt reactiv8 in light of the additional associated cost if we are forced to lower the price we charge for reactiv8 our profit margins will decrease which will adversely affect our ability to invest in and grow our business with the global pressure on healthcare costs payers are attempting to contain costs by for example limiting coverage of and the level of reimbursement for new therapies any limitations on decreases in or elimination of payments by third party payers may have an adverse effect on our financial condition business prospects and or results of operations in many countries a series of codes is used to classify diagnoses and clinical procedures performed and there are separate coding systems for delivery of inpatient and ambulatory outpatient care these codes and coding systems vary from country to country including from country to country within the european unio
christine lagarde as president theodore roosevelt once put it there is every reason why we should face the future seriously neither hiding from ourselves the gravity of the problems nor fearing to approach these problems with the unbending unflinching purpose to solve them aright i would like to focus on how we can harness this unbending purpose for the benefit of all let me begin with the global economic weather map a year ago i said the sun is shining fix the roof six months ago i pointed to clouds of risk on the horizon today the weather is increasingly unsettled what do i mean by that in january the imf projected global growth for 2019 and 2020 at around 3 ½ percent less than in the recent past but still reasonable it has since lost further momentum as you will see from our updated forecast next week only two years ago 75 percent of the global economy experienced an upswing for this year we expect 70 percent of the global economy to experience a slowdown in growth but to be clear we do not see a recession in the near term in fact we expect some pickup in growth in the second half of 2019 and into 2020 so you see what i mean by unsettled indeed the global economy is at a delicate moment global growth has been slowing largely because of rising trade tensions and financial tightening in the second half of 2018 at the same time global economic activity is set to benefit from the now more patient pace of monetary normalization by major central banks led by the us fed and from increased stimulus in china for example these policy responses have supported an easing of financial conditions and increased capital flows to emerging markets where currencies have strengthened relative to the us dollar but again to be clear the expected rebound in global growth later this year is precarious it is vulnerable to downside risks including country related uncertainties such as brexit and broader uncertainties such as high debt in some sectors and countries tensionsaround trade policy and a sense of uneasein financial markets for example should there be a sharper than expected tightening of financial conditions it could create serious challenges for many governments and companies in terms of refinancing and debt service which could amplify exchange rate movements and financial market corrections three areas of policy action so indeed this is a delicate moment that requires us to handle with care this means that we must not only avoid policy missteps but also be sure to take the right policy steps i see three mutually reinforcing areas of action in domestic policies in cross border policies and in coordinated efforts to tackle the major global challenges we all face let me touch on each of these a domestic policies to build more resilient and inclusive economies first and foremost policies must provide conditions at home for people to succeed you might have heard me say we should fix the roof especially when it comes to structural reforms that can help boost productivity and long term growth there is no one size fits all of course policies should be customized to meet the needs of individual countries broadly speaking however macroeconomic policy should aim to secure growth and stability monetary policy should remain accommodative where inflation is below target and should anchor expectations exchange rate flexibility should be used as needed to help absorb shocks and the financial sector should be strengthened and risks reduced by maintaining the impetus of regulatory reform the reality is that many economies are not resilient enough high public debt and low interest rates have left limited room to act when the next downturn comes which inevitably it will for many countries this implies making smarter use of fiscal policy which in turn means striking the right balance between growth debt sustainability and social objectives as a former finance minister i know that this is not so easily done it involves building fiscal buffers in good times while creating enough fiscal space to act in bad times it involves the continual hard work of upgrading tax systems mobilizing domestic revenue prioritizing growth friendly expenditure and reducing public debt where needed it also involves addressing excessive inequality here fiscal policy can play a key role including through progressive tax measures that would need to be country specific and stronger safety nets that can help address dislocations caused by technological change and globalization above all fiscal policy can help create broader opportunities by providing access to quality education healthcare and infrastructure especially for those who have been left behind or left out in many countries this means paying special attention to young people and to women this kind of policy action can help build confidence and trust and overcome perceptions of an unfair sharing of economic benefits one area where these perceptions are growing is in the increasing concentration of market power by a few corporate giants new imf analysis shows that over the past two decades rising corporate market power in advanced economies had only a very small effect on investment output and the share of national income paid to workers but we also found that a small number of highly dynamic companies accounted for the highest price markups in other words there is a winner takes most dynamic at play especially pronounced in the digital economy i am not saying that we currently have a monopoly problem but i am saying that we should take appropriate measures so that it does not become a problem that means reducing barriers to entry for new firms and reforming competition frameworks to ensure a level playing field in all sectors whether traditional or high tech b cross border efforts to provide a more level playing field this brings me to my second priority area for action cross border policies here there are a wide range of economic issues to be addressed upgrading financial regulations improving debt transparency tackling illicit financial flows to name a few but when it comes to levelling the playing field across borders no issue looms larger than trade this is an area where the chamber and the imf share much common ground we know that for many decades trade integration has helped to increase prosperity reduce poverty spread new technologies and boost productivity for people all over the world it has reduced the cost of living and created millions of new jobs with higher wages at the same time we know that not everyone has benefitted that there are distortions in the trade system and that it needs to be reformed we also know that trade barriers are not the answer more new research from the imf about to be released shows just how important it is to avoid policy missteps in this sphere analyzing experience from 180 countries over the past six decades we have found that trade integration clearly boosts investment in plant machinery and many other high job creating areas conversely trade barriers clearly damage investment and employment this finding is of particular relevance now at a time when trade tensions could further damage investment and at a time when investment is already weak so again it is a delicate moment and we should be careful specifically we have looked at what might happen if tariffs on all goods traded between the us and china went up by 25 percentage points that alone would reduce annual gdp by up to 0 6 percent in the us and by up to 1 5 percent in china these are potentially self inflicted wounds that should be avoided and yet discussions about trade distortions or unfair practices are often bound up with the concept of bilateral trade deficits and surpluses and tariffs the fact is that historically bilateral trade balances have been driven mostly by macroeconomic factors not bilateral tariffs in other words the most effective way to reduce a bilateral trade deficit is to steer clear of tariffs because tariffs on the goods of one country only divert trade flows to other countries nobody wins a trade war you might have heard me say that as well that is why we need to work together to reduce trade barriers and modernize the global trade system so that we all win that means addressing issues such as state subsidies intellectual property and data privacy it also means new deals to unlock the full potential of tradeable services and digital commerce and it means having rules based frameworks to ensure fair competition and a level playing field so as we move forward we need collective action to modernize the key functions of the world trade organization from negotiation to transparency to dispute resolution this will create a stronger and more flexible system of course leveling the playing field across borders is not only about trade in recent days as you may have seen the imf has also emphasized the need to improve the framework around international corporate taxation i have gone so far as to say the system is fundamentally out of date and i believe that we share the chamber s view that it is counterproductive for countries to take a unilateral approach we need a cross border effort reforming international corporate taxation is a challenge for all countries but developing economies rely especially on corporate tax revenues to fund essential investment in people and infrastructure our analysis shows that non oecd countries lose about 200 billion a year because companies are able to shift profits to low tax locations this foregone revenue makes it even more difficult for low income countries to increase growth employment and to meet the sustainable development goals by the agreed target date of 2030 the good news is that efforts to modernize the international corporate tax system are underway but there is a lot more to be done the imf has put forward some options on how to work together to make the system fairer and fit for the future i have so far talked about two priority areas for policy action domestic and across borders let me turn to my third and final priority area global challenges c partnership to address global challenges these are issues that no country can solve alone and the list is long demographics migration cyber risks and of course the existential threat of climate change on that issue i know that the chamber sees great potential in public private partnership as well as innovation and technology to reduce greenhouse gas emissions we at the imf are also deeply engaged on this issue taking a macroeconomic perspective of course we have focused in particular on pricing carbon emissions and reducing energy subsidies which amount to about 5 2 trillion per year or 6 5 percent of global gdp both of these policy tools would go a long way to help mitigate the effects of climate change having just recently become a grand mother i must say that the challenge of making the planet a better place for our children and grand children has taken on a special resonance for me in my conversations with young people all over the world i have also learned that climate change is one of the two challenges that they see as of greatest importance to their future the other one is corruption this too is an area where the imf has stepped up its focus on the macroeconomic effects on our member nations the annual cost of bribery alone is over 1 5 trillion dollars roughly two percent of global gdp money laundering and the financing of terrorism are other serious dimensions of the problem where the imf has been working with over a hundred countries our latest research underlines the high fiscal cost of corruption leading to a massive loss in public revenue and lower quality public spending this new analysis confirms what we had all long suspected corruption lowers growth it increases inequality it feeds distrust is there any hope in combatting corruption we think there is and we do believe that the right policy responses can make a significant difference in a new study we estimate that within a group of similar economies less corruption is associated with higher tax revenues in fact a very significant difference of up to 4 percentage points of gdp between countries better governance is also associated with higher student test scores and more efficient spending on vital infrastructure from roads to schools to hospitals this highlights the potentially huge benefit of curbing corruption and not only fiscal benefit but also the potential benefit to society at large there is clearly an international dimension to this transparency international for example recently updated its corruption perceptions index where 100 means very clean by that measure two thirds of all countries score below 50 indicating that they have serious problems in preventing corruption certainly countries must accept responsibility for what happens within their own borders but corruption is an international plague to fight it effectively requires international cooperation 4 international policy cooperation and the imf i know that the chamber recognizes the value of cooperation ever since world war ii in country after country in crisis after crisis working together has served the world well the imf has often been at the center of those efforts during the global financial crisis the fund was able to commit over 500 billion to help prevent another great depression in the decade since we supported economic programs in over 90 countries and our work continues consider the fund s advice to countries to help them open up their markets and encourage investment or think about our recent support for critical country programs in egypt tunisia and jordan think about ukraine or argentina to do our job effectively of course we need to be sufficiently well resourced into the future for that we rely on the support of our 189 member countries this is another issue that i expect our ministers and governors will discuss at our spring meetings next week i am confident that the support from our membership remains strong 5 conclusion to conclude i want to return to the inspirational nature of this magnificent building inscribed on the walls of the original chamber building was a quote from the great american statesman daniel webster he said let us develop the resources of our land call forth its powers build up its institutions promote all its great interests and see whether we also in our day and generation may not perform something worthy to be remembered at this delicate moment for the global economy let us work together to do something worthy to be remembered lagarde imf managing director delivered the speech at the us chamber of commerce washington dc last week

report on the company during the period from 31 december 2017 to 31 december 2018 the period the company s net asset value decreased by 20 24 underperforming the reference msci korea 25 50 net total return index the korea index which decreased 15 24 in pounds sterling since the admission of the company to aim in may 2013 the net asset value has increased by 62 35 compared to the korea index returns of 38 15 as will be discussed in the investment manager s report the underperformance of the company in 2018 can be largely attributed to the widening of preference share discounts the corporate governance reforms that have taken place so far in the south korean market have proceeded more slowly than we would have wished however we have already seen significant changes to the way several south korean companies are managed the board believes that in the long term these changes will continue across the south korean corporate landscape and will serve as a catalyst for the narrowing of preference share discounts and the phasing out of the inefficient preference share structure as we have seen in other countries we look forward to the continued outperformance of the company over the long term the company recently announced that the investment manager intends to rebalance the portfolio towards preference shares trading at wider discounts the board fully supports this move a report from the investment manager follows in accordance with the company s admission document the company has announced that it is offering shareholders the opportunity to elect to realise all or a part of their shareholding in the company the realisation opportunity a circular with full details of the realisation opportunity was published on 20 march 2019 if any shareholders elect for realisation then on the realisation date the company s current portfolio will be divided into two pools a continuation pool and a realisation pool the realisation pool will be managed in accordance with an orderly realisation with the aim of making progressive returns of cash to holders of realisation shares all of the directors and personnel associated with the investment manager who collectively own 7 74 of the company s issued share capital as at 17 april 2019 intend to continue their investment in the company and do not intend to participate in the realisation opportunity in respect of all or any part of their respective shareholdings the directors will be declaring a dividend to distribute the income received by the company in respect of the year ended 31 december 2018 this dividend will be payable to all shareholders regardless of any election they make under the realisation opportunity in addition to the realisation opportunity the company has an active share repurchase program as part of its discount management strategy the board is authorised to repurchase up to 40 of the company s outstanding ordinary shares in issue as at 26 july 2018 on which date the company had 84 364 981 ordinary shares in issue as the company traded at a narrow discount or premium to net asset value in 2018 there were no share repurchases during the period since admission almost six years ago and as at the date of this document the company has repurchased 12 590 250 ordinary shares of the original 105 000 000 ordinary shares issued at admission at a discount to nav the board also has in place standing instructions with the company s broker n 1 singer advisory llp for the repurchase of the company s shares during closed periods when the board is not permitted to give individual instructions typically around the preparation of the annual and half yearly financial reports the board intends to continue to aggressively repurchase shares if the company s discount is greater than 5 of the company s net asset value we will continue to keep shareholders informed of any share repurchases through public announcements as discussed in previous communications the company has purchased certain derivatives as general market and portfolio hedges please see the investment manager s commentary for more detail about these derivative securities owned by the company if you would like to speak with the investment manager or learn about potential opportunities to meet with them please contact the company s broker n 1 singer i would like to thank shareholders for their support and look forward to the continued success of the company in the future norman crighton chairman 17 april 2019 this return includes the annual cash dividend paid to the company s shareholders but does not assume such dividends are reinvested msci total return indices are calculated as if any dividends paid by constituents are reinvested at their respective closing prices on the ex date of the distribution additionally unless it has already been determined that the company will be wound up the company will offer shareholders subsequent opportunities to realise all or part of their shareholding every two years after the realisation opportunity on or prior to the anniversary of admission 14 may as the company detailed in its circular for the realisation opportunity the mechanism for returning cash to the shareholders that elect for realisation will be determined by the board in consultation with its advisors once the results of the elections of shareholders in the realisation opportunity are available we note that the cash distributed to realising shareholders will likely be different than the net asset value of the company on the realisation date in part due to transaction expenses associated with liquidating the realisation pool if the realisation pool is of significant size it is likely that a full cash distribution may take some considerable time investment manager s report for the year ended 31 december 2018 in 2018 the performance of wkof was disappointing including reinvested dividends the return to an investor in the company was down 20 50 per cent assuming dividends were not reinvested the return was down 20 24 per cent compared to a return of 15 24 per cent for the msci korea 25 50 net total return index the korea index over the same period in each case calculated in sterling the underperformance last year was in large part due to a widening of discounts which we believe creates opportunities for the future we don t presume to be able to explain short run changes in market psychology which tend to be the primary driver of discounts over time intervals of less than a couple of years over the long term we expect prices to reflect fundamental value this should provide a tailwind for korean preference shares driving their discounts to more reasonable levels starting from its inception in may 2013 wkof has significantly outperformed the korean market including reinvested dividends the total return to an investor in wkof was 62 01 compared to returns of 38 15 for the korea index over the same period past returns versus future returns we will discuss some of the fundamental explanations for recent market moves below however beginning with an academic perspective we note that one year returns of fund managers are notoriously bad predictors of future one year returns recent research published in the journal of portfolio management has found that returns for periods as long as two three and five years also are poor predictors the authors found that at these time scales past returns were negatively correlated with future returns the negative correlation persists for up to five years weakening over time so that for five year periods past returns have almost no predictive power the negative relationship held for a variety of specifications since investors cannot rely on past returns for periods as long as five years to predict future returns investors need to evaluate the investment thesis and the expertise of the fund manager when selecting funds we believe that our investment thesis of buying highly discounted korean preference shares with the same or better economics as the corresponding ordinary shares continues to be valid therefore the poor performance in the last year driven by a widening of preferred share discounts creates opportunities for the future exceptional profits are often due to the opportunities that became available in years when markets were doing poorly when cheap stocks get cheaper this should be viewed as a reason to buy not as a sell signal we don t see any fundamental reason why the prices of preference shares generally should have fallen relative to the ordinary shares comments on the korean economy and stock market the performance of the korean stock market as a whole was poor in 2018 prices of korean stocks fell even more than prices in other markets this poor performance was in the face of the relative strength of the korean economy which grew significantly faster than japan s and western europe s and roughly the same as the u s economy usually the better performing economies are not associated with the worst performing stock markets one possible explanation for the price fall of the south korean market relative to other markets may be the threat of a u s china trade war korean goods are major components of chinese exports to the u s and thus a turndown in chinese exports to the u s would have a disproportionate effect on the korean economy the imminent threat of a more serious u s china trade war seems to have subsided but u s policy has become exceptionally unpredictable the current u s administration does not seem bound by previous norms nor constrained by congress so the risk of national security concerns being used to enforce tariffs or quotas is a serious threat to global investors more generally investors may justifiably fear a slowdown of the chinese economy which would hurt the profits of korean exporters since exports to china are a major contributor to korean gdp a fall in those exports would have knock on effects throughout the korean economy on the korean domestic front there was considerable turmoil on 23 august the appeals court sentenced the impeached president park geun hye to 25 years in prison on corruption charges the new administration increased the minimum wage by 10 9 for 2019 to 8 350 won approximately 7 35 per hour for comparison the minimum wage in 2010 was 4 110 won per hour and the minimum wage in the u s is currently 7 25 per hour this is the federal minimum wage state and local minimum wages can be significantly higher these large increases in the minimum wage have been accompanied by increases in the labor force participation rate the magnitude of the effect of a higher minimum wage on wages in manufacturing is unclear a higher minimum wage may also push up demand the net effect on profits is likely to vary by market segment president moon has called for the national pension service to take a more active role in policing corporate governance at the chaebols a south korean conglomerate the nps has been shifting its allocation from bonds toward equities making it a major shareholder for many korean companies the hope is that this higher equity position coupled with a more activist stance will induce korean firms to emphasize the interests of shareholders rather than those of the founding family the risk is that the nps will become politicized and will be more responsive to the dictates of the ruling party however the government is concerned about the solvency of the nps and thus is likely to have a common interest in increasing the profitability and dividend yields of the firms in which the nps is invested our analysis of the ratio of dividends and discounts suggests that higher payout ratios are generally associated with narrower discounts as of 31 december 2018 wkof s gross dividend yield on the preferred shares in its portfolio was 3 8 by comparison at 31 december 2018 the yield on the 10 year korean sovereign debt was 1 94 shorter maturities had slightly lower yields and the s p korea corporate bond index had a yield to maturity of 2 27 we believe the higher yield on preference shares relative to bonds provides a strong incentive for investors seeking yield to move out of bonds and into the preference shares over the long run this should provide a positive impetus for preference share prices even after its large increase in dividends for 2018 korea has perhaps the lowest dividend payout ratio of any major market the table below is as of 31 march 2019 note that the kospi 200 index contains ordinary shares not preference shares index name dividend payout p e ratio p b ratio ftse 100 uk 73 8 14 8x 1 72x taiex taiwan 61 3 14 2x 1 60x s p 500 us 45 8 18 6x 3 36x shanghai composite china 36 8 14 1x 1 59x nikkei 225 japan 32 7 15 0x 1 63x kospi 200 south korea 20 6 8 7x 0 89x looking forward we expect the dividend payout ratios of korean stocks to continue to converge closer to international norms higher dividend payout ratios may also increase the price of the ordinary shares dividend payouts are considered to be a positive signal for companies with large cash holdings dividend payouts also tend to increase the return on equity since the marginal return on cash is generally lower than the average return on equity indeed the low dividend payout ratios for korean stocks may explain their low valuations price to earnings and price to book ratios which are lower in korea than in comparable markets would also likely converge to international norms as corporate governance improves and payout ratios increase note that the price of insuring korean sovereign debt against default implies very low geopolitical risk the timing of these changes is unclear generally we have found that markets stay out of balance for longer than expected but when they adjust the adjustments are more rapid than we expected however the increase in dividend yields lowers the cost to waiting portfolio allocation wkof was established to enable investors to benefit from the large discounts of korean preference shares relative to their underlying ordinary shares indeed the vast majority of the return to wkof investors since inception has been attributable to the discount narrowing of preference shares in the portfolio larger discount korean preference shares in general are often less liquid than smaller discount korean preference shares but we believe that it is currently in the interest of shareholders to trade off liquidity for what we believe to be a portfolio with higher expected returns we plan to rebalance the company s portfolio over time toward larger discount korean preference shares consistent with our view on the most attractive portfolio we note that one likely result of this shift will be a gradual reduction in our holding of samsung electronics samsung preference shares which were trading at a 19 discount as of 31 march 2019 and are the most liquid preference shares in south korea while it trades at a significantly narrower discount than the other preference shares in the wkof portfolio we do believe that samsung looks undervalued on a fundamental basis this may be due to limitations on the ability of some institutions to allocate a share of their assets to samsung that is proportionate to the representation of samsung in the korea index however even if samsung ordinary shares were to outperform the market it is not clear that its preference shares would also outperform at a 19 discount there is far less scope for outperformance from discount narrowing we do however expect that we will generally continue to hold a meaningful position in samsung as a relatively high expected return source of liquidity to enable us to purchase large blocks of other securities at attractive prices when those opportunities arise as well as to repurchase shares of wkof at the board s direction investors may be concerned that the high discounts on preference shares reflect poor corporate governance but we note that the ordinary shares are much more closely followed and more liquid than the preference shares consequently we would expect that any problems with a korean company would be at least as likely to be reflected in the price of its ordinary shares as in its preference shares and discounts would not predict negative returns on ordinary shares which is what we found in the historical data portfolio developments during the fourth quarter two portfolio companies made noteworthy announcements the first cj corp cj announced in december its intent to conduct a bonus issuance of a new class of preferred shares to existing cj common and preferred shareholders in april 2019 for each common share or preferred share held on the record date the cj shareholder will receive 0 15 new cj preferred shares free of payment while we typically view bonus issues and share dividends as neutral events that have similar economic impact to stock splits the economic terms of the new preference shares are unusual the new preference shares receive a yield equal to the common dividend yield plus 2 of par value carry similar legal protections as other korean preference shares and are convertible to common shares in ten years the new cj preference shares are not the first instance of convertible preferred shares in korea however previous convertible preference shares had typically been issued by companies with small market capitalization and traded on the korean stock exchange with low liquidity both the common and preferred share prices reacted positively to the news of the bonus dividend with the preferred share price displaying a larger percentage impact because of its 50 discount relative to the common shares despite these share price movements we currently have a neutral stance on the cj bonus issue of new preferred shares for the following reasons from an economic perspective it is unclear why shareholders are better off receiving what is in essence a delayed stock dividend of new common shares normally secondary offerings of stock are a negative signal for future stock price performance conversations with local brokers yielded rumors that a potential rationale behind the bonus issue was to facilitate inheritance and ownership transfer between the ceo and his son we treat this claim with scepticism the ceo is 58 years old and the heir to the cj group is still in his early 30s so any inheritance planning would likely still be at least a decade away and using a bonus issue of convertible preference shares is fraught with uncertainty on pricing and legality we do view optimistically the fact that the lengthy convertibility time frame opens up potential mispricing opportunities for the new preference shares and we expect increased price volatility around the listing date of the new securities the second development was a small buyback of common and preference shares by hyundai motors only one per cent of shares were repurchased so the economic impact was minor what was more important was the precedent of the share buyback in the u s share buybacks summed to about 2 8 of shares outstanding in 2018 which exceeded stock dividends and was a significant fraction of total u s gdp if korea were to follow the u s model that could have a major effect on return on equity for korean firms and a concomitant effect on their share prices comments on hedging against economic calamity wkof pursues its investment strategy with a portfolio that is generally long only however because of political tensions in northeast asia the board approved a hedging strategy on 5 september 2017 the purpose of the hedging strategy is to reduce exposure to extreme events that would be catastrophic to wkof importantly the company has limited its use of hedging instruments to purchases of credit default swaps and put options securities that we believe would generate high returns in an economic disaster without introducing new risks into the portfolio or exacerbating existing risks by contrast if wkof were to short ewy which tracks the korea index it would increase the risk of companies without preference shares outperforming the companies with preference shares as well as the risk of an increase in the discount of preference shares to the underlying ordinary shares these risks are not present in the hedges wkof has purchased the hedges are similar to insurance the sum of the premia paid for the insurance is the maximum potential cumulative loss to wkof from hedging these catastrophe hedges are not intended to make money we expect that the company s hedges will lose money most of the time as with any insurance policy in contrast to the typical insurance contract the expected return may in fact be positive depending on the probability distribution of bad events since a probability distribution over a single event is never observed only the realized outcome is observed it is impossible to know whether these hedges had a positive or negative expected return the table below provides details about the hedges as of 31 december 2018 note that outside of the

financial instruments and the composition of options and credit default swaps held at year end following year end the company sold all of the ewy put options in january and purchased new put options in march a note on the wkof discount we believe that the narrow discount over the past year is due both to the board s strong commitment to share buybacks when wkof is trading at a meaningful discount as well as wkof providing a unique product wkof enables investors who couldn t otherwise access the korean market to own deeply discounted korean preference shares even large institutions who might have access would have difficulty buying a meaningful position in the more heavily discounted preference shares which tend to be illiquid within a reasonable time frame and cost it took wkof multiple months to accumulate its positions in those shares it would be difficult for investors to replicate this portfolio at a reasonable cost going forward change alone is unchanging heraclitus since the inception of the fund almost six years ago conditions have changed somewhat while the discounts are not as attractive as when we first launched the fund the prospects for investors in wkof continue to be highly favourable we are not aware of any market segment that is as undervalued as korean preference shares in the short run markets are governed by the vagaries of investor whims in the long run prices generally reflect fundamental values long run investors in korean preference shares should have their patience rewarded weiss asset management lp 17 april 2019 this return includes all

attractive return on their investment predominantly though long term capital appreciation by investing primarily in listed south korean preferred shares the full investment objective and investment policy are detailed in the summary information going concern in accordance with the company s articles of association and its admission document the company offered all shareholders the right to elect to realise some or all of the value of their ordinary shares the realisation opportunity less applicable costs and expenses on or prior to the fourth anniversary of the company s admission to aim and unless it has already been determined that the company be wound up every two years thereafter being 15 may 2019 the realisation date see note 18 for further details on 20 march 2019 the company announced that pursuant to the realisation opportunity shareholders who are on the register as at the record date may elect during the election period to redesignate all or part provided that such part be rounded up to the nearest whole ordinary share of their ordinary shares as realisation shares the election period commenced on 15 april 2019 and closes at 1pm on 8 may 2019 subject to the aggregate nav of the continuing ordinary shares at the close of business on the last business day before the realisation date being not less than 50 million the ordinary shares held by the shareholders who have elected for realisation will be redesignated as realisation shares and the portfolio will be split into two separate and distinct pools namely the continuation pool comprising the assets attributable to the continuing ordinary shares and the realisation pool comprising the assets attributable to the realisation shares if one or more realisation elections are duly made and the nav of the continuing ordinary shares at the close of business on the last business day before the reorganisation date is less than 50 million the directors may propose an ordinary resolution for the winding up of the company and may pursue a liquidation of the company instead of splitting the portfolio into the continuation pool and the realisation pool currently the board does not know the number of shareholders or related shares who will take up the realisation opportunity based on the uncertainty of the offer and the fact that the assets of the company consist mainly of securities that are readily realisable whilst the directors acknowledge that the liquidity of these assets needs to be managed the directors believe that the company has adequate financial resources to meet its liabilities as they fall due in the foreseeable future and for at least twelve months from the date of this report and that it is appropriate for the financial statements to be prepared on a going concern basis given that the board believes the company will continue in existence post the realisation opportunity viability statement in accordance with provision c 2 2 of the uk corporate governance code april 2016 the uk code published by the financial reporting council in 2016 the board has assessed the prospects of the company over the three year period to 17 april 2022 the viability period on 20 march 2019 the company announced to offer all shareholders the right to elect during the election period to realise some or all of the value of their ordinary shares less applicable costs and expenses on or prior to the realisation date currently the board does not know the number of shareholders or related shares who will take up the realisation opportunity the board however believes that the company will continue in existence post realisation opportunity and considers that three years is an appropriate period of assessment of the viability of the company for the purpose of giving assurance to shareholders the board and the investment manager believe that the investment opportunity provided by the company remains compelling but the viability of the company is clearly contingent on the investment opportunity remaining in place a matter which the board monitors on an on going basis as the south korean preference shares held by the company trade at a discount compared with ordinary shares for the same companies the company remains attractive to long term investors over the viability period the board s assessment of the company over the viability period has been made with reference to the company s current financial position and prospects the company s strategy and risk appetite having considered the company s principal risks and uncertainties detailed below the board has also considered the company s likely cash flows and the liquidity of its portfolio it is noted that the company currently has no gearing though borrowing is permitted under its constitution in the event that the company did consider taking on debt the board would carefully assess the company s ability to meet the debt obligations as they become due it is possible to imagine a number of scenarios such as war or political events which could severely impact the liquidity of the company s investments the board has assumed that the regulatory and fiscal regimes under which the company operates will continue in broadly the same form during the viability period the board speaks with its broker and legal advisers on a regular basis to understand issues impacting the company s regulatory and fiscal structure the board considers the principal risks affecting the viability of the company are as follows notice period of investment manager the board has assumed that the investment manager will remain in place during the viability period however the board acknowledges the risk of the investment manager serving a twelve month notice period under the investment management agreement ima to mitigate this risk the board meets and communicates regularly with the investment manager to review its performance and the board s relationship with the investment manager failure of the custodian to carry out its obligations to the company the company s assets are held in accounts maintained by the company s custodian failure by the custodian to carry out its obligations to the company in accordance with the terms of the custodian agreement could have an impact on the viability of the company to mitigate this risk the board regularly receives reports from the custodian and through the management and engagement committee monitors the relationship with the custodian loss of license or listing the board has assumed that the company will retain its regulatory status and listing throughout the viability period the company secretary administrator and broker report to the board at least quarterly on regulatory matters and confirm compliance with listing and other regulatory requirements failure to implement and poor execution of the investment strategy the company maintains an investment policy as discussed in the summary information the policy states that the company must invest primarily in listed south korean preference shares and also states that investments in other types of securities are allowed as long as the investments track south korean companies or the south korean market as a whole failure to implement the investment strategy or poor execution by the investment manager would have an effect on the viability of the company the board ensures that the policy is being implemented in the quarterly board meetings where the investment manager presents reports to the board detailing the current portfolio and investment performance the risks specifically associated with the south korean economic and political climate are discussed in the investment manager s report based on the company s processes for monitoring operating costs the share price discount the investment manager s compliance with the investment objective asset allocation the portfolio risk profile liquidity risk and the robust assessment of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the company the board has concluded that there is a reasonable expectation that the company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the viability period to 17 april 2022 international tax reporting for purposes of the us foreign accounts tax compliance act the company registered with the us internal revenue

the board the board will determine whether an external search consultancy or open advertising is used in the appointments of non executive directors in the future remunerationcommittee in view of its non executive and independent nature the board considers that it is not appropriate for there to be a remuneration committee as anticipated by the uk code because this function is carried out as part of the regular board business a remuneration report prepared by the board is contained within the directors remuneration report directors remuneration is considered on an annual basis environmental policy due to the company s listing on aim the company is required to disclose its environmental policy but this is not applicable due to the nature of its operations internal controls the board is ultimately responsible for establishing and maintaining the company s system of internal controls and for maintaining and reviewing the system s effectiveness the company s risk matrix continues to be the basis of the company s risk management process in establishing the company s system of internal financial and reporting controls the risk matrix is prepared and maintained by the board which initially identifies the risks facing the company and then collectively assesses the likelihood of each risk the impact of those risks and the strength of the controls operating over each risk the company s system of internal controls is designed to manage rather than to eliminate the risk of failure to achieve the company s objectives and by the internal controls nature can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against misstatement and loss these controls aim to ensure that assets of the company are safeguarded proper accounting records are maintained and the financial information for publication is reliable the uk code requires directors to conduct at least annually a review of the company s system of internal controls covering all controls including financial operational compliance and risk management the board has evaluated the company s system of internal controls in particular it has prepared a process for identifying and evaluating the significant risks affecting the company and the policies by which these risks are managed the process has resulted in a low to medium risk assessment the board has delegated the management of the company s investment portfolio administration registrar and corporate secretarial functions which includes the independent calculation of the company s nav and the production of the audited annual report and financial statements whilst the board delegates these functions it remains responsible for the functions it delegates and for the systems of internal control formal contractual agreements have been put in place between the company and providers of these services on an on going basis board reports are provided at each quarterly board meeting from the investment manager administrator registrar and company secretary and a representative from the investment manager is asked to attend these meetings in common with most investment companies the company does not have an internal audit function all of the company s management functions are delegated to the investment manager administrator registrar and company secretary which have their own internal audit and or risk assessment functions the company s risk exposure and the effectiveness of its risk management and internal control systems are reviewed by the audit committee at its meetings and annually by the board the board believes that the company has adequate and effective systems in place to identify mitigate and manage the risks to which it is exposed principal risks and uncertainties in respect to the company s system of internal controls and reviewing its effectiveness the directors are satisfied that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the company including those that would threaten its business model future performance solvency or liquidity and have reviewed the effectiveness of the risk management and internal control systems including material financial operational and compliance controls including those relating to the financial reporting process and no significant failings or weaknesses were identified the principal risks and uncertainties which have been identified and the steps which are taken by the board to mitigate them are as follows investment risks the company is exposed to the risk that its portfolio fails to perform in line with its investment objective and policy if markets move adversely or if the investment manager fails to comply with the investment policy the board reviews reports from the investment manager at the quarterly board meetings with a focus on the performance of the portfolio in line with its investment policy the administrator is responsible for ensuring that all transactions are in accordance with the investment restrictions operational risks the company is exposed to the risk arising from any failures of systems and controls in the operations of the investment manager administrator and the custodian the board and its committees regularly review reports from the investment manager and the administrator on their internal controls the administrator will report to the investment manager any valuation issues which will be brought to the board for final approval as required accounting legal and regulatory risks the company is exposed to the risk that it may fail to maintain accurate accounting records fail to comply with requirements of its admission document and fail to meet listing obligations the accounting records prepared by the administrator are reviewed by the investment manager the administrator broker and investment manager provide regular updates to the board on compliance with the admission document and changes in regulation discount management the company is exposed to shareholder dissatisfaction through inability to manage the share price discount to nav the board and its broker monitor the share price discount or premium continuously and have engaged in share buybacks from time to time to help minimise any such discount the board believes that it has access to sufficiently liquid assets to help manage the share price discount the company s discount management programme is described within note 18 liquidity of investments the korean preferred shares typically purchased by the company generally have smaller market capitalisations and lower levels of liquidity than their common share counterparts these factors among others may result in more volatile price changes in the company s assets as compared to the south korean stock market or other more liquid asset classes this volatility could cause the nav to go up or down dramatically in order to realise its investments the company will likely need to sell its holdings in the secondary market which could prove difficult if adequate liquidity does not exist at the time and could result in the values received by the company being significantly less than their holding values the liquidity of the market for preferred shares may vary materially over time there can be no guarantee that a liquid market for the company s assets will exist or that the company s assets can be sold at prices similar to the published nav illiquidity could also make it difficult or costly for the company to purchase securities and this could result in the company holding more cash than anticipated furthermore it is possible that south korea could impose currency exchange or capital controls on foreign investors making it difficult or impossible for the company to repatriate funds the investment manager considers the liquidity of secondary trading in assessing and managing the liquidity of the company s investments the board reviews the company s resources and obligations on a regular basis with a view to ensuring that sufficiently liquid assets are held for the expected day to day operations of the company however if the company were required to liquidate a substantial portion of its assets at a single time it is likely that the market impact of the necessary sale transactions would impact the value of the portfolio materially fraud risk the company is exposed to fraud risk the audit committee continues to monitor the fraud bribery and corruption policies of the company the board receives an annual confirmation from all service providers that there have been no instances of fraud or bribery financial risks the financial risks including market credit and liquidity risks faced by the company are set out in note 20 of the financial statements these risks and the controls in place to reduce the risks are reviewed at the quarterly board meetings shareholder engagement the directors welcome shareholders views and place great importance on communication with the company s

e cigarette study a step further toward confirming risk reduction on march 14 2019 pmi presented the results from a study on e cigarettes at the 58th annual society of toxicology meeting in baltimore the study demonstrates that after six months e cigarette vapors with and without nicotine induced significantly lower biological responses associated with cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases than cigarette smoke this study which pmi believes is a first of its kind study on this subject matter assessed the biological response of mice exposed to e cigarette vapors compared with that of exposure to cigarette smoke background the combustion of tobacco produces over 6 000 chemicals of which almost 100 are identified as harmful or potentially harmful the overwhelming scientific evidence links the exposure to these chemicals rather than nicotine as the primary cause of smoking related disease therefore in recent years e cigarettes have been gaining popularity as a potential alternative to cigarettes currently however there are limited data on the long term disease risk profile of e cigarettes or their components compared with that of cigarette smoke in general e cigarettes consist of aerosol formers propylene glycol and or vegetable glycerin nicotine and flavor ingredients therefore the study is relevant for products that contain these components in contrast with cigarettes e cigarettes deliver nicotine without the smoke constituents that arise from the combustion of tobacco about the study this apoe mouse study was a six month inhalation study designed to assess the impact of exposure to e cigarette vapor with and without nicotine and flavor on the respiratory and cardiovascular systems female apoe mice were exposed to air cigarette smoke or three formulations of e cigarette vapors carrier pg vg water base carrier plus 4 nicotine test base plus flavors for three hours day five days week for six months via a whole body inhalation system the study measured a number of disease endpoints and the results indicate that after six months e cigarette vapor with and without nicotine and flavor resulted in lower levels of lung inflammation structural damage and molecular changes in the lungs and induced lower atherosclerotic plaque formation and molecular changes in aorta and heart tissue compared to cigarette smoke the study also detected an effect of nicotine on pulse wave velocity an expected effect of nicotine however when compared with cigarette smoke the effect was significantly less for e cigarette aerosol exposures with nicotine at comparable concentrations and without nicotine and overall the study demonstrated that e cigarette vapor induce significantly lower biological responses associated with cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases compared with cigarette smoke the full results of this study will be submitted for publication in a peer reviewed journal this preclinical mouse study does not pertain to a specific product but represents a toxicological assessment of an e vapor aerosol this study is part of pmi s larger scientific assessment program that includes aerosol chemistry toxicology and clinical studies with human subjects adding to the totality of evidence already existing for e vapor products as previously disclosed pmi plans to initiate a clinical study for its e vapor products to measure selected biomarkers of exposure to harmful or potentially harmful constituents and assess changes in clinical risk markers philip morris international delivering a smoke free future philip morris international

presented the results from a study on e cigarettes at the 58th annual society of toxicology meeting in baltimore the study demonstrates that after six months e cigarette vapors with and without nicotine induced significantly lower biological responses associated with cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases than cigarette smoke this study which pmi believes is a first of its kind study on this subject matter assessed the biological response of mice exposed to e cigarette vapors compared with that of exposure to cigarette smoke background the combustion of tobacco produces over 6 000 chemicals of which almost 100 are identified as harmful or potentially harmful the overwhelming scientific evidence links the exposure to these chemicals rather than nicotine as the primary cause of smoking related disease therefore in recent years e cigarettes have been gaining popularity as a potential alternative to cigarettes currently however there are limited data on the long term disease risk profile of e cigarettes or their components compared with that of cigarette smoke in general e cigarettes consist of aerosol formers propylene glycol and or vegetable glycerin nicotine and flavor ingredients therefore the study is relevant for products that contain these components in contrast with cigarettes e cigarettes deliver nicotine without the smoke constituents that arise from the combustion of tobacco about the study this apoe mouse study was a six month inhalation study designed to assess the impact of exposure to e cigarette vapor with and without nicotine and flavor on the respiratory and cardiovascular systems female apoe mice were exposed to air cigarette smoke or three formulations of e cigarette vapors carrier pg vg water base carrier plus 4 nicotine test base plus flavors for three hours day five days week for six months via a whole body inhalation system the study measured a number of disease endpoints and the results indicate that after six months e cigarette vapor with and without nicotine and flavor resulted in lower levels of lung inflammation structural damage and molecular changes in the lungs and induced lower atherosclerotic plaque formation and molecular changes in aorta and heart tissue compared to cigarette smoke the study also detected an effect of nicotine on pulse wave velocity an expected effect of nicotine however when compared with cigarette smoke the effect was significantly less for e cigarette aerosol exposures with nicotine at comparable concentrations and without nicotine and overall the study demonstrated that e cigarette vapor induce significantly lower biological responses associated with cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases compared with cigarette smoke the full results of this study will be submitted for publication in a peer reviewed journal this preclinical mouse study does not pertain to a specific product but represents a toxicological assessment of an e vapor aerosol this study is part of pmi s

as most of you reading this will know julian assange was recently dragged out of the ecuadorian embassy assange has long been subjected to ridicule and character assassination by the deep state owned mainstream media and for one reason it s the same reason they ve been wanting to snatch him up for so long it s because for years he has been sharing information that the global elite around the world did not want him to share he s been publishing information that threatens various elitist corporate and political interests around the globe as well as information showing just how much the public is deceived to lied to and manipulated in several different ways in order to justify actions that do not resonate with the majority of people on planet earth various media outlets have been silenced censored and have and their revenue streams taken away including us this is why we created cetv a platform to combat the censorship we are currently experiencing in episode 5 we go deep into assange s arrest i also recently published an article about his arrest and the truth behind his arrest what julian assange s arrest tells us about our world we ve published many wikileak leaks as well the latest one being a document exposing a secret us base on the moon if you can please support us and help us stay alive so we can continue sharing what we share the wikileaks files t wikileaks best price 4 18 buy new 6 95 as of 06 20 utc details i recently came across an article published on mintpress news it was written by whitney webb is who is a staff writer for mintpress news and has contributed to several other independent alternative outlets her work has appeared on sites such as global research the ron paul institute and 21st century wire among others she also makes guest appearances to discuss politics on radio and television she currently lives with her family in southern chile in her article she references a leaked military manual on unconventional warfare that was recently highlighted by wikileaks the u s army states that major global financial institutions such as the world bank international monetary fund imf and the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd are used as unconventional financial weapons in times of conflict up to and including large scale general war as well as in leveraging the policies and cooperation of state governments the rest of her article is posted below the document officially titled field manual fm 3 05 130 army special operations forces unconventional warfare and originally written in september 2008 was recently highlighted by wikileaks on twitter in light of recent events in venezuela as well as the years long u s led economic siege of that country through sanctions and other means of economic warfare though the document has generated new interest in recent days it had originally been released by wikileaks in december 2008 and has been described as the military s regime change handbook wikileaks recent tweets on the subject drew attention to a single section of the 248 page long document titled financial instrument of u s national power and unconventional warfare this section in particular notes that the u s government applies unilateral and indirect financial power through persuasive influence to international and domestic financial institutions regarding availability and terms of loans grants or other financial assistance to foreign state and nonstate actors and specifically names the world bank imf and the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd as well as the bank for international settlements bis as u s diplomatic financial venues to accomplish such goals the manual also touts the state manipulation of tax and interest rates along with other legal and bureaucratic measures to open modify or close financial flows and further states that the u s treasury s office of foreign assets control ofac which oversees u s sanctions on other nations like venezuela has a long history of conducting economic warfare valuable to any arsof uw campaign this section of the manual goes on to note that these financial weapons can be used by the u s military to create financial incentives or disincentives to persuade adversaries allies and surrogates to modify their behavior at the theater strategic operational and tactical levels and that such unconventional warfare campaigns are highly coordinated with the state department and the intelligence community in determining which elements of the human terrain in uwoa are most susceptible to financial engagement the role of these independent international financial institutions as extensions of u s imperial power is elaborated elsewhere in the manual and several of these institutions are described in detail in an appendix to the manual titled the financial instrument of national power notably the world bank and the imf are listed as both financial instruments and diplomatic instruments of u s national power as well as integral parts of what the manual calls the current global governance system furthermore the manual states that the u s military understand that properly integrated manipulation of economic power can and should be a component of uw meaning that these weapons are a regular feature of unconventional warfare campaigns waged by the united states another point of interest is that these financial weapons are largely governed by the national security council nsc which is currently headed by john bolton the document notes that the nsc has primary responsibility for the integration of the economic and military instruments of national power abroad independent but controlled though the unconventional warfare manual is notable for stating so openly that independent financial institutions like the world bank and the imf are essentially extensions of u s government power analysts have noted for decades that these institutions have consistently pushed u s geopolitical goals abroad indeed the myth of world bank and imf independence is quickly eroded by merely looking at the structure and funding of each institution in the case of the world bank the institution is located in washington and the organization s president has always been a u s citizen chosen directly by the president of the united states in the world bank s entire history the institution s board of governors has never rejected washington s pick this past monday it was reported that president donald trump nominated former bear stearns economist david malpass to lead the world bank malpass had famously failed to foresee the destruction of his former employer during the 2008 financial crisis and is likely to limit world bank loans to china and to countries allied or allying with china given his well established reputation as a china hawk in addition to choosing its president the u s is also the bank s largest shareholder making it the only member nation to have veto rights indeed as the leaked unconventional warfare manual notes as major decisions require an 85 supermajority the united states can block any major changes to world bank policy or the services it offers furthermore the u s treasury secretary former goldman sachs banker and foreclosure king steve mnuchin functions as the world bank s governor though the imf is different from the world bank in several respects such as its stated mission and focus it too is largely dominated by u s government influence and funding for instance the imf is also based in washington and the u s is the company s largest shareholder the largest by far owning 17 46 percent of the institution and also pays the largest quota for the institution s maintenance paying 164 billion in imf financial commitments annually though the u s does not choose the imf s top executive it uses its privileged position as the institution s largest funder to control imf policy by threatening to withhold its imf funding if the institution does not abide by washington s demands as a consequence of the lopsided influence of the u s on these institutions behavior these organizations have used their loans and grants to trap nations in debt and have imposed structural adjustment programs on these debt saddled governments that result in the mass privatization of state assets deregulation and austerity that routinely benefit foreign corporations over local economies frequently these very institutions by pressuring countries to deregulate their financial sector and through corrupt dealings with state actors bring about the very economic problems that they then swoop in to fix guaidó hits up imf given the close relationship between the u s government and these international financial institutions it should come as little surprise that in venezuela the u s backed interim president juan guaidó has already requested imf funds and thus imf controlled debt to fund his parallel government this is highly significant because it shows that top among guaidó s objectives in addition to privatizing venezuela s massive oil reserves is to again shackle the country to the u s controlled debt machine as the grayzone project recently noted venezuela s previous elected socialist president hugo chávez broke ties with the imf and world bank which he noted were dominated by us imperialism instead venezuela and other left wing governments in latin america worked together to co found the bank of the south as a counterbalance to the imf and world bank however venezuela is far from the only country in latin america being targeted by these financial weapons masquerading as independent financial institutions for instance ecuador whose current president has sought to bring the country back into washington s good graces has gone so far as to conduct an audit of its asylum of journalist and wikileaks publisher julian assange in order to win a 10 billion bailout from the imf ecuador granted assange asylum in 2012 and the u s has fervently sought his extradition for still sealed charges ever since when google met wikileaks assange julian best price 4 99 buy new 1 99 as of 01 25 utc details in addition last july the u s threatened ecuador with punishing trade measures if it introduced a measure at the un to support breastfeeding over infant formula in a move that stunned the international community but laid bare the willingness of the u s government to use economic weapons against latin american nations beyond ecuador other recent targets of massive imf and world bank warfare include argentina which awarded the largest imf bailout loan in history just last year that loan package was unsurprisingly heavily pushed by the u s according to a statement from treasury secretary mnuchin released last year notably the imf was instrumental in causing the complete collapse of the argentinian economy in 2001 sending a poor omen for last year s approval of the record loan package though it was released over a decade ago this u s coup manual recently highlighted by wikileaks serves as a salient reminder that the so called independence of these financial institutions is an illusion and that they are among the many financial weapons regularly used by the u s government to bend countries to its will and even overthrow u s disfavored governments

london the word disruption is often used in discussions on new technology that is changing the world order cryptocurrencies have disrupted the way we think about money and have evoked strong emotions in those who believe that bitcoin and the currencies that followed it heralds a new way of conducting financial transactions while opponents like dr nicholas weaver who has been studying the technology believes the entire space ought to be burnt down in a fire there was even a stronger reaction from yves mersch a member of the european central bank who likened cryptocurrency to a will o the wisp a malignant marsh dwelling creature that lured travellers from their path to their untimely death and a watery grave in a response to dr weaver s attack on bitcoin justin mccarthy a fintech specialist from ubu and project manager ricki allardice has used equally strong words in defending bitcoin saying weaver is another public intellectual who has chosen btc as a hill to die on and his arguments are flawed and incoherent one thing these commentators on cryptocurrencies appear to agree on is a creative use of language in their arguments linda van tilburg in response to cryptocurrency is cow poo by justin mccarthy and ricki allardice in an article published by biznews dr nicholas weaver attacked bitcoin btc and cryptocurrencies as technology that is deserving of being destroyed with fire i rebut many of weavers claims several of which are logically inconsistent and patently false the original interview was conducted on bloomberg with joe weisenthal and tracy alloway the primary concern raised by weaver is that btc doesn t work as a currency saying it cannot compete with payment networks such as paypal visa and mastercard and is significantly less efficient than these incumbent networks what weaver means by efficiency is unclear as he could be referring to the speed and ease of transferring value or to integration with other payment gateways it s clear that btc won t displace the incumbent networks as the payment processor of choice for the market any time soon but the network is only a decade old and the development of layer two solutions such as the lightning network are still in testing phases simply no serious btc enthusiast expects it to replace visa anytime soon this argument is perpetuated by btc denialists however it s important to note that btc is an alternative to the incumbent systems which gives users choice to send money privately quickly and cheaply to anyone who has a btc wallet without permission required this alone is a phenomenal milestone in the development of money and should be celebrated and because this alternative exists the incumbent systems are forced to be transparent as they now have competition from a system that plays by a different and immutable set of rules the inevitable destructive outcome of fiat monetary systems will eventually manifest as it always does combine this with dangerous central bank monetary policy of zero to negative interest rates essentially a monoculture across all developed nations and you have a plausible scenario where btc may become the currency of choice following a crisis just look at venezuela and even zimbabwe more importantly in the event of a global meltdown btc could become the global reserve currency overnight replacing the us dollar usd even without such a scenario the chances are increasing daily that btc will naturally migrate to the global reserve standard elaine ou financial institutions make people feel safe by hiding risk behind layers of complexity crypto brings risk front and center and brags about it on the internet weaver attests that btc is only beneficial to use over conventional payment networks if your interest is criminal activity a report published last year by the foundation for defense of democracies confirms that less than 1 of btc is used for illegal purposes enough said regarding btc acquisition weaver claims it is difficult because transactions are immutable immutability of the blockchain and the user experience offered by crypto exchanges are separate issues purchasing btc is as simple as opening an account on your local exchange e g luno transferring cash from your bank account via eft and purchasing btc if using reputable exchanges the scam risk is almost zero furthermore the suite of user options to purchase cryptocurrency range from simple to complex entry level users looking for simplicity over privacy versus advanced users who value their anonymity have various suitable options available weaver details the risk of being defrauded by fake crypto sales as something that even caught apple co founder steve wozniak out presumably this example was used as an emotional play to lead readers into assuming that if the founder of apple can t figure out how to buy btc what hope do i have unfortunately wozniak lost his money because he didn t make use of an escrow service this is nothing more than bad operational security on the behalf of woz the btc immutability is the most distinguishing feature of the protocol the fact that transactions cannot be reversed means that no central authority can bully btc users by blocking or reversing their transactions this creates an even playing field and a host of benefits for individual user sovereignty security is another concern raised by weaver he correctly points out that exchanges and devices can be hacked this happens regularly the reason exchanges are hacked is because they act as honey pots for hackers once again this highlights why decentralisation is so important exchanges hold large amounts of btc and fiat currency on behalf of their users so this custodial risk often leads to security breaches as hackers gain access to wallets connected to the internet the simplest way to avoid this is by keeping control of your private keys and keeping your btc on a hardware wallet such as a ledger or trezor device that is not connected to the internet btc allows individuals to become their own bank and just as banks have to secure client funds so the same applies to btc users this is a feature not a bug furthering the lack of security in cryptocurrency claim weaver postulates that open source projects which store their code on github may be subject to having code taken over by malicious actors however it is broadly accepted that open source projects have higher levels of security than those that make use of proprietary code as there are more eyes scrutinising it while it s true that a hacker managed to inject malicious code into an open source crypto wallet owned by bitpay the pros of utilising open source libraries far outweigh the cons this case serves as a warning to other wallet developers that they need to maintain constant scrutiny of their code regardless of how many contributors they have weaver made mention of hacking attempts by north korea it stands to reason that north korea would use btc if sanctions cut them off from using the usd which is a feather in the btc cap truth is btc protocol itself has never been hacked software deployed on top of btc such as wallets and exchanges are at risk and for this reason good personal operational security is required by all btc users weaver further claims that btc is used by hackers when extorting individuals as we saw during the wannacry virus saga of 2017 as well as drug dealers seeking anonymity by far the currency most used by criminals warlords drug dealers and gangsters globally is the usd recent revelations indicate that even commercial banks have been involved with laundering billions of dollars for mexican drug cartels money is nothing more than a tool and blaming it for criminal activity is as asinine as blaming butter knives for the spate of stabbings seen in london recently doubling down on his claim weaver questions how long before terrorists use btc to extort the public with bomb threats and drone strikes the same could be used against usd or other currencies weaver s unspoken assumption is that btc transactions are anonymous which they are not this is a slippery slope logical fallacy admittedly having btc sent to a wallet is simpler than collecting a suitcase of cash but spending it is also simpler this is why terrorists settle for cash they re motivated by other factors beyond btc a point made by weaver around price manipulation within crypto markets is valid since the markets are relatively small compared to other capital markets the ease and prevalence of manipulation is a concern that said as the market cap of btc grows the influence of individual malicious actors decreases concerns of manipulation in the gold and silver markets are present too with fingers being pointed at the large banks as being conspirators similarly george soros did damage to the pound in the early 1990 s this doesn t excuse crypto market manipulation but it does indicate that it is a constant threat across many capital markets small alt coins are more prone to massive price swings than btc due to market size but this comes with the territory of being an asset class that is only a decade old further weaver considers every initial coin offering ico securities fraud while there have been some ico scams there are many legitimate businesses too the ico model is a new method of raising capital with the advent of btc and later ethereum businesses can now raise capital from individuals worldwide at a fraction of the time and cost of conventional initial product offerings ipo s incumbents such as law firms and merchant banks who earn income from the existing ipo framework are not pleased with this but the ico model is disruptive decreasing the red tape involved in raising capital including investors who haven t been involved in stock market investing and increasing the efficiency of the overall system many ico s operate in good faith while developing the blockchain industry which is supported by a recent action of us lawmakers seeking to classify tokens as a separate asset class to securities while this has nothing to do with btc it illustrates the use case for btc in transferring value from anywhere without permission required weaver welcomes the crackdown of regulators on the cryptocurrency market but feels that they are reactionary rather than proactive furthermore he claims that the market has all but collapsed it s the nature of bureaucratic institutions to be reactive and regulators are almost always behind the curve as it s the nature of their role to his next point claiming that btc has collapsed refer to the chart below when speaking about equity markets it s commonly known that a five to ten year timeframe must be reviewed before drawing conclusions about the nature of average returns this is due to varying degrees of annual or bi annual variations in price btc is a volatile asset and as such it s good practice to view it over time when considering the valuation trend detractors often reference the bear market initiated in december 2017 when they claim that btc is dead evaluating btc trends shows the average rate of price growth is 1 per day relative to 1 january 2017 the btc price is still 500 higher as of mid april 2019 the same cannot be said for all alt coins but it s the nature of the free market many projects are destined for zero weaver downplays the point of censorship resistance which is a key feature of btc he claims that if you need censorship resistance then you can always use cash he does concede that moving sums of over 1 000 becomes tricky which indicates that he doesn t believe his own argument if you can t move large volumes of cash around without being censored by the banks at the behest of governments then cash doesn t really provide censorship resistance it s particularly distressing is that as of april 2019 the central banks of the eurozone bulgaria japan sweden denmark and switzerland have all implemented zero or negative interest rates this effectively taxes bank depositors on the capital they have on deposit with their banks the natural response to this would be to withdraw your cash and keep it in your safe at home as evidenced in japan recently the natural response of the banks and governments in these zero negative interest rate jurisdictions is thus to outlaw or remove cash by the admission of the international monetary fund on their blog deeply negative interest rates are only possible in a cashless society as depositors cannot withdraw their funds from the banking system this is a very chilling and dystopian future vision over the next five years we might see central banks rolling out crypto versions of their own sovereign currencies but this is nothing more than an attempt to drive societies cashless luckily we have btc the expensive cost associated with btc and cryptocurrency transactions was cited by weaver he claims that target gift cards are cheaper with a 4 fee it s true that in the peak of the 2017 bubble btc transactions were expensive largely due to network congestion since then numerous upgrades to the btc network have been made to drastically reduce these fees the most notable are segwit and the development of lightning network currently the cost of sending a bitcoin transaction for 100 at the most expensive rate is around 2 36 via the wallet provider jaxx liberty this fee is reduced if you re willing to wait a few more minutes alternatively transactions across the lightning network cost 1 satoshi which is substantially less than the 4 charged for sending a 100 target gift card furthermore the btc transaction cost remains essentially the same regardless of the value of the transaction traditional middlemen charge a percentage of the value of the transaction while crypto is a once off fee a good case in point is the first major lightning network transaction of 1m of btc which took seconds at a cost of just circa 0 02c weaver also makes the case for not holding onto btc long term as hackers will steal your coins and price volatility will destroy the value neither of these are true if you re worried about hacking secure your btc private keys in a hardware wallet if you re worried about short term price volatility convert your btc into a stable coin such as maker dai over the long term btc price trends upwards so keeping your money in btc is a good hedge against volatility also btc is inflation resistant tether was brought up by weaver referring to it as a criminal enterprise while tether has been central to much controversy the parent company has yet to be indicted that said many stable coin competitors are popping up and i expect tether s dominance to disappear quickly after weaver states that tether is effectively the achilles heel of the crypto industry and that if us regulators were to crackdown on blockchain enterprises they should do so by cracking down on tether this proves that centralisation creates honey pots ripe for regulatory entrapment the purpose of btc is to decentralise tether is currently a weak link but rest assured many blockchain developers are working on a decentralised solution to counter this the proof of work algorithm was attacked by weaver whereby he claims that it doesn t provide security against 51 attacks on small chains and that the cost of securing the btc chain is 5m per day his first claim is correct small chains with low hash rates are vulnerable to 51 attacks and this is the case with many smaller coins trying to be currencies they don t have the requisite security from a hash rate perspective to be as viable as currencies presently however this is not the case with the btc blockchain which is currently performing approximately 46 000 giga hashes per second this equates to approximately 821 000 antminer s17 mining units this is a large amount of hash power and thus security and would cost close to 1 8bn just to purchase the hardware the second claim about the cost of securing the network is an impossible calculation to make accurately in order to calculate the total electricity cost of the btc blockchain you d need to know what the individual electricity input costs of each mining farm are this data is simply not available this is a wildly inaccurate and irresponsible remark btc miners exploit areas with surplus electricity and or is faced by a distribution challenge this means btc miners buy excess electricity from producers who can t sell their power otherwise since btc mining is highly competitive the bulk of commercial miners purchase surplus electricity this way as they can obtain it very cheaply they tend to aggregate in areas with large excess power capacity mainly china india georgia and iceland the result is that using standard usa household electricity rates when calculating the cost of securing the btc blockchain over estimates the cost by orders of magnitude furthermore what the statistic does not indicate is that btc mining is a net gain for society as it uses power that would otherwise be wasted to go even further over 77 of all energy used in btc mining operations globally is sourced from renewable energy sources should a malicious actor wish to attack the network they d need to purchase electricity at standard rates since it is presumable that most cheap electricity is already being utilised by btc miners the cost to attack the network is far greater than the cost of securing it which is compounded by the fact that an attacker would need to have a larger amount of hash power than all other miners combined just to alter the last block mined this misinformation was taken further when weaver insinuated that btc could enter a mining death spiral if the price of the btc token does not increase soon this is not true firstly while the price of btc has dropped from near 20 000 to 5 000 since december 2017 more than three times the amount of hash power has been allocated to mining so it is obvious that there is no imminent mining death spiral moreover if the btc price drops fewer miners will mine as their fixed costs are greater than their profits made from mining this effect is compounded by the difficulty adjustment algorithm taking two weeks before adjusting difficulty downwards at which point the price has dropped more and mining difficulty needs to be adjusted downwards again so the cycle continues until there are no miners left in reality this is not the case as this argument fails to take human action into account when bitcoin price drops some miners switch off their mining rigs because they are no longer profitable this is specific to every miner as they all have different input costs as miners leave the mining pool those who remain effectively gain a larger share of the mining pool without having to spend any additional resources and profitability goes up this ensures that hash rate doesn t drop weaver s argument assumes that btc nodes will stand idle while watching btc die which won t happen the rules of btc can be changed as long as consensus is reached between all parties thus in the death spiral scenario the btc community might implement a change in the protocol which causes the difficulty retargeting algorithm to be implemented every three days instead of every two weeks for instance addressing the problem caused by a delay in difficulty retargeting either way this scenario is unlikely to occur and positive incentives are built into btc to combat this in closing it appears weaver is another public intellectual who has chosen btc as a hill to die on many like him have built their reputations on btc denialism but their arguments are flawed and incoherent btc provides an alternative to billions of people who may yet choose to opt out of the conventional financial system or at the very least aid in keeping the incumbent system honest justin mccarthy ceo co founder and

but also is helping spur a bond market rally the us 10 year yield is pulling back after the test on the 2 60 area the germany 10 year bund yield has been halved today to four basis points the us dollar is mostly firmer with the yen the notable exception among the majors news that turkey has used dollar swaps to boost reserves has weighed on the lira which is trading at new lows investors cheered the reelection of wadodo for a second term in indonesia local stocks and the rupiah are firmer asia pacific after being spun for weeks with nearly daily claims of progress the media is now reporting that a us china trade deal is close the new signal is that a couple more rounds of negotiations are all that it may take and that trump and xi can meet at the end of may may 27 us lighthizer will go to beijing at the end of the month and then vice premier liu will return to the us in early may separately despite the recent batch of chinese data appearing to show a recovery there is talk about more stimulative measures australia reported better than expected employment data but the australian dollar has not found much love and is holding near yesterday s lows australia created more jobs than expected 25 7k vs 15k and these were all full time positions 48 3k and the february fall was revised nearly away 1 7k vs 7 3k the participation rate increased and this saw the unemployment rate tick up to 5 0 from 4 9 separately the flash pmi was mixed manufacturing slowed to 51 from 52 while services rose to 50 5 from 49 3 the composite poked back above the 50 boom bust to 50 6 from 49 5 next week australia s q1 cpi will be reported it is expected to have softened after briefly rising through 0 7200 yesterday the australian dollar is near 0 7160 near midday in europe the employment data has not dissuaded the market from looking for a rate cut which is priced in by the end of q3 there is an a 1 1 bln option at 0 7175 that expires today support is seen in the 0 7140 0 7150 area the weakness in equities and slippage in yields has buoyed the yen though its flash pmi remained below 50 for the third month 49 5 vs 49 2 the dollar made a fresh low for the week just below jpy111 80 with 2 bln in options struck at jpy112 00 jpy112 10 the upside looks to be blocked but the market does not appear to have given up on it the dollar broke below cny6 70 yesterday on the back of the better than expected data optics but has bounced back above it today and at cny6 7040 it is virtually unchanged on the week europe the euro has been sold on the disappointing flash pmi earlier in the

the composite rose to 50 from 48 9 the aggregate pmi for the eurozone was weaker than that implied by german and french numbers and this likely reflected deterioration in the periphery the aggregate manufacturing pmi edged up to 47 8 from 47 5 while the service pmi fell to 52 5 from 53 3 both were weaker than expectations the composite fell to 51 3 from 51 6 uk retail sales surged in march the 1

stephen moore and herman cain the two recent nominees to the federal reserve board of governors have in the past suggested returning to a gold standard although moore now says he favors merely consulting a broad range of commodity prices as leading indicators in response a number of recent op eds criticized the idea of reinstating a gold standard the critics unfortunately show little theoretical understanding of the mechanisms by which a gold standard works and consult no evidence about how the classical gold standard worked in practice i don t seek to defend the nominees who i think are poor choices on other grounds that have been enumerated by will luther and i don t seek here to answer many common criticisms of the gold standard since i have tried to do that here and here i want to focus on one novel criticism it stems from imagining that a gold standard regime works like our present regime in the sense that the central bank uses a short term interest rate target to steer the economy toward its long run goal the only difference is that the central bank pursues a constant dollar price of gold rather than another nominal goal like a gradually rising price level or nominal income path thus a washington post reporter matt o brien declares that a gold standard is a disaster and might be the worst guide to setting policy that he sees the gold standard as a guide to setting policy already signals a misconception o brien comes to the disaster conclusion by starting from the false premise that the wild price volatility of today s demonetized gold tells us how volatile the price of gold would be under an international gold standard absent domestic central bank action to offset that potential price volatility he supposes the central bank would have to undertake wild and often inappropriate swings in its interest rate policy if you look at the track record of the classical gold standard however you don t find such wild central bank policies in the united states you don t even find a central bank in a classic article on econometric policy analysis a critique the nobel laureate monetary economist robert e lucas enunciated what has come to be known as the lucas critique the critique warns us against assuming that a statistical relationship observed under one policy regime would persist under a different policy regime under the regime of the classical gold standard a newly minted us 10 dollar coin contained 48375 troy ounces of gold alternatively put the gold definition of the dollar equated 1 troy oz of gold to 20 67 the dollar price of gold in the us did not vary from that par value except within the narrow band around parity set by the cost of shipping gold in or out estimated at less than 0 33 of par value despite the absence of offsetting central bank policy matt o brien s view is inconsistent with the historical record of the classical gold standard where did o brien get his initial false premise and its incorrect implication about monetary policy under a gold standard he refers to a piece by the economist menzie chinn on the blog econbrowser that asks the question what would it take to implement cain s gold standard interest rate wise as its title suggests chinn s piece takes it for granted that a gold standard is implemented by having a central bank adjust interest rates as necessary to maintain a constant nominal price of gold this is an odd conception of a gold standard because as already noted the united states didn t have a central bank while it was on a gold standard before 1914 the mechanism for maintaining the dollar gold parity was something quite different the redeemability of dollar deposits and banknotes for gold coin or bullion and international transfers of gold enabled the quantity of money to adjust endogenously to bring about monetary equilibrium at the given parity the redemption was performed mostly by private commercial banks before 1914 with the founding of the federal reserve which opened in 1914 and after the 1933 mandate that all commercial banks and individuals turn in their monetary gold to the federal government the right to redeem dollar denominated claims to gold could now be exercised only by foreign central banks and only against the us treasury the decentralized automaticity of the classical international gold standard was gone and central banks ruled the roost in the mid 1960s president johnson began restricting foreign redemption of dollars and in 1971 president nixon ended it since then the dollar price of gold has been free to fluctuate as the public hedges against fiat money inflation and speculates about a variety of other risks chinn s piece does not look at the classical gold standard period in the us he plots data on the dollar price of gold only from 1968 to the present then regresses the dollar price of gold during that non gold standard period on a short term treasury bond yield in disregard of the lucas critique he then quite remarkably draws conclusions about the working of a gold standard he writes stabilizing the price of gold in us dollars requires adjusting the interest rate akin to how the exchange rate is managed return to the gold standard would imply that the fed funds rate would have to be about 15 percentage points higher than it was in january 2000 in order to keep the dollar s value stable at january 2000 levels a rate 18 percentage points higher than actually recorded in march 2019 chinn s estimate of the required fed funds rate is based on the coefficients produced by his regression of recent gold prices on a treasury yield rate he reports the following point estimate of the relation between the log price of gold and the real 3 month treasury yield estimated over the 1968m03 2019m02 period pgold 6 423 10 210 fedfunds he infers from the negative sign that the fed can raise interest rates to lower the price of gold to maintain a constant dollar gold parity he then supposes the fed must raise interest rates its only policy tool considered to offset what would otherwise be a rise in the dollar price of gold but that is plainly not how the parity is or was maintained under a gold standard as conventionally defined or as historically experienced rather the parity is maintained by redeemability of dollars into coined gold at the defined par rate the dollar money stock endogenously adjusts either via the price specie flow mechanism a la david hume or via goods arbitrage a la mccloskey and zecher until it is consistent with the quantity of money demanded at the defined parity chinn s idiosyncratic conception of how a gold standard works is inconsistent with at least two historical facts first as a recent working paper by christopher hanes shows the bank of england which did vary its discount rate to manage gold flows never had to raise its rate above 7 percent during the classical period 1880 1913 there is nothing remotely like a 20 percent rate to be seen second as already noted the united states maintained a fixed dollar gold parity over the same span without any central bank a central bank varying an interest rate policy target obviously cannot be the key to explaining how the us maintained a fixed dollar gold parity before 1914 having a central bank adjust the interest rate can hardly be a requirement for keeping the dollar at its defined par value with gold although there is no central bank policy rate to track the observed range of rates on prime commercial paper in the united states remained between 3 percent and 6 5 percent during 1888 1914 as shown in a published paper by gene smiley the lucas critique may not always be pertinent criticism as found by a paper that professor chinn has cited but the critique provides a highly relevant warning against extrapolating from the behavior of the dollar price of gold under our current fiat regime to the behavior of the dollar price of gold under a gold standard regime as already noted the dollar price of one troy ounce of gold does not vary under a gold standard except within the very narrow band between the gold import and export points rather the dollar sticks to its definition in terms of gold due to redemption and equilibrating money flows if one were to repeat chinn s exercise with data from the classical gold standard regressing the log dollar price of gold on a constant plus the real 3 month treasury rate i venture to predict that he would find very different coefficients namely the constant would be the log of 20 67 and the coefficient on the treasury rate would be zero whatever the demerits of stephen moore and herman cain as potential federal reserve governors the working of a gold standard should not be misunderstood or misrepresented as part of the argument against them as tyler cowen has noted one of the nominees chief shortcomings is their loyalty to a president who gives partisan monetary policy advice whereas a great merit of an automatic gold standard system is that it provides a barrier against partisan manipulation of money both supporters and critics of the nominees should make a real effort to study the self adjusting mechanisms and track record of the classical gold standard before they absurdly proclaim it a disaster george selgin and i have explained why redemption by private commercial banks constrained by competition and the rule of law is more reliable than redemption by monopolistic bodies with sovereign immunity
on march 29 2019 the office of the united states trade representative ustr published its annual national trade estimate nte report on foreign trade barriers which highlights significant foreign barriers to u s exports u s foreign direct investment and u s electronic commerce this year s nte report comes at an important time as the trump administration has been vocal about its view that current trading arrangements have permitted widespread unfair treatment of the united states including by its largest trading partners the administration has shown that it is willing to address such issues through negotiation for example it has recently proposed formal negotiations with japan and the eu is in the midst of bilateral negotiations with china and has completed a renegotiation of the north american free trade agreement with canada and mexico at the same time the administration also has been willing to take aggressive unilateral actions in response to perceived unfair treatment causing significant commercial disruptions and frictions in the global trading system these developments have generated significant interest in the administration s views and priorities with respect to the trade policies of the united states major trading partners this report aims to shed light on these issues by reviewing key developments in this year s nte with respect to major us trading partners namely china japan the european union canada mexico brazil and korea china the 2019 nte lists a multitude of longstanding us concerns about china s trade and industrial policies which seek to limit market access for imported goods foreign manufacturers and foreign services suppliers while offering substantial government guidance resources and regulatory support to chinese industries it also identifies several new us concerns and highlights the trump administration s recent efforts to obtain the elimination of certain chinese practices through the unilateral actions it has taken against china under section 301 of the trade act of 1974 we discuss these issues below new developments in the 2019 nte the report highlights several new developments over the last year that are of concern to the united states including the following e commerce china s new e commerce law which entered into force in january 2019 allegedly introduced provisions that weaken the ability of rights holders to protect their rights online and that make it more difficult for chinese electronic commerce platforms to be liable for selling counterfeit and other infringing goods china s new e commerce

banks but in practice china has maintained restrictions that do not allow for significant non chinese competition in commercial banking activities foreign suppliers also allegedly have been unable to secure licenses to supply electronic payment services in china under a licensing process that china established in 2017 following an adverse wto ruling and have had similar difficulties with respect

that action by imposing retaliatory tariffs on us goods however the report does not reference directly the ongoing bilateral negotiations between the united states and china regarding the issues raised in the section 301 investigation and other issues other alleged barriers the report also describes a wide range of longstanding us concerns about china s trade policies and economic model that

agriculture china remains a difficult and unpredictable market for u s agricultural exporters largely because of inconsistent enforcement of regulations and selective intervention in the market by china s regulatory authorities china s regulators fail to routinely follow science based international standards and guidelines bilateral negotiations as noted above the report does not reference directly the ongoing bilateral negotiations between the united states and china in which the united states is seeking chinese commitments to eliminate not only the policies identified in the section 301 investigation but other alleged trade barriers discussed in the nte for example the united states reportedly is seeking commitments from china related to digital trade services e g electronic payments motion pictures and cloud computing and various agriculture issues e g biotechnology approvals however the extent to which these issues will be addressed in a potential us china agreement remains unclear and other key trade frictions highlighted in the nte undoubtedly will remain the nte notes that the trump administration is pursuing other avenues to address such issues e g by working with the eu and japan to identify further effective action and potential rules that could address problematic subsidies practices not currently covered by existing obligations japan the report highlights a range of barriers to goods and services trade with japan including in areas such as agriculture and automotive trade that are likely to be central to forthcoming bilateral fta negotiations in addition to discussing longstanding issues identified in previous iterations of the nte this year s report introduces new sector specific issues aligned with the trump administration s stated trade priorities we discuss the most significant issues highlighted in the report below new developments in the 2019 nte ustr notes several new or exacerbated regulatory challenges that it sees as negatively impacting us companies competitiveness relative to their japanese counterparts including i changes to the reimbursement pricing system adversely affecting us medical devices and pharmaceuticals companies ii newly noted tariffs of 3 5 percent to 10 percent on certain fish and seafood products iii new concerns relating to government procurement procedures including that technical specifications are selected to exclude us products and services or direct procurements towards a specific japanese company iv a potentially problematic geographical indications law and v the

the international monetary fund imf has once again cut its global growth forecast for 2019 in its new semi annual world economic report the organization now projects a 3 3 growth rate down from the 3 5 it predicted in january 3 7 in october and 4 a year ago key reasons for the downward revisions the u s china trade war and the potential for a disorderly brexit added to those concerns is a general tightening of monetary policy globally particularly the spate of interest rate increases in the u s imf chief economist gita gopinath wrote that with 70 of the global economy seeing a slowdown in growth it is a delicate moment right now what might strike some as the relatively small size of the recent decreases in the imf s forecast belies the large impact such cuts in growth can bring on the ground to people and businesses particularly in countries already struggling that could easily be tipped into a recession at the same time it s worth noting that each of the imf concerns has been partly ameliorated more recently the immediate brexit risk has been pushed back by a deadline extension to october the outlook for the u s china trade war at this moment at least looks more sanguine and the fed has clearly become more dovish making further rate increases this year unlikely and raising the possibility of a rate cut plenty of concerns about the world economy nevertheless remain a recent collapse in global trade is the worst since the financial crisis and as steep as during the recession of the early 2000s notes this report from the telegraph citing figures from the cpb netherlands bureau for economic policy analysis the report pointed out that global trade has fallen 1 8 in the three months to january compared to the preceding three months the article added however that markets seemed to be recovering in early 2019 thanks to reports that the u s and china appear closer to a trade accord long term concerns meanwhile there are many reasons for concern over the longer term prospects for global growth and even the newly revised imf forecast is too optimistic said ashoka mody former deputy director of the imf s research and european departments and joao gomes a wharton finance professor in the short term both expect slower growth than the imf projects though neither sees a u s recession as likely up until 2020 at least but they noted that beyond the immediate trouble that lower global economic growth would bring is a more pervasive long term drift towards slower growth driven by mega trends such as china s reaching economic maturity and settling into a much slower growth rate and aging populations in many of the world s richest economies especially china and europe the two experts made their comments on the knowledge at wharton radio show on siriusxm listen to the podcast at the top of this page according to mody who is a visiting professor of international economic policy at princeton university the world has been on a secular declining growth rate path that matters because there have been brief periods when we lift off from that downward trend and those brief periods are essentially driven by china the overarching problem now however is that china itself is trending towards slower growth rich countries do not grow perpetually at 7 to 8 therefore the chinese growth rate has to come down for mody the question is not whether china s economic growth will slow but how fast it will happen and whether it can manage that without a crisis china occasionally pumps up its economy but the resources to do so are thinning out i expect that in the second half of 2019 and certainly the early part of 2020 the chinese economy will continue to slow world trade will continue to slow he said rich countries do not grow perpetually at 7 to 8 therefore the chinese growth rate has to come down ashoka mody gomes agreed that china is an economic fulcrum for much of the world along with the u s when china s economy slows it s a real problem for virtually most of latin america and africa mostly because of lower commodity exports and investments the strong downward effects on many countries such as australia have long been noted and then there s the auto manufacturers in europe that really depend on china and china s market a lot of the slowdown in europe has been tied to the trade wars and the prospects of the slowdown in china and what exactly the chinese consumers have access to now gomes said added to the risks in europe are the new threats by the trump administration to slap 11 billion in tariffs on various eu imports because of subsidies to the european aerospace behemoth airbus just hours later the eu was preparing retaliatory tariffs on some 12 billion worth of u s products based on similar claims of subsidies to boeing both sides have been arguing over subsidies for nearly 15 years and now the world trade organization has ruled that cases on both sides have at least some merit the u s and the eu have asked wto arbitrators meantime to approve appropriate countermeasures europe bears the brunt according to mody the biggest impact from china s slowdown will be in europe because trade is so important to the region it s being felt in germany which looks to be nearing a recession he added italy already is in recession with china slowing the sugar high of tax breaks already wearing off in the u s and europe completely dependent on world trade i m not able to see what the major sources of growth are mody suggested that the imf forecast is too high and we may end this year closer to just 3 and therefore be in a somewhat dire situation particularly in countries like italy which are very precariously balanced right now we live in a world where we re getting older and productivity is slowing down if you take a 10 to 20 year outlook we are going to slow down that s just a fact joao gomes longer term should growth in china slow to 3 to 3 5 a year then world trade will drop to 2 5 to 3 annually that is catastrophically low for eu countries italy will be in almost permanent recession with its huge financial burdens we have the making of a crisis now i m not quite clear how we can avoid that mody noted that in his book euro tragedy a drama in nine acts i call italy the fault line in europe that fault line has been steadily deepening italy is now in recession my view is that it is now on the threshold of a financial crisis and could get tipped over at any time if you drew a checklist of factors that cause a financial crisis italy has all of them what s more various european safety nets designed to save ireland and greece are not adequate to help italy whose sovereign debt is similar in size to the debts of germany and france gomes added we live in a world where we re getting older and productivity is slowing down if you take a 10 to 20 year outlook we are going to slow down that s just a fact i think everything you see on the horizon is negative gomes like mody does not see any obvious sources of strong growth in the near term certainly none with the strength to reverse the trend the ecb european central bank has no room for monetary policy anymore mody pointed out i think that is very important to understand in terms of the big possibility of monetary stimulus it has nothing left to give anymore the same is true for fiscal policy he adds gomes agreed that europe is the most vulnerable part of the world to recession right now the question is how do you solve this and really none of us knows that s the honest truth

the real effective exchange rate reer may sound arcane to non economists but it is one of the most important international financial indices the reer is a summary index that tracks the difference in the prices of goods produced by a country and its trading partners other things being equal an increase in a country s reer indicates a loss of trade competitiveness and rising current account imbalances are often associated with deviations in the reer from equilibrium values given the reer s importance for economic policy in the current trade discussions between the united states and china for example central banks and international financial institutions devote considerable resources to calculating and analysing it but their methods have become outdated as global value chains gvcs become increasingly widespread we therefore recently proposed a new reer calculation with zhi wang that addresses the current shortcomings illustration by binay sinha standard calculations of the reer by most central banks and statistical agencies assume that countries export only final goods but gvcs spread the different stages of production among different countries they can do so thanks to technological improvements lower trade barriers and the closer integration of emerging markets into the global economy ignoring this reality can lead to substantial mismeasurement of the reer resulting in questionable policy inferences to see how the standard approach could be wrong consider a hypothetical value chain for the production of smartphones suppose japan manufactures the components and ships them to china where the phones are assembled and exported globally as finished products traditional reer models would assume that japan exports final goods to china and that the two countries are competitors a depreciation of the japanese yen therefore would help japan s competitiveness and hurt that of china in this case however a weaker yen would lower the price of japanese components which may lead to lower prices and increased demand for chinese phones leading to an improvement in china s competitiveness this example shows that the standard reer calculation is getting not only the magnitude wrong but also the direction of change our proposed framework addresses these problems it also provides reer measures for individual sectors within a country this makes it possible to assess the competitiveness of different parts of the economy and to determine which sectors are the main drivers of the overall reer taking gvcs into account alters our understanding of china s bilateral real exchange rate against the us dollar china has increased its global trade footprint massively following its accession to the world trade organization in 2001 the us meanwhile has long blamed its rising current account deficit on the renminbi s allegedly undervalued exchange rate although china s gross exports to the us are sizeable china operates largely downstream in several gvcs this is exemplified in the production of smartphones and electronic goods as a result a large part of chinese exports represents value added embedded in parts and components from other countries besides china including a significant share coming from the us itself moreover us competitiveness relative to china depends more on prices in tradable sectors such as electronics than on those in non tradable parts of the economy like real estate but commonly used aggregate measures of the reer do not allow for these distinctions once these factors are taken into account our analysis shows that china s real exchange rate against the us dollar displays a pronounced and consistent appreciation trend by contrast the standard calculation shows a real depreciation of the renminbi in the period leading up to china s abandonment of its exchange rate peg in 2005 and then an exchange rate appreciation that is smaller than the traditionally measured one graph 1 similarly for the eurozone our gvc exchange rate based measure implies that greece s loss of competitiveness or reer appreciation relative to germany was worse than the standard measure suggests and that greece s competitiveness in the period leading up to the eurozone crisis was thus worse this mismeasurement arose because the standard reer calculation was based on the extent to which germany s inflation rate differed from greece s but it underestimated the difference made by gvcs graph 2 far from being a theoretical concept confined to economics textbooks the reer has significant real world relevance calculating it more accurately could reduce the risk of misguided economic policies and it may lead policymakers to reach some very different conclusions about which measures to pursue patel is an economist at the bank for international settlements wei a former chief economist of the asian development bank is professor of chinese business and economy and professor of finance and economics at columbia university 2019 project syndicate

a noticeable shift has taken place on wall street and among many economists and business leaders in recent weeks fears of an imminent recession have faded and been replaced with cautious optimism especially about 2020 a trend that bodes well for president donald trump as he seeks re election the international monetary fund is a good example it made headlines last week when it slashed its global growth forecast to the lowest pace since the financial crisis but it is not as gloomy as it sounds the imf also predicted a rebound for later this year and slightly stronger growth next year for the world economy which should be a positive for the united states the imf isn t alone in its optimism the u s stock market had one of its best starts to the year since 1998 and is now within striking distance of hitting an all time high goldman sachs says the likelihood a recession in the next year has been cut in half to 10 percent there s a plausible story to tell that explains why this optimism has taken root it goes like this a u s china trade agreement looks likely the chinese economy appears to be stabilizing and the federal reserve and other central banks have shown they will do whatever it takes to keep this expansion going many of the major fears that drove the stock market down at the end of last year and caused anxiety about a u s and global recession by 2020 have subsided instead of a recession some are now talking about an upside surprise in which the u s economy could grow faster than expected especially if businesses start to spend more as trump s trade war cools and the fed doesn t raise interest rates almost no independent expert thinks the economy will achieve above 3 percent growth in 2019 and 2020 as the white house predicts but most forecasters are now in the 2 to 2 5 percent range for 2019 and about 2 percent for 2020 good enough to keep unemployment low and wages rising at a robust pace how the economy fares in spring 2020 is likely to play a large role in trump s re election chances according to election experts like larry sabato of the center for politics at the university of virginia the best guess now is that the economy in early to mid 2020 won t be the huge growth trump likes to boast about but there s a decent chance it will be doing well enough to give him an edge if unemployment is still 3 5 to 4 percent and gas is still 2 75 and the stock market is still near a record high then the economy is probably at the president s back or at least not a headwind said mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics if you plug that scenario into our election model trump wins or it s close u s companies continue to hire at a robust pace and wages are rising including for lower skilled workers which should make americans comfortable enough to keep spending the housing market is showing signs of a rebound another indication that people are still confident about the economy and their finances china a nation trump often berates is providing a boost to the global and u s economies by stimulating its own the world s second largest economy said wednesday that growth was 6 4 percent in the first quarter slightly better than expected and a sign that china has stabilized despite the trade war but not all is well the u s manufacturing sector has had a noticeable slowdown this year and business and consumer sentiment while still high by historical levels is down from where it was a few months ago trump has repeatedly blamed the fed especially chairman jerome powell for dragging the economy down by raising interest rates too quickly last year the fed raised interest rates a full percentage point but economists investors and business leaders no longer see the fed as a worry after powell indicated that the central bank is on hold and unlikely to raise rates again this year trump has yet to remove any tariffs he has put in place even the steel and aluminum tariffs on canada and mexico which he said were a bargaining tactic did not change after the revised north american free trade agreement nafta was finished last fall all of the optimism about the economy assumes the u s china trade conflict is rolled back and mr trump doesn t start imposing auto tariffs on the eu and asia said joseph brusuelas chief economist at accounting firm rsm heather long is an economics correspondent for the washington post
this article appears in the april 19 2019 issue of executive intelligence review what is americaâ s national credit can we use it for real economic growth part 2 of a two part series april 5â with the enactment of the legal tender act of 1862 and the banking acts of 1863 and 1864 the united states had a national paper currency for the first time in a generationâ over 600 million created as a war emergency action being a debt of the nation to its people the new currency helped the union borrow nearly five times that much to fight the civil war that nearly 3 billion in new national credit made available was backed in turn by about 600 million in new broad based taxation as ways and means chairman elbridge g spaulding explained see part 1 the new taxes essentially paid ordinary non war government expenses and the interest on the new debt during the war the debt itself the principal was held by patriotic citizens and institutions who had taken it for a 20 year period and could use the â greenbackâ portion of the debt as money we have seen that the tremendous u s economic expansion which actually began during the civil war made the next generationâ s repayment of the debt with much greater tax revenue easy this was treasury secretary alexander hamiltonâ s principle that a public debt is a public blessing if invested to advance new productive capacity new invention new productivity and if the means for its future payment were assured it was stated in his 1791 â report on the public debtâ to congress the treasuryâ s making credit available by printing legal tender paper currency was a successful innovation of the lincoln republicans the principle is still valid now reorganizing banking chairman spaulding and other followers of alexander hamiltonâ s economicsâ that is to say virtually all lincoln republicansâ thought that a national paper currency for all uses should issue through a national bankâ not from the government the treasury not only would such a bank avoid excessive printing of new money to pay ordinary government bills it couldâ essentiallyâ take that currency back from private banks around the country which engaged in usury or pure speculation the congressional debates recounted in spauldingâ s book show that it was a great leap for these lincoln republicans including spaulding to legislate printing of the new legal tender paper currency directly by the treasury in fact secretary salmon chaseâ s stated reason for declining to issue a firm statement supporting the legislation when spaulding needed it was the lack of a national bank to control it mathew brady elbridge g spaulding the private banks particularly those of new york boston and philadelphia were of great concern they were state chartered poorly capitalized and engaged in speculations ranging from mild to wild those republicans who opposed issuing a legal tender currency argued that the union government should instead borrow by issuing bonds directly â on the marketâ â i e to those banksâ while imposing very large new taxes to pay them off the congressional debates recorded in the book make clear that spauldingâ a banker himselfâ speaker thaddeus stevens and other republicans understood that bank speculation would cut a worse and worse discount off the governmentâ s bonds with every new borrowing effectively squandering huge new tax revenues on banks not soldiers spaulding was unusual in also forecasting that the civil war could be lengthy and absorb spending on an unheard of scale the private banks were nowhere near being able to fund the debt required here the â glass steagall principleâ of bank regulation emerged for the first time the lincoln administrationâ s banking actsâ which took effect on january 1 1863 and january 1 1864â effectively compelled banks to acquire federal charters which required that they buy treasury bonds and hold them as their own capital reserve and allowed them to issue treasury notes as their own currency and they prohibited chartered banks from securities speculation and broker dealing no attempt to make the nationâ s credit available on a large scale for national purposes can work without such glass steagall break up and regulation of private banks to carry the nation rapidly forward given the success of greenbacks under such conditions no one can claim that the united states treasury today cannot issue even trillions in new treasury notes greenbacks to â make the national credit availableâ for building a new economic infrastructure or other crucial purposes if done properly it will set off neither runaway inflation nor other economically damaging effects and will be for the government â a debt to future generations â as lyndon larouche often said second chairman spauldingâ s example has in common with our present time the magnitude of the value requiredâ then to fight the war now to build a new high technology basic economic infrastructure while replacing much of the deteriorated old one what is that magnitude loc note that the approximately 600 million of new currency issued by the union government during the civil warâ greenbacks and new â national bank currencyâ â was nearly double the total amount of currency in circulation in the united states including the slave states before the war congressman spaulding noted a new york state appeals court decision in early 1864 on the legality of the greenbacks as legal tender we take note of the fact that to maintain armies and provide a navy for the prosecution of the war more money is needed annually than all the specie within the united states and that a resort by the government to the use of its own credit was not only a matter of necessity but the result has demonstrated that it was a measure of prudence and wisdom the facilities for carrying on the business of the country as they existed before the war were still necessary to carry on that business and could not safely be withdrawn from it and a new currency national in character and to some extent a new financial system must be created to meet the new and enlarged demands of the war as in the case of unionâ s need for currency in the civil war years compared to the total currency in circulation before that war americaâ s current need for investment in new infrastructure manufacturing invention and productivity is huge compared to its currency in circulation it is not huge compared to what the real economic activity of the country could be but that is exactly the reason these investments are urgent all realistic estimates of the national credit that must be mobilized for basic economic infrastructure investments are in the multiple trillions the relatively conservative american society of civil engineers creates annual â report cardsâ which do not deal with new infrastructure technologies like nuclear desalination and propulsion high speed and mag lev rail or fusion technologies but only with restoring and upgrading the nationâ s existing basic economic infrastructure yet the society estimates 2 4 trillion must be invested in just five years a very short time in economic terms other serious evaluations which incorporate from 50 to 100 significant projectsâ and not even the most ambitious onesâ are in the 3 5 trillion range up to 8 trillion by one of chinaâ s state investors who wished to invest in infrastructure renewal in america the shadow of a magnitude compare to the magnitude of these needed investments of any â crash programâ to rebuild americaâ s real economic mind and muscle the dollar currency in the u s economyâ in circulation in checking accounts in time savings accounts of various types or in the capital reserves of banks it totals about 3 9 trillion according to the federal reserve including the fedâ s money printing in its â quantitative easingâ and bank bailout programs and just as e g spaulding pointed out regarding the civil war currency cannot be withdrawn wholesale from its current uses into an entirely new campaign to renew the national economic infrastructure nearly three times that much dollar money supply exists outside the united statesâ the result of our having lost control of the creation of dollars to the london centered â offshoreâ financial system from the 1960s on so to fund the great new â warâ on deindustrialization obsolescence infrastructure breakdown and disaster either create a national bank or credit institution that can succeed in bringing significant overseas dollar based liquid assets back to the united states combining them with domestic assets and directing them into the most productive investments or let the treasury print very large issues of new treasury notes and so direct them and there is no economic reason why the treasury could not or should not do this to move the most transformative and productive projects forward immediately as chairman spaulding wrote then they â will carry the nation so rapidly forward in power and resources that nothing need prevent the government from paying the last dollar of the debt incurredâ from the economic progress of the next generations directing the credit as soon as congress had authorizedâ with president lincolnâ s signature on february 25 1862â the treasuryâ s printing of the greenback currency as legal tender the government had masses of war bills waiting to be paid with it to soldiers contractors shipbuilders arms companies teamsters and so on there was no difficulty in directing where this new national credit would go it would go to fund mobilizing and fighting the war moreover chairman spaulding was confident that the great majority of the greenbacks could be quickly borrowed again from the public if 20 year treasury bonds with 6 interest were offered in exchange for greenbacks and he was proven correct this was called in the act â fundingâ the greenbacks the â loan without interestâ greenbacks was interchangeable with a â loan with interestâ the bonds obviously this enabled the union government to spend the funds a second time and in a still more directed manner this time it committed itself to pay interest and repay the principle if demandedâ in 20 years in addition to 440 million in greenbacks under president lincolnâ s and secretary chaseâ s plan treasury bonds in larger denominations were issued to banks which bought and held them as capital in order to obtain federal chartersâ the nationâ s first national banking system another 200 million in new currency called by spaulding â bank currency â was issued later in the war by treasury through these banks which were under a â glass steagallâ principle of regulation barred from securities broker dealing and speculation this currency kept expanding after the civil war as credit for the extraordinary infrastructural industrial and productivity expansion over the next generation and other forms of new credit were issued down to short term government promissory notesâ in total 2 8 billion spaulding computes on the new taxes â enough money was realized from these sources to pay the ordinary expenses of the government and all the interest on the war debt â but just 300 million of the 2 8 billion war debt principal was repaid by 1868 the ensuing industry technology boom paid itâ easily thus the new national credit multiplied the 600 million in new taxes by five times those elected officials and organizations today who are proposing to enact new taxes and just spend the revenue on new infrastructure are ignoring the credit of the nation made available successfully in previous crises consequently their proposals fall far short of the urgent need some in the 1862 congress including some of lincolnâ s party so feared issuing a legal tender paper currency as to propose taxing for the entire cost of war borrowing some on wall street with whatever â haircutsâ wall street would impose that 2 3 billion in war taxation would have crushed the unionâ s economy fortunately for the nation spaulding and others who understood â the credit of the nation â prevailed direction by the fedâ to wall street the federal reserve bank which prints americaâ s currency now directs its issuance of that currency very preciselyâ to the largest private banks for the purpose of building their capital reserves and their liquidity even far in excess of what is required by regulation these banks unfettered by any glass steagall regulations use their excess reserves as the basis for speculation the fed has printed more than 4 trillion in new currency since the 2008 crash directed to this purposeâ even including the reserves and liquidity of london and european banks the chair and governors of the fed a â reserve bankâ for banks say this is their charterâ s mandate it is of no use to the u s physical economy this is what fed supporters call its â independenceâ from the federal governmentâ s purposes if the fed were instructed by congress to issue trillions in currency for any sort of infrastructure investments it would fight this to keep using its control of currency to control interest rates and to feed liquidity reserves to money center banks and the fed would still be run by major bankers bank traders and academic economists with no expertise in investing credit in productive high technology new infrastructure worse the technologies it would be funding in some â green new dealâ are low energy density expensive facilities which can litter the land anywhere and will lower the technological level of the economy it would be lending the new federal reserve notes to hundreds of state and community banks newly created for the haphazard â greeningâ of locales lowering productivity of industry and agriculture unsupported by productivity increases or tax revenue this new 2 trillion could trigger rapid inflation as larouche warned â disaster would ensueâ from fed control of such a chaotic currency issuance worse the promotors want to reduce the human population to â save the planet â a national credit institution congress and the president have to direct the issuance of national credit to those investments which cause the greatest increase in productivity in the economyâ in new basic infrastructure and in revolutionary technologies like plasma processes fourth generation fission and fusion this must include protective infrastructure particularly against storm and floodâ productivity increase emphatically includes ending the senseless repeated loss of many lives and tens of billions in wealth from flooding rivers that could be managed and storm surges that could be stopped by new infrastructure the treasury now can issue new credit and currency to agencies or authorities specifically tasked with carrying out missions of new infrastructure or crash programs of science and technology research and development a new reconstruction finance corporation modelled on president franklin rooseveltâ s rfc can organize this process but lincolnâ s administration combined the direct issuance of treasury credit as new greenback notes with the issuance of treasury notes through a system of federally chartered commercial banks essentially capitalized with treasury bonds a new bank of the united states can be created by congress capitalized both by the treasury and by private holders of treasury securities a key advantage it can bring back into new infrastructural investment some of the dollar based liquid assets held overseasâ recall that three quarters of dollar holdings are abroad that bank can be the instrument to multiply many times the tax revenue assigned to it to pay interest or dividends on the long term capital subscribed or loaned to it it will enable the issuance of new currency on a large but controlled scale through this bank it will operate as a large commercial bank funding projects and technologies including in partnership with other major nationsâ national credit institutions therefore it must be run by directors and staff experienced in scientific and construction projects as well as in banking and it must operate in cooperation with private banks under glass steagall regulation

205 264 4551 use of non gaap financial measures management uses pre tax pre provision income non gaap and adjusted pre tax pre provision income non gaap as well as the adjusted efficiency ratio non gaap and the adjusted fee income ratio non gaap to monitor performance and believes these measures provide meaningful information to investors non interest expense gaap is presented excluding certain adjustments to arrive at adjusted non interest expense non gaap which is the numerator for the efficiency ratio non interest income gaap is presented excluding certain adjustments to arrive at adjusted non interest income non gaap which is the numerator for the fee income ratio adjusted non interest income non gaap and adjusted non interest expense non gaap are used to determine adjusted pre tax pre provision income non gaap net interest income and other financing income gaap on a taxable equivalent basis and non interest income are added together to arrive at total revenue on a taxable equivalent basis adjustments are made to arrive at adjusted total revenue on a taxable equivalent basis non gaap which is the denominator for the fee income and efficiency ratios regions believes that the exclusion of these adjustments provides a meaningful base for period to period comparisons which management believes will assist investors in analyzing the operating results of the company and predicting future performance these non gaap financial measures are also used by management to assess the performance of regions business it is possible that the activities related to the adjustments may recur however management does not consider the activities related to the adjustments to be indications of ongoing operations regions believes that presentation of these non gaap financial measures will permit investors to assess the performance of the company on the same basis as that applied by management tangible common stockholders equity ratios have become a focus of some investors and management believes they may assist investors in analyzing the capital position of the company absent the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock analysts and banking regulators have assessed regions capital adequacy using the tangible common stockholders equity measure because tangible common stockholders equity is not formally defined by gaap or prescribed in any amount by federal banking regulations it is currently considered to be a non gaap financial measure and other entities may calculate it differently than regions disclosed calculations since analysts and banking regulators may assess regions capital adequacy using tangible common stockholders equity management believes that it is useful to provide investors the ability to assess regions capital adequacy on this same basis the calculation of the fully phased in pro forma common equity tier 1 cet1 is based on regions understanding of the final basel iii requirements for regions the basel iii framework became effective on a phased in approach starting in 2015 with full implementation beginning in 2019 the calculation includes estimated pro forma amounts for the ratio on a fully phased in basis regions current understanding of the final framework includes certain assumptions including the company s interpretation of the requirements and informal feedback received through the regulatory process regions understanding of the framework is evolving and will likely change as analysis and discussions with regulators continue because regions is not currently subject to the fully phased in capital rules this pro forma measure is considered to be a non gaap financial measure and other entities may calculate it differently from regions disclosed calculation a company s regulatory capital is often expressed as a percentage of risk weighted assets under the risk based capital framework a company s balance sheet assets and credit equivalent amounts of off balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories the aggregated dollar amount in each category is then multiplied by the prescribed risk weighted percentage the resulting weighted values from each of the categories are added together and this sum is the risk weighted assets total that as adjusted comprises the denominator of certain risk based capital ratios cet1 capital is then divided by this denominator risk weighted assets to determine the cet1 capital ratio the amounts disclosed as risk weighted assets are calculated consistent with banking regulatory requirements on a fully phased in basis non gaap financial measures have inherent limitations are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited although these non gaap financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company they have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under gaap in particular a measure of earnings that excludes selected items does not represent the amount that effectively accrues directly to stockholders management and the board of directors utilize non gaap measures as follows

spanish banks expanded aggressively into emerging markets to flee the consequences of the euro debt crisis by don quijones spain uk mexico editor at wolf street ubs has alerted that spanish banks outsized exposure to latin american markets could serve as a source of contagion for future crises 80 of the eurozone s total banking exposure to the region is channeled through spain whose banks have around 384 billion of counterparty claims in the region a shock in emerging and developing markets could also drag down the eurozone economy ubs said spanish banks exposure to latin america is equivalent to around 30 of spain s gdp and leaves both the country and the eurozone susceptible to contagion effects from a crisis emerging in any of the major contingent economies the authors of the report themis themistocleous and ricardo garcía warn this is the second time this year that ubs has warned about the health of spanish banks in january the basel based lender made waves by slashing the price targets of all spanish lenders citing two main concerns spain s slowing economic growth which combined with the rising likelihood of never ending zero interest rates in the eurozone could negatively impact the banks margins which combined with the rising likelihood of never ending zero interest rates in the eurozone could negatively impact the banks margins spanish banks low capital ratios most spanish banks including giant santander have capital ratios below the minimum 12 level set by the ecb what s more costly litigation continues to pose a big risk to spain s banking sector including the pending sentence of the european court of justice on the legality of spain s irph mortgage reference index which according to goldman sachs analysts could alone cost spanish lenders between 7 billion and 44 billion depending on the outcome with such low capital ratios it s not clear how the sector will be able to absorb any significant negative impact warns ubs now ubs has thrown into the mix the contagion risk posed by spanish banks huge exposure to latin america s fragile economies it s not the only one who s raised concerns about this risk at the end of 2017 the imf warned in an assessment of spain s financial sector that the significant international presence of the country s biggest banks while providing welcome diversification effects may also have significant implications for inward and outward spillovers the share of financial assets abroad has grown continuously for the spanish banking sector with the largest international exposures by financial assets concentrated in the united kingdom the united states brazil mexico turkey and chile most worrisome of all is spain s banking exposure to latin america s two mega economies brazil and mexico in brazil spanish banks had total exposure to the economy of 150 billion in the third quarter of 2018 down slightly from 161 billion in the first quarter according to bis data it s still the equivalent of 47 of total foreign banking investments in the country we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us for banco santander brazil is by far its biggest market accounting for 26 of its global operating profits compared to just 17 for spain the spanish too big to fail lender also plans to expand its presence in mexico by acquiring the remaining listed shares of its mexican subsidiary worth just over 2 5 billion according to el país the bank wants to take advantage of the high interest rates in mexico currently at 8 compared to 0 in the eurozone as well as the galloping credit growth available in the market in 2018 alone santander mexico increased its lending by 16 in mexico spanish banks already have over 160 billion invested in the economy which represents 42 of total foreign banking exposure this time it s bbva that is doing the heavy lifting through its subsidiary bbva bancomer the largest bank in mexico it provided 45 of bbva s group profits in 2018 across latin america from argentina and chile to peru and colombia spanish banks are far and away the most invested in fact it s no overstatement to say that as goes latin america so goeth spain s banking system for the moment most of latin america s biggest economies with the obvious exception of argentina and venezuela are doing quite well crucially both the brazilian real and the mexican peso are bearing up fairly well this year despite the rallying dollar but economic headwinds are brewing in both countries in february brazilian economic activity contracted by the most in nine months prompting analysts to revisit earlier projections of 3 growth for this year a similar thing is happening in mexico where a sharp increase in violence and uncertainty over the future of the state owned oil giant pemex are taking a big toll on economic sentiment and activity both the imf and the bank of mexico have slashed growth forecasts for this year from 2 1 to 1 6 but the most immediate emerging market risk for spanish banks is half a world away in turkey where a repeat of last year s crisis could be in the making as a maelstrom of political geostrategic economic and financial pressures buffet the country the unemployment rate reached a near decade high this week while the lira slumped to a six month low against the dollar between the first and third quarters of 2018 as the last turkish crisis roared spanish banks slashed their exposure to the turkish economy by around a quarter from 82 billion to 62 billion but they re still much more exposed than any other foreign banks and the risks in turkey are not going away any time soon if things do kick off again on the anatolian peninsula the biggest risk for foreign banks operating there such as spain s bbva italy s unicredit holland s ing and the uk s hsbc is that turkish borrowers begin to default en masse on foreign currency loans which account for a staggering 40 of the turkish banking sector s assets and no bank is as exposed to such a risk as bbva which has already lost over 60 of its 6 9 billion investment in turkey as a result of the plunging lira and the plummeting shares of its turkish subsidiary turkiye

kmi earnings call for the period ending march 31 2019 kinder morgan inc kmi 0 16 q1 2019 earnings call 4 30 p m et contents prepared remarks questions and answers call participants prepared remarks operator welcome to the quarterly earnings conference call at this time all participants are in a listen only mode until the question and answer session of today s conference operator instructions this call is being recorded if you have any objections you may disconnect at this time i would now like to turn the call over to mr rich kinder executive chairman of kinder morgan thank you you may begin richard d kinder executive chairman of the board thank you jennifer before we begin as usual i d like to remind you that today s earnings releases by kmi and kml and this call includes forward looking and financial outlook statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 the securities exchange act of 1934 and applicable canadian provincial and territorial securities laws as well as certain non gaap financial measures before making any investment decisions we strongly encourage you to read our full disclosures on forward looking and financial outlook statements and use of non gaap financial measures set forth at the end of kmi s and kml s earnings releases and to review our latest filings with the sec and canadian provincial and territorial securities commissions for a list of important material assumptions expectations and risk factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated and described in such forward looking and financial outlook statements as usual before turning the call over to steve kean and the rest of the team i would like to provide a quick update and some insight on our financial philosophy at kinder morgan the important news today is that our board has increased the dividend by 25 from 0 20 per quarter or 0 80 annualized to 0 25 per quarter or 1 annualized now this is consistent with our intention which we announced in mid 2017 to increase the dividend to 0 80 in 2018 to 1 in to 2019 and to 1 25 in 2020 central to our ability to do this is the strong and growing cash flow our assets are generating and you will see that again in the first quarter s results we have used that cash to get our balance sheet in shape having paid off over 8 billion of debt and received credit upgrades from both s p and moody s and we intend to maintain our improved credit metrics beyond that we are now focusing on using our cash to fund our expansion capex without need to access the equity market to pay our increasing dividends and repurchase stock when appropriate in short we believe we are being careful and conservative stewards of our cash flow and using it in ways that benefit all our shareholders you should expect no less of us and should be reassured by the fact that the management and board of kmi are significant shareholders steve steven j kean chief executive officer and director yes thanks rich we ll be updating you on both kmi and kml this afternoon i am going to start with a high level update and outlook on kmi then turn it over to our president kim dang to give you the update on our segment performance david michels kmi s cfo will take you through the numbers dax sanders will update you on kml and then we ll take your questions on both companies the summary on kmi is this we are adhering to the principles that we have previously laid out for you we have a strong balance sheet having met our approximately 4 5x target of debt to ebitda and with ratings upgrades from both moody s and s p we re maintaining our capital discipline through our return criteria a good track record of execution and by self funding our investments we are returning value to shareholders with the 25 dividend increase announced today and we continue to find an attractive growth opportunity with a net add of 400 million to our backlog during the quarter again strong balance sheet capital discipline returning value to our shareholders and finding additional growth opportunities those are the principles we operate by here are a few updates on some of the key projects first our permian natural gas pipeline project our customers are anxious to have us get their gas out of the permian so they can also get their oil and ngls out we have two projects to get the gas out gulf coast express and permian highway each are about 2 bcf a day of capacity both are secured by long term contracts and both are in execution stage gcx is scheduled to be in service in october of this year with permian highway following a year later both projects are on schedule both projects have attractive returns which we expect to realize and both projects bring us additional opportunities in our downstream pipeline combined they bring 4 bcf a day of incremental gas to a system that moves about 5 bcf a day today those projects will bring opportunities for downstream expansion and optimization as we find homes for that incremental gas through our connectivity with lng facilities mexico exports utility demand and texas gulf coast industrial and petchem demand our execution and our economics on these projects both look good and we re actively managing our risks and opportunities on both these projects show us taking advantage of a very positive situation that is this there is a large supply growth at texas and a large demand growth in texas and we can bridge the two and connect to our premier texas intrastate pipeline network and stay entirely within the state of texas which facilitates permitting and commercial flexibility as we pointed out at the conference in january of this year 70 of the demand growth between now and 2030 is projected to be in louisiana and texas largely due to lng and our systems are well positioned to benefit from that also it s worth noting that now 70 of our backlog is natural gas and 56 of that is in our midstream group where market based rates in terms of service prevail on another key project elba our lng facility that we re building in savannah georgia we are closing in on the in service date for the first unit we now expect in service of that unit to be around may 1 a couple of weeks from now getting the first unit on secures about 70 of the project revenue the delay we ve experienced is certainly unwelcome but the risk allocation between us our contractor and our customer provides significant production and mitigates the effect to our irr so we re introducing natural gas into the facility as well as refrigerants in that process it s been going well also of note we added a net 400 million to the backlog this quarter with new investments in natural gas and terminals primarily more than offsetting projects placed in service the backlog now stands at 6 1 billion a few observations about our expansion capital investments over time as several people have asked how we re doing on the capital we deploy in those projects so at the january conference kim took you through our historical project performance if you look at page 49 of what we provided there you ll see a comparison between project ebitda multiples and actual performance for the projects completed during the 2015 to 2018 period you ll see that our actual performance was better than our original estimate 5 8x versus 6 1x in the original estimate you will also see that the story is even better in natural gas which makes up the bulk of our backlog as i said where we came out at 5 2x versus the original estimate of 5 8x on page 50 you will also see some other factors that partially offset the contribution from a project investment but overall project performance was very good the point here is we are very careful with your capital we don t swing at every pitch we definitely have our hits and misses but we have shown that in aggregate we do well we get there by having elevated return criteria well above our cost of capital we focus on projects that we understand and primarily focus on expansion off of our existing footprint all of this helps us invest in returns that are well above our cost of capital and helps overcome the inevitable curve ball that come up during project execution this has served us well particularly during an increasingly challenging regulatory environment next an update on 501 g as we said in our press release monday of last week we have reached settlements on two more systems epng and tgp which now resolve a vast majority of our 501 g exposure this is an overhang that we now believe we have nearly entirely behind us to settlements that are pending at the commission right now here s our observations the commission generally approves negotiated settlements so they are pending before the commission but we expect that they will be approved and two they respect existing settlements including rate moratoria that are in place the 501 g overhang has been a consistent part of the dialogue around our stock and we are pleased with our resolution of it i believe we have said this before but when we announced the budget we did not have anything in for settling 501 g matters but we telegraphed that if we did get such settlements it would likely be a good thing for the value of the company and we are happy with the outcome finally before turning it over to kim a word about the kml process as we say in the release the process is ongoing we don t have anything more than that to say at this point and as you will hear when we get to kml we have been attentive not only to the process but also to managing and developing existing business it s comprised of a very good set of midstream assets it gets a good deal of effort and focus from our management team but what i want to say from a kmi investor standpoint is that you need to keep in mind that while this while the process gets a lot of attention kml makes up about 2 of kmi ebitda on a consolidated basis so to just put it in perspective for kmi and with that i ll turn it over to kim kimberly allen dang president and director okay thanks steve so looking at the segment natural gas had another outstanding quarter it was up 12 if you look at the market fundamentals they remain very strong for 2019 lower 48 natural gas demand is expected to increase by 5 5 bcf to approximately 95 bcf a day and the lower 48 production is expected to increase by 7 5 bcf a day growth in the natural gas markets in the first quarter is driving very nice results on our assets transport volumes on our transmission pipes increased approximately 4 55 bcf a day or 14 this is the fifth quarter in a row in which volumes have exceeded the comparable prior period by 10 or more if you look on the demand side deliveries to lng facilities off of our pipes were almost 1 5 bcf a day in the quarter that s an increase of approximately 900 million cubic feet a day versus the first quarter of 2018 power demand on our system for the quarter was down slightly primarily due to warmer weather exports to mexico were up almost were up 183 million cubic feet to 3 2 bcf a day which is a 6 increase versus the first quarter of 2018 on the supply side production out of key out of the key basins we continues that we serve continues to increase if you look at the permian natural gas wellhead volumes increased approximately 30 the bakken natural gas wellhead volumes increased about 31 and the haynesville they increased 29 and in eagle ford they increased 8 if you look at where these volumes showed up on our transmission pipes epng volumes were up 1 1 bcf a day primarily due to permian volume wic volumes were up 900 million cubic feet a day and cig volumes were up approximately 550 million a day both due to growth in the dj basin kml kmla volumes were up 570 million cubic feet a day primarily due to lng exports on our gas gathering assets volumes were up 21 or 570 million cubic feet a day driven by the production increases that i mentioned in the haynesville in the eagle ford and the bakken overall the higher utilization on our system systems a lot of which came without the need of significant capital resulted in nice bottom line growth in the quarter and longer term as our systems fill up will drive nice expansion opportunity if you look at the longer term by 2024 the natural gas market is projected to grow to almost 110 bcf a day driven by increases in power generation lng and mexico exports and continued industrial development with most of that supply growth expected to come out of the permian the haynesville and the marcellus on our product side on the product segment it was down slightly in the quarter we had increased contribution from our southeast refined products assets calnev and our bakken crude assets that were more than offset by lower contributions from kmcc volumes on kmcc were actually up 16 in the quarter but that was more than offset by lower rates overall crude and condensate volumes were up 8 refined product volumes in the quarter were flat from the terminals business it was up modestly in the quarter the liquids business which accounts for about 80 of the segment was driven by strength in the houston ship channel and on our base line terminal expansion project in edmonton these increases were slightly were offset by the increased lease expense at our edmonton south terminal and that became a third party obligation post the trans mountain sale we added 1 4 million barrels of tankage versus the first quarter of 2018 due to the base line project coming online bringing our total leasable capacity to almost 92 million barrels the bulk business in our terminal segment was roughly flat our co2 segment was down in the quarter and that s primarily due to lower crude and ngl prices but also to slightly lower production oil production volumes our net realized crude oil price was down about 11 per barrel and ngl prices were down about 4 per barrel net crude oil production was down approximately 1 200 barrels a day or 3 due to lower production at katz and goldsmith katz and goldsmith are two of our smaller fields and account for roughly 10 of our overall production on these in these fields since we are not implementing new development projects we would expect a continued decline over time on the other hand at sacroc which is our largest field and accounts for well over 60 of our production we continue to find attractive projects the co2 sales and transport business was up slightly in the quarter due to about 5 higher co2 volume co2 prices were essentially flat that s it for the segment overview and i ll turn it over to david david patrick michels vp and chief financial officer thanks kim so today we re declaring a dividend of 0 25 per share up from 0 20 per share last quarter and in line with our budget to declare 1 per share for the full year 2019 as rich mentioned this would be a 25 increase over 0 80 per share compared to 2018 kmi had a good quarter we grew significantly from last year s first quarter and we overcame a number of items to end the quarter in line with our budget we generated dcf per share of 0 60 which is 2 4 times our declared dividend or over 80 million 800 million in excess of that dividend additionally as the press release points out for the full year 2019 we forecast our dcf to be on budget and that is even after incorporating the approximately 50 million impact from our announced ferc 501 g settlement so very nice overall performance from our underlying business turning to the earnings page revenues were in line with the first quarter of 2018 but operating income was higher due to lower quarter over quarter costs net income available to common stockholders for the quarter were 556 million which is a 15 increase from the first quarter of last year that includes the benefit of euro preferred dividend payments down from 39 million we paid last year in the quarter as a result of the conversion of our preferred equity securities in october of last year adjusted earnings per share was up excuse me was 0 25 up 0 03 or 14 from the prior period very nice growth there moving on to distributable cash flow we believe distributable cash flow is a good reflection of our cash earnings and it was up it was 0 60 per share for the quarter up 0 04 or 7 from q1 of 2018 natural gas segment was the largest driver of that growth up 127 million or 12 as is the as has been the consistent theme for that segment recently we benefited on multiple fronts tgp benefited from multiple expansion projects placed in service in 2018 epng was up driven by permian supply growth more than offsetting the unfavorable impact from the ferc 501 g settlement in the quarter texas and louisiana gathering and processing assets were up driven by increased volumes from the haynesville and eagle ford basins kinder morgan louisiana pipeline was up due to the sabine pass expansion our product segment was down 4 million our terminal segment was up 2 million our co2 segment was down 48 million or 20 and kim covered the drivers behind those segments performance for the quarter kinder morgan canada was down 46 million from q1 2018 as a result of the sale of our trans mountain asset our g a expense was lower by 6 million due to greater amounts of costs to capitalize the growth projects as well as lower g a resulting from the trans mountain sale those items were partially offset by the by higher pension expenses in the quarter and those pension expenses are non cash and are backed out of our dcf metric and replaced with actual cash contribution excluding the higher pension costs g a our g a would have been 16 million lower than q1 2018 interest expense was 14 million lower driven by lower debt balance and lower average rate on our bonds as well as greater interest capitalized to our growth projects that was partially offset by higher libor rates which impacted the interest rate swaps we settled in the quarter our preferred stock dividends were down 39 million as i mentioned before so total dcf of 1 371 billion was up 124 million or 10 from the prior period and to summarize the main changes greater segment ebda of 38 million when you include the nci change which relates to the segment generated from greater natural gas contributions offset by lower contributions from co2 in canada 14 million lower interest expense 16 million lower g a expenses excluding the non cash pension expense and 39 million lower preferred stock dividend which gets you to 107 million of the 124 million increase in the quarter dcf per share of 0 60 was again up 0 04 or 7 with the same drivers as total dcf but inclusive of the incremental shares issued as a result of the preferred stock conversion moving onto the balance sheet once again we have two net debt to ebitda figures listed at the bottom of the table at year end 2018 kmi s balance in our adjusted net debt figure included all of the kml excuse me trans mountain sales proceeds and the adjusted net debt figure excludes the portion of those proceeds that was paid to the kml public shareholders in early january beyond year end 2018 there is no difference between the net debt and adjusted net debt figures we ended the quarter at 4 6 times debt to ebitda which is consistent with our budget and slightly higher than year end 4 5 times our end of year 2019 leverage is currently forecasted to be 4 6 times which is slightly unfavorable to our plan of 4 5 times but is consistent with our long term leverage target of approximately 4 5 times the slightly higher than budget year end leverage is due to slightly lower than planned ebitda the recent ebitda is forecasted to be slightly below budget but while dcf is expected to be on budget is because of the add backs of non cash pension expenses below ebitda and ebitda does not pick up the benefit of our favorable interest expense some items to note on the budget changes from year end a cash reduction of 3 1 billion due to 1 3 billion used to pay down kmi bonds maturing in the quarter 800 million distribution to public kml shareholders 340 million of canadian taxes due to the trans mountain sale and almost 300 million of lower revolver and cp borrowings in other assets 700 million of the 712 million increase is due to booking a right to use asset resulting from a new lease accounting standard the offsetting liabilities and short term and long term liabilities include 647 million which are in long term liabilities which explains most of the increase of the 618 million in other liability in our short term and long term debt changes in short term that was mainly due to the pay off of the 1 3 billion of bonds and 700 million of other bonds which rolled into the short term category and out of the long term category our adjusted net debt ended the quarter at 34 8 billion which is an increase of 668 million from year end and to reconcile that we generated 1 371 billion in dcf we spent approximately 750 million in growth capital and contributions to our joint ventures we paid approximately 450 million of dividend we paid 340 million of taxes on our trans mountain sale and we had a working capital use of cash of approximately 500 million the largest item in that are greater interest payments in the quarter bonus payments payroll and property tax payments with that i ll turn it back to steve steven j kean chief executive officer and director okay now we are going to turn to kml and at kml again we realize the burning question here is the process we previously announced and which as we said today remains ongoing and we should have an update for you in the coming weeks all we have to say at this point about the process is in the press release but clearly we will have more to say once we have something to announce in the meantime as you will hear from dax and as we have said all along we ve got a good business here that we continue to operate and invest in as a stand alone business and we re in a good position of not being forced to do anything so we ll work through the process and we will have we believe a conclusion in the coming weeks and let you know more about it at that time with that i ll turn it over to dax dax a sanders executive vp and chief strategy officer thanks steve before i get into the results i do want to update you on a couple of general business items on the announced diesel export project we received our required air permit amendment and key building permit and satisfied a key condition process in the customer s contract as such we can now commence construction activities and plan to do so in may consistent with previous statements this is an approximately cad43 million project that contemplates two new distillate tanks with combined storage capacity of 200 000 barrels underpinned by a 20 year take or pay contract that we expect to put in service during the first half of 2021 on the shed 6 ph reactivation project that we have discussed we expect to get our key building permits shortly which will allow us to start construction in may also and have the project inserted in december 2019 as a reminder the total capex on that project is approximately 8 million now moving toward the results and of note as i talk to the results i m generally only going to reference results from continuing operations as discontinued ops only relates to prior period and is less relevant today the kml board declared a dividend for the first quarter of 0 1625 per restricted voting share or 0 65 annualized which is consistent with previous guidance earnings per restricted voting share for continuing operations for the first quarter of 2019 or 0 12 and that is derived from approximately 21 million of income from continuing operations which is up approximately 7 million versus the same quarter in 2018 revenue increased across most all of kml s assets and was led by the contribution for the base line tank and terminal assets coming online but was partially offset by the expiration of a third party contract on esrp which we have previously discussed the increase in revenue was partially offset by higher g a and depreciation total dcf from continuing operations for the quarter is 22 4 million which is down about 1 million from the comparable period in 2018 that reflects coverage of approximately 1 million and reflects the dcf payout ratio of approximately 85 the coverage and payout ratio this quarter are skewed by the large cash tax amount of almost 21 million which is 14 million higher than the almost 7 million in the comparable period last year as we previously discussed we were not required to make cash tax payments in 2018 or 2018 operations but rather were able to defer them to this year as such we made a cash tax payment in the first quarter of cad17 3 million for 2018 which is consistent with what we budgeted and a payment of cad3 5 million for 2019 which together make up the almost cad21 million as we sit here today while we have not finalized the 2018 canadian return we believe the tax ultimately owed will be less than the cad17 3 million that we budgeted and paid and that we ll be able to apply the excess in 2019 looking at the other components of the dcf variant segment ebda before certain items is up cad13 million compared to q1 2018 with the terminal segment up cad9 million and the pipeline segment up cad4 million the terminal segment was higher due primarily to base line coming online which accounted for about cad7 3 million the north 40 added about cad2 2 million largely from rate increases in new tsas and vancouver wharves added about cad1 7 million due to incremental volumes those positives were offset by a cad2 4 million negative variance on esrp primarily due to the expiration of the contract that i mentioned a second ago the pipeline segment was higher primarily due to lower o m on cochin of approximately cad2 7 million due to non recurrence of in line inspection dig and other integrity management items performed in q1 2018 and higher revenue of approximately cad1 3 million largely from fx and a short term deal not in place in 2018 d a is negative about cad1 5 million compared to q1 2018 largely due to some transition services cost related to the trans mountain sale and some higher labor interest is favorable by approximately cad1 6 million due primarily to interest income on the cad308 million of cash we held until making the cash tax payment of the same amount on trans mountain on the trans mountain gain on february 28th i have already discussed cash taxes preferred dividends are flat and sustaining capital is slightly unfavorable compared to q1 2018 due to timing and with that i ll move on to the balance sheet comparing year end 2018 to 3 31 this year cash decreased approximately cad4 292 billion to approximately cad47 million which is due to cad22 million of dcf plus net borrowings of cad50 million offset by cad3 977 billion in special distributions cad19 million in common dividends cad37 million paid on the final working capital adjustment on trans mountain paid to the government cad13 million of cash paid for expansion capital cad308 million of cash taxes paid on the trans mountain gain and a working capital other use of about cad10 million other current assets increased approximately cad14 million primarily due to the prepaid asset associated with the federal income tax that i mentioned earlier and a small increase in accounts receivable net pp e decreased by cad17 3 as a result of depreciation in excess of net assets placed in service lease assets increased from zero to approximately cad514 million as we adopted the new accounting rule asc 842 which requires us to record present value of operating leases deferred charges and other assets increased approximately cad1 3 million primarily as a result of a contribution to the cochin reclamation trust on the right hand side of the balance sheet the credit facility balance increased by cad50 million from zero as we borrowed a bit for general working capital needs distributions payable and distributions payable to related parties went to zero as we made the january 3rd special distributions of the trans mountain sale proceeds current lease liabilities increased cad17 million which is the current portion of lease liability that is the other side of the entry related to the asc 842 lease accounting that i mentioned other current liabilities decreased by approximately cad363 million primarily due to the payment of the taxes payable on the gain that i mentioned of cad308 million and the final trans mountain working capital payment of cad37 million that i mentioned for the government lease liabilities increased by almost cad497 million which is the long term portion of the lease liability that is the other side of the entry related to the asc 842 lease accounting i mentioned other long term liabilities increased by about cad1 million primarily due to a small increase in the liability associated with the cochin reclamation trust from a liquidity perspective we ended the quarter with cad47 million in cash and significant available liquidity as we had only cad50 million drawn out of the cad500 million revolver our debt to ltm adjusted ebitda ratio was just under 1 4 however given potential rating agency adjustments on operating leases and other items this ratio is not necessarily indicative of our debt rating and capability in our rating and with that i ll turn it back to steve steven j kean chief executive officer and director all right thanks dax and for the q a as we ve been doing for the last few quarters as a courtesy to all callers we re asking that you restrict yourself to one question and then one follow up question and if you have more questions not answered please get back in the queue and we will come back around to you and answer your question okay and with that jennifer you can open it up questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions and our first question comes from shneur gershuni from ubs your line is open shneur z gershuni ubs investment bank research division hi good afternoon everyone are you able to answer any questions about the kml process like the order does that mean anything steven j kean chief executive officer and director the order shneur z gershuni ubs investment bank research division the order in the press release of the three options is it or is it likelihood of success or preference steven j kean chief executive officer and director i hear you shneur so no beyond the press release as would be customary when you are running a process like this we re just going to run the process and really not comment beyond what we ve said publicly in the release shneur z gershuni ubs investment bank research division okay fair enough just a couple of questions here you re spending 3 1 billion in capex this year you ve added 600 million to the backlog you recently walked from the dlcc port opportunity where do you see incremental opportunity to spend capex in the next 18 months based on in addition to where you are at right now and do you have kind of a sense on a zip code of what 2020 would look like would it be higher or lower than where you expect 2019 to shake out steven j kean chief executive officer and director on the last we re again continuing to guide to between 2 billion and 3 billion and we won t get to that finally until we do our budget for 2019 but i think to your first question as we mentioned in talking about what s going on in the texas market and what s going on in midstream generally as kim took you through the numbers there we continue to see good opportunities in natural gas which makes up 70 of the backlog we re seeing some opportunities here and there in refined products continue to see small incremental opportunities there as the year goes on there s less coming in 2019 and we feel comfortable with kind of what we guided to in terms of discretionary capex at the beginning of the year as being where we will end up with it but that s where the opportunities are coming from that s what we expect in 2019 and we re working on 2020 and beyond as we speak i think the 2 billion to 3 billion is a reasonable guide shneur z gershuni ubs investment bank research division okay and as a follow up question given there seems to be a trend toward refined product exports is your operating leverage in your terminals in refined product system to be able to benefit around more export using ship channel or is what we are seeing right now kind of where you are at steven j kean chief executive officer and director yes there is so we have 11 ship docks and 12 barge docks and we have been growing kind of at an 8 annual year over year rate john w schlosser vp and president of terminals 8 5 in the last five years steven j kean chief executive officer and director 8 5 year over year over the last five years as john points out and you won t quite see that in the first quarter because we had some fog we had some issues in the ship channel associated with the itc incident which restricted that but it s not for a lack of demand to move us refined products to overseas markets john w schlosser vp and president of terminals yeah and i don t think there s anybody better positioned than we are with the 11 docks there steven j kean chief executive officer and director right we have some spare capacity which is part of your original question shneur z gershuni ubs investment bank research division all right perfect thank you very much i appreciate the color guys operator the next question comes from colton bean from tudor pickering holt company your line is open colton westbrooke bean tudor pickering holt co securities good afternoon just wanted to follow up on the comments on leverage you have seen some positive actions from the ratings agencies but it does seem like balance sheet has shifted higher in the priority list for the public markets so can you just provide an update as to how you are looking at the 4 5 times target and whether the strategy around capital allocation has shifted at all steven j kean chief executive officer and director sure we think the 4 5 is the right place to be for our particular assets given the size the stability of cash flow the diversity of the businesses that we have the quality of customers the dividend coverage you put all those things together we actually mapped higher than bbb flat and so and we think that all of those factors with respect to our business are is what has made the rating agencies comfortable with the upgrades that they have given us so we think the 4 5 times given all of those considerations is a fine place to be colton westbrooke bean tudor pickering holt co securities okay perfect and then on kmcc i think you all have noted over the last few quarters that you have seen some rate reductions can you just update us as to where we stand in terms of recontracting process there steven j kean chief executive officer and director yeah sure the recontracting process is ongoing and we do expect to see some additional capacity commitments forthcoming but granted at lower rates the other thing the other key development for us on kmcc is and we ve kind of set this out as a goal and talked about it some over time is we want to get that pipe to access permian barrels so right now of course you d primarily see it primarily is a takeaway for growing the eagle ford production but there s a lot of capacity away from the eagle ford so even as it grows it takes a while to fill that capacity back up and hence the rate reductions we re experiencing on the base business but we participated in the gray oak expansion that open season was just extended to april 30 however we ve got some pretty good commitments there and think we re going to be successful in getting permian barrels attracted to kmcc and so that will be a part of our picture going forward as we mitigate and add back some growth to the asset kim kimberly allen dang president and director i think that s right colton westbrooke bean tudor pickering holt co securities okay just a quick follow up on that so you mentioned the permian barrels is there an ability to use that pipe as a logistical backstop for corpus exports as well if you had a weather issue in corpus could you use that to get barrels up to the houston market steven j kean chief executive officer and director yes and so that s that you put your finger right on it so i think what we re seeing is that and for good reason is that i think customers are looking particularly in the early periods here they re looking for an alternative and there s really no better alternative than the houston market with the refining base that we have with the access to the petchem markets and global markets over docks all of the infrastructure that we and others have in the ship channel makes houston an attractive market for these barrels so it s i d say more than a backstop it s a nice market outlet alternative a nice market option that we would expect to be particularly strong in the early days but will be around for a long time colton westbrooke bean tudor pickering holt co securities thanks i ll leave it there operator the next question comes from tristan richardson from suntrust your line is open tristan james richardson suntrust robinson humphrey hi good afternoon guys just briefly on the slightly lower ebitda commentary should we think that deviation from budget is purely the incorporation of the 501 g settlements you guys talked about last week or are there some other puts and takes to think about steven j kean chief executive officer and director sure go ahead kim kimberly allen dang president and director there are some other puts and takes in that it s obviously guys the delay on elba which is an impact versus the budget and the pension expense that david talked about which we add back that non cash pension expense and track out the cash contributions for dcf and that s why you see the differences in ebitda and dcf and then also impact of slightly lower commodity prices primarily the ngl price impact on co2 steven j kean chief executive officer and director so the interesting thing i think the interesting conclusion is that notwithstanding those moving parts and now all of them affect dcf and ebitda the same way but we re basically flat on dcf and slightly down on ebitda and we ve absorbed and put behind us a significant regulatory risk that we did not budget for settlements on and so really that tells you that net the base business is strong and overcoming a lot in the way of headwind tristan james richardson suntrust robinson humphrey great very helpful and then just a follow up could you talk about your potential jv project serving the bakken and rockies and just sort of the timing of the commercial process there in that evolution steven j kean chief executive officer and director sure so that s our project with tallgrass and we are in customer discussions right now we think we have a good project because it is using in significant part existing pipeline asset so our double h system which is not something to be contributed to the joint venture but our one of our wic medicine bow laterals and the cheyenne plains system which provide a significant takeaway capacity really for three sources of supply one is the bakken second is some heavy barrels arriving from canada at guernsey and third is powder river and dj basin barrels there s also the pxp system that is part of the joint venture that tallgrass is contributing so bottom line on all that is we are offering a lot of way to provide crude takeaway capacity with a lot of existing pipes only about 200 miles of new build to get to cushing with the converted gas pipes so significant capacity probably more than we would expect to contractually fill up but we re in contractual discussions right now i think we ve got a good proposal to the market but not in the backlog and not nothing more definitive to announce at this point tristan james richardson suntrust robinson humphrey helpful so it could potentially have a decision this year steven j kean chief executive officer and director that s possible tristan james richardson suntrust robinson humphrey okay thanks guys very much operator the next question comes from gabriel moreen your line is open gabriel philip moreen mizuho securities usa hey good afternoon everyone first question for me is just whether the backlog around bakken gmp has shifted at all upwards since the analyst day just curious whether that s you have added anything there steven j kean chief executive officer and director yes we have had some capital additions there we continue to see good performance from our customer shippers there and particularly a compelling need for additional gas processing and takeaway capacity and so we have added a couple of projects in call it the tens of millions ballpark to what we already had in when we did the january conference gabriel philip moreen mizuho securities usa okay thanks steve and then i was going to ask on tall cotton now that phase ii is completed can you maybe give us your latest thoughts on proceeding with phase iii given the performance out of the reservoir steven j kean chief executive officer and director sure so tall cotton as we have said in the release we ve seen year over year growth in the production there but it s booked it s behind our plan and so frankly we are deferring further investment decisions in there until we get a better sense for downhole conformance and other work that we d like to do to get confident that we are going to get what we get confidence in what we re going to ultimately be able to recover from the reservoir in previous quarters we had talked about operational issues regarding compression and gas handling and things like that we think we have those behind us at this point but it s still a question of what do we need to do in terms of conformance and we re going to get ourselves satisfied on that before we make a further significant capital commitment to it gabriel philip moreen mizuho securities usa and does oil price matter at all for that steve or is it just agnostic of oil price steven j kean chief executive officer and director no oil price always matters yeah it always matters gabriel philip moreen mizuho securities usa okay thanks very much operator the next question comes from spiro dounis from credit suisse your line is open spiro michael dounis crédit suisse ag hey good afternoon everyone just wondering if you could provide some guidance or maybe some color just around waha gas prices and maybe some of the volatility and negative basis we ve seen there lately just wondering if you d expect that basis to stay negative and maybe even get worse over time until gcx comes online and is there anything you can do to actually speed gcx up at this point steven j kean chief executive officer and director as i said at the beginning we are doing everything i can we can for our customers there both with our existing infrastructure as well as prosecuting our projects just as quickly as we can and we feel very good about our schedule on gcx we think we re making extremely good progress there i think to answer your question about basis you have to take a lot of other things into account like what producer self help is available more docks and things like that and so we don t have any special insights into forward basis and how much of that can be mitigated by producer activity but there s no question that there is heavy demand to get out of permian and we re doing our best to fill that demand for our customers thomas a martin vp president of natural gas pipelines yeah and i mean this is nothing that isn t already out in the rags but i mean really two main drivers have caused the real severe negative basis that we ve experienced over the last few weeks outages and then well really outages on an intrastate system and interstate system and so as those come back on things should relieve a bit and then the other thing we are hearing now and again price as well some of the dry gas portion of the permian were seeing some nominal shutdowns until you get more relief out of the basin and so all that should improve somewhat but it s not going to be a pretty market until we get gcx online and then i think beyond that i think if gcx filled up very quickly and we could be in similar situation at this time next year spiro michael dounis crédit suisse ag fair enough i appreciate that color and then i want to respect your process on canada so i won t ask specifically around that review but i guess we have new data points coming out of alberta in terms of the government turning over there that would seem to sort of favor energy in canada just curious how much of that sort of factoring into your decision making process in general and maybe how you view the landscape there steven j kean chief executive officer and director look i think we are generally we feel good about having the terminal position that we have in alberta with the connectivity that it has with the customer base we have with what we have been able to see on contract renewals and the performance that we ve had on our expansion projects up there we are not really opining around governments and all of that we just work with our customers to get the new business as best we can of course other people have written about what they believe the implications are for the energy business and we just kind of refer to those spiro michael dounis crédit suisse ag appreciate the color thanks guys operator the next question is from keith stanley from wolfe research your line is open keith t stanley wolfe research hi good afternoon on kml just the one thing in the statement is that i think before you guys had cited a transaction with kmi as one of the alternatives and that s not in the release this afternoon any color on why kmi kml transaction is not one of the options steven j kean chief executive officer and director i m going to stick to my script keith and just say what we say in the press release is kind of all we have to say about it at this point keith t stanley wolfe research okay on the permian gas side is you guys have obviously led and been the only one successful in building a gas takeaway pipelines in the permian is there any potential for kinder to build a third permian pipeline even potentially just given the downstream sort of benefits on connectivity that you guys have steven j kean chief executive officer and director yes and there are some discussions ongoing there s nothing to announce and of course it s not in the backlog because we are not under contract or anything but the demand to get out of the permian continues to grow and the desire to be able to unlock the value that s in oil and the ngls as well as the natural gas continues to put pressure on the need for additional takeaway capacity and so short answer is yes and if you look at the projections they would show you that a gcx a year almost is what s required in order to satisfy the need for takeaway capacity and to unlock the value in the other commodities out of the permian i don t know that it s going to be anything like that pace or that it s going to be at that pace but there s certainly interest already in pipe three keith t stanley wolfe research okay thank you operator the next question comes from dennis coleman from bank of america merrill lynch your line is open dennis paul coleman bofa merrill lynch hi good afternoon everyone thanks for taking my questions if i can start maybe a little bit more on gcx you talk about doing everything you can for your customers i guess i interpret that as trying to get it online as soon as possible some anecdotes out there from different sources that it is well ahead of schedule i guess maybe the simple question is how much ahead of schedule might you be able to come on is it could it be are we talking weeks is it months steven j kean chief executive officer and director this is a long pipeline with a lot of compressor stations to commission meter stations to commission booster compression to commission and final testing and backfill all the things you have to do to get a pipeline a long linear asset where every inch is critical path all that work we have to do so we re going to leave it at we re doing well we re doing well on schedule we re happy with where we are in the construction process and we re going to do everything we can to be there for our customers just as fast as we can but because of because it s a long linear project with a lot of mechanical parts to it that we ve got to get completed we re not comfortable in projecting some kind of an early in service date or anything other than the october 1st at this point dennis paul coleman bofa merrill lynch sure and that s totally fair i guess maybe a different question is the revenue turns on when you get ferc approval to put in service or i guess no ferc approval is steven j kean chief executive officer and director it s not a ferc pipeline the contract is going to service what we re able to provide the 2 bcf of capacity that s associated with this pipeline dennis paul coleman bofa merrill lynch okay okay my follow up sort of more of a blue sky question i guess but with the increase in gas production that you re talking about a storage does come to mind particularly as we push up the volume of lng that we re exploiting there hasn t been much growth in storage in recent years there is the old reason of summer winter arbitrage doesn t exist is that something that you look at over time or how do you think about storage as an opportunity maybe not in the next couple years but beyond that as that volume grows steven j kean chief executive officer and director absolutely tom thomas a martin vp president of natural gas pipelines yeah no i mean it s clearly as the market grows volumetrically the way we talked about today there s going to be a need for more storage over time that we and others certainly need commensurate value to expand storage capability beyond what we have today and so we ll be watching that i mean i guess the one comment i ll make is that although the seasonal values have not really increased they ve probably contracted a bit if we look at historically we ve seen certainly seen an increase in the extrinsic value volatility value which if you look at the component of supply and demand that makes a lot of sense and so to the extent the solid intrinsic and extrinsic grows and can support future expansions obviously customers have stuff i mean it s stuff behind all that we ll look at expanding our storage footprint but we re in a great position with the existing capability we have across all of our markets today to provide storage service and that s an upside potential for us as the market grows dennis paul coleman bofa merrill lynch great and would you expect it to be more soft or more sort of single turn stuff thomas a martin vp president of natural gas pipelines yeah i think clearly with the volatility being more the component and obviously back stopping renewables i think multi cycle high delivery types of storage make the most sense steven j kean chief executive officer and director which tom s team has a lot of in texas and has is facing additional lng demand coming on which is very chunky as well as additional supply coming on which in this case is chunky with the gulf coast express coming on so having our texas intrastate system has significant amount of self owned storage capability is we think an advantage as we see them play out dennis paul coleman bofa merrill lynch okay thanks very much operator the next question comes from michael lapides from goldman sachs your line is open michael jay lapides goldman sachs hey guys thanks for taking my question actually i had two unrelated ones one regards connectivity for crude pipeline capacity between corpus and the houston ship channel and the houston market just curious are there lots of people concerned about enough pipeline capacity between the two markets relative to the size of export and inbound pipes are there opportunities to expand the kmcc or are you looking at that market and seeing what could be congestion down the road as more inbound crude pipelines come online steven j kean chief executive officer and director okay so i think that it s not like there s a lot of pipe going from corpus to houston or other way around however there is pipe that can get to corpus or can get to houston and if you look at gray oak for example gray oak is being built all the way over to while it s being built to freeport too but also to corpus ultimately and it interconnects with will interconnect with kmcc which then creates the houston option so that creates the kind of connectivity that you re talking about and as we said in response to an earlier question we expect that option to houston to get some pretty good utilization as the things come on and then yeah we do have expansion capability on kmcc as well right and in fact where we can technical difficulty michael jay lapides goldman sachs got it okay i was having my apologies i was having a hard time i think you had about 70 000 75 000 barrels we can talk offline on that then any change in status or thoughts about kind of the embedded call option that is gulf lng in terms of just next step next steps from here if any steven j kean chief executive officer and director we re going to continue to work with all of our stakeholders to find the right next steps we did today get an approval of our eis from the commission on the version that we filed earlier but really there s nothing more to update or report at this point michael jay lapides goldman sachs got it thank you steve much appreciated operator the next question comes from mirek zak from citigroup your line is open mirek zak citigroup hi good afternoon with last week s newly signed presidential executive orders does this potentially create or renew any opportunities for you to move gas further into the northeast maybe something similar to the northeast direct or maybe not as large or has not enough changed perhaps on the market demand side for anything to move forward steven j kean chief executive officer and director it s good but not that good i think there s a lot there are a lot of other it is good ok there does need to be some rationality in the way the delegated authority is handled by the states under the environmental regulations their permitting authority so that s a good thing just generally but there are a lot of things to work through in the northeast on getting new pipeline infrastructure in place and we continue to work on those projects ned is a very big project and that s not a very likely resurrection what we think is that we will find smaller one off kind of projects to do working very closely with our utility customers and we have one of those that s ongoing right now and we re working on another mirek zak citigroup okay great and switching to the permian here on all your gas pipeline outlets out of the permian do you have any level of open or marketing capacity on any of those lines available to you that allows you to take some advantage of the low waha pricing there and if so can you quantify the level at all steven j kean chief executive officer and director yeah i mean everything that well first of all i mean we do have takeaway capacity that s existing capacity out of the permian and so we do have the opportunity to take advantage of that provide outlets for our customers but every nook and cranny is in use mirek zak citigroup okay got you thank you kimberly allen dang president and director by our customers steven j kean chief executive officer and director by our customers mirek zak citigroup got it thank you operator operator instructions and the next question comes from jeremy tonet from jp morgan your line is open jeremy bryan tonet jp morgan chase co hi good afternoon steven j kean chief executive officer and director hi jeremy jeremy bryan tonet jp morgan chase co just wanted to touch base on the environment building pipeline to texas and your thoughts on house bill 991 and if there s any chance of passage there and just in general is it getting a little bit more difficult or you take a little bit more time to build pipes in texas any thoughts you could provide there steven j kean chief executive officer and director sure so yeah there is the texas legislature is in session right now and so there a number of bills are being considered regarding eminent domain and modifying the existing eminent domain process we had really let me put it this way this is not a traditional land owner versus pipeline issue any longer i mean this is about the value of the permian that benefits the entire state of texas and the profound public interest that s at stake there when it comes to royalties taxes royalties going to the state to fund schools et cetera and so i think it s fair to say that people in the texas legislature understand how important it is to unlock the value of this resource in the public interest and that s what you have eminent domain for and so our view is that what will emerge from that process ultimately will be a rational properly balanced properly balanced approach to eminent domain in the meantime we are actively working with our land owner land owners in order to get consensual arrangements in place and we re using the existing process of eminent domain where that makes sense as well but we don t currently see any kind of existential threat to our projects by any stretch jeremy bryan tonet jp morgan chase co that s helpful thanks for that i am supposing you might not give a lot of color here but just trying to put your comments together as far as the impact of ebitda guidance here there s 50 million to 150 million of impact does that kind of bookend what we re looking at here is this a right zip code or am i off on that field steven j kean chief executive officer and director we are just going to stick with the slightly down and what that implies it s not a material value jeremy bryan tonet jp morgan chase co got you one last one if i could imo2020 just wondering if that s any impact that you guys are seeing with regards to your storage position any benefits that you guys see out in the different storage areas outside of houston steven j kean chief executive officer and director yeah john schlosser from our terminals group john w schlosser vp and president of terminals it s a very small amount of our business it s less than 3 and it s under long term agreement most of it here at our bostco facility but there are opportunities for a segmentation project at bostco to handle both high sulfur and low sulfur and that s one of the largest handlers of distillate in the united states there s opportunities for blending there as well jeremy bryan tonet jp morgan chase co has this helped like the new york market or anything else like that john w schlosser vp and president of terminals it has not helped the new york market our opportunity is mostly in the gulf coast but there are smaller opportunities up and down the east coast jeremy bryan tonet jp morgan chase co got you that s it from me thanks operator there are no further questions in the queue at this time steven j kean chief executive officer and director good thank you very much operator that does conclude today s call thank you for participating you may

forward looking and financial outlook statements as usual before turning the call over to steve kean and the rest of the team i would like to provide a quick update and some insight on our financial philosophy at kinder morgan the important news today is that our board has increased the dividend by 25 from 0 20 per quarter or 0 80 annualized to 0 25 per quarter or 1 annualized now this is consistent with our intention which we announced in mid 2017 to increase the dividend to 0 80 in 2018 to 1 in to 2019 and to 1 25 in 2020 central to our ability to do this is the strong and growing cash flow our assets are generating and you will see that again in the first quarter s results we have used that cash to get our balance sheet in shape having paid off over 8 billion of debt and received credit upgrades from both s p and moody s and we intend to maintain our improved credit metrics beyond that we are now focusing on using our cash to fund our expansion capex without need to access the equity market to pay our increasing dividends and repurchase stock when appropriate in short we believe we are being careful and conservative stewards of our cash flow and using it in ways that benefit all our shareholders you should expect no less of us and should be reassured by the fact that the management and board of kmi are significant shareholders steve yes thanks rich we ll be updating you on both kmi and kml this afternoon i am going to start with a high level update and outlook on kmi then turn it over to our president kim dang to give you the update on our segment performance david michels kmi s cfo will take you through the numbers dax sanders will update you on kml and then we ll take your questions on both companies the summary on kmi is this we are adhering to the principles that we have previously laid out for you we have a strong balance sheet having met our approximately 4 5x target of debt to ebitda and with ratings upgrades from both moody s and s p we re maintaining our capital discipline through our return criteria a good track record of execution and by self funding our investments we are returning value to shareholders with the 25 dividend increase announced today and we continue to find an attractive growth opportunity with a net add of 400 million to our backlog during the quarter again strong balance sheet capital discipline returning value to our shareholders and finding additional growth opportunities those are the principles we operate by here are a few updates on some of the key projects first our permian natural gas pipeline project our customers are anxious to have us get their gas out of the permian so they can also get their oil and ngls out we have two projects to get the gas out gulf coast express and permian highway each are about 2 bcf a day of capacity both are secured by long term contracts and both are in execution stage gcx is scheduled to be in service in october of this year with permian highway following a year later both projects are on schedule both projects have attractive returns which we expect to realize and both projects bring us additional opportunities in our downstream pipeline combined they bring 4 bcf a day of incremental gas to a system that moves about 5 bcf a day today those projects will bring opportunities for downstream expansion and optimization as we find homes for that incremental gas through our connectivity with lng facilities mexico exports utility demand and texas gulf coast industrial and petchem demand our execution and our economics on these projects both look good and we re actively managing our risks and opportunities on both these projects show us taking advantage of a very positive situation that is this there is a large supply growth at texas and a large demand growth in texas and we can bridge the two and connect to our premier texas intrastate pipeline network and stay entirely within the state of texas which facilitates permitting and commercial flexibility as we pointed out at the conference in january of this year 70 of the demand growth between now and 2030 is projected to be in louisiana and texas largely due to lng and our systems are well positioned to benefit from that also it s worth noting that now 70 of our backlog is natural gas and 56 of that is in our midstream group where market based rates in terms of service prevail on another key project elba our lng facility that we re building in savannah georgia we are closing in on the in service date for the first unit we now expect in service of that unit to be around may 1 a couple of weeks from now getting the first unit on secures about 70 of the project revenue the delay we ve experienced is certainly unwelcome but the risk allocation between us our contractor and our customer provides significant production and mitigates the effect to our irr so we re introducing natural gas into the facility as well as refrigerants in that process it s been going well also of note we added a net 400 million to the backlog this quarter with new investments in natural gas and terminals primarily more than offsetting projects placed in service the backlog now stands at 6 1 billion a few observations about our expansion capital investments over time as several people have asked how we re doing on the capital we deploy in those projects so at the january conference kim took you through our historical project performance if you look at page 49 of what we provided there you ll see a comparison between project ebitda multiples and actual performance for the projects completed during the 2015 to 2018 period you ll see that our actual performance was better than our original estimate 5 8x versus 6 1x in the original estimate you will also see that the story is even better in natural gas which makes up the bulk of our backlog as i said where we came out at 5 2x versus the original estimate of 5 8x on page 50 you will also see some other factors that partially offset the contribution from a project investment but overall project performance was very good the point here is we are very careful with your capital we don t swing at every pitch we definitely have our hits and misses but we have shown that in aggregate we do well we get there by having elevated return criteria well above our cost of capital we focus on projects that we understand and primarily focus on expansion off of our existing footprint all of this helps us invest in returns that are well above our cost of capital and helps overcome the inevitable curve ball that come up during project execution this has served us well particularly during an increasingly challenging regulatory environment next an update on 501 g as we said in our press release monday of last week we have reached settlements on two more systems epng and tgp which now resolve a vast majority of our 501 g exposure this is an overhang that we now believe we have nearly entirely behind us to settlements that are pending at the commission right now here s our observations the commission generally approves negotiated settlements so they are pending before the commission but we expect that they will be approved and two they respect existing settlements including rate moratoria that are in place the 501 g overhang has been a consistent part of the dialogue around our stock and we are pleased with our resolution of it i believe we have said this before but when we announced the budget we did not have anything in for settling 501 g matters but we telegraphed that if we did get such settlements it would likely be a good thing for the value of the company and we are happy with the outcome finally before turning it over to kim a word about the kml process as we say in the release the process is ongoing we don t have anything more than that to say at this point and as you will hear when we get to kml we have been attentive not only to the process but also to managing and developing existing business it s comprised of a very good set of midstream assets it gets a good deal of effort and focus from our management team but what i want to say from a kmi investor standpoint is that you need to keep in mind that while this while the process gets a lot of attention kml makes up about 2 of kmi ebitda on a consolidated basis so to just put it in perspective for kmi and with that i ll turn it over to kim okay thanks steve so looking at the segment natural gas had another outstanding quarter it was up 12 if you look at the market fundamentals they remain very strong for 2019 lower 48 natural gas demand is expected to increase by 5 5 bcf to approximately 95 bcf a day and the lower 48 production is expected to increase by 7 5 bcf a day growth in the natural gas markets in the first quarter is driving very nice results on our assets transport volumes on our transmission pipes increased approximately 4 55 bcf a day or 14 this is the fifth quarter in a row in which volumes have exceeded the comparable prior period by 10 or more if you look on the demand side deliveries to lng facilities off of our pipes were almost 1 5 bcf a day in the quarter that s an increase of approximately 900 million cubic feet a day versus the first quarter of 2018 power demand on our system for the quarter was down slightly primarily due to warmer weather exports to mexico were up almost were up 183 million cubic feet to 3 2 bcf a day which is a 6 increase versus the first quarter of 2018 on the supply side production out of key out of the key basins we continues that we serve continues to increase if you look at the permian natural gas wellhead volumes increased approximately 30 the bakken natural gas wellhead volumes increased about 31 and the haynesville they increased 29 and in eagle ford they increased 8 if you look at where these volumes showed up on our transmission pipes epng volumes were up 1 1 bcf a day primarily due to permian volume wic volumes were up 900 million cubic feet a day and cig volumes were up approximately 550 million a day both due to growth in the dj basin kml kmla volumes were up 570 million cubic feet a day primarily due to lng exports on our gas gathering assets volumes were up 21 or 570 million cubic feet a day driven by the production increases that i mentioned in the haynesville in the eagle ford and the bakken overall the higher utilization on our system systems a lot of which came without the need of significant capital resulted in nice bottom line growth in the quarter and longer term as our systems fill up will drive nice expansion opportunity if you look at the longer term by 2024 the natural gas market is projected to grow to almost 110 bcf a day driven by increases in power generation lng and mexico exports and continued industrial development with most of that supply growth expected to come out of the permian the haynesville and the marcellus on our product side on the product segment it was down slightly in the quarter we had increased contribution from our southeast refined products assets calnev and our bakken crude assets that were more than offset by lower contributions from kmcc volumes on kmcc were actually up 16 in the quarter but that was more than offset by lower rates overall crude and condensate volumes were up 8 refined product volumes in the quarter were flat from the terminals business it was up modestly in the quarter the liquids business which accounts for about 80 of the segment was driven by strength in the houston ship channel and on our base line terminal expansion project in edmonton these increases were slightly were offset by the increased lease expense at our edmonton south terminal and that became a third party obligation post the trans mountain sale we added 1 4 million barrels of tankage versus the first quarter of 2018 due to the base line project coming online bringing our total leasable capacity to almost 92 million barrels the bulk business in our terminal segment was roughly flat our co2 segment was down in the quarter and that s primarily due to lower crude and ngl prices but also to slightly lower production oil production volumes our net realized crude oil price was down about 11 per barrel and ngl prices were down about 4 per barrel net crude oil production was down approximately 1 200 barrels a day or 3 due to lower production at katz and goldsmith katz and goldsmith are two of our smaller fields and account for roughly 10 of our overall production on these in these fields since we are not implementing new development projects we would expect a continued decline over time on the other hand at sacroc which is our largest field and accounts for well over 60 of our production we continue to find attractive projects the co2 sales and transport business was up slightly in the quarter due to about 5 higher co2 volume co2 prices were essentially flat that s it for the segment overview and i ll turn it over to david thanks kim so today we re declaring a dividend of 0 25 per share up from 0 20 per share last quarter and in line with our budget to declare 1 per share for the full year 2019 as rich mentioned this would be a 25 increase over 0 80 per share compared to 2018 kmi had a good quarter we grew significantly from last year s first quarter and we overcame a number of items to end the quarter in line with our budget we generated dcf per share of 0 60 which is 2 4 times our declared dividend or over 80 million 800 million in excess of that dividend additionally as the press release points out for the full year 2019 we forecast our dcf to be on budget and that is even after incorporating the approximately 50 million impact from our announced ferc 501 g settlement so very nice overall performance from our underlying business turning to the earnings page revenues were in line with the first quarter of 2018 but operating income was higher due to lower quarter over quarter costs net income available to common stockholders for the quarter were 556 million which is a 15 increase from the first quarter of last year that includes the benefit of euro preferred dividend payments down from 39 million we paid last year in the quarter as a result of the conversion of our preferred equity securities in october of last year adjusted earnings per share was up excuse me was 0 25 up 0 03 or 14 from the prior period very nice growth there moving on to distributable cash flow we believe distributable cash flow is a good reflection of our cash earnings and it was up it was 0 60 per share for the quarter up 0 04 or 7 from q1 of 2018 natural gas segment was the largest driver of that growth up 127 million or 12 as is the as has been the consistent theme for that segment recently we benefited on multiple fronts tgp benefited from multiple expansion projects placed in service in 2018 epng was up driven by permian supply growth more than offsetting the unfavorable impact from the ferc 501 g settlement in the quarter texas and louisiana gathering and processing assets were up driven by increased volumes from the haynesville and eagle ford basins kinder morgan louisiana pipeline was up due to the sabine pass expansion our product segment was down 4 million our terminal segment was up 2 million our co2 segment was down 48 million or 20 and kim covered the drivers behind those segments performance for the quarter kinder morgan canada was down 46 million from q1 2018 as a result of the sale of our trans mountain asset our g a expense was lower by 6 million due to greater amounts of costs to capitalize the growth projects as well as lower g a resulting from the trans mountain sale those items were partially offset by the by higher pension expenses in the quarter and those pension expenses are non cash and are backed out of our dcf metric and replaced with actual cash contribution excluding the higher pension costs g a our g a would have been 16 million lower than q1 2018 interest expense was 14 million lower driven by lower debt balance and lower average rate on our bonds as well as greater interest capitalized to our growth projects that was partially offset by higher libor rates which impacted the interest rate swaps we settled in the quarter our preferred stock dividends were down 39 million as i mentioned before so total dcf of 1 371 billion was up 124 million or 10 from the prior period and to summarize the main changes greater segment ebda of 38 million when you include the nci change which relates to the segment generated from greater natural gas contributions offset by lower contributions from co2 in canada 14 million lower interest expense 16 million lower g a expenses excluding the non cash pension expense and 39 million lower preferred stock dividend which gets you to 107 million of the 124 million increase in the quarter dcf per share of 0 60 was again up 0 04 or 7 with the same drivers as total dcf but inclusive of the incremental shares issued as a result of the preferred stock conversion moving onto the balance sheet once again we have two net debt to ebitda figures listed at the bottom of the table at year end 2018 kmi s balance in our adjusted net debt figure included all of the kml excuse me trans mountain sales proceeds and the adjusted net debt figure excludes the portion of those proceeds that was paid to the kml public shareholders in early january beyond year end 2018 there is no difference between the net debt and adjusted net debt figures we ended the quarter at 4 6 times debt to ebitda which is consistent with our budget and slightly higher than year end 4 5 times our end of year 2019 leverage is currently forecasted to be 4 6 times which is slightly unfavorable to our plan of 4 5 times but is consistent with our long term leverage target of approximately 4 5 times the slightly higher than budget year end leverage is due to slightly lower than planned ebitda the recent ebitda is forecasted to be slightly below budget but while dcf is expected to be on budget is because of the add backs of non cash pension expenses below ebitda and ebitda does not pick up the benefit of our favorable interest expense some items to note on the budget changes from year end a cash reduction of 3 1 billion due to 1 3 billion used to pay down kmi bonds maturing in the quarter 800 million distribution to public kml shareholders 340 million of canadian taxes due to the trans mountain sale and almost 300 million of lower revolver and cp borrowings in other assets 700 million of the 712 million increase is due to booking a right to use asset resulting from a new lease accounting standard the offsetting liabilities and short term and long term liabilities include 647 million which are in long term liabilities which explains most of the increase of the 618 million in other liability in our short term and long term debt changes in short term that was mainly due to the pay off of the 1 3 billion of bonds and 700 million of other bonds which rolled into the short term category and out of the long term category our adjusted net debt ended the quarter at 34 8 billion which is an increase of 668 million from year end and to reconcile that we generated 1 371 billion in dcf we spent approximately 750 million in growth capital and contributions to our joint ventures we paid approximately 450 million of dividend we paid 340 million of taxes on our trans mountain sale and we had a working capital use of cash of approximately 500 million the largest item in that are greater interest payments in the quarter bonus payments payroll and property tax payments with that i ll turn it back to steve okay now we are going to turn to kml and at kml again we realize the burning question here is the process we previously announced and which as we said today remains ongoing and we should have an update for you in the coming weeks all we have to say at this point about the process is in the press release but clearly we will have more to say once we have something to announce in the meantime as you will hear from dax and as we have said all along we ve got a good business here that we continue to operate and invest in as a stand alone business and we re in a good position of not being forced to do anything so we ll work through the process and we will have we believe a conclusion in the coming weeks and let you know more about it at that time with that i ll turn it over to dax thanks steve before i get into the results i do want to update you on a couple of general business items on the announced diesel export project we received our required air permit amendment and key building permit and satisfied a key condition process in the customer s contract as such we can now commence construction activities and plan to do so in may consistent with previous statements this is an approximately cad43 million project that contemplates two new distillate tanks with combined storage capacity of 200 000 barrels underpinned by a 20 year take or pay contract that we expect to put in service during the first half of 2021 on the shed 6 ph reactivation project that we have discussed we expect to get our key building permits shortly which will allow us to start construction in may also and have the project inserted in december 2019 as a reminder the total capex on that project is approximately 8 million now moving toward the results and of note as i talk to the results i m generally only going to reference results from continuing operations as discontinued ops only relates to prior period and is less relevant today the kml board declared a dividend for the first quarter of 0 1625 per restricted voting share or 0 65 annualized which is consistent with previous guidance earnings per restricted voting share for continuing operations for the first quarter of 2019 or 0 12 and that is derived from approximately 21 million of income from continuing operations which is up approximately 7 million versus the same quarter in 2018 revenue increased across most all of kml s assets and was led by the contribution for the base line tank and terminal assets coming online but was partially offset by the expiration of a third party contract on esrp which we have previously discussed the increase in revenue was partially offset by higher g a and depreciation total dcf from continuing operations for the quarter is 22 4 million which is down about 1 million from the comparable period in 2018 that reflects coverage of approximately 1 million and reflects the dcf payout ratio of approximately 85 the coverage and payout ratio this quarter are skewed by the large cash tax amount of almost 21 million which is 14 million higher than the almost 7 million in the comparable period last year as we previously discussed we were not required to make cash tax payments in 2018 or 2018 operations but rather were able to defer them to this year as such we made a cash tax payment in the first quarter of cad17 3 million for 2018 which is consistent with what we budgeted and a payment of cad3 5 million for 2019 which together make up the almost cad21 million as we sit here today while we have not finalized the 2018 canadian return we believe the tax ultimately owed will be less than the cad17 3 million that we budgeted and paid and that we ll be able to apply the excess in 2019 looking at the other components of the dcf variant segment ebda before certain items is up cad13 million compared to q1 2018 with the terminal segment up cad9 million and the pipeline segment up cad4 million the terminal segment was higher due primarily to base line coming online which accounted for about cad7 3 million the north 40 added about cad2 2 million largely from rate increases in new tsas and vancouver wharves added about cad1 7 million due to incremental volumes those positives were offset by a cad2 4 million negative variance on esrp primarily due to the expiration of the contract that i mentioned a second ago the pipeline segment was higher primarily due to lower o m on cochin of approximately cad2 7 million due to non recurrence of in line inspection dig and other integrity management items performed in q1 2018 and higher revenue of approximately cad1 3 million largely from fx and a short term deal not in place in 2018 d a is negative about cad1 5 million compared to q1 2018 largely due to some transition services cost related to the trans mountain sale and some higher labor interest is favorable by approximately cad1 6 million due primarily to interest income on the cad308 million of cash we held until making the cash tax payment of the same amount on trans mountain on the trans mountain gain on february 28th i have already discussed cash taxes preferred dividends are flat and sustaining capital is slightly unfavorable compared to q1 2018 due to timing and with that i ll move on to the balance sheet comparing year end 2018 to 3 31 this year cash decreased approximately cad4 292 billion to approximately cad47 million which is due to cad22 million of dcf plus net borrowings of cad50 million offset by cad3 977 billion in special distributions cad19 million in common dividends cad37 million paid on the final working capital adjustment on trans mountain paid to the government cad13 million of cash paid for expansion capital cad308 million of cash taxes paid on the trans mountain gain and a working capital other use of about cad10 million other current assets increased approximately cad14 million primarily due to the prepaid asset associated with the federal income tax that i mentioned earlier and a small increase in accounts receivable net pp e decreased by cad17 3 as a result of depreciation in excess of net assets placed in service lease assets increased from zero to approximately cad514 million as we adopted the new accounting rule asc 842 which requires us to record present value of operating leases deferred charges and other assets increased approximately cad1 3 million primarily as a result of a contribution to the cochin reclamation trust on the right hand side of the balance sheet the credit facility balance increased by cad50 million from zero as we borrowed a bit for general working capital needs distributions payable and distributions payable to related parties went to zero as we made the january 3rd special distributions of the trans mountain sale proceeds current lease liabilities increased cad17 million which is the current portion of lease liability that is the other side of the entry related to the asc 842 lease accounting that i mentioned other current liabilities decreased by approximately cad363 million primarily due to the payment of the taxes payable on the gain that i mentioned of cad308 million and the final trans mountain working capital payment of cad37 million that i mentioned for the government lease liabilities increased by almost cad497 million which is the long term portion of the lease liability that is the other side of the entry related to the asc 842 lease accounting i mentioned other long term liabilities increased by about cad1 million primarily due to a small increase in the liability associated with the cochin reclamation trust from a liquidity perspective we ended the quarter with cad47 million in cash and significant available liquidity as we had only cad50 million drawn out of the cad500 million revolver our debt to ltm adjusted ebitda ratio was just under 1 4 however given potential rating agency adjustments on operating leases and other items this ratio is not necessarily indicative of our debt rating and capability in our rating and with that i ll turn it back to steve all right thanks dax and for the q a as we ve been doing for the last few quarters as a courtesy to all callers we re asking that you restrict yourself to one question and then one follow up question and if you have more questions not answered please get back in the queue and we will come back around to you and answer your question okay and with that jennifer you can open it up questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions and our first question comes from shneur gershuni from ubs your line is open hi good afternoon everyone are you able to answer any questions about the kml process like the order does that mean anything the order the order in the press release of the three options is it or is it likelihood of success or preference i hear you shneur so no beyond the press release as would be customary when you are running a process like this we re just going to run the process and really not comment beyond what we ve said publicly in the release okay fair enough just a couple of questions here you re spending 3 1 billion in capex this year you ve added 600 million to the backlog you recently walked from the dlcc port opportunity where do you see incremental opportunity to spend capex in the next 18 months based on in addition to where you are at right now and do you have kind of a sense on a zip code of what 2020 would look like would it be higher or lower than where you expect 2019 to shake out on the last we re again continuing to guide to between 2 billion and 3 billion and we won t get to that finally until we do our budget for 2019 but i think to your first question as we mentioned in talking about what s going on in the texas market and what s going on in midstream generally as kim took you through the numbers there we continue to see good opportunities in natural gas which makes up 70 of the backlog we re seeing some opportunities here and there in refined products continue to see small incremental opportunities there as the year goes on there s less coming in 2019 and we feel comfortable with kind of what we guided to in terms of discretionary capex at the beginning of the year as being where we will end up with it but that s where the opportunities are coming from that s what we expect in 2019 and we re working on 2020 and beyond as we speak i think the 2 billion to 3 billion is a reasonable guide okay and as a follow up question given there seems to be a trend toward refined product exports is your operating leverage in your terminals in refined product system to be able to benefit around more export using ship channel or is what we are seeing right now kind of where you are at yes there is so we have 11 ship docks and 12 barge docks and we have been growing kind of at an 8 annual year over year rate 8 5 in the last five years 8 5 year over year over the last five years as john points out and you won t quite see that in the first quarter because we had some fog we had some issues in the ship channel associated with the itc incident which restricted that but it s not for a lack of demand to move us refined products to overseas markets yeah and i don t think there s anybody better positioned than we are with the 11 docks there right we have some spare capacity which is part of your original question all right perfect thank you very much i appreciate the color guys the next question comes from colton bean from tudor pickering holt company your line is open good afternoon just wanted to follow up on the comments on leverage you have seen some positive actions from the ratings agencies but it does seem like balance sheet has shifted higher in the priority list for the public markets so can you just provide an update as to how you are looking at the 4 5 times target and whether the strategy around capital allocation has shifted at all sure we think the 4 5 is the right place to be for our particular assets given the size the stability of cash flow the diversity of the businesses that we have the quality of customers the dividend coverage you put all those things together we actually mapped higher than bbb flat and so and we think that all of those factors with respect to our business are is what has made the rating agencies comfortable with the upgrades that they have given us so we think the 4 5 times given all of those considerations is a fine place to be okay perfect and then on kmcc i think you all have noted over the last few quarters that you have seen some rate reductions can you just update us as to where we stand in terms of recontracting process there yeah sure the recontracting process is ongoing and we do expect to see some additional capacity commitments forthcoming but granted at lower rates the other thing the other key development for us on kmcc is and we ve kind of set this out as a goal and talked about it some over time is we want to get that pipe to access permian barrels so right now of course you d primarily see it primarily is a takeaway for growing the eagle ford production but there s a lot of capacity away from the eagle ford so even as it grows it takes a while to fill that capacity back up and hence the rate reductions we re experiencing on the base business but we participated in the gray oak expansion that open season was just extended to april 30 however we ve got some pretty good commitments there and think we re going to be successful in getting permian barrels attracted to kmcc and so that will be a part of our picture going forward as we mitigate and add back some growth to the asset kim i think that s right okay just a quick follow up on that so you mentioned the permian barrels is there an ability to use that pipe as a logistical backstop for corpus exports as well if you had a weather issue in corpus could you use that to get barrels up to the houston market yes and so that s that you put your finger right on it so i think what we re seeing is that and for good reason is that i think customers are looking particularly in the early periods here they re looking for an alternative and there s really no better alternative than the houston market with the refining base that we have with the access to the petchem markets and global markets over docks all of the infrastructure that we and others have in the ship channel makes houston an attractive market for these barrels so it s i d say more than a backstop it s a nice market outlet alternative a nice market option that we would expect to be particularly strong in the early days but will be around for a long time thanks i ll leave it there the next question comes from tristan richardson from suntrust your line is open hi good afternoon guys just briefly on the slightly lower ebitda commentary should we think that deviation from budget is purely the incorporation of the 501 g settlements you guys talked about last week or are there some other puts and takes to think about sure go ahead kim there are some other puts and takes in that it s obviously guys the delay on elba which is an impact versus the budget and the pension expense that david talked about which we add back that non cash pension expense and track out the cash contributions for dcf and that s why you see the differences in ebitda and dcf and then also impact of slightly lower commodity prices primarily the ngl price impact on co2 so the interesting thing i think the interesting conclusion is that notwithstanding those moving parts and now all of them affect dcf and ebitda the same way but we re basically flat on dcf and slightly down on ebitda and we ve absorbed and put behind us a significant regulatory risk that we did not budget for settlements on and so really that tells you that net the base business is strong and overcoming a lot in the way of headwind great very helpful and then just a follow up could you talk about your potential jv project serving the bakken and rockies and just sort of the timing of the commercial process there in that evolution sure so that s our project with tallgrass and we are in customer discussions right now we think we have a good project because it is using in significant part existing pipeline asset so our double h system which is not something to be contributed to the joint venture but our one of our wic medicine bow laterals and the cheyenne plains system which provide a significant takeaway capacity really for three sources of supply one is the bakken second is some heavy barrels arriving from canada at guernsey and third is powder river and dj basin barrels there s also the pxp system that is part of the joint venture that tallgrass is contributing so bottom line on all that is we are offering a lot of way to provide crude takeaway capacity with a lot of existing pipes only about 200 miles of new build to get to cushing with the converted gas pipes so significant capacity probably more than we would expect to contractually fill up but we re in contractual discussions right now i think we ve got a good proposal to the market but not in the backlog and not nothing more definitive to announce at this point helpful so it could potentially have a decision this year that s possible okay thanks guys very much the next question comes from gabriel moreen your line is open hey good afternoon everyone first question for me is just whether the backlog around bakken gmp has shifted at all upwards since the analyst day just curious whether that s you have added anything there yes we have had some capital additions there we continue to see good performance from our customer shippers there and particularly a compelling need for additional gas processing and takeaway capacity and so we have added a couple of projects in call it the tens of millions ballpark to what we already had in when we did the january conference okay thanks steve and then i was going to ask on tall cotton now that phase ii is completed can you maybe give us your latest thoughts on proceeding with phase iii given the performance out of the reservoir sure so tall cotton as we have said in the release we ve seen year over year growth in the production there but it s booked it s behind our plan and so frankly we are deferring further investment decisions in there until we get a better sense for downhole conformance and other work that we d like to do to get confident that we are going to get what we get confidence in what we re going to ultimately be able to recover from the reservoir in previous quarters we had talked about operational issues regarding compression and gas handling and things like that we think we have those behind us at this point but it s still a question of what do we need to do in terms of conformance and we re going to get ourselves satisfied on that before we make a further significant capital commitment to it and does oil price matter at all for that steve or is it just agnostic of oil price no oil price always matters yeah it always matters okay thanks very much the next question comes from spiro dounis from credit suisse your line is open hey good afternoon everyone just wondering if you could provide some guidance or maybe some color just around waha gas prices and maybe some of the volatility and negative basis we ve seen there lately just wondering if you d expect that basis to stay negative and maybe even get worse over time until gcx comes online and is there anything you can do to actually speed gcx up at this point as i said at the beginning we are doing everything i can we can for our customers there both with our existing infrastructure as well as prosecuting our projects just as quickly as we can and we feel very good about our schedule on gcx we think we re making extremely good progress there i think to answer your question about basis you have to take a lot of other things into account like what producer self help is available more docks and things like that and so we don t have any special insights into forward basis and how much of that can be mitigated by producer activity but there s no question that there is heavy demand to get out of permian and we re doing our best to fill that demand for our customers yeah and i mean this is nothing that isn t already out in the rags but i mean really two main drivers have caused the real severe negative basis that we ve experienced over the last few weeks outages and then well really outages on an intrastate system and interstate system and so as those come back on things should relieve a bit and then the other thing we are hearing now and again price as well some of the dry gas portion of the permian were seeing some nominal shutdowns until you get more relief out of the basin and so all that should improve somewhat but it s not going to be a pretty market until we get gcx online and then i think beyond that i think if gcx filled up very quickly and we could be in similar situation at this time next year fair enough i appreciate that color and then i want to respect your process on canada so i won t ask specifically around that review but i guess we have new data points coming out of alberta in terms of the government turning over there that would seem to sort of favor energy in canada just curious how much of that sort of factoring into your decision making process in general and maybe how you view the landscape there look i think we are generally we feel good about having the terminal position that we have in alberta with the connectivity that it has with the customer base we have with what we have been able to see on contract renewals and the performance that we ve had on our expansion projects up there we are not really opining around governments and all of that we just work with our customers to get the new business as best we can of course other people have written about what they believe the implications are for the energy business and we just kind of refer to those appreciate the color thanks guys the next question is from keith stanley from wolfe research your line is open hi good afternoon on kml just the one thing in the statement is that i think before you guys had cited a transaction with kmi as one of the alternatives and that s not in the release this afternoon any color on why kmi kml transaction is not one of the options i m going to stick to my script keith and just say what we say in the press release is kind of all we have to say about it at this point okay on the permian gas side is you guys have obviously led and been the only one successful in building a gas takeaway pipelines in the permian is there any potential for kinder to build a third permian pipeline even potentially just given the downstream sort of benefits on connectivity that you guys have yes and there are some discussions ongoing there s nothing to announce and of course it s not in the backlog because we are not under contract or anything but the demand to get out of the permian continues to grow and the desire to be able to unlock the value that s in oil and the ngls as well as the natural gas continues to put pressure on the need for additional takeaway capacity and so short answer is yes and if you look at the projections they would show you that a gcx a year almost is what s required in order to satisfy the need for takeaway capacity and to unlock the value in the other commodities out of the permian i don t know that it s going to be anything like that pace or that it s going to be at that pace but there s certainly interest already in pipe three okay thank you the next question comes from dennis coleman from bank of america merrill lynch your line is open hi good afternoon everyone thanks for taking my questions if i can start maybe a little bit more on gcx you talk about doing everything you can for your customers i guess i interpret that as trying to get it online as soon as possible some anecdotes out there from different sources that it is well ahead of schedule i guess maybe the simple question is how much ahead of schedule might you be able to come on is it could it be are we talking weeks is it months this is a long pipeline with a lot of compressor stations to commission meter stations to commission booster compression to commission and final testing and backfill all the things you have to do to get a pipeline a long linear asset where every inch is critical path all that work we have to do so we re going to leave it at we re doing well we re doing well on schedule we re happy with where we are in the construction process and we re going to do everything we can to be there for our customers just as fast as we can but because of because it s a long linear project with a lot of mechanical parts to it that we ve got to get completed we re not comfortable in projecting some kind of an early in service date or anything other than the october 1st at this point sure and that s totally fair i guess maybe a different question is the revenue turns on when you get ferc approval to put in service or i guess no ferc approval is it s not a ferc pipeline the contract is going to service what we re able to provide the 2 bcf of capacity that s associated with this pipeline okay okay my follow up sort of more of a blue sky question i guess but with the increase in gas production that you re talking about a storage does come to mind particularly as we push up the volume of lng that we re exploiting there hasn t been much growth in storage in recent years there is the old reason of summer winter arbitrage doesn t exist is that something that you look at over time or how do you think about storage as an opportunity maybe not in the next couple years but beyond that as that volume grows absolutely tom yeah no i mean it s clearly as the market grows volumetrically the way we talked about today there s going to be a need for more storage over time that we and others certainly need commensurate value to expand storage capability beyond what we have today and so we ll be watching that i mean i guess the one comment i ll make is that although the seasonal values have not really increased they ve probably contracted a bit if we look at historically we ve seen certainly seen an increase in the extrinsic value volatility value which if you look at the component of supply and demand that makes a lot of sense and so to the extent the solid intrinsic and extrinsic grows and can support future expansions obviously customers have stuff i mean it s stuff behind all that we ll look at expanding our storage footprint but we re in a great position with the existing capability we have across all of our markets today to provide storage service and that s an upside potential for us as the market grows great and would you expect it to be more soft or more sort of single turn stuff yeah i think clearly with the volatility being more the component and obviously back stopping renewables i think multi cycle high delivery types of storage make the most sense which tom s team has a lot of in texas and has is facing additional lng demand coming on which is very chunky as well as additional supply coming on which in this case is chunky with the gulf coast express coming on so having our texas intrastate system has significant amount of self owned storage capability is we think an advantage as we see them play out okay thanks very much the next question comes from michael lapides from goldman sachs your line is open hey guys thanks for taking my question actually i had two unrelated ones one regards connectivity for crude pipeline capacity between corpus and the houston ship channel and the houston market just curious are there lots of people concerned about enough pipeline capacity between the two markets relative to the size of export and inbound pipes are there opportunities to expand the kmcc or are you looking at that market and seeing what could be congestion down the road as more inbound crude pipelines come online okay so i think that it s not like there s a lot of pipe going from corpus to houston or other way around however correct there is pipe that can get to corpus or can get to houston and if you look at gray oak for example gray oak is being built all the way over to while it s being built to freeport too but also to corpus ultimately and it interconnects with will interconnect with kmcc which then creates the houston option so that creates the kind of connectivity that you re talking about and as we said in response to an earlier question we expect that option to houston to get some pretty good utilization as the things come on and then yeah we do have expansion capability on kmcc as well right and in fact where we can technical difficulty got it okay i was having my apologies i was having a hard time i think you had about 70 000 75 000 barrels correct we can talk offline on that then any change in status or thoughts about kind of the embedded call option that is gulf lng in terms of just next step next steps from here if any we re going to continue to work with all of our stakeholders to find the right next steps we did today get an approval of our eis from the commission on the version that we filed earlier but really there s nothing more to update or report at this point got it thank you steve much appreciated the next question comes from mirek zak from citigroup your line is open hi good afternoon with last week s newly signed presidential executive orders does this potentially create or renew any opportunities for you to move gas further into the northeast maybe something similar to the northeast direct or maybe not as large or has not enough changed perhaps on the market demand side for anything to move forward it s good but not that good i think there s a lot there are a lot of other it is good ok there does need to be some rationality in the way the delegated authority is handled by the states under the environmental regulations their permitting authority so that s a good thing just generally but there are a lot of things to work through in the northeast on getting new pipeline infrastructure in place and we continue to work on those projects ned is a very big project and that s not a very likely resurrection what we think is that we will find smaller one off kind of projects to do working very closely with our utility customers and we have one of those that s ongoing right now and we re working on another okay great and switching to the permian here on all your gas pipeline outlets out of the permian do you have any level of open or marketing capacity on any of those lines available to you that allows you to take some advantage of the low waha pricing there and if so yeah can you quantify the level at all yeah i mean everything that well first of all i mean we do have takeaway capacity that s existing capacity out of the permian and so we do have the opportunity to take advantage of that provide outlets for our customers but every nook and cranny is in use okay got you thank you by our customers by our customers got it thank you operator instructions and the next question comes from jeremy tonet from jp morgan your line is open hi good afternoon hi jeremy just wanted to touch base on the environment building pipeline to texas and your thoughts on house bill 991 and if there s any chance of passage there and just in general is it getting a little bit more difficult or you take a little bit more time to build pipes in texas any thoughts you could provide there sure so yeah there is the texas legislature is in session right now and so there a number of bills are being considered regarding eminent domain and modifying the existing eminent domain process we had really let me put it this way this is not a traditional land owner versus pipeline issue any longer i mean this is about the value of the permian that benefits the entire state of texas and the profound public interest that s at stake there when it comes to royalties taxes royalties going to the state to fund schools et cetera and so i think it s fair to say that people in the texas legislature understand how important it is to unlock the value of this resource in the public interest and that s what you have eminent domain for and so our view is that what will emerge from that process ultimately will be a rational properly balanced properly balanced approach to eminent domain in the meantime we are actively working with our land owner land owners in order to get consensual arrangements in place and we re using the existing process of eminent domain where that makes sense as well but we don t currently see any kind of existential threat to our projects by any stretch that s helpful thanks for that i am supposing you might not give a lot of color here but just trying to put your comments together as far as the impact of ebitda guidance here there s 50 million to 150 million of impact does that kind of bookend what we re looking at here is this a right zip code or am i off on that field we are just going to stick with the slightly down and what that implies it s not a material value got you one last one if i could imo2020 just wondering if that s any impact that you guys are seeing with regards to your storage position any benefits that you guys see out in the different storage areas outside of houston yeah john schlosser from our terminals group it s a very small amount of our business it s less than 3 and it s under long term agreement most of it here at our bostco facility but there are opportunities for a segmentation project at bostco to handle both high sulfur and low sulfur and that s one of the largest handlers of distillate in the united states there s opportunities for blending there as well has this helped like the new york market or anything else like that it has not helped the new york market our opportunity is mostly in the gulf coast but there are smaller opportunities up and down the east coast got you that s it from me thanks there are no further questions in the queue at this time good thank you very much that does conclude today s call thank you for participating you may disconnect at this time duration 63 minutes call participants more kmi analysis

the repeated calls by president donald trump for the us federal reserve to loosen its monetary policy and provide a further boost to the stock market expose the economic and political reality behind the mask of official ideology in his latest remarks contained in a tweet last sunday trump said the dow jones industrial average would be 5 000 or even 10 000 points above its present near record level if the fed had not tightened interest rates last year he demanded that the central bank resume the program of quantitative easing under which it poured trillions into the financial markets in the wake of the 2008 finance crash for more than three decades the stock market has served as the primary financial mechanism through which the american ruling class has carried out an unprecedented redistribution of wealth from the working population to the rich under democratic as well as republican administrations the dow has risen 17 fold since 1985 on the basis of a relentless assault on workers jobs and wages and cuts in education health care and other social services under obama the dow rose more than 250 percent under trump it has risen a further 32 percent the official refrain has been the lie that there is no money for schools health care housing or pensions while unlimited sums have been squandered to pay for more yachts private islands and manhattan penthouses for the modern day aristocrats along with new and more deadly conventional and nuclear weapons to prepare a new military armageddon wealth and income inequality have reached record levels consolidating the rule of the financial oligarchy over every aspect of american social and political life trump is simply declaring openly what the fed has been doing throughout this period behind the official pretence of neutrality and independence and demanding that it do more of it if there are objections to trump s comments from the new york times and other key sections of the political and media establishment on the grounds that they infringe on the fed s independence it is not because of any disagreement with the fundamental direction of his policies they are concerned that trump is seeking to transform the us central bank from the instrument of the ruling class as a whole into that of his own faction but trump s factional opponents within the ruling elite base themselves on the same forms of financial parasitism as those sections for whom the real estate swindler turned president speaks the legal mandate of the fed is to adjust monetary policy so as to ensure stable prices and maximum employment irrespective of the ups and downs of the stock market but the fed has been directly tailoring its policies to prop up the financial markets since the stock market plunge of october 1987 when wall street fell more than 22 percent in a single day and the then fed chairman alan greenspan announced that the financial spigots were open this led to what became known as the greenspan put that when the markets began to falter the fed would be ready to step in to boost them with the provision of cheap money greenspan did make one attempt to curb what he termed irrational exuberance in 1996 but such was the adverse reaction from the financial elites that it was never again attempted from then on the official mantra was that it was impossible to tell if a financial bubble was in formation and the markets had to be given their head with the fed intervening to support them when their speculative activities gave rise to a crisis this program was intensified after the financial crash of 2008 when the government doled out hundreds of billions of dollars to bail out the banks and the fed initiated its policy of quantitative easing providing trillions of dollars of ultra cheap money to ensure that the speculative binge continued and expanded at the same time it was insisted that corporate taxes had to be continually reduced this has now resulted in a situation where as a recent analysis revealed 60 us corporations appropriating billions of dollars in profits paid no tax in 2018 with some receiving a tax refund trump s latest intervention is accompanied by the claim that the us economy is powering ahead and could grow even faster if only the fed stopped holding it back but rather than indicating strength trump s ultimatums express a deepening crisis and fear that the financial house of cards will collapse unless still more money is pumped into the system claims of the underlying strength of the us economy are belied by basic facts the present interest rate of between 2 25 percent and 2 5 percent is one of the lowest in economic history but the trump administration wants it cut by at least 0 5 percent the stock market bloated by financial speculation is like a drug addict who demands more as his underlying health continues to deteriorate when the us financial markets neared bear market territory earlier this year and wall street demanded that the fed halt its policy of incremental rate increases the fed snapped into line and chairman jerome powell announced it would abandon its efforts to normalize interest rates leading to the latest rally which has pushed the dow to within a few points of its record high at the end of 2017 trump claimed that the trillions of dollars handed out in corporate tax cuts would cause the economy to roar ahead with expanded investment and the provision of well paying jobs this lie has been exposed as the vast bulk of the money the tax cuts provided has gone for share buybacks and other parasitic means of pumping more money into the coffers of the rich now the global economy upon which the us economy is dependent notwithstanding trump s claims of the success of his america first program is experiencing a significant slowdown after a brief upturn in 2017 in its latest economic outlook the international monetary fund cut its forecast for global growth warning that 70 percent of the world economy was undergoing deceleration a phenomenon concentrated in the advanced economies including the us those warnings have been underscored by the announcement on wednesday by the german government that it was halving its forecast for economic growth in 2019 to just 0 5 percent the trump administration is frightened by the prospect of a recession or even a significant slowdown in the economy fueling the growing wave of strikes and protests and transforming it into a social explosion not only in the so called rust belt areas that voted for his presidency but across the country these fears extend beyond the white house in a recent essay the head of the hedge fund bridgewater associates the multibillionaire ray dalio warned that when there is a very big gap in the economic conditions of people a downturn can lead to conflict and revolutions of one sort or another with interest rates already at historic lows dalio said he was worried what the next economic downturn will be like especially as central banks have limited ability to reverse it it is above all the fear within the ruling elite of growing socialist sentiment in the working class that underlies both trump s self proclaimed war against socialism and the bipartisan attack by the ruling elite on democratic rights
inflation that s projected to reach an eyeball popping 8 million percent this year has left venezuela saddled with the title of the world s most miserable economy the embattled south american nation topped the rankings of bloomberg s misery index which sums inflation and unemployment outlooks for 62 economies for the fifth straight year joining venezuela in the most distressed crowd are argentina south africa turkey greece and ukraine each of which retained the same rank as last year showing intense economic stress and scant progress in taming price growth and getting people back to work at the other end of the scale singapore whose central bankers gained best in world status sits pretty at third least miserable despite a one spot decline venezuela and those in the most miserable camp are in a lonely battle fighting high inflation alongside lofty jobless rates most other countries policy makers this year face a very different challenge a tricky combination of quiet inflation and lower unemployment that complicates readings on economic health and appropriate responses thailand again claimed the title of the least miserable economy though the government s unique way of tallying unemployment makes it less noteworthy than switzerland s improvement to second least and singapore managing to stay in the bottom three the us moved six spots toward 13th least miserable and the uk improved four spots to 16th least the bloomberg misery index relies on the age old concept that low inflation and unemployment generally illustrate how good an economy s residents should feel this year s scores are based on bloomberg economist surveys while prior years reflect actual data sometimes of course a low tally can be misleading in either category persistently low prices can be a sign of poor demand and too low joblessness shackles workers who want to switch to better jobs for instance the venezuelan government hasn t published economic data since 2016 analyst estimates differ substantially from bloomberg s cafe con leche index which is estimating a current inflation rate of 219 900 the price growth trend in the misery index is a change from last year when fears of creeping inflation raised scores for many countries economists surveyed by bloomberg see almost half of the 62 economies with lower inflation rates than in 2018 while a majority are forecast to see unemployment decrease the swings from 2018 are changing central bankers minds around the world emerging markets which rushed to tighten policy last year amid a stronger us dollar and lurking inflation have seen a wave of dovish calls since the start of 2019 the international monetary fund is among institutions that have repeatedly downgraded forecasts for the global economy this year russia s 17 spot deterioration in its score to the 17th most miserable economy is owed to projections of higher prices and stagnation in joblessness an inflation spike last month has complicated central bankers plans to embark on monetary policy easing yet sometimes a less miserable score isn t all it s cracked up to be japan s top 5 ranking belies weakening demand that s making it tough for the asian giant to gain traction in fighting demographic and global trade headwinds
u s west coast container import traffic plunged by 19 in the first quarter of 2019 as trump s trade war hammered china s export economy drewry maritime research reported that u s west coast ports suffered from a tariff hangover effect as transpacific container imports were down 19 from the previous quarter and down 3 from the same period last year pres trump was hammered by democrats and the mainstream media for the 11 jump in u s exports from china during the last three quarters of 2018 but drewry highlighted that container ship volumes and rates have tanked by 20 since january as chinese exporters tried to front run pres trump s ratcheting up tariffs now that the sugar rush caused by the threatened tariffs on chinese goods has passed the market is readjusting to much slower volumes and prices america s import and export trade balance was generally flat from 1950 to 1993 but the collapse of the soviet union was hailed as the end of history to launch a new era of scientific comparative advantage that would allocate economic activity to where an item could be produced better or more efficiently than in another region the nafta draft agreement creating a trilateral north american trade bloc united states canada and mexico introduced by republican president george h w bush in december 1992 incoming democrat president bill clinton and a democrat controlled congress would substantially strengthen u s job and patent protections but clinton forcefully campaigned for and signed the agreement by claiming we must recognize that the only way for a wealthy nation to grow richer is to export bill clinton s globalist doctrine essentially provided socialism for capital and free markets for labor trade economist paul krugman would win the nobel prize for supporting clinton s globalist new world order that he called an issue whose symbolic importance is much larger than its direct economic implications clinton s radical new world order economic doctrine precipitated the 1994 mexican peso crisis and the 1997 asian financial crash clinton responded to the crises by doubling down on his doctrine by supporting u s government sponsored international bank bailouts and lobbied congress to pass china s permanent recognition by the world trade organization as a tariff free most favored nation in march 2000 after 43 years of balanced trade stability the u s monthly balance of trade relentlessly expanded to a record monthly deficit of 67 8 billion by august of 2006 after a short recovery a new plunge in the trade balance kicked off the 2008 2011 great recession clinton s policies caused u s domestic manufacturing employment to crash from 15 4 of u s employment when he took office to 8 5 when pres trump took office the obvious winner was china which saw its balance of trade surplus spike from 18 billion when clinton took office to 376 billion when trump took office but the biggest winner from clinton s new world order were the globalist plutocrats that saw u s corporate profits as a percentage of gdp more than double from about 2 when clinton took office to over 4 when trump took office more importantly during the same period was the impact on income inequality the top 5 of u s income earners over the 24 years saw their after inflation adjusted earnings jump by 50 compared to a 20 increase for median earners and a 10 growth for the bottom 20 of income earners paul krugman who warned during the 2016 election campaign that donald trump s maga policies would create a global recession now claims that the trump boom record employment and fastest manufacturing job growth in three decades is unsustainable but it is china that is panicked about sustainability as the red dragon has been slashing lending rates and offering subsidies to purchase new cars and appliances to counter the contracting growth of its tax collection that fell 12 4 last month
one of the most emphasized points in the aftermath of the march 31 municipal elections has been the government s resolution to expedite the implementation of the economic agenda in coordination with the relevant public bodies and the private sector president recep tayyip erdoğan treasury and finance minister berat albayrak and other members of the economic administration and representatives of the business world underscored the importance of the 4 5 year election free period to accomplishing much needed reforms to ensure sustainable development and growth in his address at an international labor conference held by the confederation of public servants trade unions memur sen in the capital ankara president erdoğan also drew attention to the coverage of the turkish economy and politics by the international media which he described as biased in reference to an article by the british newspaper the financial times president erdoğan said we are cognizant of the fact that the underlying cause of this anti turkey campaign is the principled stance we have displayed on the issues of syria palestine yemen and egypt as well as our sensitivity concerning rising islamophobia those attacks further escalate as we raise our voice against global injustices news reports against us multiply as we highlight the double standards regarding the fight against terror and the issue of refugees president erdoğan underscored citing the lack of coverage and attention of the western media on turkey s refugee policies and fight against terrorism the financial times thursday reported that the turkish central bank had bolstered its foreign reserves with short term lending in what analysts worried was a way to overstate its buffer against any new lira crisis the article received criticism for being biased and citing anonymous resources which are described as former employees of the central bank unfortunately some quarters in the west using all their media tools are trying to say our economy has collapsed erdoğan said in his speech thursday president erdoğan underscored the economy and security focused agenda ahead during the 4 5 years heading toward 2023 the primary goal is to fortify the economy sustain growth performance based on technology and export and increase employment a 4 5 year long continuous period of action now lies ahead of our country the president noted adding as the 82 million citizens we should make the most of this period we should leave behind election debates and focus on our true agenda first and foremost the economy and security it is now time to once again cool the hot iron shake hands hug each other and reinforce our unity and solidarity our target in the upcoming 4 5 year period is to enhance our people s prosperity as well as to achieve turkey s goals for 2023 by preserving the security freedom balance and eliminating threats against our country last week reports by the financial times reuters and bloomberg on minister albayrak s meeting with investors in washington also drew criticism from the turkish government as part of international monetary fund imf and world bank spring meetings treasury and finance minister albayrak had a very busy agenda as he met representatives of international financial institutions and investors his washington program began with one on one investor meetings first with high level executives of global funds such as eaton vance carlyle group alliance bernstein blackrock bluebay asset management pimco and goldman sachs asset management which manage over 8 trillion in assets he addressed all the questions from his counterparts especially with regards to the new structural transformation package while foreign investors showed great interest in thursday s meeting the reports by reuters bloomberg and the financial times did not reflect all the aspects of the meetings and cited a couple of anonymous resources without verifying or confirming their facts with the subjects of the articles in creating a biased view of the turkish economy these news outlets initially implied that the country would not be able to overcome the currency crisis and foreign investors would refrain from investing however speaking to reporters last friday the head of the imf s european department poul thomsen said despite some issues in the turkish economy we shouldn t exaggerate the difficulties turkey is facing turkey implemented some important measures including in monetary policy over the last six months thomsen added stressing that a tight monetary policy was needed to curb inflation he also said the imf and turkey were not holding any official or secret talks outside their cooperation the president emphasized the significance of putting the interests of turkey and turkish citizens above politics and said we the 82 million citizens should set aside our differences of political opinion and act jointly as the alliance of turkey on issues that concern our country s survival this is he added was the only way to resolve the problems of public servants workers farmers industrialists and merchants to communicate its commitment of sweeping reforms to the markets turkey released a reform package on april 10 from banking to insurance the reforms will delve into all areas of the financial sector and contribute to reinforce the capital structure of private and public lenders the treasury will issue tl 28 billion worth of government debt securities to make state banks balance sheets robust a venture capital fund for the energy industry and a real estate fund will be established to manage bad loans in these two sectors in addition to the financial sector the second area for reform efforts will concentrate on inflation which soared as high as 25 percent in october 2018 and retracted to 19 71 percent in march with a view to mitigating food inflation the government will carry out structural reforms in agricultural policy turkey s reforms in the upcoming period

percent compared to 200 2 million at december 31 2018 the increase in stockholders equity from march 31 2018 was primarily attributable to an increase in additional paid in capital of 17 4 million from common stock and preferred stock issued as part of the acquisition of iab the company s issuance of 6 3 million of private placement common stock which closed in february 2019 and the issuance of 5 3 million of preferred series g stock which was issued in january 2019 retained earnings increased by 7 1 million to 40 8 million at march 31 2019 from 33 7 million at march 31 2018 due primarily to the increase in net income net of dividends paid first quarter income statement review net interest income increased by 4 5 million or 27 1 percent to 20 9 million for the first quarter of 2019 from 16 4 million for the first quarter of 2018 the increase in net interest income resulted primarily from an increase in the average balance of interest earning assets of 662 0 million or 33 6 percent to 2 629 billion for the first quarter of 2019 from 1 968 billion for the first quarter of 2018 there was an increase in the average yield on interest earning assets of 38 basis points to 4 64 percent

for the first quarter a year ago the decrease in the net interest margin was the result of the rising interest rate environment with the increase in the cost of funds outpacing the return on interest earning assets for the short term said coughlin total non interest income decreased by 1 7 million or 51 0 percent to 1 7 million for the first quarter of 2019 from 3 4 million for the first quarter of 2018 the decrease in total non interest income was primarily related to a decrease in the amount of other non interest income of 2 2 million or 97 6 percent to 53 000 for the first quarter from 2 2 million for the first quarter a year ago the decrease in other non interest income was the result of 2 2 million in proceeds from a legal settlement recognized in the first quarter of 2018 first quarter total non interest expense increased by 1 8 million or 14 7 percent to 13 8 million from 12 0 million for the first quarter of 2018 the increases in non interest expense over the prior year were largely attributable to the inclusion of iab expenses since the merger in april 2018 these increases in total non interest expense were partly offset by a decrease in merger related costs of which 145 000 was recognized in the first quarter of 2018 with no comparable expense during the first quarter of 2019 the income tax provision increased by 604 000 or 32 8 percent to 2 4 million for the first quarter of 2019 from 1 8 million for the first quarter of 2018 the increase in the income tax provision comes as a result of higher taxable income for the first quarter of 2019 as compared to that same period for 2018 the consolidated effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2019 was 31 0 percent compared to 28 4 percent for the first quarter of 2018 the higher effective tax rate in the current period primarily relates to an increase in the new jersey corporate business tax of 2 5 percent which was enacted july 1 2018 and effective retroactively to january 1 2018 asset quality the provision for loan losses decreased by 453 000 to 889 000 for the first quarter of 2019 from 1 3 million for the first quarter of 2018 non accruing loans improved to 5 7 million or 0 24 percent of

million compared to 22 5 million at december 31 2018 and 21 4 million at march 31 2018 borrowers who are in financial difficulty and who have been granted concessions that may include interest rate

march 31 2019 as compared to an allowance for loan losses of 22 4 million or 309 6 percent of non accruing loans and 0 97 percent of gross loans at december 31 2018 and an allowance of 18 3 million or 172 7 percent of non accruing loans and 1 03 percent of gross loans a year ago the decline in the allowance as a percentage of gross loans from march 31 2018 was primarily driven by the addition of iab acquired loans with no allowance for loan losses as these loans were recorded at fair value at the acquisition date the company s outstanding credit mark recorded on acquired portfolios of 238 5 million at march 31 2019 totaled 6 1 million at march 31 2019 the company s combined coverage of allowance for loan loss and credit mark on the acquired portfolios totaled 29 1 million or 1 25 percent

what do i offer as your senator i m a proven leader i lead from the front the first one in and the last out never asking others to do what i myself would not do i ve united diverse groups of men and women people from across this state the nation and world i served for more than 30 years serving during the cold war in iraq and afghanistan my life is about delivering results of my original class of 40 plus officers only three of us made it to colonel to achieve this is extremely difficult and only comes by being a person of moral character incredibly hard work personal sacrifice and delivering results if elected what is the first policy or issue you are going to tackle in the senate and how would you go about it our property tax is the 17th highest in the nation this is too much for our retirees i propose immediate relief and help for our retirees by expanding the real estate tax deferment program if you are 65 and over earn less than 80 000 annually you should be exempt from the property tax immediately penndot says that half of our major roads need repairs and half of our bridges have exceeded their life cycles to resolve this governor wolf gave us the highest gas tax in the nation he said that this high taxation was required to address our crumbling transportation network and thereby fix our roads and bridges this cost us 76 cents a gallon 18 cents federal 58 cents state penndot says it needs 1 3 billion a year to maintain our existing roads and bridges yet despite this cumbersome gas tax only 460 million was provided to repair our transportation networks since harrisburg can t be trusted with this gas tax revenue i propose that the money collected be returned to the counties to take charge of road and bridge maintenance at the local level additional priorities include defending life the single most important issue of our lifetime protecting the 2nd amendment and the right for citizens to protect themselves fighting for lower taxes rolling back government regulations crushing farmers and business owners school choice how do you think governor wolf is doing what would you like him to do differently and what would you like to see him to continue to do governor wolf s tax and spend policies are driving the elderly from their homes forcing businesses out of the state and bankrupting the state for the future generation he has supported or asked for three tax increases each year as governor for a total of twelve thus far according to the tax foundation this has made pennsylvania the 11th most taxed state in the nation with 10 2 cents of every dollar going to the state and local government the tax burden at the state and local level is 4 589 per person this is too much we need fiscal responsibility and an end to the tax and spend programs advanced by harrisburg twelve billion dollars went to welfare last year and there are generations of welfare recipients enjoying the fruits of your labors our welfare system is being abused and needs immediate reform if you wish to receive welfare there should be three prerequisites a work requirement a time limit and drug tests sarah hammond d what experience do you have that makes you qualified for the job after graduating from slippery rock university with a degree in communications i spent two years as an embroidery machine operator at legacy athletic back in my hometown of hanover earning money to pay off my student loans while i was starting to get more involved in local politics i decided to run for state house in district 169 in 2018 i gained invaluable experience and insight into how effective campaigns are run and took the time to make sure that i was reviewing my policy views while cross examining what issues are hard pressing right here in our district i am currently the director of community development for the borough of spring grove in this position i ve been learning more about local economic and environmental impacts as well as zoning land development permitting planning and all the necessary aspects of effectively running a borough i m running because i understand the struggles and responsibilities of working class people in the middle class and those trying to get into the middle class i understand how important job security is in our current paycheck to paycheck culture i was born here i was raised here and together we will represent our district to make sure everyone s voice is heard at the table more pennsylvania midterm elections q a with 169th house district candidate sarah hammond if elected what is the first policy or issue you are going to tackle in the senate and how would you go about it there are a lot of different factors that we must adequately address when looking into eradicating the opioid crisis as a whole we presently struggle to provide even a basic level of universal healthcare to our people in a state where workers haven t seen a wage increase in years we must provide alternatives that are cost efficient non lethal and far less damaging to those who are fighting to beat their addictions we incarcerate both nonviolent addicts and casual cannabis users alike who have been caught in many cases with less than an ounce of cannabis for personal recreational use as a result we have over populated our prisons with both harmless offenders and with inmates struggling with addiction who should be in detox facilities instead more adams county election who is on the primary ballot for commissioner other offices i am fighting for the legalization of adult recreational cannabis because it is a non partisan issue that has impacted to some degree every single person in pennsylvania i propose that we implement rules similar to that of nicotine and alcohol i propose that we tax those products similarly and put these taxes back into reforming our criminal justice system and i propose that we erase the felonies and misdemeanors for past and current nonviolent offenders we can utilize the revenue from these taxes to redefine addicts as survivors by providing funding for programs within detox facilities when we simply treat these individuals as criminals and force them into withdraw in jail cells we see overdoses more commonly upon reentry back on the streets how do you think governor wolf is doing what would you like him to do differently and what would you like to see him to continue to do i greatly appreciate and am directly impacted in my day to day job by governor wolf s restore pennsylvania plan this comprehensive plan addresses many pressing issues related to improving our infrastructure including an initiative focused on how we can turn blighted properties land structures in a dilapidated unsafe and most often times uninhabitable condition into sustainable long term investments within our communities funding which is proposed to come from the implementation of a reasonable severance tax on the natural gas sector will ensure that we are able to reinvest resources in our communities demolishing blighted properties within pa and redeveloping these areas often times the cost of demolishing a blighted property particularly in areas with considerably smaller tax bases can be budget breaking by using the funding from the severance tax plan restore pennsylvania is able to provide financial resources at the local level to help communities acquire and demolish blighted properties this creates the opening for more initiatives in community and economic development

hartsville s c april 18 2019 globe newswire sonoco nyse son one of the largest diversified global packaging companies today reported financial results for its first quarter ending march 31 2019 first quarter highlights first quarter 2019 gaap earnings per diluted share were 0 73 compared with 0 73 in 2018 first quarter 2019 gaap earnings included after tax charges of 12 5 million related to restructuring actions as well as non operating pension costs in the first quarter of 2018 gaap results included net after tax charges of 0 4 million as after tax restructuring charges were mostly offset by a tax benefit from the u s tax cuts and jobs acts of 2017 base net income attributable to sonoco base earnings for first quarter 2019 was 0 85 per diluted share compared with 0 74 in 2018 see base earnings definition explanation and reconciliation to gaap earnings later in this release sonoco previously provided first quarter 2019 base earnings guidance of 0 77 to 0 83 per diluted share first quarter 2019 net sales were 1 35 billion up 3 6 percent from 1 30 billion in 2018 cash flow from operations was 92 3 million in the first three months of 2019 compared with 119 8 million in 2018 free cash flow was 9 5 million compared with 44 9 million in the first quarter of 2018 see free cash flow definition and reconciliation to cash flow from operations later in this release second quarter and full year guidance update base earnings for the second quarter of 2019 are estimated to be in the range of 93 to 99 per diluted share compared to 93 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2018 full year 2019 base earnings guidance is raised to 3 52 to 3 62 per diluted share reflecting the better than expected first quarter results the company previously issued full year guidance of 3 47 to 3 57 as previously announced beginning in 2019 the company excludes all non operating components of net pension expense from base earnings in 2019 these charges are expected to total approximately 20 0 million compared to 0 2 million that were previously classified as base charges in 2018 full year 2019 operating cash flow and free cash flow guidance is unchanged at a range of 600 million to 620 million and 225 million to 245 million respectively note second quarter and full year 2019 gaap guidance are not provided in this release due to the likely occurrence of one or more of the following the timing and magnitude of which we are unable to reliably forecast possible gains or losses on the sale of businesses or other assets restructuring costs and restructuring related impairment charges acquisition related costs and the income tax effects of these items and or other income tax related events these items could have a significant impact on the company s future gaap financial results ceo comments on first quarter results commenting on the company s first quarter gaap and base performance rob tiede president and chief executive officer said sonoco produced solid first quarter results which exceeded the high end of our earnings guidance as our diverse mix of businesses successfully navigated through what can best be described as sluggish global economic conditions net sales grew by 3 6 percent while gaap net income attributable to sonoco was essentially flat both compared to last year s first quarter base net income gained 15 8 percent over the prior year period as a result of earnings from acquisitions a positive price cost relationship improvements in productivity and a lower effective tax rate which were only partially offset by modestly lower volume mix and the negative impact from foreign exchange translation gaap gross profit margin improved by 70 basis points and gaap operating profit increased 6 2 percent over the prior year s quarter while base operating profit increased 13 0 percent we were extremely pleased that each of our business segments recorded year over year improvement in operating earnings during the first quarter our consumer packaging segment reported slightly improved operating results in the first quarter while operating margin declined 19 basis points compared to last year s period however these results were significantly better than the disappointing 2018 fourth quarter results as sequentially margins improved by 291 basis points our paper and industrial converted products segment continued to drive strong results with operating margin improving 112 basis points compared to last year s first quarter in addition the turnaround in our display and packaging segment continued with operating margin expanding 348 basis points over the prior year period and our protective solutions business operating results improved slightly and operating margin expanded by 45 basis points first quarter review net sales for the first quarter were 1 35 billion an increase of 47 5 million or 3 6 percent from last year s first quarter the improvement reflects sales added by acquisitions and higher selling prices foreign exchange rate declines negatively impacted first quarter sales by approximately 38 million gaap net income attributable to sonoco in the first quarter was 73 7 million or 0 73 per diluted share a decrease of 0 4 million compared with 74 1 million or 0 73 per diluted share in 2018 first quarter gaap earnings included after tax non base charges totaling 12 5 million 8 0 million of which were after tax charges related to restructuring activities the remaining 4 5 million related almost exclusively to non operating pension costs in the first quarter of 2018 gaap earnings included 0 4 million of after tax non base net charges as after tax restructuring charges of 2 4 million were mostly offset by a tax benefit from the u s tax cuts and jobs acts of 2017 of 2 0 million adjusted for these items base earnings in the first quarter of 2019 were 86 2 million or 0 85 per diluted share an increase of 11 8 million compared with 74 4 million or 0 74 per diluted share in 2018 base earnings and base earnings per diluted share are non gaap financial measures adjusted to remove restructuring related items asset impairment charges acquisition expenses non operating pension costs and certain income tax related events and other items if any the exclusion of which the company believes improves comparability and analysis of the ongoing operating performance of the business see base earnings definition explanation and reconciliation to gaap earnings later in this release gross profit was 270 1 million in the first quarter an increase of 19 5 million or 7 8 percent compared with 250 6 million in the same period in 2018 gross profit as a percentage of sales was 20 0 percent compared with 19 2 percent in the same period in 2018 first quarter selling general and administrative expenses increased 5 1 million from the prior year to 142 6 million this increase was driven by higher expenses related to acquired businesses as absent these costs selling general and administrative expenses were slightly down compared to last year s quarter segment review sonoco reports its financial results in four operating segments consumer packaging display and packaging paper and industrial converted products and protective solutions segment operating results do not include restructuring and asset impairment charges acquisition expenses interest income and expense income taxes or certain other items if any the exclusion of which the company believes improves comparability and analysis consumer packaging sonoco s consumer packaging segment includes the following products and services round and shaped rigid containers and trays both composite and thermoformed plastic extruded and injection molded plastic products printed flexible packaging global brand artwork management and metal and peelable membrane ends and closures first quarter 2019 sales for the segment were 589 7 million compared with 569 9 million in 2018 segment operating profit was 62 1 million in the first quarter compared with 61 1 million in the same quarter of 2018 segment sales increased 3 5 percent compared to the prior year s quarter due to sales added from acquisitions and higher selling prices partially offset by lower volume mix and the negative impact of foreign exchange higher sales volume in rigid paper containers in europe and north america were more than offset by declines in rigid plastics as adverse weather impacted the fresh fruit harvest in north america segment operating profit increased 1 7 percent compared to the prior year s quarter as the benefit of acquisitions productivity improvements and a positive price cost relationship were partially offset by weaker volume and the negative impact of foreign exchange these items resulted in segment operating margin declining slightly to 10 5 percent in the quarter from 10 7 percent in 2018 display and packaging the display and packaging segment includes the following products and services designing manufacturing assembling packing and distributing temporary semi permanent and permanent point of purchase displays supply chain management services including contract packing fulfillment and scalable service centers retail packaging including printed backer cards thermoformed blisters and heat sealing equipment and paper amenities such as coasters and glass covers first quarter 2019 sales for this segment were 137 6 million compared with 142 7 million in 2018 the segment reported an operating profit of 6 5 million in the current quarter compared with an operating profit of 1 7 million in the prior year s quarter sales declined 3 6 percent compared to last year s quarter as volume growth in domestic displays and international pack centers was more than offset by reduced revenue from exiting the atlanta pack center contract segment operating profit improved 4 8 million due to higher volume mix improved productivity and the non recurrence of operating losses at the atlanta pack center paper and industrial converted products the paper and industrial converted products segment includes the following products paperboard tubes cones and cores fiber based construction tubes wooden metal and composite wire and cable reels and spools and recycled paperboard linerboard corrugating medium recovered paper and material recycling services first quarter 2019 sales for the segment were 496 0 million up from 460 7 million in 2018 segment operating profit was 48 4 million in the quarter compared with 39 8 million in 2018 segment sales increased 7 7 percent from the prior year s quarter due to sales added from the conitex acquisition and higher sales prices these positive factors were partially offset by lower volume mix and the negative impact of changes in foreign exchange rates in the quarter tube and core volume was weak across most of the globe while paperboard and corrugated medium volume declined in the u s canada segment operating profit improved 21 6 percent over the prior year s quarter driven by a positive price cost relationship the incremental earnings from conitex and productivity improvements all partially offset by lower volume mix impact segment operating margin improved 112 basis points to 9 8 percent protective solutions the protective solutions segment includes the following products custom engineered paperboard based and expanded foam protective packaging and components and temperature assured packaging first quarter 2019 sales were 128 4 million down from 131 0 million in 2018 operating profit was 11 0 million a 3 0 percent increase from the first quarter of 2018 this segment s sales were modestly lower year over year due primarily to lower volume mix as strong sales growth for temperature assured packaging was offset by declines in molded foam and consumer fiber packaging segment operating profit improved modestly as productivity improvements were mostly offset by a negative price cost relationship segment operating margin compared to the prior year quarter improved 45 basis points to 8 6 percent corporate tax net interest expense for the first quarter of 2019 increased to 15 4 million compared with 13 4 million during the same period in 2018 primarily due to increased expense from higher u s interest rates and reduced interest income on lower offshore cash balances the 2019 first quarter effective tax rates on gaap and base earnings were 23 7 percent and 24 1 percent respectively compared with 24 1 percent and 25 9 percent respectively in the prior year s quarter the lower 2019 gaap and base effective tax rates were attributable to a decreased impact of the global intangible low taxed income gilti tax as well as an increased tax benefit from equity based compensation the effective rate on gaap earnings decreased to a lesser extent due to the 2018 benefit of one time adjustments related to the u s tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 cash flow and free cash flow for the first quarter of 2019 cash generated from operations was 92 3 million compared with 119 8 million in 2018 a decrease of 27 5 million this decrease was driven by a 19 0 million increase in cash consumption by working capital while the seasonal changes in business activity consumed cash in both periods this increase was more meaningful in 2019 due to greater year over year increases in business activity from the prior year s end additionally accrued management incentives paid in the first quarter of 2019 were higher than those paid in the first quarter of 2018 free cash flow for the first three months of 2019 was 9 5 million compared with 44 9 million in the same period last year reflecting the 27 5 million decrease in cash flow from operations discussed above the remaining decrease in free cash flow was driven by current quarter increases in net capital expenditures and cash dividends which were 41 7 million and 41 1 million respectively compared with 36 0 million and 38 8 million respectively in 2018 see free cash flow description and reconciliation later in this release free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operations minus net capital expenditures and cash dividends net capital expenditures are defined as capital expenditures minus proceeds from and or plus costs incurred in the disposition of capital assets as of march 31 2019 total debt was approximately 1 41 billion compared with 1 39 billion as of december 31 2018 and the company had a total debt to total capital ratio of 43 9 percent at end of the first quarter unchanged from year end 2018 cash and cash equivalents were 124 3 million as of march 31 2019 compared with 120 4 million at december 31 2018 second quarter and full year 2019 outlook sonoco expects second quarter 2019 base earnings to be in the range of 93 to 99 per diluted share base earnings in the second quarter of 2018 were 93 per diluted share full year 2019 base earnings per diluted share are expected to be in a range of 3 52 to 3 62 which is an increase from the previous estimate of 3 47 to 3 57 per diluted share based on the lower than expected first quarter effective tax rate the company now estimates the full year 2019 tax rate will be 25 5 percent operating and free cash flow for 2019 is expected to be in the range of 600 million to 620 million and 225 million to 245 million respectively which is unchanged from previous guidance although the company believes the assumptions reflected in the range of guidance are reasonable given uncertainty regarding the impact of new and potential tariffs the future performance of the overall economy potential changes in raw material prices and other costs as well as other risks and uncertainties including those described further below actual results could vary substantially commenting on the company s outlook tiede said we re off to a solid start to 2019 and we remain optimistic that we have the initiatives in place to achieve our targets for profitable growth improved operating margins and strong free cash flow that said we must also be realistic about the balance of the year as global economic conditions showed some weakness to start the year and the uncertainty of tariffs trade disputes and regional policy concerns are still hanging over business and consumer confidence in the next few weeks we will celebrate sonoco s 120th anniversary and given our strong foundation we are confident that our people our products and our portfolio have us well positioned to compete in a changing market environment while achieving

relating to restructuring initiatives asset impairment charges non operating pension costs or income environmental charges acquisition related costs gains or losses from the disposition of businesses excess property insurance recoveries pension settlement costs and certain other items if any including other income tax related adjustments and or events the exclusion of which management believes improves comparability and analysis of the ongoing operating performance of the business these adjustments which are referred to as non base result in the non gaap financial measures referred to in this press release as base earnings and base earnings per diluted share these non gaap measures are not in accordance with or an alternative for generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non gaap measures used by other companies in addition these non gaap measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles sonoco continues to provide all information required by gaap but it believes that evaluating its ongoing operating results may not be as useful if an investor or other user is limited to reviewing only gaap financial measures sonoco uses these non gaap financial measures for internal planning and forecasting purposes to evaluate its ongoing operations and to evaluate the ultimate performance of each business unit against plan forecast all the way up through the evaluation of the chief executive officer s performance by the board of directors in addition these same non gaap measures are used in determining incentive compensation for the entire management team and in providing earnings guidance to the investing community sonoco management does not nor does it suggest that investors should consider these non gaap financial measures in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with gaap sonoco presents these non gaap financial measures to provide users information to evaluate sonoco s operating results in a manner similar to how management evaluates business performance material limitations associated with the use of such measures are that they do not reflect all period costs included in operating expenses and may not reflect financial results that are comparable to financial results of other companies that present similar costs differently furthermore the calculations of these non gaap measures are based on subjective determinations of management regarding the nature and classification of events and circumstances that the investor may find material and view differently to compensate for these limitations management believes that it is useful in understanding and analyzing the results of the business to review both gaap information which includes all of the items impacting financial results and the non gaap measures that exclude certain elements as described above whenever sonoco uses a non gaap financial measure except with respect to guidance it provides a reconciliation of the non gaap financial measure to the most closely applicable gaap financial measure whenever reviewing a non gaap financial measure investors are encouraged to fully review and consider the related reconciliation as detailed below second quarter and full year 2019 gaap guidance are not provided in this release due to the likely occurrence of one or more of the following the timing and magnitude of which we are unable to reliably forecast possible gains or losses on the sale of businesses or other assets restructuring costs and restructuring related

several years to fully implement and the company is continually seeking to take actions that could enhance its efficiency although recurring these charges are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period due to the varying levels of restructuring activity and the inherent imprecision in the estimates used to recognize the impairment of assets and the wide variety of costs and taxes associated with severance and termination benefits in the countries in which the restructuring actions occur 2 these amounts are primarily non operating pension expenses beginning in 2019 the company excludes from base earnings the full amount reported on the income statement as non operating pension costs income the key drivers to this expense income are primarily the financial markets or specific events thus the impact on earnings is not directly related to the company s operations also included are costs related to acquisitions and potential acquisitions and divestitures 3 these amounts include the effect of the change in the us corporate tax rate on deferred tax adjustments totaling a gain of 1 975 and a small gain from a casualty loss insurance settlement partially offset by costs related to acquisitions and potential acquisitions these amounts also include all amounts related to non operating pension costs income as discussed in footnote 2 above more

87 county attorneys especially in greater minnesota to improve safety and do justice for people and communities i m continuing some great consumer protection and anti trust work that the attorney general s office has done over the years in these core areas lawsuits against insulin manufacturers opioid manufacturers internet providers and others for practices that we believe have defrauded minnesotans of their ability to afford their lives we re also making a concerted effort to support people who ve fallen victim to tech support scams and to help students when their higher education institutions have engaged in fraud or have abruptly closed i m building on that foundation with the help of the talented team of attorneys investigators legal assistants consumer specialists and support staff in the attorney general s office i m also leading some new work in the core areas of the job lowering pharmaceutical drug prices people are having to choose between affording their lives or staying alive because the price of pharmaceutical drugs has skyrocketed the price of insulin alone has gone up 1200 in 20 years i ve convened a task force to come up with legal legislative

the attorney general s office many of the small county attorney offices in greater minnesota need our help when they have a big case twenty years ago we had 12 attorneys who assisted them in trying homicides other violent crimes gang and drug related crime and white collar crime today we only have one attorney who assists them full time and only with homicides with governor walz s support i ve

supporting tenants as consumers the attorney general s office has done useful work over the years in producing and updating a legally required handbook about tenants and landlords rights i ve begun expanding that work to include a focus on tenants as consumers of a necessary life sustaining good housing much of our work is focused on what we can do right here in minnesota there have been times in the last 100 days though when the federal government hasn t done its job of protecting all americans when that s happened i ve stepped up to protect the people of minnesota i ve defended workplace safety and healthy school lunches for our kids defended affordable access to healthcare defended our immigrant neighbors defended a fair count in the 2020 census defended women s rights to control their own health and bodies defended workers against abusive payday lenders defended the unions that have built the american middle class and defended minnesota s resources against a unconstitutional

hesitate to use the tools of my office to protect minnesotans i m proud of the work we ve done in 100 days and grateful to everyone who works for the attorney general s office for their dedication to and support of it but i m not satisfied after four decades of a systematic assault on the regulatory system that once created family supporting jobs that lifted americans into the middle class and kept them healthy well fed well housed and well educated there s a lot more to do how we ve done it just as important as what we ve accomplished in 100 days is how we ve accomplished it by making a shift in the attorney general s office to a culture of transparency cooperation and inclusion this has taken many forms we re holding listening and outreach sessions around minnesota northern southern suburban urban even in two prisons we re nearing 10 of them so far with more to come through the spring and summer i ve heard everywhere that minnesotans are struggling to keep up and expect

this article is more than 4 years old associated press the market might take a hit from thursday s release of a redacted mueller report on whether trump obstructed justice or colluded with the russians or not barring a bombshell that everyone can agree is a bombshell then any market slide will be temporary the fed will keep this market alive for starters robert mueller supposedly said in the report that he lacked the confidence to totally clear trump on numerous obstruction of justice matters but attorney general william barr and his deputy rod rosenstein hardly someone in trump s back pocket said those obstructions were not criminal washington will keep this story alive until the election anyway and wall street knows it unless barr outright lied about trump s dealings with russians in the 2016 presidential campaign there is no bombshell and the market will continue apace fueled by a defanged jerome powell s federal reserve as everyone knows the year started off with investors expected two to four rate hikes now there are none stocks have risen ever since investor business and consumer sentiment remains strong for once the fed might not kill a growing economy unless there is an acceleration in wages then we are good on rates says scott clemons chief investment strategist for brown brothers harriman let it ride on monday chicago fed chief charles evans a dove who votes on the fed s open markets committee this year and next said he saw no reason to move on rates until fall 2020 evans also added that interest rates could move either way up or down which is highly vague not to mention obvious 2019 bloomberg finance lp we believe rates are more likely to move lower if anything says vladimir signorelli head of brettonwoods research in new jersey then there is st louis fed chief jim bullard who last week said that normalization of interest rates is now over good bye 4 treasury yields a number many believed was right around the corner just three short months ago for the uber dovish bullard his concern is in a sustained inversion of the yield curve often a precursor to a recession only sourpuss bears see a recession at this point despite a very late business cycle and a 10 year record breaking economic expansion that started with the fed in the obama presidency the base case is a slower economy but not a contracting one 2019 bloomberg finance lp jp morgan ceo jamie dimon said last week he saw no signs of a slowdown and with the fed on pause it s even clearer to see a stable to growing economy at least until trump s last year in office whether or not that helps him remains to be seen trump criticized powell in november and december saying his rate hikes were erasing fiscal stimulus signed into law in trump s first year many cried foul saying he was interfering with the fed s independence then in january during a conversation with former fed leaders janet yellen and ben bernanke at the american economic association s annual meeting in atlanta powell looked the odd man out both yellen and bernanke said economic growth cycles don t just die on their own they are killed by the fed the fed s hawkish camp is in being dismantled the latest dovish rhetoric comes on the heels of a much more assertive larry kudlow trump s economic advisor who now argues for a rate cut it is unlikely he will get his way 2019 bloomberg finance lp meanwhile with the white house adopting a personnel is policy approach kudlow has been instrumental in promoting the potential nominations of people like steve moore and herman cain moore has begun to champion the idea of using commodities as a guide for monetary policy both were critical of powell s hawkishness in 2018 trump wants to take a buzzsaw through the fed the argument for further rate increases would be fiercely resisted by cain and moore should they make it on the board at the fed associated press inflation remains benign thanks to advancements in technologies which have lowered the cost of production and transportation moreover american households have deleveraged they are spending again but a good job market and decent wage growth mean there are competing demands for that new dollar income household debt to income has risen over time hitting 134 in 2008 in 2018 it was 99 due to deleveraging household debt is rising again but household income is rising faster if people were feeling over confident in their finances and were maxing out the credit card to take a vacation then debt levels would rise faster than income and you d see inflation go up says harriman that s the animal spirits it s hard to predict that but it is what the fed will have to watch going forward he says the near term market outlook for mueller time sideways heading into the summer months markets tend to sell off anyway but with the fed on defense investors are confident that equity markets will appreciate and the economic growth story remains in place as long as rate hawks don t start pitching their tent again in this summer

a noticeable shift has taken place on wall street and among many economists and business leaders in recent weeks fears of an imminent recession have faded and been replaced with cautious optimism especially about 2020 a trend that bodes well for us president donald trump as he seeks reelection fading recession fears are good news for donald trump s chances of remaining in the white house credit ap the international monetary fund is a good example it made headlines last week when it slashed its global growth forecast to the lowest pace since the financial crisis but it is not as gloomy as it sounds the imf also predicted a rebound for later this year and slightly stronger growth next year for the world economy which should be a positive for the united states after the weak start growth is projected to pick up in the second half of 2019 wrote imf chief economist gita gopinath in a blog post the imf isn t alone in its optimism the us stock market had one of its best starts to the year since 1998 and is now within striking distance of hitting an all time high goldman sachs says the likelihood a recession in the next year has been cut in half to 10 per cent

use the lexology getting the deal through tool to compare the answers in this article with those from other jurisdictions market overview high yield debt securities versus bank loans discuss the major differences between high yield debt securities and bank loans in your jurisdiction what are some of the critical advantages and disadvantages the major difference between high yield debt securities and bank loans in the us is that securities are governed by securities laws as a result there are disclosure obligations that issuers must abide by the regulatory aspect of a securities offering adds a layer of legal liability on parties participating in the offering and parties generally have to follow the disclosure standards in accordance with the securities laws here is an example to illustrate the point assume that company a wants to buy company b company a would prefer to issue high yield debt securities to finance the acquisition but company b is a private company that has no audited financial statements assuming this is a significant acquisition for company a it would need company b s historical financial statements as well as pro forma financial statements as part of its required disclosure to investors under the securities laws in many situations such as this instead of forcing company b to prepare the requisite financial statements which may be costly and time consuming company a may instead decide to turn to the loan market which is not subject to the same regulatory regime another key difference is that high yield indentures are generally difficult to amend and this is one of the primary reasons that high yield covenant are more flexible than traditional credit agreements credit agreement amendments are fairly common and credit agreement covenant packages are often designed to require a borrower to seek consent from its lenders for material departures from its ordinary course of business high yield debt securities however are securities that are usually widely held and high yield investors traditionally do not expect to be approached for consent except in special circumstances in addition unlike the administrative agent under a typical credit agreement the trustee under a high yield indenture is not expected to closely monitor or be in frequent contact with an issuer instead amending a high yield indenture requires a formal consent solicitation process that follows an established market practice which is time consuming and costly for the issuer and may create hold up value for the investors regulation are you seeing increased regulation regarding either high yield debt securities or bank loans in your jurisdiction regulation regarding high yield debt securities is always changing as the securities and exchange commission sec adds rules clarifies rules or makes other changes to the regulations in addition following the 2008 global financial crisis we are seeing more federal regulation for example there are certain limitations on banks ability to hold securities for their own account which can create certain complicated issues in leveraged financing situations further we were starting to see more regulation of bank loans again following the 2008 global financial crisis more laws have been passed limiting the ability of banks to make loans in certain situations where leverage would be viewed as being too high having said all that the trump administration has begun easing certain regulations imposed on banks during the 2008 global financial crisis this is a constantly evolving issue and we will see how it unfolds in the coming months current market activity describe the current market activity and trends in your jurisdiction relating to high yield debt securities financings in general 2017 was a very busy year for issuers in part aided by president trump s pro business agenda commodity prices rebounded and more oil and gas companies re entered the high yield market in general there was less volatility in 2017 compared with 2016 at the time of writing market activity has been fairly robust but certainly more volatile than what we saw in 2017 there is a feeling that volatility is back driven by fears of inflation a looming recession rising interest rates and fear about the newly issued trump tariffs on steel as a result we expect that issuance levels will be on par with 2017 but with increased volatility a typical high yield covenant package will include incurrence based covenants ie there are typically no maintenance covenants and companies must only test the covenants at the time of taking a certain action which include limitations on incurring debt incurring liens making restricted payments and investments entering into transactions with affiliates entering into mergers and sales of all or substantially all assets consummating asset sales and consummating change of control transactions almost all high yield debt securities are guaranteed by the issuer s subsidiaries which guarantee the bank facility and other material debt of the issuer most high yield debt securities are held by qualified institutional buyers ie institutions knowledgeable about the instrument increased overlap between investors in high yield debt securities and loan financings has been noted main participants identify the main participants in a high yield debt financing in your jurisdiction and outline their roles and fees the key participants in a high yield debt financing in the united states are the banks which play the role of the underwriters or initial purchasers in an unregistered deal the underwriters have three main responsibilities they manage the process for the issuer among other things they create the timeline prepare the issuer for meetings with investors create roadshow schedules and bring the issuer on the roadshow to meet with investors they are responsible for marketing the offering for the issuer for example the offering document for a high yield debt security will typically have a summary section upfront commonly referred to as the box and it will contain among other things strengths and strategies of the company which is the marketing element of the disclosure document the underwriters play an important part in crafting the marketing story for the issuer and they act as the gatekeepers for the market in terms of the covenant package being negotiated as opposed to bank loans the underwriters typically do not hold the high yield debt securities on their books but are viewed as the experts in terms of what the market will and will not bear as it relates to covenant packages for their services the underwriters will receive a gross spread tied to their allocation of the aggregate principal amount of securities being offered there are other participants in a high yield debt financing but none play as big a role as the banks lawyers play a crucial role representing the company on the one hand and the banks on the other accountants also play an important role in advising the company on financial presentation in the offering document and delivering a comfort letter to the underwriters rating agencies are always involved because they have to provide a rating on the proposed high yield debt security which is obviously critical for execution of the deal and finally there is the trustee the trustee retains its own counsel on any transaction and receives fairly standard flat fees in connection with each engagement new trends describe any new trends as they relate to the covenant package structure regulatory review or other aspects of high yield debt securities the trends in high yield are always changing based on the state of the market for example when the market is hot and there is much demand for high yield paper issuers and sponsors start to forge ahead as a result there tends to be flexibility in the covenants primarily in terms of incurring debt and liens and making restricted payments as the market cools off and investors become more selective in terms of the paper they are willing to buy covenant packages start to tighten up documentation terms issuance how are high yield debt securities issued in your jurisdiction are there particular precedents or models that companies and investors tend to review prior to issuing the securities every high yield debt security is issued pursuant to an offering memorandum or prospectus in a registered deal provided to prospective investors the offering memorandum describes the business of the company and the transaction being undertaken and it contains the covenant package being offered to investors there are always precedents and models that need to be reviewed prior to issuing the securities in a sponsor leveraged buyout scenario the issuer and sponsor will normally look to the last deal completed by that sponsor every sponsor has a form for its covenants and while every covenant package will be tailored to the particular needs of each issuer and its industry the sponsor form is the starting point for such deals if the issuer has issued high yield debt securities in the past then the prior covenant package is the appropriate starting point for the new issuance however for debut high yield issuers typically the deal team will look at a combination of the lead bank s form recent sponsor precedent recent precedents in the issuer s particular industry and recent precedents for issuers with a similar credit profile maturity and call structure what is the typical maturity and call structure of a high yield debt security are high yield securities frequently issued with original issue discount describe any yield protection provisions typically included in the high yield debt securities documentation high yield debt securities generally tend to have either an eight year or a 10 year maturity however in 2017 we saw an increased number of issuers issuing high yield debt securities with a five year maturity in order to get a cheaper coupon in general high yield debt securities are not redeemable at the option of the issuer for a specified number of years permitting investors to lock in an interest rate for a significant period for example after a five year non call period 10 year securities are typically redeemable at a redemption price equal to par plus half the coupon and the premium then declines to par two years before maturity for eight year securities the usual formulation is a four year non call period after which the securities are redeemable at a redemption price equal to par plus half the coupon declining to par sometimes however eight year securities with a three year non call period are issued in which case the redemption price after the non call period is typically equal to par plus 75 per cent of the coupon although an increasing number of three year non call deals have the first step down at 50 per cent of the coupon declining to par make whole redemption allows issuers to call the securities during the non call period at a price equal to the present value of the optional redemption price on the first optional redemption date and scheduled interest payments up to that date the present value is almost always calculated based on the treasury rate plus 50 basis points which approximates the price that investors would expect to receive in a tender offer another significant exception to the non call period is the ability of an issuer to redeem a portion of the securities with the proceeds of an equity offering during the first three years following the issuance date commonly referred to as the equity clawback or equity claw this exception which is nearly universal in high yield offerings permits the issuer to deleverage after an initial public offering or after raising additional equity capital typically issuers may not redeem more than 35 per cent of the original principal amount of the securities in an equity claw although 40 per cent is possible in some deals the issuer must pay a redemption price to investors equal to par plus a premium equal to the full coupon plus accrued interest a less common exception to the non call period is in the case of secured notes the ability of the issuer to redeem a small portion typically 10 per cent of the outstanding securities during each of the three years after the issue date at a specified premium to par typically 103 per cent this provision is much less common than the equity claw provision described above one rationale for the inclusion of this provision is that secured notes became prevalent in the marketplace during the global financial crisis in 2008 and often substituted for secured term loans while term loans are generally prepayable at par many terms loans include a soft call at 101 per cent feature for a short period after the closing date with the proceeds of another financing so some issuers sought to mimic this type of redemption feature for secured notes as a result in capital structures where secured notes exist alongside secured credit facilities it is sometimes possible to redeem up to 10 per cent of the notes in any 12 month period during the first three years following issuance at a price equal to 103 per cent plus accrued interest occasionally such 10 per cent exception can also be found in unsecured notes too particularly floating rate notes the redemption features are not mutually exclusive offerings how are high yield debt securities offerings launched priced and closed how are coupons determined do you typically see fixed or floating rates the timeline of a typical high yield offering is as follows an offering is launched by the distribution of the red ie the preliminary offering memorandum or prospectus to investors which is often accompanied by a press release for a debut issuer or a significant transaction the issuer may then go on the road to meet with investors while the banks are building the order book a formal roadshow can be as short as three days and as long as two weeks the bankers will determine the length of the roadshow and they will instruct accounts that books will close by a certain time on the final day of the roadshow which is the deadline for submitting an order in the security after the books have closed the bankers will schedule a pricing call with the issuer and the bankers and the issuer will agree to the terms of the deal eg the coupon issue price maturity and call schedule most high yield debt securities are issued at a fixed coupon and the coupon is determined as a result of investor demand many factors lead to the determination of the coupon including the general market prevailing interest rates the health and stability of the issuer the issuer s industry the covenant package the maturity of the high yield debt securities and the financial performance of the issuer after the pricing call a pricing term sheet is sent to investors to confirm sales coinciding with the signing of the underwriting agreement or purchase agreement in an unregistered deal between the issuer and the underwriters pursuant to which the underwriters agree to purchase the securities from the issuer once a securities transaction is priced the securities begin trading as part of the pricing terms the parties will also schedule a closing date which is typically done on a t 2 basis therefore two business days after pricing the securities offering will close under certain circumstances however closing may be done on a t 5 or even a t 10 basis note that for a repeat high yield issuer launch and pricing are often accelerated to a single day known as a drive by offering in other words the offering launches before the market opens followed by single or multiple investor calls followed by pricing later that afternoon if the market is familiar with the issuer the need to have a formal roadshow to meet with accounts is generally not required resulting in an accelerated process covenants describe the main covenants restricting the operation of the debtor s business in a typical high yield debt securities transaction have you been seeing a convergence of covenants between the high yield and bank markets high yield covenants always need to strike a delicate balance on the one hand the covenants provide protection for high yield investors against an issuer overextending itself or using cash unwisely on the other hand the covenants must provide flexibility for the issuer to operate its business and grow over the life of the high yield debt securities in other words the covenants protect the investors ability to be paid principal and interest on the securities while preserving the issuer s ability to run its business without undue restrictions the high yield covenant package is focused on regulating the ability of the issuer and its restricted subsidiaries to service their debt and achieve the balance described above high yield covenants are generally flexible in permitting different types of transaction between the issuer and its restricted subsidiaries or among restricted subsidiaries in many cases regardless of whether those restricted subsidiaries are guarantors or non guarantors while each high yield covenant package is distinct the main covenants are as follows limitation on restricted payments this is often called the rp covenant the rp covenant regulates the amount of cash and other assets that may flow out of the issuer and its restricted subsidiaries it limits cash dividends and other distributions the redemption or repurchase of the issuer s capital stock the redemption or repurchase of subordinated debt obligations prior to their scheduled maturity and restricted investments which are investments that are not defined as permitted investments limitation on indebtedness the debt covenant restricts the amount and the type of debt the issuer can incur limitation on liens the lien covenant is focused on protecting the high yield investors position in the capital structure by regulating the incurrence of secured debt that may be effectively senior to or pari passu with the high yield debt securities and ensuring that the securities have a senior priority lien on collateral that secures any junior debt limitation on asset sales unlike a traditional credit agreement high yield debt securities do not place strict limits on asset sales instead the high yield asset sale covenant establishes guidelines that must be followed in any asset sale and permits the issuer to use the proceeds either to reinvest in the business or to prepay debt that ranks higher than or equal to the high yield debt securities in the capital structure if the issuer does not use the proceeds in this way it is required to offer to repurchase the high yield debt securities at par plus accrued interest limitation on affiliate transactions the limitation on affiliate transactions covenant limits the issuer s ability to enter into transactions with affiliates unless those transactions are on terms no less favourable than would be available for similar transactions with unrelated third parties the covenants are designed to prevent value from leaking out from the issuer to affiliates that are not subject to the covenants of the indenture reporting the reporting covenant is aimed at ensuring the flow of information that high yield investors need to support trading in the high yield debt securities and to monitor the performance of the issuer mergers and consolidations the merger and consolidation covenant is designed to prevent a business combination in which the surviving obligor for the high yield debt securities is not financially healthy as measured by a ratio test the covenant also seeks to ensure that noteholders will have enforceable rights against the surviving entity in a merger consolidation or transfer of all or substantially all the assets of the issuer or a subsidiary guarantor future guarantors the future guarantors covenant is designed to make sure that if a subsidiary of the issuer is guaranteeing other debt the noteholders get the benefit of that guarantee as a result the common formulation is that if a restricted subsidiary guarantees the bank facility of the issuer that entity will guarantee the high yield debt securities as well in addition if the issuer decides to issue new high yield debt securities the guarantor package will be the same across both tranches of securities change of control the change of control covenant requires that the issuer purchase the high yield debt securities from noteholders at a price equal to 101 per cent plus accrued interest if a change of control of the issuer takes place the change of control put right is a defining feature of high yield debt securities note that for covenants appearing highly restrictive there is a set of baskets and exceptions giving the issuer the flexibility it needs to operate its business and grow over the life of the high yield debt securities the exceptions are limitless and they are highly negotiated are you seeing any tightening of covenants or are you seeing investor protections being eroded are terms of covenants often changed between the launch and pricing of an offering as mentioned above any tightening or loosening of covenants typically tracks the overall market or the particular industry in the past couple of years or so there have been more instances of covenants being changed between the launch and the pricing of an offering as investors get more selective and as investors have more time to digest a particular covenant package there are likely to be more changes to it sometimes the changes can be fairly benign such as reducing a particular basket size or tweaking a particular definition at times however the change can be more drastic such as the wholesale introduction of a new covenant are there particular covenants that are looser or tighter based on a particular industry sector the energy sector is a good example of an industry sector with looser covenants typically the formation of a joint venture will trip the restricted payments covenant discussed above most high yield covenant packages will have some kind of a basket specific to joint ventures that will allow an issuer to make investments in joint ventures up to a certain dollar threshold as these structures are the backbone of the energy industry however there is a separate exception referred to as the permitted business investment exception this exception simply allows the issuer to make unlimited investments as long as it is the kind of investment that is customary or is becoming customary in the energy sector as the sector has revived following the prolonged downturn however there have been increased instances of investors demanding tighter covenants change of control do changes of control asset sales or similar typically trigger any prepayment requirements as discussed in question 9 a change of control typically requires the issuer to offer to prepay the bonds at 101 per cent plus accrued interest asset sales only trigger a prepayment obligation at par plus accrued interest if the issuer does not use the asset sale proceeds in a manner permitted by the asset sale covenant ie reinvest in the business or pay down debt if an issuer is unable to apply the net proceeds of an asset sale in the manner and in the time allowed under the covenant it must then make an offer to acquire the bonds at par plus accrued interest once the excess proceeds reach a negotiated threshold if the offer is oversubscribed then the issuer must purchase the bonds on a pro rata basis if the offer is undersubscribed then the issuer can use the remainder for general corporate purposes and the excess proceeds amount is reset to zero do you see the inclusion of double trigger change of control provisions tied to a ratings downgrade a double trigger change of control put option has slowly crept into some high yield debt securities from the investment grade world in recent years in a double trigger change of control put the put is triggered only if there is both a change of control and a ratings downgrade from one or more rating agencies within a specified period following the announcement of a transaction that will be a change of control the double trigger concept in effect shifts to rating agencies the determination as to whether the change of control is positive for investors rather than permitting individual noteholders to decide whether to put their securities based on their views of the transaction the double trigger provision puts rating agencies in the position of assessing the effect of the transaction on the financial health of the issuer on behalf of investors double trigger change of control provisions in high yield offerings are more likely to be encountered for issuers which may be on the cusp of reaching investment grade status such as issuers with split high yield or investment grade ratings from the rating agencies during the past year however there have been more instances of investors pushing back on the double trigger concept and demanding a more standard change of control provision crossover covenants is there the concept of a crossover covenant package in your jurisdiction for issuers who are on the verge of being investment grade and if so what are some of the key covenant differences yes crossover covenant packages are common for issuers with split high yield or investment grade ratings from rating agencies as well as for issuers on the cusp of being investment grade a typical crossover covenant package will be similar to a typical high yield covenant package except that there is usually only a limitation on secured debt and the covenant is often accompanied by an exception allowing an issuer to secure debt up to a negotiated percentage of its consolidated net tangible assets there is typically no restricted payments covenant and the change of control covenant is usually a double trigger regulation disclosure requirements describe the disclosure requirements applicable to high yield debt securities financings is there a particular regulatory body that reviews or approves such disclosure requirements high yield debt securities are typically sold on either the public market or the 144a market securities sold on the 144a market typically include an obligation to complete a back end exchange offer which is an offer to allow holders to exchange the privately placed securities for freely transferable sec registered securities within a specified period after the closing the back end requirement reduces or can even eliminate any negative impact on the coupon of the notes from their having been sold as relatively less liquid 144a securities that can only be traded among sophisticated institutions at least during a specified period in addition some buy side investors operate under investment guidelines that limit the amount of securities they can buy without back end registration rights after the adoption of sarbanes oxley and the related sec rules and regulations however private companies have begun to resist the obligation of back end exchange offers and are increasingly opting for 144a for life transactions that do not contemplate registration rights these companies point to the added burdens of sarbanes oxley and related sec rules and the resulting increase in expenses in addition the number of 144a for life deals has increased owing to a rise in the number of secured high yield deals the reporting requirements of rule 3 16 of regulation s x which requires financial statements in sec registered deals for certain subsidiaries whose securities are pledged as collateral are onerous and costly indentures for sec registered notes must also comply with the trust indenture act of 1939 which imposes extra requirements on issuers of secured notes issuers of 144a for life securities can avoid these complications to offer the securities on a registered basis the issuer must meet the disclosure requirements set forth by the sec predominantly regulation s k which governs what needs to be included regarding the description of the business risks and trends among others and regulation s x which governs what needs to be included in terms of financial statements while a 144a deal with back end exchange rights or a 144a for life deal requires no sec filing or approval at the time of issuing in practice the disclosure requirements are substantially similar with certain caveats for example a registered deal requires executive compensation information which is burdensome and costly to put together most people take the position in a 144a deal that such information is not material to debt investors and as a result it is rarely included in the offering document overall however the disclosure requirements applicable to a 144a deal as compared with a registered deal are the same the key difference is execution and timing since a 144a deal is not subject to sec review it enables issuers to access the market more quickly and efficiently use of proceeds are there any limitations on the use of proceeds from an issuance of high yield securities by an issuer none other than in violation of any anti terrorism anti money laundering or similar laws restrictions on investment on what grounds if any could an investor be precluded from investing in high yield securities as noted in question 15 most high yield debt securities are issued on a 144a basis rule 144a under the securities act of 1933 allows private resales to qualified institutional buyers such securities are also often concurrently sold to non us investors pursuant to regulation s under the securities act of 1933 as a result the type of distribution used for selling the securities will dictate the types of investors permitted to participate in the offering closing mechanics are there any particular closing mechanics in your jurisdiction that an issuer of high yield debt securities should be aware of closing mechanics in the united states are fairly uniform but can be complicated in addition in cross border transactions or if securities are issued in a non us dollar denomination settlement will be increasingly more complicated for a typical high yield issuance as noted earlier once the securities are priced they are actively trading and then they typically settle in three business days guarantees and security guarantees outline how guarantees among companies in a group typically operate in a high yield deal in your jurisdiction are there limitations on guarantees the most common high yield structure is to have an issuer with upstream guarantees from its subsidiaries in certain instances where the issuer may not be the topco entity there may be a downstream guarantee too most often the guarantee structure will mimic the bank finance structure in general unsecured guarantees are limited only by fraudulent conveyance issues under us federal bankruptcy law the incurrence of indebtedness the guarantee thereof or the grant of a security interest in collateral could be avoided as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance if the issuer or guarantor i incurred the indebtedness or guarantees with the intent of hindering delaying or defrauding creditors or ii received less than the reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration in return and in the case of ii only one of the following is also true at the time thereof the issuer or any guarantor was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the incurrence of the indebtedness or the guarantee the incurrence of the indebtedness or the guarantee left the issuer or the guarantor with an unreasonably small amount of capital or assets to carry on its business the issuer or guarantor intended to or believed that it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay as they mature or the issuer or guarantor was a defendant in an action for money damages or had a judgment for money damages docketed against it if in either case the judgment is unsatisfied after final judgment in addition there are limitations associated with foreign guarantees first the provision of a guarantee by a foreign entity of the obligations of a us issuer can have serious economic consequences for the issuer under the us tax code income earned abroad by companies that are organised abroad is generally not taxed by the us if however the assets of such company provide credit support for obligations of a us affiliate then the undistributed earnings and profits of the foreign entity may be deemed repatriated to the united states and become subject to us taxation as a dividend as a result in the us market issuers are typically not expected to take such a risk and guarantees from foreign subsidiaries are not commonly required while the 2017 tax reform bill allows companies to repatriate foreign earnings back into the united states there are still certain limitations in place that would encourage domestic issuers not to obtain guarantees from foreign subsidiaries that may change in the future but at this point in 2018 the structures have remained the same collateral package what is the typical collateral package for high yield debt securities in your jurisdiction collateral that is typically used as security falls into two general categories real property and personal property real property is governed by the law of the state in which the property is located and a security interest in real property can be granted pursuant to a mortgage or similar agreement the creation of security interests in most types of personal property are governed by the uniform commercial code ucc a form of which has been enacted in each state security interests in such personal property governed by the ucc can be granted pursuant to a single security agreement and perfected subject to certain exceptions by the filing of financial statements describing the collateral in the jurisdiction of organisation of the party granting the security interest limitations are there any limitations on security that can be granted to secure high yield securities in your jurisdiction are there any limitations on types of assets that can be pledged as collateral are there any limitations on which entities can provide security see question 20 collateral structure describe the typical collateral structure in your jurisdiction for example is it common to see crossing lien deals between high yield debt securities and bank agreements there is no single typical collateral structure in the us it is certainly common to see crossing lien deals between high yield debt securities and bank agreements but that is not the only structure typically lenders take a first lien in the hard assets and the bonds get a first lien on personal property then the lenders would take a second lien on the personal property and the bonds would get a second lien on the hard assets it is also possible for secured bonds to rank pari passu with the bank debt in addition while uncommon there are deals where the bonds obtain a second lien on all of the collateral legal expenses who typically bears the costs of legal expenses related to security interests while the underwriters generally pay underwriters counsel for their legal expenses the costs of legal expenses related to security interests are generally paid by the issuer in the united states borrowers typically pay the legal expenses associated with counsel to the lenders and since the work related to security interests is really more akin to a credit agreement it is customary for issuers to pay for the legal expenses of counsel to the underwriters for such work security interests how are security interests recorded is there a public register similar to the creation of the security interest the ucc governs the perfection of a security interest in most types of personal property perfection occurs through the filing of ucc financing statements with the relevant state office the filing of intellectual property security agreements with the relevant federal office the execution of control agreements with respect to cash and cash equivalents held in a depositary bank or in certain circumstances with a securities intermediary the possession or delivery of certain personal property the recording of mortgages with the relevant state office and other filings or actions in the case of other special category assets how are security interests typically enforced in the high yield context there is no real distinction between high yield debt securities and other debt in terms of enforcing security interests a secured noteholder that forecloses on collateral outside the bankruptcy process generally takes that collateral subject to any other potential liabilities against which the collateral is subject typically on the filing of a petition for bankruptcy reorganisation a chapter 11 proceeding or liquidation a chapter 7 proceeding under title 11 of the us bankruptcy code an automatic stay arises which prohibits all collection and enforcement efforts subject to certain exceptions for the right to close out most securities and financial contracts criminal proceedings and the exercise of regulatory powers generally all interest accruals stop as of the petition date unless a debtor is solvent and covenants are not enforceable once a petition is filed under certain circumstances a secured noteholder may be able to obtain relief from the automatic stay to enforce remedies against collateral debt seniority and intercreditor arrangements ranking of high yield debt how does high yield debt rank in relation to other creditor interests there is no distinction between high yield debt securities and other debt in terms of ranking and it depends on the capital structure of the company in general the high yield debt securities rank equally in right of payment with any existing and future senior debt are effectively subordinated to all secured debt to the extent of the value of the collateral and are senior in right of payment to any existing and future subordinated debt regulation of voting and control describe how intercreditor arrangements entered into by companies in your jurisdiction typically regulate voting and control between holders of high yield debt securities and bank lenders this depends on the structure and the answer to question 22 in general each tranche of debt has its representative for example noteholders are represented by a trustee which will sign the intercreditor agreement and the bank lenders are represented by the administrative agent which will sign the intercreditor agreement typically control resides with the party that holds the most senior piece of debt or if the different tranches of debt rank pari passu then typically voting and control will reside with the biggest tranche of debt tax considerations offsetting of interest payments may issuers set off interest payments on their securities against their tax liability are there any special considerations for the high yield market generally in the united states interest should be deductible in accordance with the issuer s method of accounting interest expense on indebtedness issued with original issue discount is deductible on a constant yield to maturity basis even if the issuer is on a cash method of accounting there are many interest deduction rules with which a us issuer may require guidance in addition one special consideration for the high yield market is the application of the high yield discount obligations ahydo rules if a debt obligation is issued with original issue discount and the ahydo rules apply a portion of the interest expense may be deductible only when paid in cash and as a result a portion may be permanently non deductible tax rulings is it common for issuers to obtain a tax ruling from the competent authority in your jurisdiction in connection with the issuance of high yield bonds no a typical high yield transaction does not require issuers to obtain a tax ruling in connection with the issuance in certain circumstances however relating to tax free spin offs and the issuance of high yield debt securities in connection therewith a tax ruling may be required or desired by the issuer update and trends update and trends updates and trends the emerging trend in the high yield market is the return of volatility into the markets investors have become spooked by the looming recession rising interest rates worries about inflation among others we have also seen the market retreat after president trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum as a result issuers will have to be mindful that if a window opens up they should get in because otherwise they might be shut out for a while because of the volatile market

charlie munger in pdf save it to your desktop read it on your tablet or email to your colleagues q1 hedge fund letters conference scoops etc andrew ross sorkin blackstone out with its first quarter earnings as well as a major announcement breaking news literally as we speak and we have the man behind it all steve schwarzman ceo and chairman of blackstone right here to tell us all about it we can walk through the earnings but to me the bigger issue is the transformation structurally of what you re announcing this morning in terms of the company moving to be a c corp steve schwarzman well that s true andrew so this is big news for us and we ve been a publicly traded partnership since we went public in 2007 and as part of that you flowed through all your income but the people who receive it get something called a k1 statement for taxes which is very irksome and it disqualifies us as being able to be owned by a huge number of potential buyers so for example right now there are about 12 trillion in mutual funds and index funds andrew ross sorkin they can t own blackstone at all steve schwarzman they can t own it well not all of them we can sell to 4 5 trillion out of 12 andrew ross sorkin okay steve schwarzman but if we make this change to be a corporation which is like every other corporation then we can double the number of people we still have a few left who can t but i think that will change over time so if you look at the ability to have people buy your stock double the number and we ll grow to more and that s just in the u s there are people who are non u s in foreign countries they can t buy us either and so this kind of change should result in very large increases i think andrew ross sorkin you ve long talked about how you felt that you were undervalued especially from a multiple perspective steve schwarzman right andrew ross sorkin how much of that is in the calculus of shifting this structure steve schwarzman i think that s really an important part you know we ve been included by morgan stanley in the top 30 companies in the united states we score way high compared to almost every other company in terms of growth and earnings and we have a multiple that s 30 discount to the s p joe kernen up 6 5 already today steve schwarzman it s really sort of mystical makes no sense andrew ross sorkin let s put some context though for viewers who don t necessarily understand the difference between a partnership and a c corp steve schwarzman right andrew ross sorkin and why you originally wanted to be a partnership there used to be tax advantages to be a partnership steve schwarzman right andrew ross sorkin and some of those advantages i don t want to say they ve gone away but the mix has shifted in large part because of the new tax regime in the past year kkr by the way made the same shift earlier this year and you ve been telegraphing this or at least talking about it so i think a lot of investors who have been paying attention understood this was on your mind steve schwarzman well i think they were waiting to see what we would do and in when we went public we just flowed all our income through and now we re changing the mix of our income we already pay a lot of income taxes at the firm on all of our current income and our current income is going up andrew ross sorkin so but speak to the true tax costs in terms of how you re projecting what it s going to cost you how your tax bill what your tax bill is now and what it becomes as a c corp steve schwarzman our tax bill will go up somewhere in the 3 4 5 over the next five years and then higher after that and the reason we re doing accepting that is we think that the value for our shareholders of our stock appreciating should be much higher than that loss of current income andrew ross sorkin and so your effective tax rate today is what as a partnership steve schwarzman i don t even know the exact number frankly andrew ross sorkin i think doing some of the math that i was looking at it is probably around 7 steve schwarzman yeah andrew ross sorkin so your view is you think it s going to go up another 3 4 we re talking it goes up to 10 11 steve schwarzman yeah andrew ross sorkin just trying to understand the dynamics of some of the math that i imagine steve schwarzman right and the first few years it s quite low it s a few percent whether it s 2 3 4 andrew ross sorkin right steve schwarzman something like that andrew ross sorkin you re saying in the first couple of years what happens in the outer years steve schwarzman well it goes up over time where it should be in the low double digits that s our current thinking andrew ross sorkin okay joe kernen so how s business how s the economy what s your overall view of steve schwarzman well our business is pretty amazing and we just raised 126 billion this year and that s a huge number in the alternative area we re the largest by far of everybody in that business and we re deploying capital as well and so you know the environment is working surprisingly well for people like us prices are a little high but we basically have a chance to fish for deals all over the whole world andrew ross sorkin you have expanded into all sorts of new business lines and as you said you ve been raising money like crazy literally i think the money under management au under management has almost doubled has it almost doubled in the past two three years now steve schwarzman yeah and we ve increased six times since we ve gone public andrew ross sorkin so my question to you i feel like i ve known you for a long time and i feel like back in the day when you were much smaller you might have said size can be the enemy of performance how do you feel about that today steve schwarzman well you know the reason we still perform exceptionally well is that we re not putting all the money in one strategy that s how you get hurt we keep inventing new ways to invest new things to invest in new places to invest and as you do that you can keep every one of your strategies at exactly the right size so our private equity business our fund will have the largest fund in the world and that enables us to do deals that most other firms could never think about andrew ross sorkin is there an upper limit though for a particular business line meaning do you say to yourself okay in the private equity space once we get to this number we just can t do it steve schwarzman yeah what happens andrew ross sorkin i mean a lot of people look at masa son for example right now with this 100 billion fund and they say that s going to be tough to make it really work steve schwarzman well i think that s true andrew there s a right sizing for the amount of money that you can handle you have to remember the size of some of the funds has grown but the reason for that is that markets since the global financial crisis have gone up what 3 4 times and so the size of everything is bigger the size of companies that you can buy is bigger joe kernen so you get initial pop of about 4 it just keeps going it looks like it s headed up to 8 andrew ross sorkin now up to 8 as we re speaking joe kernen so you probably you re a confidant to some extent to the president you probably were a proponent of the tax reform and the deregulation do you attribute some of the positive momentum in the economy to those moves and some of the companies that you own can you point to concrete examples where either lower taxes or less regulation has improved business for your the things that you own steve schwarzman well it s pretty clear this was a simulative joe kernen was it a front end loaded stimulus a sugar high steve steve schwarzman it was somewhat front end loaded on capital expenditures but i think a lot of it isn t just the tax aspects which were done in the corporate area because we were really quite uncompetitive globally but the decreases in regulation is really what has joe kernen and you can point concretely to some of your businesses where it s just obvious that that helped steve schwarzman we re seeing it vis a vis the firm itself you see it everywhere and that doesn t mean there s some kind of unilateral disarmament going and we re doing irresponsible things in the united states joe kernen do you think that melissa lee has it opened you up to new investments that you might not otherwise have looked at but for the regulation changes steve schwarzman but we re seeing that the cost of expanding into areas is lower and there is a positive sense in almost everything you do that you re not going to be inhibited for reasons that make no sense you know part of the things i m on the hospital board you know over the last ten years some of the costs of compliance of the same hospital doing the same thing without any problems have gone up hundreds of millions of dollars to the extent that you reverse that you re not impacting medical care but there s more money for nurses melissa lee but look at what s going with health care though today in terms of publicly traded companies the worst performing sector of this year and it s really being dogged by political concerns about medicare for all et cetera since you sit on the board of a hospital is that going to be a cloud over how you serve customers steve schwarzman that whole sector is probably the hardest set of problems we re facing in the country joe kernen steve you re seeing some organic revenue growth at this point income inequality are you optimistic that the current environment that we re in will start to relieve some of the social ills that are now becoming so large that some people think we need to do something or there is going to be some type of revolution my point is that the wage gap in china is starting to narrow where we can start it makes sense to have companies here again so some of what we ve been subjected to for the past 30 years maybe some of those pressures are starting to lessen and maybe we don t need to start questioning capitalism and start talking about reforming capitalism and conscientious i don t even larry fink said conscientious i thought that was like an objector but he used it as a conscientious capitalism or something i mean you ve seen the debate i mean where are you on this steve schwarzman well i think the numbers tell the tale that you know like half of our population in the united states in terms of the work force is living paycheck to paycheck they basically don t have savings and they don t believe because it s probably true they don t have the same opportunities that people of my generation had and unless we solve this problem this is not optional to solve joe kernen right what are the answers though steve schwarzman it must be addressed joe kernen but it s under the there s capitalism and then we work tax policy and education and everything under the capitalist umbrella we don t suddenly start thinking that we have the wrong economic system do we steve schwarzman i think this is a governance problem in the united states joe kernen right steve schwarzman what we have is less an issue of income inequality than income insufficiency for the bottom 50 of the society joe kernen but is redistribution the answer or is organic growth steve schwarzman there are always answers what we need is basically a marshall plan basically for the middle class and you know you have to address this in three different areas one you have to get more cash to these people they simply aren t earning enough and you can do that through minimum wage changes that only affects interestingly about 15 of the population andrew ross sorkin when you say you can do that through minimum wage changes is that through policy in terms of what you think minimum wage should be as you ve seen a number of big companies including amazon have raised their own minimum wages are you looking at blackstone portfolio companies and saying you know what we are going to raise the minimum wage on our own steve schwarzman andrew i look at this as a systemic problem this is not anecdotal this is like half of our society is severely disadvantaged we can t allow that to continue so that means you need policy solutions steve schwarzman so you would advocate for higher minimum wage steve schwarzman i would and i think what happens with that you not only address that group there is a flex on top of it where you have to increase other people i think we should do that melissa lee how steve schwarzman i think secondly melissa we ve now slipped from number one in primary secondary education when i was young back in you know the medieval times and we re now down depending upon who is measuring it to number 30 or 35 in the world our graduates simply aren t competitive on a global basis you can t be in a knowledge economy you can t do all the tasks you need to do if you re number 30 or 35 and so that needs to be joe kernen we have to figure that out whether it s breaking the teacher s unions andrew ross sorkin do you have a third item steve schwarzman yes andrew ross sorkin what s the third one joe kernen we have got to figure out how to fix education i want to hear that steve schwarzman you have to have some type of technical training for people who don t go to college and they have great models in germany there are all kinds of things one thing you can do is each state could get you know some allocation from federal budget and the business communities in those states have to have links with the high schools and start training the people joe kernen well what about public schools steve how do we fix the public schools with charter schools with choice you just tax people more and throw it at federally public school steve schwarzman joe everybody has different ideas one thing i think that we should do is we should make teachers pay no tax i think teachers is where the key is and we have to address getting the best people and it s not just money and you can see from these strikes people don t have enough money but we also have to make teachers a special class in our society if we really want to change we have to advantage them andrew ross sorkin i have to say these are very bold bold thoughts from steve schwarzman this morning melissa lee it is very interesting andrew ross sorkin before we let you go i have two just broad questions one is just about the market itself which is where are we where are we are you optimistic are you positive going through the rest of this year steve schwarzman i would say we have had a good run there s no doubt now what happens andrew ross sorkin what am i supposed to take away from that melissa lee that s past tense that s past tense steve schwarzman what happened we basically had a fourth quarter where i hate to say it you know the media was declaring we were going into a recession we never thought so and i think i said it publicly andrew ross sorkin yep i remember steve schwarzman and we didn t so what happened is we overshot on the way down significantly and when the recession didn t happen when china didn t fall off a cliff the way people were also saying now it s popped up and it s at a pretty good level the idea that we re going to sort of keep increasing at the same rate doesn t make a lot of sense to me you know he economy is good but it s you know maybe 2 5 down from where it was in the 3s melissa lee you believe it was the turn in china it sounds like you believe in the uptick in data steve schwarzman well china has done i was in china a few weeks ago and met with the head of the central bank and he said look we ve done a lot of interesting things to stimulate the economy and he said we ve basically turned so we re not concerned about that andrew ross sorkin so what do you i mean you guys do have interests obviously in public markets steve schwarzman we do andrew ross sorkin and your thought is that right now we re already where we re as high as we re going steve schwarzman i think we ve had a good year andrew ross sorkin a good year it s the spring steve schwarzman we re up 16 17 andrew ross sorkin right steve schwarzman the nasdaq is up what 20 this is not sort of nothing melissa lee it sounds like you re telling people to take the money and steve schwarzman no i didn t say that you can t like you know do that melissa lee that s why i m asking you steve schwarzman but i am saying the rate of increase i think has to slow down joe kernen steve in his point of life might be more interested in preservation of capital than growing capital i would say is there some truth to that with you know 10 12 billion we still need to make our 10 12 billion so steve schwarzman well joe kernen i would be in t bills if i were you or muni bonds but that s just me steve schwarzman well you know i do a lot of my investing we have restrictions on what we can do because we know so much so i keep a lot of money in index funds and you know that s been like a very good thing over time and i m not selling my index funds joe kernen there s another company that starts with black steve schwarzman that much i would say joe kernen you can put some money in that other company that starts with black because their guy thinks it s going to be a melt up steve schwarzman well i watched larry yesterday that was a great interview you all did and you know larry is always very opinionated and he is always very positive joe kernen that s where i got the conscientious capitalism steve schwarzman on markets and you know he always has something you know to say on things but that was good joe kernen guess what there s been a barr sighting apparently just moments ago there was actually a camera ready when he left his home ahead of this morning s news melissa lee you can see him through the trees joe kernen the conference is scheduled the news conference is scheduled at 9 30 a m there it is we briefly left lori loughlin s house and went over to the barr s house and we re stationed outside there now we re going to have live coverage and market reaction to that andrew ross sorkin steve schwarzman joe kernen conference and more all day right here on cnbc andrew ross sorkin okay steve schwarzman thank you for being here thank you for bringing us the big news and we ll watch as we ve said the stock moving materially this morning on this news so good luck steve schwarzman okay thanks

u s retail sales increased by the most in 1½ years in march as households boosted purchases of motor vehicles and a range of other goods the latest indication that economic growth picked up in the first quarter after a false start the economy s enduring strength was reinforced by other data on thursday showing the number of americans filing applications for unemployment benefits dropped to the lowest in nearly 50 years last week fears of an abrupt slowdown in growth escalated at the turn of the year after a batch of weak economic reports they were also exacerbated by a brief inversion of the u s treasury yield curve in late march but those concerns have dissipated in recent weeks amid fairly upbeat data on trade inventories and construction spending that have suggested growth in the first quarter could be better than the moderate pace logged in the final three months of 2018 a report from the federal reserve on wednesday described economic activity as expanding at a slight to moderate pace in march and early april the fed s beige book report of anecdotal information on business activity collected from contacts nationwide showed a few of the u s central bank s districts reported some strengthening the rebound in retail sales underscores that the domestic outlook remains favourable and well supported by the labour market and it dispels the misguided concerns that the u s economy is slipping into recession said kathy bostjancic head of u s macro investor services at oxford economics in new york the commerce department said retail sales surged 1 6 per cent in march the biggest increase since september 2017 after dropping 0 2 per cent in february economists polled by reuters had forecast retail sales accelerating 0 9 per cent last month with march s rebound retail sales have now erased the plunge in december that put consumer spending and the overall economy on a sharply lower growth trajectory retail sales last month were probably lifted by tax refunds even though they have been smaller than in previous years following the revamping of the u s tax code in january 2018 excluding automobiles gasoline building materials and food services retail sales rebounded 1 0 per cent in march after declining 0 3 per cent in february these so called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product consumer spending accounts for more than two thirds of economic activity and is being buoyed by a tightening labour market that is driving up wage growth a separate report from the u s department of labour on thursday showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 5 000 to a seasonally adjusted 192 000 for the week ended april 13 the lowest level since september 1969 claims have now declined for five straight weeks economists had forecast claims rising to 205 000 in the latest week though the trend in hiring has slowed job gains remain above the roughly 100 000 needed each month to keep up with growth in the working age population the reports boosted the u s dollar against a basket of currencies stocks on wall street were mixed while u s treasury prices rose as a result of march s strong core retail sales the atlanta fed raised its first quarter gdp estimate by four tenths of a percentage point to a 2 8 per cent annualized rate growth forecasts for the january march quarter have been upgraded from as low as a 0 5 per cent rate following the recent trade inventories and construction spending data the economy grew at a 2 2 per cent pace in the fourth quarter stronger growth in the first quarter will probably not change the view that the economy will slow this year as the stimulus from a us 1 5 trillion tax cut package diminishes and the impact of interest rate hikes over the past few years lingers it also is unlikely to have any impact on monetary policy after the fed recently suspended its three year campaign to tighten monetary policy the central bank dropped projections for any rate hikes this year after increasing borrowing costs four times in 2018 key downside risks to u s growth are fading from view said allison nathan an economist at goldman sachs in new york while we still think the next fed move is much more likely to be a hike than a cut we ve pushed back our forecast for the next hike from the first quarter to the fourth of next year goldman sachs has lifted its growth estimate for the second half of 2019 by 25 basis points to 2 5 per cent despite the recent wave of relatively strong data business surveys suggest pockets of weakness persist especially in manufacturing a third report on thursday from the philadelphia fed showed factory activity in the mid atlantic region slowed in april and manufacturers were less optimistic about business and labour market conditions over the next six months that was corroborated by a fourth report from data firm ihs markit showing its measure of national factory activity was unchanged near a two year low in early april with the survey s gauge of factory employment dropping to its lowest level since june 2017 many of the hard readings on activity suggest that the economy started picking up momentum late in the first quarter but this is not evident in much of the recent survey data said daniel silver an economist at jpmorgan in new york

county more election 2019 here are the candidates on the primary ballot for hanover area races candidates answers have been edited for clarity douglas mastriano r what experience do you have that makes you qualified for the job i will not stand aside as career politicians and greedy bureaucrats run us into the ground this is why i am asking for your vote to fight for you our freedoms and state what do i offer as your senator i m a proven leader i lead from the front the first one in and the last out never asking others to do what i myself would not do i ve united diverse groups of men and women people from across this state the nation and world i served for more than 30 years serving during the cold war in iraq and afghanistan my life is about delivering results of my original class of 40 plus officers only three of us made it to colonel to achieve this is extremely difficult and only comes by being a person of moral character incredibly hard work personal sacrifice and delivering results if elected what is the first policy or issue you are going to tackle in the senate and how would you go about it our property tax is the 17th highest in the nation this is too much for our retirees i propose immediate relief and help for our retirees by expanding the real estate tax deferment program if you are 65 and over earn less than 80 000 annually you should be exempt from the property tax immediately penndot says that half of our major roads need repairs and half of our bridges have exceeded their life cycles to resolve this governor wolf gave us the highest gas tax in the nation he said that this high taxation was required to address our crumbling transportation network and thereby fix our roads and bridges this cost us 76 cents a gallon 18 cents federal 58 cents state penndot says it needs 1 3 billion a year to maintain our existing roads and bridges yet despite this cumbersome gas tax only 460 million was provided to repair our transportation networks since harrisburg can t be trusted with this gas tax revenue i propose that the money collected be returned to the counties to take charge of road and bridge maintenance at the local level additional priorities include defending life the single most important issue of our lifetime protecting the 2nd amendment and the right for citizens to protect themselves fighting for lower taxes rolling back government regulations crushing farmers and business owners school choice how do you think governor wolf is doing what would you like him to do differently and what would you like to see him to continue to do governor wolf s tax and spend policies are driving the elderly from their homes forcing businesses out of the state and bankrupting the state for the future generation he has supported or asked for three tax increases each year as governor for a total of twelve thus far according to the tax foundation this has made pennsylvania the 11th most taxed state in the nation with 10 2 cents of every dollar going to the state and local government the tax burden at the state and local level is 4 589 per person this is too much we need fiscal responsibility and an end to the tax and spend programs advanced by harrisburg twelve billion dollars went to welfare last year and there are generations of welfare recipients enjoying the fruits of your labors our welfare system is being abused and needs immediate reform if you wish to receive welfare there should be three prerequisites a work requirement a time limit and drug tests sarah hammond d what experience do you have that makes you qualified for the job after graduating from slippery rock university with a degree in communications i spent two years as an embroidery machine operator at legacy athletic back in my hometown of hanover earning money to pay off my student loans while i was starting to get more involved in local politics i decided to run for state house in district 169 in 2018 i gained invaluable experience and insight into how effective campaigns are run and took the time to make sure that i was reviewing my policy views while cross examining what issues are hard pressing right here in our district i am currently the director of community development for the borough of spring grove in this position i ve been learning more about local economic and environmental impacts as well as zoning land development permitting planning and all the necessary aspects of effectively running a borough i m running because i understand the struggles and responsibilities of working class people in the middle class and those trying to get into the middle class i understand how important job security is in our current paycheck to paycheck culture i was born here i was raised here and together we will represent our district to make sure everyone s voice is heard at the table more pennsylvania midterm elections q a with 169th house district candidate sarah hammond if elected what is the first policy or issue you are going to tackle in the senate and how would you go about it there are a lot of different factors that we must adequately address when looking into eradicating the opioid crisis as a whole we presently struggle to provide even a basic level of universal healthcare to our people in a state where workers haven t seen a wage increase in years we must provide alternatives that are cost efficient non lethal and far less damaging to those who are fighting to beat their addictions we incarcerate both nonviolent addicts and casual cannabis users alike who have been caught in many cases with less than an ounce of cannabis for personal recreational use as a result we have over populated our prisons with both harmless offenders and with inmates struggling with addiction who should be in detox facilities instead more adams county election who is on the primary ballot for commissioner other offices i am fighting for the legalization of adult recreational cannabis because it is a non partisan issue that has impacted to some degree every single person in pennsylvania i propose that we implement rules similar to that of nicotine and alcohol i propose that we tax those products similarly and put these taxes back into reforming our criminal justice system and i propose that we erase the felonies and misdemeanors for past and current nonviolent offenders we can utilize the revenue from these taxes to redefine addicts as survivors by providing funding for programs within detox facilities when we simply treat these individuals as criminals and force them into withdraw in jail cells we see overdoses more commonly upon reentry back on the streets how do you think governor wolf is doing what would you like him to do differently and what would you like to see him to continue to do i greatly appreciate and am directly impacted in my day to day job by governor wolf s restore pennsylvania plan this comprehensive plan addresses many pressing issues related to improving our infrastructure including an initiative focused on how we can turn blighted properties land structures in a dilapidated unsafe and most often times uninhabitable condition into sustainable long term investments within our communities funding which is proposed to come from the implementation of a reasonable severance tax on the natural gas sector will ensure that we are able to reinvest resources in our communities demolishing blighted properties within pa and redeveloping these areas often times the cost of demolishing a blighted property particularly in areas with considerably smaller tax bases can be budget breaking by using the funding from the severance tax plan restore pennsylvania is able to provide financial resources at the local level to help communities acquire and demolish blighted properties this creates the opening for more initiatives in community and economic development

the u s trade deficit fell to an eight month low in february as imports from china plunged temporarily providing a boost to president donald trump s america first agenda and economic growth in the first quarter the surprise second straight monthly narrowing in the trade gap reported by the commerce department on wednesday was also driven by soaring aircraft exports which are likely to reverse after boeing halted deliveries of its troubled 737 max aircraft max planes have been grounded indefinitely following two deadly crashes economists warned the trade deficit would remain elevated regardless of whether the united states and china struck a trade deal that was to the white house s liking because of americans insatiable appetite for cheaper imports talks between washington and china to resolve the bitter trade war have been dragging the united states is also embroiled in conflicts with other trading partners including the european union contributing to big swings in exports and imports data in recent months even if trade negotiations are resolved in such a way as to reduce the bilateral trade deficit with china one of the trump administration s stated goals this would likely divert trade flows to other countries and have little impact on the top line u s trade deficit said emily mandel an economist at moody s analytics in west chester pennsylvania the trade deficit tumbled 3 4 to 49 4 billion in february the lowest level since june 2018 economists polled by reuters had forecast the trade shortfall widening to 53 5 billion in february the politically sensitive goods trade deficit with china a focus of the trump administration s protectionist trade policy decreased 28 2 to 24 8 billion in february as imports from the world s no 2 economy plunged 20 2 u s exports to china jumped 18 2 in february washington last year imposed tariffs on 250 billion worth of goods imported from china with beijing retaliating with duties on 110 billion worth of american products trump has defended the duties as necessary to protect domestic manufacturers from what he says is unfair foreign competition trump has delayed tariffs on 200 billion worth of chinese imports the white house argues that substantially reducing the trade deficit would lift annual economic growth by at least 3 on a sustainable basis a feat that economists have said is impossible because of low productivity and population growth the economy grew 2 9 in 2018 the dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies while u s treasury debt prices rose marginally stocks on wall street fell growth estimates raised february s smaller trade deficit suggests the economy will probably avoid a sharp slowdown in growth that had been feared at the start of the year the goods trade deficit declined 1 7 to an eight month low of 72 0 billion in february when adjusted for inflation the overall goods trade deficit fell 1 8 billion to 81 8 billion also the lowest since last june goldman sachs raised its first quarter gross domestic product estimate by four tenths of percentage point to a 2 1 annualized rate the atlanta federal reserve bumped up its gdp forecast to a 2 4 pace from a 2 3 rate the economy grew at a 2 2 rate in the fourth quarter it sounds like pencils are being sharpened in order to revise up first quarter gdp forecasts said jennifer lee a senior economist at bmo capital markets in toronto in february goods exports increased 1 5 to 139 5 billion the surge in goods exports is unlikely to be sustained given slowing global economic growth the dollar s strength last year means u s manufactured goods are less competitive on foreign markets shipments of civilian aircraft soared by 2 2 billion in february exports of motor vehicles and parts increased by 0 6 billion there was a small rise in soybean exports economists expect soybean exports to remain moderate because of an outbreak of swine flu that has reduced demand for soybean meal in china in february imports rose 0 2 to 259 1 billion consumer goods imports increased by 1 6 billion in february led by a 2 1 billion rise in imports of cellphones and other household goods imports of industrial supplies and materials fell by 1 2 billion capital goods imports rose slightly pointing to slower business spending on equipment crude oil imports fell to 173 7 million barrels the lowest since march 1992 from 223 1 million barrels in january an increase in domestic production has seen the united states become less dependent on foreign oil we see more potential for stronger imports in coming months which would reestablish a trend toward wider deficits said andrew hollenhorst an economist at citigroup in new york credit voice of america voa

further details non gaap measures in our financial reporting we use certain measures that are not defined by generally accepted accounting principles gaap such as ifrs we believe this information along with comparable gaap measurements is useful to investors because it provides a basis for measuring our operating performance and our ability to retire debt and invest in new business opportunities our management uses these financial measures along with the most directly comparable gaap financial measures in evaluating our operating performance and value creation non gaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information presented in compliance with gaap wherever appropriate and practical we provide reconciliations to relevant gaap measures the non gaap measures used in this announcement are underlying sales growth underlying volume growth and underlying price growth see below underlying sales growth usg underlying sales growth usg refers to the increase in turnover for the period excluding any change in turnover resulting from acquisitions disposals and changes in currency we believe this measure provides valuable additional information on the underlying sales performance of the business and is a key measure used internally the impact of acquisitions and disposals is excluded from usg for a period of 12 calendar months from the applicable closing date turnover from acquired brands that are launched in countries where they were not previously sold is included in usg as such turnover is more attributable to our existing sales and distribution network than the acquisition itself also excluded is the impact of price growth from countries where the impact of consumer price inflation cpi rates has escalated to extreme levels there are two countries where we have determined extreme levels of cpi exist the first is venezuela where in q4 2017 inflation rates exceeded 1 000 and management considered that the situation would persist for some time consequently price growth in venezuela has been excluded from usg since q4 2017 the second is argentina which from q3 2018 has been accounted for in accordance with ias 29 and thus from q3 2018 argentina price growth is excluded from usg the adjustment made at group level as a result of these two exclusions was a reduction in price growth of 1 0 for the first quarter this treatment for both countries will be kept under regular review the reconciliation of changes in the gaap measure turnover to usg is provided on page 5 underlying volume growth uvg underlying volume growth uvg is part of usg and means for the applicable period the increase in turnover in such period calculated as the sum of i the increase in turnover attributable to the volume of products sold and ii the increase in turnover attributable to the composition of products sold during such period uvg therefore excludes any impact on usg due to changes in prices the measures and the related turnover gaap measure are set out on page 5 underlying price growth upg underlying price growth upg is part of usg and means for the applicable period the increase in turnover attributable to changes in prices during the period upg therefore excludes the impact to usg due to i the volume of products sold and ii the composition of products sold during

on the morning of september 11 2001 india born author pramila jayapal was living amid cardboard boxes in her new house in seattle washington when a friend called from the east coast and told her to unpack her television over the next several days as americans struggled with their grief over the deaths caused by the plane hijackings and the collapse of the world trade center towers another set of tragedies began to unfold hate crimes against arabs and other ethnic minorities swept the country in seattle jayapal was inundated with calls for help from muslim women who were afraid to leave their houses in traditional dress from immigrant taxi drivers who had been assaulted and from arab parents who had pulled their children from school recently divorced jayapal had set aside her activism to carve out time to work on a book manuscript but a few days later she met with congressman jim mcdermott d wa and presented a proposal for a campaign to make washington a hate free zone she d envisioned someone else leading the effort but within twenty four hours mcdermott organized a press conference to introduce jayapal who maintained that she was not looking to front a new activist movement as the head of the campaign during the next year as hate crimes against immigrants in the u s soared by 1 600 percent and the federal government tightened immigration policies jayapal was drawn again and again to the defense of immigrants today her oneamerica www weareoneamerica org is one of the nation s leading immigrants rights organizations on any given day jayapal might face off against an anti immigration pundit on talk radio speak to a crowd of conservative rural oklahomans listen to the plight of mexican farmworkers or help argue a somali refugee s case before the immigration courts jayapal learned early to bridge deep cultural and economic divides when she was a girl her father s oil industry job took her family from india to indonesia where she attended the jakarta international school though she and her siblings had a modest upbringing her classmates were often the children of wealthy embassy families from europe and the u s jayapal spent some time volunteering with charity groups in the jakarta slums she immigrated to the u s at age seventeen to study english and economics at georgetown university and went on to receive an mba from northwestern in 1990 she worked for a time in banking and marketing but she found the jobs unrewarding and took a position with an international public health organization running a loan program that funded socially responsible health projects in developing countries later jayapal spent two years living in villages and small towns in india as a fellow with the institute of current world affairs and from that experience she wrote her memoir pilgrimage one woman s return to a changing india seal press she became a u s citizen in 2000 i met jayapal in her office in one of seattle s most ethnically diverse neighborhoods on the brightly painted walls she and her staff had hung a u s immigration history timeline alongside banners batik cloths and other colorful symbols of their immigrant clients at forty two jayapal is small framed with a melodic voice and a flair for storytelling as we talked she gestured with one hand and held a mug of tea in the other her eyes widening when she made a point pramila jayapal ostrander when you speak about immigration you often cite the emma lazarus poem at the base of the statue of liberty give me your tired your poor do you think that image of a safe harbor is still a part of the american identity jayapal i think that the majority of americans still see the u s as a nation of immigrants and as a generous fair country of course people want policies to govern who comes to america and whether they get to stay and that s a reasonable request but research shows that americans have strong beliefs in fairness equality justice and democracy the words due process poll well with americans even if people can t define what the phrase means it implies to them that there s a process it s fair and everybody gets treated equally but the system isn t fair and we re trying to publicize that we need due process for everyone who is detained by immigration officials more than 90 percent of people who go through the incredibly complex immigration system don t have an attorney and those who do get one often hire someone who exploits them and sometimes worsens their situation my group is constantly solving problems for people who have gotten terrible legal advice or been ripped off by corrupt lawyers and there are not enough immigration judges to hear all the cases more and more discretion has been given to clerks to make decisions that should be made by judges such as whether somebody s going to be deported part of what oneamerica does is inform people about the immigration and detention system for example after 250 detainees got food poisoning at the tacoma detention center we invited people to come and sample a detainee meal we wanted to encourage americans to think about what it might be like to get food poisoning while stuck in a bureaucratic jail system most people are horrified to learn that these things happen but they don t take action because they think it s an isolated occurrence we re trying to make people act on their core beliefs about how human beings should be treated oneamerica has worked with many clients who have had medical conditions in a detention center and been unable to see a doctor one of our clients was pregnant and wasn t allowed her prenatal visits finally in her eighth month of pregnancy she was released onto the street with no money perhaps they were afraid she would deliver her baby in the detention center the detention industry is enormous and growing i think that the more the industry is privatized the way the prison industry is becoming the more human rights abuses we re going to see ostrander how does an immigrant end up in a detention center jayapal there are many ways sometimes it is for not having legal status or letting their legal status expire either they came across the border without any papers or they came on a student visitor or worker visa but didn t renew it because they didn t know you had to or they forgot or they can t read english and didn t understand the notices some immigrants apply for political asylum and don t get it often because it s so difficult to navigate the complex u s immigration system but they choose to stay anyway rather than put themselves at risk by returning to their home countries others in detention have committed a crime that is considered a deportable offense you would think these offenses are horrible but congress has continued to expand the list of deportable offenses to include more petty crimes someone can be deported for an offense as minor as shoplifting many people don t understand that staying in the united states on an expired visa or entering without papers is not a criminal violation but a violation of the civil immigration code the u s never criminalized immigration violations i m not sure why but my theory is that if it had the government would have had to provide immigrants with public defenders since september 11 2001 we have seen a blurring between terrorists and immigrants the fbi may start an inquiry into a suspected terrorist but rather than take those terrorism charges to criminal court it will try the suspect on immigration charges instead because it simply doesn t have the evidence to prove a criminal charge it is much easier to win a case in immigration court than in criminal court in part because you can raise the specter of terrorism without having to prove anything a respected somali muslim imam we worked with was picked up on terrorism charges but tried on an immigration violation in the immigration court they allowed an fbi informant to testify by phone because he claimed he was too scared to testify in person that would never have happened in criminal court we re not necessarily saying all these people should be allowed to stay we re asking where s the due process where s the fair system ostrander is it fair to extend the same rights to illegal immigrants that we do to legal immigrants and citizens polls show that many americans don t support equal rights for illegal immigrants jayapal it depends on how you word the question in the polls i can show you polls in which 85 percent of americans respond that immigrants who are here without legal status but have worked hard and haven t committed any crimes should be given citizenship your question also assumes that we have a fair system in place and that the laws make sense martin luther king jr in his letter from the birmingham jail wrote an unjust law is no law at all and remember that our constitution provides certain rights to due process to everyone in the u s regardless of legal status we need legalization and a path to citizenship for all undocumented immigrants and not just the mexican immigrants but the 3 million undocumented asian immigrants and the growing number of undocumented african immigrants many of these immigrants may not think of themselves as illegal because they entered the country legally but have overstayed their visas or let their immigration status lapse without even knowing it the immigration debate has unfortunately come to be seen as a debate only about undocumented mexican immigrants hardly anyone discusses african political asylum seekers or cambodian refugees or even other latin americans salvadorans ecuadorians guatemalans it s true there are 12 million undocumented immigrants who have crossed the border illegally to work but more than 70 percent of the immigrants who enter the u s each year have legal status when they arrive and remember that one in five children in the u s is a child of an immigrant so policies around immigration affect plenty of u s citizens too ostrander you say the immigration system doesn t work how is it broken jayapal for starters there s an enormous discrepancy between the number of immigrants permitted by law to enter the u s and the number needed by the economy we need quotas that make sense the u s allows roughly five thousand visas per year for low skilled workers but every year about four hundred thousand low skilled jobs are filled by immigrants national lobbyists for the farming industry have said that there are millions more agricultural jobs than can be filled by legal workers then there s what the system does to families the republican party claims we re a country of family values yet our immigration policies separate husbands from wives and parents from children there is such a backlog of immigration and visa applications currently around 5 million waiting to be processed that sometimes applicants have to be separated from their families for a decade i met a mother who had escaped el salvador and come here seeking political asylum with her five year old child she had left her younger son in el salvador in the care of grandparents she got asylum and she and her older child became citizens but when she applied to bring her younger son into the country legally the system didn t allow it she waited for twelve years before she finally went back to el salvador and brought her son who was then fourteen into the u s illegally she was forced to act because her elderly parents couldn t care for him anymore and at age eighteen a child can no longer enter the u s under a parent s visa now can any parents say they wouldn t have done the same thing but the son was caught and put into detention and deported back to el salvador if the legal system isn t working because of inefficient bureaucracy then people will find other ways to be with their families it s only human ostrander but do most immigrants who come into the u s illegally have such justifiable motives jayapal the reasons people immigrate are multifaceted more people are moving around the world today because of political social and economic strife than ever before many times it is u s foreign policy driving this migration for instance after the north american free trade agreement was passed more than a million mexican farmers were driven out of business because they could not compete with subsidized u s farmers and undocumented immigration from mexico rose by 60 percent if somebody has to leave his or her home to earn a living you could describe that as seeking opportunity or you could call it forced migration nafta talks about a borderless world in which goods are freely traded back and forth but if people can t legally travel across the border and access jobs on the other side these trade agreements benefit only corporations many of which relocate just across the mexican border so they can pay lower wages and when we talk about the causes of immigration let s not forget that the u s media broadcast around the globe the idea that america is a luxurious and ideal place to live a place where you can find opportunities that you can t get anywhere else if we advertise that america is the best country in the world then we shouldn t be surprised when people show up the u s media broadcast around the globe the idea that america is a luxurious and ideal place to live a place where you can find opportunities that you can t get anywhere else if we advertise that america is the best country in the world then we shouldn t be surprised when people show up ostrander why do you think some people are willing to risk their lives to enter the u s in 2005 alone there were 433 deaths during illegal border crossings jayapal many have to migrate for economic or political reasons some are escaping danger in countries where they don t have rights others want so badly to provide a better life for their children that they re willing to put up with an incredible amount of hardship i know of a mexican woman a single parent who came across the border illegally to work cleaning houses so that she could pay for her son to attend a university she s been separated from him for at least ten years there are other people who simply have no other way to feed themselves and their children many endure abusive conditions as farmworkers in the u s i met one agricultural worker who had whip marks across his back ostrander whip marks how could that happen and go unreported jayapal the worker came to the united states and asked for political asylum but he wasn t approved he couldn t go back to his own country where he would have been thrown in prison he was completely under his employer s control as is the case with many guest worker programs ostrander but don t federal guest worker programs include some protections jayapal right now guest workers are sponsored by and dependent on a single employer if that employer threatens them withholds their pay or abuses them they can t file a complaint because the employer can have them deported people who can be deported back to a life threatening situation in their home country really have no choice and guest workers have no ability to obtain permanent status here or to join labor unions democratic congressman charles rangel from new york has called the guest worker program the closest thing to slavery that he s ever seen undocumented immigrants have even fewer protections recently i heard about a drywall company in seattle that hired undocumented immigrants and made them scale tall buildings without a safety harness one of the immigrants fell and cracked his skull the boss was so scared he would be reported for hiring undocumented workers that he refused to allow the other employees to call 911 he threatened their jobs finally one of them did call the worker who fell lived but had serious brain damage and a lawsuit was brought against the employer ostrander do you think the federal government should crack down on employers who hire illegal immigrants jayapal the government shouldn t be cracking down on workers or employers without fixing the broken system first it s ludicrous to penalize individual employers or workers when our entire economic system depends on undocumented immigrants that s why the raids happening across the country make no sense it s a temporary solution that makes anti immigration groups happy but doesn t do anything to solve the real problem of a broken system and that s not even accounting for the violations of human rights that occur in these raids even former federal reserve chairman alan greenspan has said that the government should ease restrictions on immigration former microsoft ceo bill gates has said we need immigration reform to stay economically competitive these are not just the liberal lefties talking in washington state last year thousands of apples remained unpicked because of increased government raids on undocumented workers workers were scared to go to work so the apples fell and rotted in 2006 the swift meatpacking factory in cactus texas was subject to government raids and arrests of 295 undocumented workers swift has since not been able to find enough local native born workers to fill the jobs vacated by those raids and it s had to send buses to houston to recruit burmese political refugees and a big raid on a slaughterhouse in postville iowa showed that the government should be focusing on implementing labor laws the company was hiring kids to work intolerably long hours in terrible conditions rather than cracking down on undocumented immigrants unfortunately employers scared of being held liable for hiring undocumented immigrants are pushing for piecemeal immigration legislation that often downgrades worker protections the western growers association for example is calling for more guest worker visas but it says nothing about worker protections some towns for instance riverside new jersey and hazelton pennsylvania have passed ordinances that penalize employers who hire undocumented immigrants even documented immigrants have left these towns because most of them have family members who are undocumented because immigrants are also consumers many small businesses in these towns have failed and the downtowns have begun to deteriorate i often debate anti immigration pundits on radio and television like tucker carlson on msnbc and john carlson who has a conservative radio show here in seattle when they say just deport them all i ask whether they ve ever tried to live a day without the services or food provided by an undocumented immigrant you couldn t do anything except sit probably in a very dirty house or hotel room i also tell them social security would collapse without undocumented immigrants gary harwood ostrander but undocumented immigrants aren t part of social security are they jayapal they don t benefit from social security but they contribute at least 7 billion a year to the fund through paycheck deductions i actually know undocumented immigrants who file tax returns every year hoping that when immigration reform is passed they can show themselves to have been responsible citizens and of course immigrants pay sales tax like everyone else and anti immigrant sentiment is directed not only at undocumented immigrants but also at documented ones the national foundation for american policy estimates that a moratorium on legal immigrants entering the country which the anti immigration forces are pushing for could devastate the social security system ballooning the deficit by one third over a fifty year period ostrander harvard economist george borjas estimates that immigrant labor reduced the incomes of high school dropouts by 3 percent between 1980 and 1988 do you think immigrants have a negative effect on wages jayapal it s true that a supply of labor willing to accept low pay under the table can drive down wages but why blame immigrants why not blame the employers who choose to pay those low wages in the first place and there are other factors influencing declining wages besides immigration for instance unionization is down and we don t have strong labor laws anymore and until 2007 congress kept the minimum wage stagnant for almost a decade bringing it to the lowest level since world war ii after adjusting for inflation the bureau of labor also says that there is no such thing as a fixed number of jobs between 2000 and 2010 more than 33 million new jobs that require little or moderate training will be created in the u s even if unemployed american workers agree to take these low skilled jobs we will still need more workers to fill all of them ostrander the right wing heritage foundation has argued that immigrants bring poverty and crime into the u s jayapal throughout our history immigrants have done incredibly well for this country numerous studies have shown that crime rates are lower among immigrant populations than among native born populations and immigrants provide a net economic benefit to the united states estimated to be as high as 10 billion a year most big city mayors love immigrants because they start small businesses and promote downtown revitalization but immigrants have more difficulty succeeding today because the u s has fewer mechanisms for integrating them into society than it once did european union countries on the other hand have formal integration programs that provide basic information and orientation to new immigrants along with language courses in denmark for instance your visa is contingent upon your completing integration classes within your first few months in the country there are about ninety thousand people on waiting lists for english as a second language programs in the u s and that doesn t even count the people who have given up and immigrants without english fluency earn about ten thousand dollars less in annual income than immigrants who do speak english many who don t learn english stay at the bottom of the economic ladder their entire lives ostrander you often give presentations in conservative parts of the country what kinds of responses do you get when you speak to those audiences jayapal what is most effective is just explaining the complexities of the system and then telling stories many people just don t understand what immigration entails we show videos about people we work with and sometimes even have immigrants testify in person they describe how the fbi came into their house at two in the morning forced them to get dressed at gunpoint and left their small children at home alone while they were taken to detention they tell stories of being transferred from one detention facility to another in shackles without access to a judicial process once they ve heard these stories people really do understand that the system is unfair after one of my talks a caucasian military veteran approached me and said i had no idea and he wrote a check to support our work i often debate anti immigration pundits on radio and i ask whether they ve ever tried to live a day without the services or food provided by an undocumented immigrant you couldn t do anything except sit probably in a very dirty house or hotel room ostrander does race come up in these discussions jayapal race is a hard topic to talk about especially for white audiences the whole subject of immigration has become so polarized that people need a safe space to raise their fears without being immediately branded as racist or anti immigrant sometimes i ask them to write down something they have heard someone else say about immigration such as immigrants are taking our jobs getting those ideas out in the open and being able to discuss them is important even if not all immigration opponents are racists there is an anti immigrant faction that is absolutely racist and is controlling the debate the federation for american immigration reform one of the largest anti immigrant groups in the country has been labeled by the southern poverty law center as a hate group not just fair but all the sister organizations promulgated by its creator john tanton have ties to racist beliefs many immigration policies are also enforced along racial lines the first anti immigration law passed in 1882 was race based it was called the chinese exclusion act the policies themselves aren t overtly racist anymore but authorities still largely target people of color the same way that executive order 9066 which established the internment camps during world war ii didn t explicitly say to intern only japanese americans oneamerica has found that people from african and muslim countries have much longer waits for their citizenship requests to be processed and though there are a lot of undocumented canadians in the united states the ins doesn t typically go after them ostrander is it difficult to get your message across in contentious settings like conservative talk radio shows jayapal it is tough to make those appearances people often attack me personally on the show you have to control your emotions because the hosts want you to get angry but you still have to be fierce about what you believe i do it to try to reach those good people who differ from my point of view i have to counter what the other side is saying to them if i speak rationally i can easily outshine arguments based on hate and fear the debate isn t just about passion it s about policies that make sense for this country are in keeping with our values and are good for our economy i don t want somebody to agree with me because they re taking pity on an immigrant i want them to see that immigration reform is the right thing to do ostrander do you feel that you get through to those audiences jayapal i have had some listeners e mail me after the show and say i never thought of it that way i still disagree but one thing you said made sense and that to me is huge even if people don t change their minds at least they get to hear a rational person presenting an opposing point of view ostrander some might argue that it s reasonable to constrain the rights of immigrants in order to secure the safety of the country as a whole what s your response to that jayapal it s a slippery slope the minute you take away individual rights based on nationality or ethnic or religious background in 1942 many people thought it was reasonable to lock up japanese americans in the 1950s many people thought mccarthyism was reasonable i once debated a department of justice official who argued that we need to track arab and muslim immigrants just as we now track sex offenders but in the end the american public has always rejected the argument that we must suspend democracy for the protection of our citizens benjamin franklin said those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety ostrander environmentalists have sometimes argued that increasing the population of the u s through immigration also increases consumption of the world s natural resources is there anything valid about that argument jayapal i think it s valid to say that american consumerism is taking a huge toll on the globe but to turn that into a reason to oppose immigration is bizarre i m reminded of a policy that was under discussion when i lived in singapore singapore s government had decided that too many poor uneducated women were having babies they couldn t afford so it offered to pay those women not to have babies but one has to think why not use the money to educate those women instead to solve a problem we need to address its root cause the environmental movement should be fighting consumerism and the misuse of resources not fighting immigrants and whether people immigrate here or not the u s is exporting consumerism around the globe ostrander most immigrants must feel a pull toward two different cultures they re here in the united states seeking citizenship but they also have another cultural history jayapal yes i spent many years struggling with that i still do to some extent most immigrants have this sense of not belonging anywhere they re not necessarily american but when they go back to their mother countries they don t really fit in there either one of my filipino american friends said i live in the hyphen between those two words filipino and american that s a very difficult place to be until you recognize the rich and unique perspective it grants you ostrander what was your own experience with the u s immigration process jayapal i had it much easier than many of our clients at oneamerica but until i became a citizen i never got rid of the fear at the border when i came home from traveling because even if you have a visa it s not a guarantee that the border officials will let you into the country my last experience with this was when i was in india on a fellowship with the institute of current world affairs i was pregnant and my son was born unexpectedly three months early while we were in india he weighed one pound fourteen ounces and we didn t know whether he was going to live or die we couldn t bring him home to the u s until his condition was more stable during this ordeal the u s government told me that if i didn t return right away i would lose my green card and wouldn t be allowed to reenter the country you have to come back once a year to keep your green card current but i couldn t leave my son i just couldn t so there was a chance because i didn t return when they said i had to that i wouldn t be able to come back with my son and his father it was awful finally the government officials allowed me to come back but they took away all the years of residency i had accumulated which would have qualified me for citizenship i had to start all over again in 2000 after i d built up enough residency once more i decided to get my citizenship because i wanted never to be separated from my son ostrander what did it feel like to take the oath of citizenship jayapal i was expecting to be cynical about the ceremony at that point i d lived here for eighteen years i thought i would walk out feeling unchanged but then i saw people weeping and i imagined the situations they had come from and how hard they had worked to become u s citizens there s a point in the ceremony at which you have to renounce your birth country i had a hard time doing that how do you renounce the place where you were born and where your parents live at that moment i teared up i think when i renounced my allegiance to india it put pressure on me to make sure the u s really lives up to the ideals that make this country great so great that people renounce their homelands in order to become americans people will sometimes call me unpatriotic or say if you don t like this country go back to your own and i always tell them that it s because i love this country that i do this work dissent is patriotic when i renounced my allegiance to india it put pressure on me to make sure the u s really lives up to the ideals that make this country great people will sometimes call me unpatriotic or say if you don t like this country go back to your own and i always tell them that it s because i love this country that i do this work ostrander we ve talked a lot about how the u s immigration system is unfair have you also seen the system work for immigrants jayapal yes and no for example our lawsuit protesting the detention and deportation of approximately five thousand somali immigrants had some initial success in the courts it started in 2002 when five somali immigrants were picked up by the immigration and naturalization service to be deported and their families and community members came to us for help we filed a temporary restraining order and won staying the deportation then we realized that somalis around the country were getting picked up put into detention and flown out on night flights so we did something unheard of at the time we filed a nationwide class action lawsuit on behalf of about five thousand somali detainees across the country the ins wasn t rounding up everybody who had final orders of deportation they were focusing on muslims and arabs through the absconder initiative a policy put forward after 9 11 that targeted immigrants from arab and muslim countries including somalia there s a rule that you can t be deported back to a country that can t accept you and we argued that somalia had no functioning government at the time the u s government attorneys argued that these deportations were necessary in order to protect americans because somalia was a hotbed of terrorism the judge marsha pechman asked why if these people were suspected terrorists the government would send them back into a hotbed of terrorism why not keep them here where we could watch them the government attorneys had no answer so we won in district court the government appealed the decision to the ninth circuit and we won again and then the case sat there because we were waiting for the outcome of a similar case brought by a man named keyse jama which had come up through the eighth circuit ahead of our case and had now reached the supreme court we developed a relationship with keyse who began to call us regularly he sometimes became disheartened by the length of the court proceedings he d say why should i sacrifice myself maybe i should just go back to somalia many detainees from that case had similar feelings after two years in a detention center they wanted to give up but they hung on because if the case was won it would be a victory for a huge number of people kevin bubriski ostrander why was keyse being deported jayapal he d committed a crime when he was young and had done his time but he was still under a final order of deportation ostrander so you can serve a sentence for a crime and then years later be deported for the same offense isn t that double jeopardy jayapal exactly ostrander so what happened to him jayapal the supreme court ruled five to four against keyse it was a terrible moment when we heard about that ruling our staff was devastated we had worked on that case for two years and now the federal government could deport all of the plaintiffs in our class action suit and some of them have been deported since then others escaped to canada and then there was a strange coda the u s government chartered a plane and flew keyse to somalia where they were met on the tarmac by the ruling warlords who said this is an illegal deportation we re not accepting him keyse called us from the tarmac he said i guess i have to come back to the u s ostrander were there any positive outcomes from those two years of work jayapal i think the immigrant community felt that even though the ruling went against them they had at least stood up for themselves the case also showed that there were american citizens who would fight for immigrants rights and through the media coverage the general public began to understand that it is not appropriate to deport people back to a country where they can be killed in a civil war we also publicized the lack of due process for instance the u s government used a number of tactics to make our defense more difficult such as moving our clients from detention center to detention center without telling us so that we had difficulty getting attorneys who could stay with the cases ostrander why would the government spend so much time and money to deport a group of immigrants from an impoverished war torn country jayapal i think a small but powerful anti immigrant group with ties to the white supremacist movement has made its way into the political sphere placing people in strategic offices and supporting candidates in key races where they can affect the tenor of the public debate about 130 members of congress now get significant campaign funding from groups like fair and the minutemen the september 11 attacks were the perfect opportunity for such groups to call for controlling our borders never mind that all of the 9 11 hijackers were here legally with visas ostrander where is keyse jama now jayapal he s free and working in minneapolis a few days after he was released reporters asked him what he wanted to do he said he wanted to ride the roller coaster at the mall of america so that s what he did i think about him screaming with the wind in his hair finally enjoying his freedom later he sent me a card that i ve kept in it he wrote if we had never met i would have dreamed you into being when we were filing that lawsuit people said you can t sue the ins nobody s ever done that and i said let s try the worst that can happen is that we won t win i think we have to dream what we want to see happen and then we have to work for it

roughly 100 000 needed per month to keep up with growth in the working age population the reports boosted the dollar against a basket of currencies stocks on wall street were mixed while u s treasury prices rose as a result of march s strong core retail sales the atlanta fed raised its first quarter gdp estimate by four tenths of a percentage point to a 2 8 percent annualized rate growth forecasts for the january march quarter have been upgraded from as low as a 0 5 percent rate following the recent trade inventories and construction spending data the economy grew at a 2 2 percent pace in the fourth quarter stronger growth in the first quarter will probably not change the view that the economy will slow this year as the stimulus from a 1 5 trillion tax cut package diminishes and the impact of interest rate hikes over the last few years lingers it also is unlikely to have any impact on monetary policy after the fed recently suspended its three year campaign to tighten monetary policy the central bank dropped projections for any rate hikes this year after increasing borrowing costs four times in 2018 key downside risks to u s growth are fading from view said allison nathan an economist at goldman sachs in new york while we still think the next fed move is much more likely to be a hike than a cut we ve pushed back our forecast for the next hike from the first quarter to the fourth of next year goldman sachs has lifted its growth estimate for the second half of 2019 by 25 basis points to 2 5 percent despite the recent wave of relatively strong data business surveys suggest pockets of weakness persist especially in manufacturing a third report on thursday from the philadelphia fed showed factory activity in the mid atlantic region slowed in april and manufacturers were less optimistic about business and labor market conditions over the next six months that was corroborated by a fourth report from data firm ihs markit showing its measure of national factory activity was unchanged near a two year low in early april with the survey s gauge of factory employment dropping to its lowest level since june 2017 many of the hard readings on activity suggest that the economy started picking up momentum late in the first quarter but this is not evident in much of the recent survey data said daniel silver an economist at jpmorgan in new york reporting by lucia mutikani

over the past five years 26 states have increased their gas tax rates even worse many more are considering similar hikes in minnesota state legislators are considering several proposals that would increase the state s fuel tax or increase fees on licensing and registration in his 2020 2021 budget plan minnesota gov tim walz called for a nearly 70 percent increase in the state s tax on gasoline and other motor fuels the largest hike in state history if enacted walz s plan would increase the motor fuel excise tax from 28 6 cents per gallon to 48 6 cents per gallon if walz s plan is approved minnesota s gas tax rank would move from 25th to fourth highest in the nation under walz s proposal the tax would be increased gradually over two years and indexed thereafter increasing it automatically each year tying any tax rate to a certain commodity price or the consumer price index is problematic and makes politicians and regulators less accountable for tax changes even worse this can contribute to higher prices by placing upward pressure on the very measures used to determine the rate walz s proposal was stopped in the minnesota senate however another similar proposal remains in the minnesota house the house proposal also phases in a 20 cent per gallon sales tax on gasoline but over four years rather than two the funds would be used to fund road and bridge repairs in addition to the fuel tax increase the house proposal includes several new fees which are better described as taxes including a 75 fee for electric vehicles to be used for building out state infrastructure for electric vehicles this fee appears to be counterintuitive increasing the number of electric cars on the road by improving the electric infrastructure will only exacerbate the effect electric vehicles have on gas tax revenue the house proposal would also increase vehicle license tab fees for newer cars and impose a 1 8 cent increase on the motor vehicle sales tax for those living in the seven county twin cities metro area to boost transit funding john phelan an economist at the minnesota based center of the american experiment argues the burden of government in minnesota is already very high and that an increased gas tax is unnecessary before dipping deep into their pockets once more gov walz should find out what happened to all the money the government has already had phelan told budget tax news the minnesota state government s revenues are at near record highs in real terms and in real per capita terms on top of this they have a projected 1 billion budget surplus for the next biennium phelan questions why a tax was needed with such a surplus and recommended a larger examination of the state s spending any proposal that would increase minnesota s gas tax ignores the mounting evidence showing gasoline levies are a regressive form of taxation that shortchanges transportation networks in recent years the rise of fuel efficient cars has decreased motor fuel tax coffers and disproportionately shifted the transportation tax burden to low income drivers a group that typically owns older less fuel efficient vehicles owning a car is already expensive in minnesota according to a report by u s news and world report minnesota is the 14th most expensive state to own a car compared to its neighbors it costs 687 more to own a car in minnesota than in iowa 1 311 more than in wisconsin 1 797 more than in south dakota and 2 889 more than in north dakota the report found the center for the american experiment also found 14 percent of the state s roads are in poor condition in 2015 daniel vock writing for governing analyzed state gas tax data reported to the u s census bureau and found two thirds of state fuel taxes failed to keep up with inflation leading to dramatic reductions in fuel tax related revenue in a maryland public policy institute study wendell cox and ronald utt argue gas taxes have a significantly greater detrimental effect on lower and middle income families than they do on the wealthy and americans for prosperity estimates lower gas prices amount to approximately 100 in additional spendable income per month for an average family even worse a tax hike would raise prices on goods and services throughout the economy because virtually all consumer goods are transported using gasoline powered vehicles in fact nearly 70 percent of all freight transported annually in the united states accounting for manufactured and retail goods worth 671 billion is transported by truck according to truckinfo net businesses will simply pass these added costs on to consumers as sales of fuel efficient vehicles expand motor fuel tax revenues will decline more rapidly minnesota must find new and more effective ways to cover the costs of transportation projects if the state wishes to avoid a fiscal disaster for instance the state could privatize roads expand toll systems or in line with what has occurred in several cities across the country lawmakers could implement congestion pricing varying toll prices based on congestion to manage demand and limit traffic problems the following documents provide additional

the imf world bank meeting in washington this weekend revealed again that the world economy is slowing down and the prospect of an outright recession is getting much higher the imf economists cut their outlook for global growth to the lowest since the global financial crisis of 2009 amid a bleaker outlook in most major advanced economies and signs that higher tariffs are weighing on trade a growth slowdown and precarious recovery the imf called it the imf imf international monetary fund along with the world bank the imf was founded on the day the bretton woods agreements were signed its first mission was to support the new system of standard exchange rates when the bretton wood fixed rates system came to an end in 1971 the main function of the imf became that of being both policeman and fireman for global capital it acts as policeman when it enforces its structural adjustment policies and as fireman when it steps in to help out governments in risk of defaulting on debt repayments as for the world bank a weighted voting system operates depending on the amount paid as contribution by each member state 85 of the votes is required to modify the imf charter which means that the usa with 17 68 of the votes has a de facto veto on any change the institution is dominated by five countries the united states 16 74 japan 6 23 germany 5 81 france 4 29 and the uk 4 29 the other 183 member countries are divided into groups led by one country the most important one 6 57 of the votes is led by belgium the least important group of countries 1 55 of the votes is led by gabon and brings together african countries estimates that the world economy will grow 3 3 this year down from the 3 5 it had forecast for 2019 in january it s the third time the imf has downgraded its outlook in six months the new imf chief economist gita gopinath reckoned the global economy had entered a delicate moment she offered a decisive insight if the downside risks do not materialize and the policy support put in place is effective global growth should rebound if however any of the major risks materialize then the expected recoveries in stressed economies export dependent economies and highly indebted economies may be derailed so on the one hand or on the other alongside the imf view the private brookings institution delivered its view on the global economy concluding from its tracking index of economic activity that the world had entered a synchronised slowdown which may be difficult to reverse the brookings ft tracking index for the global economic recovery tiger compares indicators of real activity financial markets and investor confidence with their historical averages for the global economy and for individual countries the headline readings slipped back significantly at the end of last year and are at their lowest levels for both advanced and emerging economies since 2016 the year of the weakest global economic performance since the financial crisis brookings did not reckon a recession was imminent but all parts of the world economy were losing momentum even if a global recession is not yet with us it is clear from the latest data on the major economies that the long depression as i have characterised this period since 2009 is still with us frances coppola the heterodox economist has also blogged that capitalism is locked into a long depression and makes similar points to me on its outcome but as for causes coppola like other keynesians holds to the idea of secular stagnation namely that the depression is due to a chronic lack of demand regular readers of this blog know that i do not consider this is an adequate explanation of crises and depressions in a profit profit the positive gain yielded from a company s activity net profit is profit after tax distributable profit is the part of the net profit which can be distributed to the shareholders making economy it is the profitability of capital that matters and here the imf s new global stability report offers more support for my causal interpretation of the long depression confirming what i have shown empirically before the imf finds that corporate profitability as measured by corporate earnings as a share share a unit of ownership interest in a corporation or financial asset representing one part of the total capital stock its owner a shareholder is entitled to receive an equal distribution of any profits distributed a dividend and to attend shareholder meetings of the stock of assets in the major economies has not recovered to 2008 levels indeed profitability of capital is well below levels of the late 1990s this long depression has similar characteristics as the late 19th century depression and the great depression of the 1930s the first was resolved by a series of slumps eventually driving up profitability and second was resolved by a world war it s my view that this one will be resolved more like the 19th century one low profitability explains above all else why corporate investment has been so weak since 2009 what profits have been made have been switched into financial speculations mergers and acquisitions share buybacks and dividend payouts also there has been hoarding of cash all this is because the profitability of productive investment remains historically low as gillian tett in the ft put it the imf calculates that american companies made shareholder payouts and buybacks that were worth 0 9 per cent of assets last year twice the level seen in 2010 little wonder that equity equity the capital put into an enterprise by the shareholders not to be confused with hard capital or unsecured debt markets have soared leaving aside the wobble late last year companies have also used this arsenal for a mergers and acquisitions boom such deals gobbled up cash flows equivalent to 0 4 per cent of assets in 2019 compared with virtually nothing in 2011 but the amount of cash flow spent on capex in contrast has flatlined since 2012 running at around 0 7 per cent of all assets smaller than the cash flow spend on shareholder payouts or as the imf report notes strong profits in the united states were used for payouts and other financial risk taking but not it seems lots more investment the other key factor in the long depression has been the rise in debt particularly corporate debt with profitability low companies have run up more debt in order to fund projects or speculate the big companies like apple or microsoft can do this because they have cash hoards to fall back on if anything goes wrong the smaller companies can only manage this debt spiral because interest rates interest rates when a lends money to b b repays the amount lent by a the capital as well as a supplementary sum known as interest so that a has an interest in agreeing to this financial operation the interest is determined by the interest rate which may be high or low to take a very simple example if a borrows 100 million dollars for 10 years at a fixed interest rate of 5 the first year he will repay a tenth of the capital initially borrowed 10 million dollars plus 5 of the capital owed i e 5 million dollars that is a total of 15 million dollars in the second year he will again repay 10 of the capital borrowed but the 5 now only applies to the remaining 90 million dollars still due i e 4 5 million dollars or a total of 14 5 million dollars and so on until the tenth year when he will repay the last 10 million dollars plus 5 of that remaining 10 million dollars i e 0 5 million dollars giving a total of 10 5 million dollars over 10 years the total amount repaid will come to 127 5 million dollars the repayment of the capital is not usually made in equal instalments in the initial years the repayment concerns mainly the interest and the proportion of capital repaid increases over the years in this case if repayments are stopped the capital still due is higher the nominal interest rate is the rate at which the loan is contracted the real interest rate is the nominal rate reduced by the rate of inflation remain at all time lows and so servicing the debt is still feasible as long as there is not a downturn in sales and profits again the imf s global stability report sums up the issue in most advanced economies debt service capacity in the corporate sector improved during the recent cyclical upswing balance balance end of year statement of a company s assets what the company possesses and liabilities what it owes in other words the assets provide information about how the funds collected by the company have been used and the liabilities about the origins of those funds sheets appear strong enough to sustain a moderate economic slowdown or a gradual tightening of financial conditions however overall debt levels and financial risk taking have increased and creditworthiness of borrowers has deteriorated in the investment grade bond bond a bond is a stake in a debt issued by a company or governmental body the holder of the bond the creditor is entitled to interest and reimbursement of the principal if the company is listed the holder can also sell the bond on a stock exchange and leveraged loan markets a significant downturn or a sharp tightening of financial conditions could lead to a notable repricing of credit risks and strain the debt service capacity of indebted firms should monetary and financial conditions remain easy for longer debt will likely continue to rise over the medium term in the absence of policy action raising the risk of a sharper adjustment in the future each crisis has a different trigger or proximate cause the 1974 5 international recession was triggered by a sharp rise in oil prices and the us coming of the dollar gold standard the 1980 82 slump was triggered by a housing bubble in europe and a manufacturing crisis in major economies the 1990 2 recession was triggered by the iraq war and oil prices the 2001 mild recession was the result of the bursting of the dot com bubble and the great recession was started with the collapse of the housing bubble in the us and ensuing credit crunch brought on by the international diversification of credit derivatives derivatives a family of financial products that includes mainly options futures swaps and their combinations all related to other assets shares bonds raw materials and commodities interest rates indices etc from which they are by nature inseparable options on shares futures contracts on an index etc their value depends on and is derived from thus the name that of these other assets there are derivatives involving a firm commitment currency futures interest rate or exchange swaps and derivatives involving a conditional commitment options warrants etc but underlying each of these crises was the downward movement in the profitability of productive capital and eventually a slowdown or decline in the mass of profits the profit investment nexus this time i reckon the trigger will be in corporate debt as companies get overstretched on cheap credit and as profits fall and interest interest an amount paid in remuneration of an investment or received by a lender interest is calculated on the amount of the capital invested or borrowed the duration of the operation and the rate that has been set costs rise they become insolvent marxist economist eric toussaint of the cadtm agrees this mountain of corporate private debt will be a prime element in the next financial crisis he points out that as interest rates climb the value of corporative debt sinks the greater the share of sinking corporate debt in a company s assets the greater the negative impact on the corporate balance sheet the corporate equity value sinks too and may get to a point where it no longer covers its obligations in 2016 apple informed us authorities that in the case of a 1 increase in interest rates it would lose 4 9 billion of course just like other companies apple borrowed to finance its debt purchases in 2017 apple has already borrowed 28 billion bringing the total to 75 billion this by domino effect could produce a crisis of similar ampler to that of the us financial crisis in 2007 2008 as the imf chief economist puts it capitalism is in a delicate moment
everything to know about the april 8 eclipse in atlantic canada saltwire eclipse saltwire by lucia mutikani washington reuters u s retail sales increased by the most in 1 1 2 years in march as households boosted purchases of motor vehicles and a range of other goods the latest indication that economic growth picked up in the first quarter after a false start the economy s enduring strength was reinforced by other data on thursday showing the number of americans filing applications for unemployment benefits dropped to the lowest in nearly 50 years last week fears of an abrupt slowdown in growth escalated at the turn of the year after a batch of weak economic reports related stories they were also exacerbated by a brief inversion of the u s treasury yield curve in late march but those concerns have dissipated in recent weeks amid fairly upbeat data on trade inventories and construction spending that have suggested growth last quarter could be better than the moderate pace logged in the final three months of 2018 a report from the federal reserve on wednesday described economic activity as expanding at a slight to moderate pace in march and early april the fed s beige book report of anecdotal information on business activity collected from contacts nationwide showed a few of the u s central bank s districts reported some strengthening the rebound in retail sales underscores that the domestic outlook remains favorable and well supported by the labor market and it dispels the misguided concerns that the u s economy is slipping into recession said kathy bostjancic head of u s macro investor services at oxford economics in new york the commerce department said retail sales surged 1 6 percent in march the biggest increase since september 2017 after dropping 0 2 percent in february economists polled by reuters had forecast retail sales accelerating 0 9 percent last month with march s rebound retail sales have now erased the plunge in december that put consumer spending and the overall economy on a sharply lower growth trajectory retail sales last month were probably lifted by tax refunds even though they have been smaller than in previous years following the revamping of the u s tax code in january 2018 excluding automobiles gasoline building materials and food services retail sales rebounded 1 0 percent in march after declining 0 3 percent in february these so called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product consumer spending accounts for more than two thirds of economic activity and is

inflation can be like molasses it often moves slowly until it doesn t 1 overall inflation tends to be a heavily lagging economic indicator with upward price pressures typically not being realized until an economy has already reached the overheating stage for instance a country s labor market may be stretched beyond capacity while at the same time prices are only modestly budging upward 2019 anyone it s no secret that one of the principal reasons the u s federal reserve the fed shelved plans for rate increases through at least the first three quarters of this year is sluggish inflation which by one common measure likely remains below the central bank s 2 target it s also no secret that the u s unemployment rate continues to hover near an all time low for the current economic cycle 2 does this mean that inflation could spike without warning sometime later this year what about in 2020 our answer an acceleration appears unlikely through the end of this year but all bets are off for 2020 to understand why let s take a step back and look at three common causes of inflation three drivers of inflation inflation is typically driven by anticipation demand pull cost push anticipation is the market s expectation of future inflation anticipation can contain information from recent trends as well as any forward looking information often there s an element of self fulfilling prophecy at play here why suppose in the aggregate individuals make business decisions based on an expectation of 2 inflation then surprise surprise we ll end up with 2 inflation demand pull comes from an increased aggregate demand for goods this uptick in demand often happens during times of low unemployment or high wages since strong consumer fundamentals often lead to increased spending this can also take place when a government or central bank injects monetary or fiscal stimulus into the economy cost push is driven by higher production costs which producers pass on to consumers in the form of steeper prices production costs can rise due to an increase in taxes and tariffs higher per unit labor costs an uptick in raw materials prices such as oil or weakening exchange rates the current strength of the u s dollar for instance is one of the factors that has kept inflation down over the last several months when the currency is strong it takes less dollars to purchase foreign imports which puts downward pressure on prices however we expect the purchasing power of the dollar to erode by late this year lowering the exchange rate and leading to a potential uptick in inflation two of the three inflation drivers are here but anticipation isn t recent data indicates that the demand and cost pressures that drive inflation are present in today s economy however empirical evidence suggests that anticipation is the primary predictor of inflation3 with this in mind take a look at the chart below which shows five year inflation expectations among consumers markets and economists note that across all three measures expectations are currently hovering near the bottom of recent ranges this supports the case for stable inflation moving forward because inflation expectations are anchored at such low levels we believe that inflation through the end of the year is likely to remain stable however the same may not ring true next year we do see the potential for a rise in inflation come 2020 mainly due to the lack of spare capacity within the u s economy spare capacity the catalyst for inflation acceleration as the chart below shows the gdp gross domestic product of all major economies is currently at or above potential this includes the u s the uk china japan and the eurozone in addition labor markets are tight worldwide the chart below illustrates the lack of spare capacity in the aforementioned major economies so what s the consequence of all this rising wages across the globe this is important because in general higher wages are often supportive of a consumer who wants to spend in the aggregate this could create upward pressure on prices there are also cost implications to a tight labor market chief among them an increase in cost pressure for producers the chart below shows the per unit labor costs for several major european countries as well as the u s across the eurozone per unit labor costs are still relatively low which is supportive of stable inflation however as the graph demonstrates this isn t the case in the u s where labor costs appear to be rising even accounting for productivity gains if u s producers pass this increase in labor costs on to consumers via higher prices inflation could accelerate what else could potentially give inflation a boost inflation has also been hampered by a slew of transitory headwinds which we believe will become tailwinds in the future the first of these is the global bias toward monetary tightening among central banks that existed prior to january 2019 after the fed signaled a pause in interest rate hikes on jan 30 pivoting to a more dovish stance many other central banks followed suit this shift in dovishness is stimulatory and could support higher inflation down the road the second headwind has been the strength of the u s dollar the dollar s bull run has lowered import prices in the u s but we expect the dollar to weaken or stabilize later this year once this happens inflation could rise faster the third headwind has been cheap oil the low cost of oil particularly late last year may have led to softer inflation in recent months however going forward we expect oil to rebound higher supporting higher price inflation taken together these three transitory factors may help explain why inflation remains soft despite a lack of spare capacity and high wages bottom line inflation should remain stable as long as anticipation remains low ultimately we believe that inflation will remain relatively stable through the end of 2019 before possibly rising at a faster clip in 2020 anticipation in our view trumps all other factors as the central driver of inflation and anticipation remains low until forward looking expectations begin to rise inflation is likely to plod along at a snail s pace just like molasses 1 recall the infamous great molasses flood of 1919 in boston massachusetts a burst molasses tank sent millions of gallons of molasses through the

population the unemployment rate is at 3 8 percent near the 3 7 percent fed officials project it will be by the end of the year u s stock index futures and u s treasury yields rose after the release of the data the dollar gained against a basket of currencies march s strong core retail sales could result in the further upgrading of first quarter gdp estimates growth forecasts for the first quarter were boosted to around a 2 5 percent annualised rate on wednesday after data showed the u s trade deficit narrowed for a second straight month in february first quarter growth forecasts have been raised from as low as a 0 5 percent rate following relatively strong reports on trade inventories and construction spending the economy grew at a 2 2 percent pace in the fourth quarter advertisement stronger growth in the first quarter will probably not change the view that the economy will slow this year as the stimulus from a 1 5 trillion tax cut package diminishes and the impact of interest rate hikes over the last few years lingers it also is unlikely to have any impact on monetary policy after the fed recently suspended its three year campaign to tighten monetary policy the central bank dropped projections for any rate hikes this year after increasing borrowing costs four times in 2018 in march sales at auto dealerships jumped 3 1 percent the most since september 2017

washington cnn a government analysis of president donald trump s proposed replacement for the north american free trade agreement shows it would have only a modest though positive effect on the us economy thursday s report from the us international trade commission an independent federal agency found that the united states mexico canada agreement usmca would boost the manufacturing agriculture and service industries the report estimates the deal would raise gdp by 0 35 and create 176 000 jobs after six years but given the size of the three countries economies and the fact that nafta already eliminated most tariffs and trade barriers between them the impact of the agreement on the us economy is likely to be moderate the itc report said the report which was due to congress by friday could play an important role as the trump administration tries to sell the deal to lawmakers trump campaigned in 2016 on getting rid of nafta which he s said is perhaps the worst trade deal ever made he s promoted the usmca as one of his big accomplishments claiming it s already creating jobs despite the fact it hasn t been ratified by congress democrats have been dissatisfied with trump s new deal arguing it does not go far enough to enforce new labor and environmental protections house speaker nancy pelosi and some of her colleagues have pushed trump s trade team to reopen the negotiations which finished with a signing ceremony with leaders of all three countries last november the office of the us trade representative headed by trump appointee robert lighthizer put out its own economic analysis of the usmca thursday focusing on some of the most notable changes for automakers made in the deal it requires that 75 of a vehicle s parts must be made in north america up from the current 62 5 rule in order to remain free from tariffs it would also require more vehicle parts to be made by workers earning at least 16 an hour the administration s report which the official said is based on information the administration received from automakers said those changes alone would create 76 000 jobs and lead to 34 billion in new manufacturing investments over a five year period but the itc s analysis of the new auto rules was less positive it found that it would add 28 000 jobs in the industry over six years but also lead to a small increase in the price of vehicles that consumers pay the american automotive policy council which represents general motors ford and fiat chrysler criticized the itc report for underestimating the long term investments us automakers will make because of the usmca in fact billions of dollars in new us investments have already been announced said president matt blunt a former missouri republican governor it s not the first time the trump administration has put out economic analysis that differs from independent government agencies when the congressional budget office scored the president s first budget in 2017 it said that the administration overestimated future economic growth to the tune of 3 4 trillion in tax revenue over next decade in a statement thursday lighthizer said he welcomed the itc report noting that it found the usmca would boost gdp by more than was projected under the trans pacific partnership trade deal that trump pulled out of in one of his first acts as president these findings validate president trump s action to withdraw from tpp and renegotiate the disastrous nafta he said automakers could decide not to comply with the new rules and instead pay the relatively low 2 5 tariff on vehicles and auto parts moving across the border as suggested by an international monetary fund study released last month that paper said the usmca s impact on real gdp would be trivial and could even be a net loss for the united states if trump s tariffs on steel and aluminum remain in place canada and mexico along with us lawmakers from both parties have called for trump to end the tariffs before the trilateral deal is ratified an automaker industry group the association of global automakers reiterated thursday how those tariffs complicate matters current and threatened tariffs should be removed so the industry can focus on retaining a critical regional trading agreement while keeping more jobs and innovation in the united states the group said in a statement senate finance committee chairman chuck grassley an iowa republican is a proponent of the usmca and for lifting the existing tariffs he argued on thursday that the agreement makes important updates to nafta on intellectual property currency practices and digital trade but that the impact on gdp of those changes has historically been inherently difficult for economists to measure
opinion the working class exists for humanity if it is to radically change the world it must wage its own war against the i and for the we learning about and building on the struggles of the past to save humanity california is a state of geographical extremes the deserts the sierras the long ocean coast and the central valleys it is a critical agricultural state and every visitor ought to travel through the san joaquin imperial or sacramento valleys to see the sources of the food we eat go during a harvest and watch the brown skinned men women and children pick the crops the people who so many in the united states now fear and hate though without them they wouldn t have such cheap food or any at all thus begins the last chapter of can the working class change the world the recently released book by michael d yates

of each adjustment item by applying danaher s overall estimated effective tax rate to the pretax amount unless the nature of the item and or the tax jurisdiction in which the item has been recorded requires application of a specific tax rate or tax treatment in which case the tax effect of such item is estimated by applying such specific tax rate or tax treatment the mcps are not tax deductible and therefore the tax effect of the adjustments does not include any tax impact of the mcps dividends f discrete tax adjustments and other tax related adjustments for the three month period ended march 29 2019 include the impact of net discrete tax charges of 242 million 0 34 per diluted share related primarily to changes in estimates associated with prior period uncertain tax positions and audit settlements net of the release of valuation allowances associated with certain foreign tax credits and tax benefits resulting from a change in law and excess tax benefits from stock based compensation realized in the three month period ended march 29 2019 in excess of anticipated levels the company anticipates excess tax benefits from stock compensation of approximately 7 million per quarter and therefore excludes benefits in excess of this amount in the calculation of adjusted diluted net earnings per share g in march 2019 the company issued 1 65 billion in aggregate liquidation preference of our 4 75 mcps dividends on the mcps are payable on a cumulative basis at an annual rate of 4 75 on the liquidation preference of 1 000 per share unless earlier converted each share of mcps will automatically convert on april 15 2022 into between 6 6368 and 8 1300 shares of danaher s common stock subject to further anti dilution adjustments the number of shares of danaher s common stock issuable on conversion of the mcps will be determined based on the vwap per share of our common stock over the 20 consecutive trading day period beginning on and including the 21st scheduled trading day immediately before april 15 2022 for the purposes of calculating adjusted earnings per share the company has excluded the anticipated mcps dividends and assumed the if converted method of share dilution the incremental shares of common stock deemed outstanding applying the if converted method of calculating share dilution are referred to as the converted shares the company believes that using the if converted method provides additional insight to investors on the potential impact of the mcps once they are converted into common stock no later than april 15 2022 statement regarding non gaap measures each of the non gaap measures set forth above should be considered in addition to and not as a replacement for or superior to the comparable gaap measure and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies management believes that these measures provide useful information to investors by offering additional ways of viewing danaher corporation s danaher or the company results that when reconciled to the corresponding gaap measure help our investors to with respect to adjusted diluted net earnings per share understand the long term profitability trends of our business and compare our profitability to prior and future periods and to our peers with respect to core revenue identify underlying growth trends in our business and compare our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to our peers and with respect to free cash flow the fcf measure understand danaher s ability to generate cash without external financings strengthen its balance sheet invest in its business and grow its business through acquisitions and other strategic opportunities although a limitation of free cash flow is that it does not take into account the company s debt service requirements and other non discretionary expenditures and as a result the entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures management uses these non gaap measures to measure the company s operating and financial performance and uses core revenue and non gaap measures similar to adjusted diluted net earnings per share and the fcf measure in the company s executive compensation program the items excluded from the non gaap measures set forth above have been excluded for the following reasons with respect to adjusted diluted net earnings per share we exclude the amortization of acquisition related intangible assets because the amount and timing of such charges are significantly impacted by the timing size number and nature of the acquisitions we consummate while we have a history of significant acquisition activity we do not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle and the amount of an acquisition s purchase price allocated to intangible assets and related amortization term are unique to each acquisition and can vary significantly from acquisition to acquisition exclusion of this amortization expense facilitates more consistent comparisons of operating results over time between our newly acquired and long held businesses and with both acquisitive and non acquisitive peer companies we believe however that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets contribute to revenue generation and that intangible asset amortization related to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized we exclude costs incurred pursuant to discrete restructuring plans that are fundamentally different in terms of the size strategic nature and planning requirements as well as the inconsistent frequency of such plans from the ongoing productivity improvements that result from application of the danaher business system because these restructuring plans are incremental to the core activities that arise in the ordinary course of our business and we believe are not indicative of danaher s ongoing operating costs in a given period we exclude these costs from the calculation of adjusted diluted net earnings per share to facilitate a more consistent comparison of operating results over time with respect to the other items excluded from adjusted diluted net earnings per share we exclude these items because they are of a nature and or size that occur with inconsistent frequency occur for reasons that may be unrelated to danaher s commercial performance during the period and or we believe that such items may obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long term performance difficult for example the first quarter 2019 legal contingency charges excluded from adjusted earnings per share were excluded because legal contingencies of this nature and amount are atypical for our businesses infrequent and not representative of a trend in our underlying business with respect to core revenue 1 we exclude the impact of currency translation because it is not under management s control is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends and 2 we exclude the effect of acquisitions and divested product lines because the timing size number and nature of such transactions can vary significantly from period to period and between us and our peers which we believe may obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long term performance difficult with respect to the fcf measure we exclude payments for additions to property plant and equipment net of the proceeds from capital disposals to demonstrate the amount of operating cash flow for the period that

there is a commendable bipartisan urge within congress to rebuke the trump administration for failing to articulate a comprehensive strategy for countering the devil may care foreign policy of the kremlin if past patterns hold further revelations in the russia saga perhaps with the release of the special counsel report will oblige members of both parties to dissociate themselves once again from well advertised desire of president trump to have a great relationship with vladimir putin without access to the same coercive tools controlled by the white house congress is forced to look for other ways to exert control over foreign policy toward russia one favorite option is to pile on fresh rounds of sanctions and at least two sanctions bills have been introduced but there is still time for a serious look at the impact of five years of sanctions on the russian appetite for risk and our most important alliance relationships jarrett blanc jarrett blanc was a senior fellow in the geoeconomics and strategy program at the carnegie endowment for international peace more bluntly the current approach is not exactly paying off congress boxed in the trump administration with the countering america s adversaries through sanctions act of 2017 this law codified an existing united states effort to pressure putin by sanctioning individuals and key parts of the russian economy linked to the kremlin it also made it politically costly for the trump administration to avoid imposing new sanctions and gave congress a voice in lifting any sanctions once they were imposed unfortunately the theories of this law and previous russia sanctions have collided with current realities while it is true that american and european sanctions since 2014 have done lasting damage to the russian economy the dirty secret is that much of the most disruptive russian behavior is done cheaply since 2015 the kremlin has mounted a global campaign of election meddling cybersecurity attacks and military muscle flexing russia cannot be targeted with iran or north korea style sanctions without hurting american interests and its technocrats have mounted a textbook policy response to blunt the impact of sanctions the tumbling ruble an outcome routinely touted by western observers as a sign of sanctions effectiveness turned out to be one of the most effective tools for the kremlin it boosted profits of exporters in dollars and made government expenditures in rubles cheaper the kremlin is now in a solid position to respond to further economic pressure thanks to higher oil prices modest growth and almost half a trillion dollars sitting in currency reserves jarrett blanc jarrett blanc was a senior fellow in the geoeconomics and strategy program at the carnegie endowment for international peace more the idea that sanctions would force putin to back off by targeting his cronies and oligarchs also has some serious holes overstating the influence that russian business elites have over national security decision making betrays a lack of understanding about how the country is actually ruled they are more dependent on the state today than the state is on them figures close to putin are often the hardest to target with sanctions some have even benefited by scooping up assets from the less reliable tycoons investing in booming sectors and pleading for state subsidies how can congress do better first sanctions are not the only tool of coercive economic diplomacy a number of european partners have gone much farther than the united states to counter illicit finance especially by requiring greater transparency over the ownership of assets like real estate and corporations more transparency on beneficial ownership would make it harder for influential russians to access everything from real estate to elite educations congress is already considering such a strategy but the effort is largely divorced from and lacks the political prioritization accorded to current discussions on russia sanctions second congress should take the lead in coordinating sanctions and other coercive economic tools with our allies who happen to be some of the main russian trading partners the extensive dialogue between congress and european and asian allies is limited to reactions to draft sanctions legislation our allies in europe and asia are more effective though far from perfect in asking congress to remove problematic provisions than in proposing useful new collaborations such as on beneficial ownership congress should begin a dialogue earlier in the process with an effort to identify common objectives then building coercive tools that can be implemented in a truly multilateral manner under normal circumstances the executive branch would be responsible for this dialogue president trump and his team have been helpless evident through such messes as the poorly conceived and then poorly removed sanctions targeting russian aluminum giant rusal which would have done much more damage to european manufacturers than to the kremlin congress should not run the risk of another rusal style train wreck and cannot depend on the trump administration to avoid it there will be a moment in the coming months when congress will feel compelled to make a point about united states policy toward russia there are ways that our lawmakers can make a difference a sanctions policy that is more aggressive than thoughtful however may feel satisfying but may prove to be counterproductive in the long run this article was originally published by the hill

will be reviewing our results for the first quarter of 2019 key takeaways from the call today are we are ensuring a strong organization for our shareholders customers and employees supported by strong underlying fundamentals including our core deposit funding advantage as we remain diligently focused on credit quality profitability and positive operating leverage we re pleased with wesbanco s performance during the first quarter of 2019 as we work to ensure a strong organization for our shareholders when excluding merger costs net income increased 27 to 43 million or 0 78 per diluted share these earnings generated strong profitability ratios for the quarter with core return on average assets and average tangible equity of 1 39 and 16 56 respectively we continue to maintain strong regulatory capital ratios as both consolidated and bank level regulatory capital ratios are well above the applicable well capitalized standards promulgated by a bank regulators and the basel iii capital standards in addition record earnings achieved during 2018 combined with our strong regulatory capital and liquidity positions and solid execution on our well defined long term operational and growth strategies enabled us to increase the quarterly cash dividends by 6 9 or 0 02 to 0 31 per share during february this was the 12th increase during the last nine years representing a cumulative increase of 121 our long term success is dependent upon continued execution of our well defined operational and growth plans as we remain both disciplined and balanced to ensure stability and success across the economic cycles we are focused on long term sustainable and profitable growth we ll not sacrifice long term shareholder value for near term gains as such i am very pleased with the strong quarterly trend and asset quality measures as they reflect the consistent high quality of our overall loan portfolio while we typically stress the importance of viewing loan growth over a rolling four quarter period in order to mitigate the impact from quarterly fluctuations in the construction portfolio due to repayments and seasonality i d like to discuss our sequential quarter loan growth in light of the comments we made during our fourth quarter 2018 earnings call in particular we mentioned that we were at the end of the targeted reductions in our consumer portfolio related to its risk return profile also they anticipated that the aggressive commercial real estate payoffs experienced during 2018 would begin to moderate and we re encouraged that our commercial pipeline going into 2019 was better than what we d experienced going into 2018 during the first quarter these statements have begun to prove true as total portfolio loans were flat when compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 or up 0 5 when annualized this positive result reflects the anticipated stabilization across loan categories our residential mortgage program continues to be a bright spot as overall production as well as the pipeline continued to be strong across all of our markets helping the direct fee income as well as growth in our portfolio loans the strength of our commercial pipeline that we saw early in the quarter remains and helped to grow commercial and industrial loans approximately 1 quarter over quarter we remain confident in our ability to deliver the low to mid single digit total loan growth over the long term finally we continue to make appropriate investments in fee and loan opportunities including an additional c i lenders mortgage loan officers private bankers and securities brokerage representative new hires and building out our online lending application capabilities furthermore we recently hired a new managing director who ll be responsible for planning and directing wesbanco securities and wesbanco insurance including the near and long term profitability and growth of these fee based businesses with our 30 plus year of securities experience and insurance regulatory experience and her success in the world of banking i m excited about the renewed opportunities for these businesses effective today current director and vice chairman christopher criss succeeded jim gardill as chairman of the board of directors as he did not stand for reelection due to the company directors retirement policy while jim will remain general counsel for the bank holding company i d like to extend the appreciation of the entire wesbanco family to jim for his long service on the board of directors and his dedication to our success for 45 years jim has provided key experience and sound counsel that has enabled the corporation to grow from a small west virginia based bank into an emerging regional financial institution with a community bank at its core in addition i m pleased to be able to continue my working relationship with chris in his new role as chairman of the board his diversified business and accounting background management experience in long term active participation on the board will ensure his success as our chairman before turning the call over for a review of our financials i wanted to highlight a few recent accolades that demonstrate the fact that wesbanco prides itself on delivering large bank capabilities with the community bank feel a financial institution through its customer centric model that delivers a strong financial institution for both our shareholders and our customers we continue to be nationally recognized for our performance strength and credit quality building upon being named one of america s best banks for the ninth time by a leading financial magazine earlier this year we were just named s p global market intelligence best performing regional bank ranking for 2018 as the number 16 bank this ranking focused on profitability asset quality and loan growth including average tangible common equity and net charge offs as a percentage of average loans efficiency ratio and net margin for 87 eligible institutions with assets between 10 billion and 50 billion lastly we received another accolade one of which i m extremely proud because it was based on customer satisfaction and consumer feedback wesbanco was named the forbes magazine s inaugural ranking of the world s best bank earning no 7 ranking in the united states based on solid scores across the survey including very high scores for general satisfaction trust and customer services this recognition is a testament to the hard work and dedication of all of our employees as they focus on our better banking pledge to deliver superior customer service and strive to maintain a premier financial institution for our customers i would now like to turn the call over to bob young our chief financial officer for an update on our first quarter financial results bob robert young chief financial officer executive vice president thanks todd and good afternoon everyone we indeed reported strong year over year profitability while displaying solid credit quality and expense management this quarter for the three months ended march 31 2019 we reported gaap net income of 40 3 million and earnings per diluted share of 0 74 as compared to 33 5 million and 0 76 respectively in the prior year period excluding after tax merger related expenses from both periods net income increased 26 9 to 42 8 million and earnings per diluted share increased 2 6 to 0 78 reflecting the additional shares issued for last year s two acquisitions and just as a reminder financial results for first sentry and farmers capital have been included in wesbanco s results subsequent to their 2018 merger dates of april 5 and august 20 2018 respectively total assets as of march 31 2019 grew to 12 6 billion year over year reflecting approximately 2 3 billion of assets from the first sentry and farmers capital acquisitions total portfolio loans of 7 7 billion increased 21 3 compared to the prior year due to both acquisitions as todd mentioned we realized some stabilization across several loan categories during the first quarter which led to overall flat loan growth on a sequential basis in addition total loan production was up about 20 from last year s first quarter regarding our strong residential mortgage loan program originations during the quarter were up some 16 year over year driven by home purchases and construction lending across our footprint while salable residential mortgage originations continue to represent around a 60 range of total originations we have also seen continued growth in one to four family mortgage loans primarily jumbo and private banking loans held on our balance sheet as they grew 5 organically year over year total deposits increased 23 4 year over year to 8 9 billion due to the acquisitions as well as organic transaction account growth driven by our legacy footprint that sits on top of the marcellus and utica shale formations this core advantage is hard to replicate as shale energy related deposits continue to be in the low eight figure range each month these deposits which help drive the 4 8 year over year organic growth in non interest bearing demand deposits helped to maintain a loan to deposit ratio in the high 80 range they also aided profitability due to a lower than industry average deposit beta of just 24 or 18 basis points during the past year or 16 and 12 basis points if including the impact of non interest bearing deposit growth the net interest margin for the first quarter of 2019 increased 30 basis points year over year to 3 68 reflecting the benefit from the increases in the federal reserve board s targeted federal funds rate during 2018 as well as the higher margin on the acquired farmers capital net assets these benefits were partially offset by higher overall funding costs as well as a continued flattening of the yield curve purchase accounting accretion from the acquisitions benefited the first quarter of 2019s net interest margin by approximately 19 basis points as compared to 6 basis points in the prior year period and 23 basis points in the fourth quarter of last year approximately 3 basis points of accretion in the first quarter was the result of a payoff of a prior acquisitions impaired loan excluding purchase accounting accretion the core net interest margin increased 17 basis points year over year from 3 32 last year to 3 49 and it was flat sequentially to the fourth quarter of 2018 for the quarter ended march 31 2019 non interest income increased 15 8 from the prior year to 27 8 million driven mostly by the first sentry and farmers acquisitions the associated larger customer base and higher transaction volumes resulted in increases in electronic banking fees and deposit service charges trust fees increased year over year primarily due to a 500 million increase in trust assets to 4 5 billion from the addition of farmers capital trust farmers capital s trust business as well as organic growth indeed rebounding nicely from the equity market s decrease in the fourth quarter lastly other income increased 1 0 million primarily due to an increase in payment processing fee income from a business inherited from farmers capital as well as loan swap fees we continue to demonstrate strong profitability and positive operating leverage through successful execution of our strategies as well as controlling discretionary costs even with the inclusion of the two acquisitions operating expenses the farmers capitals branch and data processing conversions occurred during february and focused expense savings began later in the quarter our expense management efforts are demonstrated by a relatively stable efficiency ratio of 55 9 excluding merger related expenses non interest expense increased 17 0 million or 31 3 compared to the prior year period this year over year increase is reflective of the two acquisitions and their associated staffs and locations which were the primary reasons for the increases in salaries and wages employee benefits net occupancy and equipment costs as well as intangibles amortization employee benefits expense was impacted by a 0 6 million market adjustment in the deferred compensation plan obligation which is mostly offset in the net securities gains and non interest income and 0 7 million in higher seasonal payroll taxes as well as higher healthcare and pension costs fdic insurance expense increased 0 7 million or 105 6 year over year due to the bank now being assessed as a large bank with more than 10 billion in total assets during the first quarter of 2019 our credit quality ratios remain strong as we balanced disciplined loan origination in the current environment with our prudent lending standards in fact we reported continued strength across key credit quality metrics including non performing assets past due loans the provision for credit losses and net loan charge offs as most of these measures remained at or near historic lows criticized and classified loan balance did increase during the first quarter to 109 million or 1 42 of total portfolio loans as part of our normal loan grade review process post acquisition for farmers capital and in conjunction with two downgraded relationships in our legacy portfolio the downgraded loans were from different industries and no trends were evident in addition we continue to maintain strong regulatory capital ratios as both consolidated and bank level ratios grew this quarter and significantly exceeded both well capitalized standards and peer ratios even after the early redemption of an inherited trup preferred security from farmers capital for 10 million with another 22 5 million of trups to be redeemed during the second quarter now before opening the call for your questions i would like to provide some current thoughts on our outlook for the remainder of the year which remain relatively consistent with our outlook provided on last quarter s earnings call since we remain somewhat asset sensitive we are not immune from the factors that are affecting net interest margins across the industry including the current very flat spread between the two to 10 year treasury yield treasury yields and an overall low long term rate environment we believe that our core deposit funding advantage combined with our low loan to deposit ratio will help to maintain overall deposit funding costs we do not currently anticipate much overall change in our core net interest margin during the balance of the year as compared to the first quarter however we do expect somewhat lower purchase accounting accretion which will reduce the stated margin a few basis points overall we still anticipate purchase accounting accretion to be in the mid teens during 2019 declining at a pace of 1 to 2 basis points per quarters regarding operating expenses we remain on pace to achieve the remaining 25 of the anticipated first sentry cost savings of 38 during 2019 and expect to achieve the planned 35 farmers capital cost savings with 75 of those realized this year and the remainder in 2020 we are planning our typical mid year merit increases and still expect margin expense to be higher than the 2018 quarterly run rate reflecting additional marketing spend in our various markets as well as our 25 larger company size furthermore fdic insurance expense will continue to be high during 2019 as compared to 2018 due to now being assessed as a large bank with more than 10 billion in assets before the potential application of small bank credits to be received once the fdic insurance fund exceeds 1 38 which is currently expected by mid year most credit quality measures have been at or near historic lows over the last several periods and as such variability from quarter to quarter may occur that said we do expect our overall credit quality measures to remain strong during 2019 we currently anticipate our effective full year tax rate to be approximately 18 to 19 subject to changes in certain taxable income strategies lastly during the second half of 2019 we will begin to incur the impact from the durbin amendment on interchange fee income which is currently anticipated to reduce fee income by approximately 2 5 million per quarter and that will have a slight negative influence on the efficiency ratio as a result we are now ready to take your questions operator would you please review the instructions questions and answers operator thank you we will now begin the question and answer session operator instructions our first question today comes from catherine mealor with kbw please go ahead with your question todd clossin president and chief executive officer good afternoon catherine mealor keefe bruyette woods inc analyst thanks good afternoon wanted to start first on growth todd you mentioned that you ve seen some stabilization in loan growth this quarter and are still reiterating your low to mid single digit growth over the long term with how you said it so i guess my question to you is do you feel like we had flat loan growth this quarter which of course is better than this than the decline we saw a little bit last year so do you feel like the pipeline is strong enough to where we ll actually see growth in the loan portfolio this year or are there still some dynamics within the portfolio that you feel like could keep on the portfolio more flat this year thanks todd clossin president and chief executive officer thank you when i look at the things that have been pretty consistent it s been the growth in the pipeline as bob mentioned coming into this year was stronger than coming in the last year so the growth in the pipeline production on a monthly quarterly basis has all been relatively consistent over the last really the last year or two the headwinds which we talked about in the comments are what s really been impacted and i think with the last couple of quarters actually the consumer portfolio is really the indirect piece the other pieces were we re looking to continue to grow but the indirect piece has stabilized we re not seeing a lot of movement one way or the other on that which is good that s where we want to see it and then the amount of loans go into the secondary markets things like that on the commercial real estate side multi family projects things like that have gotten back in line with where they were historically on kind of a quarterly run rate so those headwinds have subsided while the consistency of the production and the pipeline has continued on so as a result of that that s what provided the stabilization in the first quarter when i look out going forward it s interesting it s such a it s still we re still small bank right with the loan portfolio and everything a 20 million loan you know is a 1 annualized well on an annual basis so you get two or three loans that close in a c i portfolio or commercial real estate portfolio and you get low single digit annualized growth you don t get those one quarter they come the next quarter you re flat right so it really comes down to sometimes just a couple of loans and whether they close in march or they close in april so it s hard on any one quarter to quarter to say whether we re going to have those single to low digit mid digit growth rate that we ve historically had and i m very confident long term that we re going to have that but it s going to bounce around from quarter to quarter we could see a high single digit loan growth rate in a quarter and then followed by a low one and then and then nothing just flat for a quarter because of the lumpiness of the business so not trying to be evasive but that just kind of how i try to work with it i feel really good about where we re with the lending teams the people we hired the stability that we ve got in a lot of our areas the pipelines the economy seems to be rolling along yeah i don t see any big headwinds there so my expectation would be is that we would return there soon or rather than later but again it s pretty granular when you look at it on a quarter by quarter basis catherine mealor keefe bruyette woods inc analyst okay that s really helpful and then now maybe turning to the margin sorry for that noise and then turning to the margin totally appreciate the yield curve right now but as i look at and your deposit betas are have been incredible but as i look at your loan yields you actually thought some really nice improvement in your loan yields throughout last year if i look at it this quarter pulling of the accretable yield there was still i think it was about six steps increase so how do you think about are there still levers within your loan portfolio to where there is still kind of the lag impact of higher rates although we re not expecting rate hikes this year i mean how much of a lag we still have within the portfolio that you still get some upward movement on your loan yield as they move through the year despite the way the curve looks right now thanks robert young chief financial officer executive vice president well let me take that catherine first of all i wouldn t think on the residential mortgage side there is a lot of upside because mortgage rates are indeed down over the last year depends upon the mix of fixed and variable there and again whether you re selling the secondary market or not but i think really what you re getting at is the business loans and that disclosure and i ve said this in a couple of different forms but we are still a company that includes floors in our commercial loans we have about 1 5 billion of balances with floors but only about a third of that is are actually at the floor and typically it s at the floor not because the calculated rate is at or below the floor it s because of the timing of the next repricing we still do a fair amount of two three and five year fixed rate lending and those typically have floors in them and so there is still some inherent pick up depending upon what rates do because of the timing of the next repricing and indeed when i look at loans that repriced this past quarter and that was over 1 billion worth i think what i would attribute that increase in business loans too is the repricing that occurred in those loans that had a timing this quarter for repricing even those loans that are variable on our three or six month timeframe there would have been as the calendar turned into january a fair amount of repricing both in the c i portfolio as well as our commercial real estate so i think those are a couple of factors i also think that if one wanted to predict the potential for a down rate environment we re not there yet but we realize that fed funds futures may indicate that that i think we re well protected by having a lot of those loans reprice longer so it would prevent them from repricing down in that kind of environment so i think that s part of the reason stripping out as you did the accretion as to why you saw an increase this quarter in the business loan yield catherine mealor keefe bruyette woods inc analyst makes sense alright great thank you i ll inaudible todd clossin president and chief executive officer thank you operator and our next question comes from austin nicholas with stephens please go ahead with your questions austin nicholas stephens inc analyst hey guys hey good afternoon maybe we could just talk about deposit growth for a minute natural gas prices have kind of fallen to call it three year lows over the last couple of days here and you maybe talk about the average kind of monthly inflows you saw in the first quarter and kind of maybe where they re trending today and would you anticipate that kind of eight digit kind of what number to kind of slow down toward the seven digit number given that given what we re seeing with natural gas prices todd clossin president and chief executive officer yeah it s still been really tight in a tight range in that we say low inaudible figure but it s 15 million or so per month and it s within a couple of million dollars that seems to be what is coming in and even with some of the pricing going down i think production levels going up there is additional wells being drilled things like that production is going up while the price is going down so it may be impacting some of it but we haven t seen a falloff in the deposit flows at all coming from the natural gas the royalty payments to our homeowners that live in our live in our footprint so that has really helped us a lot and then with our loan to deposit ratio we re right now we got the benefit of being disciplined around how we re handling our rate structures which drives the drives the low beta if i get to a mid single digit loan growth rate then we ll start to even some of that low loan to deposit ratio but we re a long way to go before i would need to really start to address any kind of a rate strategy so we have some i think some ability to keep rates low for quite a while and with the fed pausing that just seems takes some of the we were seeing a lot of pressure but whatever pressure was there seems to have been abated austin nicholas stephens inc analyst understood that s helpful and then i appreciate kind of the comments on the asset side of the balance sheet from a yield perspective and getting your comments that you just mentioned but maybe just on the public fund side that those cost kind of are more sensitive and kind of increased in the first quarter i guess as you look at where those deposits are kind of repricing now is that kind of played out or is there still some pressure to come from that side of the coin todd clossin president and chief executive officer i would say a little bit of both and where you saw the beta the deposit costs go up that s where it s been we do match some cd rates from time to time in the branches and some things like that but it s the municipal deposits where those are bid out and pretty competitive and while a lot of that has launched through already we ve done a couple of acquisitions in the last few years that we re big in the public fund business too so we re working through those as well too i mean ffkt farmers we just closed that last august and just converted here earlier on the first quarter so as we work with those customers and some of those things come up for repricing we ll have to address them they had a very low deposit cost ffkt as well so i would say we re part of the way through i think that s maybe most of the way through our portfolio but partly through some of the acquired portfolio so i don t see it being a dramatic increase or dramatic number particularly in light of the fed pause but these are important customers to us in our markets and we do a lot more with them than just public funds so we want to stay competitive robert young chief financial officer executive vice president and any follow up i would make is that s about it s over a 1 billion it s about 1 1 billion and those rates that we paid in the fourth quarter versus the first quarter were about flat so we didn t see an increase in the public funds rates quarter over quarter austin nicholas stephens inc analyst understood so i think maybe based upon your earlier comments on the margin is it fair to say that the kind of the expectation is kind of a flat margin kind of going into the remainder of the year just as you paired some of the flowing betas you re obviously deposit advantage and some of the slight natural repricing you have in the kind of commercial side of the book todd clossin president and chief executive officer i guess how i would answer that is yes we do expect it s really the same guidance we provided last quarter a relatively flat core margin some headline reduction because purchase accounting will drop 1 basis pointed or 2 per quarter but i m looking at 349 consistent number for the last two quarters and get there some seasonality to the margin in the first quarter remember you have 28 days in february so that tends to bolster the margin but i think right around that level throughout the rest of the year could slip 1 basis point or 2 because of the shape of the yield curve i think going into the year our expectation was a little higher margin but the reality of where we are at the end of march is a flatter margin and we don t have in our asset liability modeling any increases for the rest of the year austin nicholas stephens inc analyst got it okay that s very helpful and then maybe just on expenses those are nicely controlled this quarter and then maybe just specifically on the fdic expense can you give us any indication of what the small bank credits would be should those be better offered or kind of i guess exercised robert young chief financial officer executive vice president well i would we didn t get it in time to disclose in the 10 k so i don t have a number in there we haven t produced the queue yet so i m not sure whether we re going put it in or not i would characterize it as several million a few to several so we actually have a letter from the fdic as most banks do now describing what that amount is but the reason i m being a little cagey is i don t know what we re going to be able to use it it really depends upon the shape it depends upon when the depth the positive insurance fund gets to that level that i mentioned in my prepared remarks and when the fdic board acts upon that so right now the fdic fund is at 1 36 and i think most people are figuring that sometime in the second or third quarter is when those credits would begin to be used so some in the back half of the year remainder of those would be used then in 2020 austin nicholas stephens inc analyst got it okay but in the meantime it sounds like the 1 4 ph million is a good way to think about it robert young chief financial officer executive vice president yeah correct todd clossin president and chief executive officer and inaudible comment on expenses too with the merger conversion being completed this quarter we carried those expenses for the first quarter but a lot of those employee costs are coming out here in the early second quarter a number of people that who are not part of the combined organization anymore so as we said you get 75 of those cost saves this year and that should really start to materialize in the second quarter austin nicholas stephens inc analyst okay great and then maybe just one last quick one just on the on those cost saves can you maybe just give us an idea of what percentage of the total cost saves in the acquisition were achieved as you kind of exited the first quarter than otherwise starting in the second quarter todd clossin president and chief executive officer yeah i would say with regard to a lot of the employee costs obviously don t start to materialize till after the conversion takes place and that just it was in the first quarter we had people stay another 30 days past that so you re not going to see much in the way of employee cost reduction from the merger until we get into the second quarter there were a few here and there but a majority of it is going to be in the second quarter the other cost aspects of the contracts things like that flow through fairly quickly but a good chunk of the expense is on the employee side which is why we said 75 would occur in 2019 but a majority of that s going to be this quarter and then the following two quarters in the year offset obviously by our own merit increases and our own investments that we re going to continue to make along the way as well too robert young chief financial officer executive vice president another way to look at that is that we re down about 75 full time equivalents from 930 to 331 some of those were in the fourth quarter just due to normal attrition and approaching the conversion some individuals would have chosen to leave before that time and then the bulk of what todd was talking about occurred in the month of march so by the time you run them through the payroll we start seeing those savings toward the end of the month and then into the second quarter todd clossin president and chief executive officer yeah and we re confident we re going to achieve those cost saves that we modeled at the time of the merger operator and our next question comes from steve moss with b riley fbr please go ahead with your question stephen moss b riley fbr analyst good afternoon guys todd clossin president and chief executive officer good afternoon stephen moss b riley fbr analyst just i guess going back to the margin for a quick second and in particular on securities balances wondering here with the flat to inverted curve if the securities book will be declining here going forward robert young chief financial officer executive vice president well we did we had about 65 million of sales in the month of march we in the first quarter moved some securities from htm to afs as a result of the adoption of the derivatives standard that improvement standard i can t remember the number of it steve but we did reposition some securities that were in the lower maturity range of munis ph where we didn t see as much value as holding a longer term munis and so some of those are getting replaced here in the month of april but i think in general given where the spreads are the concept as we might have had in the budget late last year of maybe adding 100 million to the securities portfolio over the course of the year given the spreads between cmos and intermediate funding given the higher short end just aren t as great as they were last year this time there is probably not much sense in doing that we do have an excess of cash right now we could put some of those into securities but we re also getting at the federal reserve 2 4 so there isn t as much initiative to do that and to go out with some term maturity there so that would be my response you ll see a little bit of an increase here just with the reinvestment in the second quarter otherwise pretty well flat 3 1 billion stephen moss b riley fbr analyst okay that s helpful and then in terms of fee income this quarter obviously seasonally weaker quarter for deposit service charges but perhaps a little bit weaker than what i was thinking i was just wondering between that and electronic banking fees was there any unusual noise and kind of what rebound should we look for in the second quarter here todd clossin president and chief executive officer yeah we did have some items in there in the last first quarter i guess comparable quarter last year in terms of boli some things like that that didn t repeat themselves in the first quarter here but we also have some businesses like insurance securities things like that that are up a little bit but more opportunity i think in the acquired markets that we have but when i look at the other categories in terms of percentage increases service charges on deposits as well as electronic banking fees i think service charges on deposits were up 36 robert young chief financial officer executive vice president 36 todd clossin president and chief executive officer 36 and electronic banking fees were up 22 obviously we re 25 bigger because of the acquisition so i think they kept pace for the most part on average with that so if you really compare first quarter last year to first quarter this year may kind of normalize it based upon the size of the company now this year versus last year and relate that to the percentage increase in those areas it was pretty consistent but it is typically a weaker quarter in the first quarter for those areas stephen moss b riley fbr analyst okay got you and then obviously it sounds like the fdic insurance will help offset some of the durbin impact in the second half of the year just wondering if you guys have any other initiatives to try to mitigate some of that impact obviously the acquisitions were in part tied to that but just wondering if there was anything else you guys are looking to in terms of to mitigate that todd clossin president and chief executive officer yeah we re always looking for ways to generate additional revenue and also focus on costs so i we don t have a specific cost initiative in place other than we re always kind of evaluating particularly in light of the yield curve flattening earlier this year we started looking pretty hard additionally hard at different expense categories and things like that they were a little more discretionary that we could pull down so we don t have a number on that but we are working through that and trying to quantify something that we could get for the remainder of this year on the expense save side and we also continue to address our branch infrastructure as well too really since the january 2017 over the last two years we ve closed the 11 branches now six of them came through the recent merger where we consolidated branches and then closed six but there were another five that we did on our own and we re going market by market and doing a branch rationalization study so if you look at we ve impacted basically 5 of our branches over the last two years and if you go to the five years prior to that we impacted about 10 so i think a good way to look at it is every five years we re addressing about 10 of our branch network in terms of closures repositioning things like that and i think that ll create some expense saves for us as well too all of those things i think have been benefits and a big part of that is just you want to run the organization efficiently and appropriately but we also have an eye toward durbin we ve known for a couple of years a pretty good idea when that was going to hit so a lot of the things we ve done in prior quarters have been to get ready for that but we do have a few additional things that we re the fdic insurance i think will be a big help the refund in that category and then some of the expense things that we re looking at i m hoping to take a big hit out of those as well the durbin with those expense initiatives stephen moss b riley fbr analyst okay robert young chief financial officer executive vice president also what i mentioned on the employee benefits side again just to emphasize there is about 600 000 in employee benefits related to the deferred comp adjustment it is also shown doesn t affect the bottom line because it s an offsetting entry that s made in net securities gains of about that same amount so we ll try to pull that out for you on a quarterly basis but the last two quarters there is been a fair amount of volatility in the markets you ll see that we had a loss for instance in net securities gains losses in the fourth quarter that was about 1 million and there would ve been an associated entry for the same 1 million then in employee benefits so when you compare one quarter to the other you see that kind of thing moving around but absent that i think employee benefits which would experience some higher payroll taxes in the first quarter self security taxes on incentive comp for instance and just the normal start back up at the beginning of the year should begin to normalize here and then you also have the individuals that would ve left after the conversion so we should see some savings in that category given that was a bit of a larger increase item stephen moss b riley fbr analyst right okay that s helpful thanks for that bob and then in terms of just kind of wondering about the m a environment what are your thoughts about potential acquisitions and how are discussions at how the activity and discussions these days todd clossin president and chief executive officer yeah i think what we said last quarter still holds true and that is we feel that we re in a position to move forward if we found the right opportunity back half of this year or sometime in 2020 or 2021 we re not in any hurry i don t think we feel like we need to do anything but being in the 12 5 million 12 6 billion in size obviously we re over 10 billion but to get a little bit more heft over and above that balance that against execution risk would benefit us if were a few billion dollars bigger it would benefit us from an roa perspective and everything else so we re open but we don t necessarily feel that anything is going to happen immediately but there is an awful lot of interest phone calls things like that that are going on between bankers and banks just seems to be pretty active it may be as a result of the last quarter i think when i talked about the fact our pause so to speak was coming to an end that may have triggered it but there is been a lot of interest but we re going to be prudent about what we decide to do or not do stephen moss b riley fbr analyst alright thank you very much todd clossin president and chief executive officer okay thank you operator and our next question comes from casey whitman with sandler o neill please go ahead with your question todd clossin president and chief executive officer hi casey casey whitman sandler o neill analyst hi most of my questions were answered but maybe can you just elaborate a little bit on the jump in classified loans maybe just how much was due to the review of the acquired loans versus downgrades of legacy portfolio and then i think you referenced maybe the two downgraded relationships in the legacy portfolio being two different industries maybe give us a little color as to what those industries were that s it thanks todd clossin president and chief executive officer yeah the two legacy one was manufacturing the other was hospitality and completely unrelated and had been customers for many many years so we don t see any trends associated with that and those loans are well structured so we re watching them obviously we downgraded them but we don t see any trends associated with any of that in terms of the review of kind of post merger review and kind of line things up from a grading perspective and we do this after every merger that would ve been about 7 million or so of the total so not it s material amount i guess but not unusual and it doesn t reflect any kind of deterioration in those credits it s just lining them up against the way we evaluate grades against the financial condition of the borrower robert young chief financial officer executive vice president and indeed the provision for those would go back to goodwill it s not really a provision but it s through the credit mark casey because you re within that one year time frame so we take that time to evaluate the risk rates on the acquired loans and then adjust through goodwill as necessary casey whitman sandler o neill analyst great thank you todd clossin president and chief executive officer thank you operator operator instructions and our next question comes from russell gunther with davidson please go ahead with your question todd clossin president and chief executive officer hey russ russell gunther d a davidson analyst hey good afternoon guys just wanted to seem like a tie down the expense conversation a bit given the moving parts on cost saves and some of the merit increases is there a core efficiency ratio target or bogey you guys are striving toward or would point us to for 2019 todd clossin president and chief executive officer yeah i d say mid 50s and really i ve used that over the last couple of years as we were wanted to get up and over 10 billion in size and everything associated with that the infrastructure build increasing risk management and then dealing durbin and all those types of things but still keep the efficiency ratio in the mid 50s and we ve been able to do that through decreasing expenses in other areas over time so obviously we re going to get two quarters of durbin this year we ll get four quarters of durbin next year but we were modeling it out it s less than 1 percentage point impact on the efficiency ratio almost 1 percentage point but not quite so i m still feeling like we should be in mid 50s and that would be the expectation rate going forward russell gunther d a davidson analyst that s very helpful thanks todd and then just last for me i heard you loud and clear on the low to mid single digit growth over time and some of the moving parts from a loan vertical but could you quantify for us or size up for us sort of geographic or regional sources of strength for you right now todd clossin president and chief executive officer yeah we i don t see any aspects of our footprint that i would say are going through any kind of severe economic challenges we ve moved pretty significantly in these higher growth markets over the last five seven years and those markets have population growth they have household income growth and that s all still continuing and it s tracking in line with the us gdp growth or slightly higher depending upon the markets that you re in even some of our legacy footprints we re in the right parts of the states that we re in i believe look at kentucky we re in louisville we re in lexington so great cities west virginia we re in parkersburg we re in wheeling and we re in morgantown we re in charleston those are really good cities so we re in the parts of the states that are growing faster a lot of times than the states themselves are so we don t see any big economic drags anywhere at all we continue to make investments in all of our different markets based upon allocating resources on the return that we re going to get so we re trying to be efficient there and to put more resources in markets that have higher growth potential than markets that don t but we re still investing in market that are showing some growth and i really don t see any markets that we re in that are going backward in terms of gdp growth russell gunther d a davidson analyst good to hear thanks for taking my questions guys todd clossin president and chief executive officer sure operator and this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to todd clossin for any closing remarks todd clossin president and chief executive officer thank you i wanted to reaffirm the strength of our underlying operating fundamentals again we remain well positioned for success i believe in a variety of operating environments and we re going to continue to focus upon executing on our defined growth strategies long term profitability that s really what our approach and what our mission is and we re not going to sacrifice credit quality or regulatory compliance because we think those are hallmarks of our company and i want to thank you for joining us today and hope we get a chance to see some of you at upcoming investor events thank you operator the conference has now concluded thank you for attending today s presentation you may now disconnect your line duration 52 minutes call

preparation of the manuscript competing interests the authors have declared that no competing interests exist introduction on march 17 2017 the united nations un security council backed by the consensus of its 193 member states adopted resolution 2344 which calls for strengthening regional economic cooperation through china s belt and road also called silk road initiative bri based on the cornerstones of peace and cooperation openness and inclusiveness and mutual learning and sharing benefit this initiative was proposed by the chinese government and is participated in by various parties its goal is to provide fundamental solutions to boost global economic development through enhancing policy coordination facility connection unimpeded trade financial integration and people to people bonds the un secretary general mr antónio guterres acknowledged that the bri tallies with and complements the sustainable development goals sdgs in terms of promoting inclusive development strengthening exchange between countries and benefiting people within the initiative s scope the bri currently involves 69 countries mainly those named in the initial belt and road outreach and those having signed cooperation agreements 70 of the world population in total 30 of the global gross domestic product and 75 of the world s energy reserves although the bri is primarily economic it also includes important health dimensions the healthy china 2030 plan promulgated in 2016 considers health as one of the national policy priorities and the memorandum of understanding with the world health organization who signed in 2017 which promotes global health security and development along the terms of the initiative based on these agreements the building of a health silk road has become a core task leading to an extensive engagement in global health development during the belt and road high level meeting for health cooperation towards a health silk road held in august 2017 in beijing the director general of who dr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus positively commented on the initiative saying that it may become the stimulus needed to drive our united activities towards universal health coverage uhc and that it contains the necessary fundamentals such as infrastructure building access to medicines and human resources needed to build a platform for sharing experience and promoting best practices the health silk road concept establishes the importance of promoting cooperation among the related countries in the prevention and control of communicable diseases medical system and policies healthcare capacity building staff training and exchange traditional medicine and health education as well as disaster relief aid and poverty reduction for health in this way building the contextual health silk road would advance political commitment to mobilise all resources for better health in the world the world is currently witnessing increasingly complex epidemics as well as natural disasters with a rising impact on both human health and the economy growing commercial trade and more frequent personal exchange following the implementation of the bri may amplify infectious disease transmission or inadvertently introduce emerging infectious diseases leading to an increased burden for local medical systems moreover infectious diseases resulting from poverty disproportionately affect poor and marginalised communities which remains a more serious hurdle to achieving the sdgs and uhc this is the reason why the initiative has made the need to combat infectious diseases a priority for social and economic development the implementation of the bri is expected to facilitate progress in eliminating infectious diseases such as the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome aids caused by the human immunodeficiency virus hiv tuberculosis tb malaria and 17 neglected tropical diseases ntds which make up sdg 3 3 it has also gained the support of who which has proposed a strategic cooperation with the bri taking the opportunities provided by this initiative action for combating the diseases will be conducted through the sharing of information and experience and cooperative disease control programmes including interventions and research innovation it will also mediate resources including the building of medical infrastructures funding support training of staff and delivery of emergency healthcare the initiative provides guidance for stronger health collaboration which should hopefully break the vicious cycle of poverty and infectious disease delegates from the joint un programme on hiv aids unaids the global fund the global alliance for vaccines and immunisation gavi and more than 30 countries participated in the belt and road high level meeting for health cooperation signed the beijing communiqué and agreed to participate in building the health silk road as for the infectious diseases cooperation on control and elimination has been the highest priority together with mounting an effective response to disease outbreaks and reemerging infections however details regarding how this should be carried out in practice have not yet been presented in particular we still lack proposals that take up the challenges specify indicators of expected impact and develop opportunities for collaboration in this area the purpose of this paper is to analyse the existing spectrum of the main infectious diseases in epidemics based on the global burden of diseases study of 2016 the potential negative effect on the economy and the challenges to elimination the paper also aims to explore opportunities and a feasible approach of global disease control with specific consideration of the bri challenges regarding infectious diseases in belt and road countries the spectrum of local infectious diseases the thrust of the bri has two main directions the silk road which connects china by land with european countries via central and western asia and the middle east and the 21st century maritime connection across the south china sea the indian ocean and the mediterranean to reach sub saharan africa following the lead of the great chinese ming dynasty admiral and explorer zheng he these two land and maritime directions from china follow five routes the health silk road a core task of the bri encourages health development and security along the road the 2030 agenda for sdgs also calls for halting hiv aids tb and malaria as well as the termination of the ravages caused by the 17 ntds by 2030 altogether according to the 2016 gbd study the cost expressed in disability adjusted life years dalys amounts to an estimated 63 31 million with substantial regional variations in the 69 countries which currently accounts for 36 7 of the total toll of these diseases throughout the world the dalys resulting from the big three hiv aids tb and malaria plus those due to the 17 ntds along the route from china towards southeast asia and south asia excluding china amounts to 34 81 million dalys and are mainly due to hiv aids tb and malaria in addition to dengue and intestinal nematode infections the infectious disease epidemics in countries along the 21st century maritime silk road are mainly the same set of diseases plus schistosomiasis which together generate 20 46 million dalys the china central asia russia europe route involving countries in central asia and eastern europe includes many of the same diseases as well as some additional ones i e intestinal nematode infections cystic echinococcosis foodborne trematodiases and cysticercosis which together cause 2 39 million dalys a total of 0 50 million dalys in the countries along the china central asia west asia axis are due to tb leishmaniasis malaria hiv aids intestinal nematode infections and cystic echinococcosis fig 1 such high endemicity of infectious diseases in the region is a serious hurdle for the global elimination agenda the dalys due to these diseases vary across the regions and so do the collaborative priorities and their expected potential impacts for example cooperative actions could lead to regional elimination of lymphatic filariasis lf along the maritime silk road while simultaneously having a significant impact on malaria dengue intestinal helminth infections schistosomiasis and tb expand fig 1 the dalys of 20 infectious diseases along five routes of the belt and road initiative aids acquired immunodeficiency syndrome daly disability adjusted life year hiv human immunodeficiency virus doi 10 1371 journal pntd 0007107 g001 more disease specific consideration for cooperation considering the high number of dalys caused by the previously mentioned 20 diseases their regional distributions and cross border transmission risks and the experience combating these diseases six of them malaria schistosomiasis lf tb dengue and cystic echinococcosis have been listed for collaborative control and elimination as priorities in the belt and road work plan for the health silk road together these six diseases cause a considerable disease burden in these countries impeding economic growth and constituting a serious challenge with regard to elimination fig 2 for example dengue causes 2 65 million dalys which accounts for 89 7 of this disease s global disease burden tb inflicts an estimated 29 million dalys which represents 66 7 of its total dalys score cystic echinococcosis causes 0 07 million dalys half of the total number in the world the current dalys score of lf reaches 0 47 million accounting for 39 7 of the global count and malaria and schistosomiasis generate an estimated 4 87 million and 0 39 million dalys respectively in the belt and road countries expand fig 2 the spectrum of six infectious diseases in the belt and road countries the value of dalys data has been processed through the logarithmic function daly disability adjusted life year doi 10 1371 journal pntd 0007107 g002 more patients infected with these diseases not only suffer from disability but also have to endure expenses for treatment and productivity disruption in addition to individual suffering these diseases hinder economic development tb for example adds a significant economic burden that is difficult to estimate exactly as it impedes development both at the national and individual household levels this disease has a higher prevalence in the economically unprivileged sector of the population and the cost for healthcare including diagnostics accommodation transport and ancillary drugs is high annual costs for cystic echinococcosis on the other hand have been estimated at usd 3 billion which reflects that the treatment is expensive not only because it requires human treatment but also because it requires health education improved slaughterhouse hygiene and deworming of the local dog population all of these diseases lead directly to loss of productivity which worsens the situation of vulnerable populations in turn resulting in continued poverty in addition they affect agricultural fishing and pastoral populations in poor regions while the ongoing influx of people to urban areas including tourism increases the risk of disease expansion into new areas although much has been achieved substantial gaps to controlling and eliminating these six diseases remain especially with increasing communication and trade across borders of these countries drug resistance and coinfection result in additional difficulties in conducting control programmes e g the rising mosquito resistance to insecticides as well as the parasites ability to develop drug resistance as strategies aimed at tb elimination are strongly challenged by multidrug resistant bacterial strains mdr tb the estimated mortality from tb in people living with hiv was as high as 30 0 4 million 1 4 million in 2015 imported cases represent a threat for the countries that are close to accomplishing elimination and prevention and control of dengue malaria schistosomiasis and lf demand a well developed surveillance and response system with regard to vector management and sustainable interventions at all levels control of schistosomiasis and cystic echinococcosis require integrated approaches from the agriculture and husbandry department because of their zoonotic characteristics infectious diseases not only cause loss of health and eventually life but generally also lead to economic consequences serious challenges oppose current efforts to stem and limit epidemics in these countries requiring urgent collaboration with adjacent and global countries through shared experience financial support multisector intervention professional healthcare delivery and technical innovation collaborative opportunities when dealing with infectious diseases promoted by the bri with the health silk road as a priority opportunities will be provided for combating infectious disease epidemics based on technical experience communication financial investment cooperative organisation and future collaborative programmes enhancing technical experience communication appropriate management and treatment are essential to achieving the elimination of infectious diseases china s disease interventions have shown that control and elimination are feasible and can be carried out in a cost effective way however such efforts will have to be tailored to local settings in 2007 china successfully passed the validation of its lf elimination strategy after having followed a plan of control and surveillance for nearly 60 years the work towards elimination of lf in china has relied on the implementation of three schemes 1 surveys using repeated blood testing followed by treatment when needed 2 mass drug administration mda with diethylcarbamazine fortified salt to disrupt infectious microfilaria and 3 target treatment of carriers using the same drug cambodia has improved its healthcare capacity and also managed to eliminate lf as a public health problem using a similar approach along with parallel interventions against other vector borne diseases turkmenistan and the united arab emirates have achieved zero indigenous cases of malaria whereas china had no indigenous cases in 2017 the chinese government has scheduled the elimination of this disease by 2020 as for the national malaria elimination programme the 1 3 7 surveillance and response strategy reporting cases within one day investigating cases within three days and targeting control measures within seven days has benefitted from conducting interventions at the provincial municipal and county levels ensuring a nationwide effect this successful rapid response to cases of malaria in returning overseas workers and the engagement of private sector employers have recently been implemented in other asia pacific countries using the antimalarial drug artemisinin developed from herb based chinese traditional medicine has proved vital for malaria treatment in addition the use of mosquito nets is suggested for implementation during the transmission season schistosomiasis has been effectively controlled with 90 of the previously endemic counties now free of the disease the chinese government now schedules schistosomiasis elimination by 2025 by using the successful multisectoral national strategy that has reduced schistosoma japonicum infection in cattle humans and snails which is based on mda with praziquantel for snails combined with the removal of cattle from the grasslands where the snails reside with regard to tb dengue and cystic echinococcosis the plan is to end these epidemics and there has already been success in reaching this goal for example the estimated dalys score for tb in china has dropped from 6 29 million to 1 74 million in the past 26 years 1990 2016 which is attributed to the nationwide tb control programme using the directly observed treatment short course dots approach the well established web based communicable disease notification system incorporates the notification of new cases and the national insurance scheme a public private partnership ppp tailored to support people with low incomes covers more than 95 of the population and functions well however the effective strategy to end tb also requires high level political commitment community engagement social protection funding support and innovation of drug delivery and rapid diagnostics for dengue the timely reporting of cases also relies on a notification system and the approach to controlling mosquito reproduction has provided a solution to dengue epidemics elsewhere most clinicians agree on the four options for treating cystic echinococcosis drugs percutaneous methods surgery and watch and wait in china the control and treatment of echinococcosis integrates large scale surveys control of the transmission source deworming definitive hosts and detection plus treatment of patients free of charge supported by domestic funding the successful interventions in china are implemented in line with the chinese health system which is vital for delivering healthcare to less developed regions and responds effectively to health crises by coordinated action apart from the above interventions political support regulation guidance and financial investment are paramount it has been proposed by who to tailor some feasible aspects to local health systems to achieve disease elimination and uhc proceeding platforms for collaboration the health silk road concept encourages regional cooperation and extensive participation from governments international and regional organisations universities private sectors civil society and the general public china is a positive initiator and has together with related countries jointly published a series of agreements furthermore 41 programmes are active including the china association of southeast asian nations asean plan training one hundred health professionals and the china africa cooperation plan on public health nongovernmental exchange and cooperation activities in various fields are complementary to governmental projects as they build public support for the bri china has also worked to strengthen think tank cooperation and initiated the international silk road think tank association building the silk road for health by combating infectious diseases cannot be achieved without multisector engagement and expert involvement the platforms created are well suited to take on current opportunities in collaboration with organisations such as who collaborating centres and existing south south networks linking them with similar units in belt and road countries table 1 current platforms have significantly contributed to achieving first control and later elimination of some diseases and are now turning to the global level providing opportunities to assist building a health approach within the bri besides establishing platforms for combating diseases china s participation in control programmes within asia and africa has become a model for other countries for example trilateral collaboration between china providing technical support australia a major donor and papua new guinea a country close to holoendemic for malaria is dedicated to improving local staff capacity for malaria diagnosis and disease control this programme highlights the regional health security agenda of a malaria free asia pacific by 2030 in africa in the pilot china united kingdom tanzania malaria control programme the parasite prevalence has dropped by two thirds after intervention for three years and tanzania has established a diagnosis treatment follow up prevention plan for malaria with links to china s experience and who guidelines expand table 1 platforms for combating infectious disease epidemics doi 10 1371 journal pntd 0007107 t001 more the regional network for asian schistosomiasis and other helminth zoonoses rnas has contributed to sharing experience and promoting control of helminth infections in asia for the past 20 years the belt and road network for elimination and control of echinococcosis and cysticercosis involving institutions from asia and europe has established the importance of technical cooperation and health education and regional collaborating control activities are on the way in the 2018 2022 five year plan of action on lancang mekong cooperation infectious disease control is achieved by strengthening collaboration on dengue fever and malaria and establishing and improving the mechanism for joint surveillance prevention and control of cross border emerging and reemerging infectious diseases other programmes such as the cooperation in control of infectious diseases in central asia cooperates with central asian countries on the control of echinococcosis and other zoonoses and lf and tb control are being proposed to enlarge enforce and deepen cooperation worldwide regional cooperation will be increased through health infrastructure work by building joint laboratories and research and knowledge translation centres china will upgrade 50 medical and health aid programmes for africa such as the headquarters of the african center for disease control and prevention and china africa friendship hospitals china has also donated drugs and equipment as well as helped to build health facilities the bri will also involve improved access to healthcare by china s innovative private sectors for example responding to the ebola epidemic the aucma company qingdao china has facilitated the delivery of the ebola vaccine to west africa using the arktek qingdao china portable cold storage devices the diverse and vibrant private sectors in china such as those dealing with data systems and mobile phone based technologies will potentially provide much needed assistance for combating infectious diseases in this collaboration based on the principle of joint construction and mutual benefit the programmes employ local medical staff to carry out evidence based studies and deliver healthcare and treatment to local people this not only provides technical guidance establishes the mechanism for disease control and prevention and improves local staff capacity to sustain interventions but also produces open platforms and innovative new models for global health collaboration financial and human resource support ending infectious disease epidemics demands intensified funding preferably delivered at the international level to strengthen advocacy research and the global control effort besides being a sincere collaborator in the area of global health and a board member of unaids and the global fund china is creating its own multilateral funds and banks e g the asia infrastructure investment bank and the new development bank to promote regional cooperation in the framework of the bri the multilateral funds are substantial adding up to usd 267 billion with china securing major pledges mainly from the two banks and the silk road fund part of the financial aid is supposed to contribute to research and innovation with respect to medical products and diagnostic skills the initiative also encourages discovery and production of new drugs and vaccines specifically a total of usd 2 billion has gone to the south south cooperation trust fund to support developing countries in implementing the sdgs and a further fund of usd 2 billion to be increased to usd 12 billion by 2030 will assist many developing countries to meet the sdgs also an additional voluntary contribution of usd 20 million will be provided to support who s global health work especially on infectious diseases the initiative is also working on poverty reduction to alleviate the epidemics for example the east asia poverty reduction pilot china africa cooperation plan for poverty reduction and people s benefit programmes which provide aid in the fields of poverty reduction and healthcare in addition china will cancel the debt of the least developed countries launch 600 specific projects to end poverty and support better health services in this way it can alleviate regional poverty so that the income of local people will increase and their living standards will improve and it can reduce the risk and burden of infectious diseases caused by poverty apart from funding infrastructure construction which supplies delivery and research the bri also advocates improved professional and organisational capabilities targeting specific diseases as one of the who emergency medical teams china has distributed medical supplies and will together with who take on infectious disease control implementing professional support training of medical staff and healthcare delivery for instance during the ebola pandemic china sent 1 200 medical experts and committed an additional usd 120 million for training more than 13 000 local medical workers in response to ebola infections in west africa china will assist in training more medical personnel for africa and continue to send medical teams to meet africa s requirements more global health human resources and specific medical workers will be brought in together with global health departments being established in universities and institutions china is pursuing discussions about cooperation with multilateral initiatives at the highest level aligning relevant health agreements under the bri theme compared with other initiatives this initiative stands out because of its political commitment which advances the health sdgs and solves current constraints to the progress of uhc chinese channels of funding and expenditure on health focus are different from those in the united states when it comes to funding in that the us focuses on specific diseases like hiv aids malaria and tb through bilateral and multilateral channels whereas china mainly focuses on medical facilities health supplies technical support and training through governmental funding however the situation is changing as the belt and road multilateral funding initiative is substantial with a total planned to reach usd 267 billion exceeding the usd 253 billion capitalisation of the world bank as an ambitious long term initiative that is extremely open and inclusive the bri meets the great challenges of cultural differences and economic risks and has questioned the viability of some infrastructure investments however with the goal of a shared benefit for all humankind an increasing number of countries have engaged in building the initiative enhanced interconnectivity will bring about not only international health risks but also more importantly new opportunities for global health cooperation and development so far there is a lack of specific indicators for each disease and detailed procedures regarding cooperation with respect to disease control and elimination the current study is expected to result in recommendations to policy makers on an overall policy plan and a road map for the imminent future all aforementioned experiences platforms and programmes as well as financial and personnel resources provide useful opportunities for cooperation among involved countries with respect to the threat of infectious diseases more importantly pilot research and demonstration projects in line with the bri have been proposed and in some cases have already started china has demonstrated strong and sustained political leadership to ensure its core role of global health collaboration in economic development conclusion and implication a major part of the bri focuses on support and communication to build a new mechanism for global health prioritising the prevention and control of infectious diseases preventing outbreaks becoming epidemics and providing uhc thus overcoming the vicious circle of poverty and ill health china will strengthen cooperation with particular regard to the control of tb echinococcosis and dengue within the 69 countries and deliver enhanced communication and research leading to the elimination of lf malaria and schistosomiasis based on opportunities the bri provides and the cooperative experience gained the framework shown in fig 3 should become available and applicable to the response to these challenges by sharing information joint control and technical know how expand fig 3 the road map of combating infectious disease epidemics doi 10 1371 journal pntd 0007107 g003 more uhc and response to the challenges posed by infectious disease epidemics are vital for the new era with health considerations at the core of the bri despite the serious threats of the infectious disease epidemics the emphasis on health through the bri puts us in an excellent position to achieve the health related aspects of the sdgs by implementing the health silk road concept of improved life through health related communication based on technical experience in this field mature collaborating mechanisms and the provision of financial support the strategies in the context of the bri reinforce the various countries extensive engagement in combating infectious disease epidemics

pool earnings call for the period ending march 31 2019 pool corp pool 0 27 q1 2019 earnings call 11 00 a m et contents prepared remarks questions and answers call participants prepared remarks operator good day and welcome to the pool corporation first quarter 2019 conference call and webcast all participants will be in listen only mode operator instructions please note this event is being recorded i would now like to turn the conference over to mark joslin senior vice president and chief financial officer please go ahead mark w joslin senior vice president and chief financial officer thank you nancy good morning everyone and welcome to our first quarter 2019 earnings call as usual i d like to remind our listeners that our discussion comments and responses to questions today may include forward looking statements including management s outlook for 2019 and future periods actual results may differ materially from those discussed today information regarding the factors and variables that could cause actual results to differ materially from projected results is discussed in our 10 k in addition we may make references to non gaap financial measures in our comments a description of reconciliation of our non gaap financial measures is included in our press release and posted to our corporate website in our investor relations section now i ll turn the call over to our president and ceo peter arvan peter d arvan president and chief executive officer thanks mark and good morning to everyone on the call we delivered a solid first quarter despite the cooler weather that impacted many of our year round markets our sales were up 2 overall while our base business grew 1 keep in mind that the first quarter of 2018 had one additional billing day which is a 2 drag on the order and currency exchange negatively impacted our 2019 sales by 1 our year round markets primarily florida california arizona and texas were up 2 for the quarter florida which experienced favorable weather in the period saw a sales increase 7 texas was up 4 with january and february sales climbing over 7 only to be impacted by a very wet march california and arizona where we saw a nice growth in the first quarter of 2018 saw sales on a combined basis declined 2 as they were impacted by record breaking cold and rain this year making construction and remodel challenging we believe the unfavorable weather pattern in the west impacted our sales by 10 million to 15 million based on normal growth rates our builders are reporting plenty of pent up demand and we believe the shortfall can be made up much of the shortfall can be made up assuming normal weather as these are predominantly year around markets labor remains tight especially in the peak months but we believe that much of this can be made up in the balance of the year turning to our green business which was also challenged with unfavorable weather our base revenue growth was 5 reflecting our continued efforts to improve this business and solid demand in the end markets international sales were up 9 with europe up 36 in local currency and 20 in us dollars but remember this is a seasonally less significant quarter for our european operations so the impact was somewhat muted it is noteworthy though that europe had great weather in 2018 and this pattern is continuing our european teams are also executing very well and have been able to take share and leverage our operations as we look at the north american end markets retail sales were essentially flat largely driven by the easter holiday falling later this year as it tends to delay pool openings and the associated buying and restocking at our independent retailers commercial product sales were up 2 and building materials were strong with 8 growth in the quarter moving on to gross margins we anticipated as we anticipated our overall gross margin percent increased in the quarter by 90 basis points to 29 2 the increase is largely driven by the strategic inventory buys and a deferral of customer early buys as the second quarter progresses and we sell through the remaining pre increase inventory we should see a slight uptick in margins but again this will diminish through the quarter overall gross profit dollars were up a total of 5 4 was driven by our base business and 1 from acquisitions looking at operating expenses the team did a very nice job managing expenses our base business sg a costs were up 1 reflecting efficiency gains and continued investment in technology and growth our pool360 sales were up 32 for the quarter which is encouraging as it creates capacity for our customers and for our sales centers as we look at operating income despite challenging weather our team remained focused on execution and managed to deliver a 14 5 increase in operating profit for the quarter by leveraging expenses and by leveraging the investments we made in inventory last year our base business operating margin percent improved 90 basis points again reflecting the efforts of a strong team and a solid plan from a cash perspective we delivered a very strong quarter with cash flow from operating activities improving by almost 73 million from the first quarter of 2018 much of this improvement is a result of the burned down and incremental inventories that we highlighted during our year end call lastly as a result of the asu benefit we saw in the quarter we are increasing our annual guidance by 0 04 our new range is 6 09 to 6 39 all in all our results were very solid giving the challenges we faced with weather we re very fortunate to have the best team in the industry that strives every day to make a difference and be the best channel to market for our suppliers and provide the best value proposition to our over 100 000 valued customers i will now turn the call over to mark for some financial commentary mark w joslin senior vice president and chief financial officer thank you pete overall other than the impact from weather and taxes our q1 results came in largely as expected on our year end call we had estimated a 20 million to 30 million impact on revenue for the quarter due to the later easter holiday which impacts pool openings and customer early buys and the loss of the billing day in addition to this the unusually cold and wet weather in the western us impacted revenues by another 10 million to 15 million most of which we expect to be pushed back to later in the year rather than lost as pete mentioned in his comments going down to p l gross margin and expenses other than taxes were more or less in line with our expectations with the expense line benefiting from currency translation as well as a loss of a billing day the growth in interest expense in the quarter was also discussed on our february call and as mentioned then should moderate after the second quarter on our tax line the positive impact of asu 2016 09 was greater than expected as the increase in our share price following our year end call resulted in more employee stock option exercises than we had anticipated on our february call we had stated that we expected 2019 benefit from the asu to be 7 2 million or 0 18 in eps by the second quarter instead we recognized a benefit of 8 8 million or 0 21 in earnings per share just in the first quarter this resulted in 7 1 million or 0 17 in added eps from options that expire this year and 1 7 million or 0 04 in eps from options that would expire in years after 2019 and which was not included in our estimate for this year as a result we increased our guidance range for 2019 to include the unexpected 0 04 benefit for q2 we are now expecting just a 500 000 or 0 01 eps benefit from unexercised 2019 expiring options for those of you modeling these things out this is a big shift in tax benefit from q2 to q1 and i want to make sure you pick this up moving on our balance sheet you ll note that receivables were relatively flat year over year in line with our sales growth while inventories were up 112 million or 16 as noted in our release there are a number of reasons for the larger than normal inventory increase including last year s prebuy acquired inventories business expansion and the slowdown in q1 sales as we move into the second quarter we d expect to see the rate of inventory growth over last year to narrow from a cash perspective and as we discussed on our year end call we expect to benefit this year from the inventory adjustments we made last year and build on the 73 million improvement in operating cash flow we reported in the first quarter on share repurchases in the quarter excuse me our share repurchases in the quarter took place earlier in the year and were discussed on our last call but to recap we ve repurchased approximately 140 000 shares at an average price of 148 a share for a use of cash of 20 million this leaves us with a 49 million current board authorization to comment briefly on exchange the stronger dollar had offsetting impacts on sales and expenses in q1 assuming a similar exchange rate for the remainder of the year i d expect this to have about a 50 basis point negative impact on sales each quarter and roughly a 0 015 negative impact on q2 earnings a modestly negative impact on q3 earnings and no impact on q4 earnings finally as discussed previously we adopted the new lease accounting guidance in the first quarter with results as previously communicated new assets and liabilities added to our balance sheet for about 180 million each with no impact on our p l or cash flow now i ll turn the call back over to our operator to begin our question and answer session nancy questions and answers operator thank you we will now begin the question and answer session operator instructions our first question comes from ryan merkel from william blair please go ahead ryan merkel william blair analyst hello can you hear me mark w joslin senior vice president and chief financial officer yes ryan peter d arvan president and chief executive officer hi good morning ryan ryan merkel william blair analyst good so first of all last quarter you talked about 20 million to 30 million of sales shift in the 2q from the easter shift is this still your estimate mark w joslin senior vice president and chief financial officer yes well it was a combination of easter which impacts pool openings also the early buys from customers and loss of a billing day so that in total we think was about 20 million to 30 million so estimate we think is really what happened in the quarter ryan merkel william blair analyst okay so nothing is changing on that estimate and then could you comment on sales trends maybe the last two weeks in march and start to april i m wondering if it s consistent with the high single digit organic growth you re expecting for the year peter d arvan president and chief executive officer yes sure ryan sales from march when the weather turned sales picked up and the high single digit that you mentioned is what we were experiencing and that has continued into april ryan merkel william blair analyst okay and then maybe just lastly commercial up 2 is a little softer i think than trend was this weather driven or is there anything else going on peter d arvan president and chief executive officer yes i think a lot of that is weather driven because remember for commercial it s not just indoor pools many of the commercial pools are frankly the outdoor pools and hmac category as well so the guys specifically at west in california and arizona where the weather was just dreadful they got behind on the commercial work so i don t think it s anything other than weather ryan merkel william blair analyst all right okay very good i ll pass it on peter d arvan president and chief executive officer thank you operator the next question comes from david manthey from baird please go ahead david manthey robert w baird analyst hi good morning guys mark w joslin senior vice president and chief financial officer hi good morning peter d arvan president and chief executive officer good morning david david manthey robert w baird analyst you probably don t want to comment on supplier s financial results but is it correct to assume that you didn t see anything in your first quarter that changed your outlook for the demand backdrop generally peter d arvan president and chief executive officer no we obviously we are not going to comment on somebody else s but as i mentioned in my comments underlying demand is strong builders have plenty of work and as usual in this industry when the sun comes out people get back to work and as i mentioned with ryan s question sales have picked up mark w joslin senior vice president and chief financial officer yes the other thing to keep in mind david is just looking at the housing market overall although construction isn t particularly strong home values have been stable and strong and that drives a lot of the growth that we ve had in renovation replacement so no change in expectations there david manthey robert w baird analyst okay it sounds good and then with easter seen as a turning point for seasonal pool openings shouldn t the lateness of easter this year cost you a little bit in the second quarter as well or are you just assuming that it ll catch up by the time you report the full quarter peter d arvan president and chief executive officer i think it will i think it ll catch up there s is as you know there s a big rush to get pools open and now that the sun is out in most places with the exception of texas today the i think it ll catch up david manthey robert w baird analyst okay and then my final question could you give us a generic overview of how you re thinking about your acquisition strategy today peter d arvan president and chief executive officer yes i think it s really no different than it s been in the past we re opportunistic and strategic right so everything that we look at a lot of deals both we look at green and blue so as you know we did a small one on the green side in the end of last year we did adcock in the beginning of this year so there s nothing out there that is transformational for us so we are opportunistic when we see an acquisition that fits our strategic plan and we think it s a good cultural fit with us then we re able to jump on those but nothing out of the ordinary for what you have seen in the past david manthey robert w baird analyst sounds great thank you peter d arvan president and chief executive officer yes thank you operator our next question comes from blake hirschman with stephens incorporated please go ahead blake hirschman stephens incorporated analyst inaudible pricing just kind of what that looked like in the quarter how that stacked up blue versus green and if you re still expecting that 200 basis points above average that you can kind of talked about last call peter d arvan president and chief executive officer if you cut out in the beginning of your question i just want to make sure i got the whole thing could you repeat the question blake hirschman stephens incorporated analyst i was just asking about price what it looked like in the quarter and if you re still expecting 200 basis points above normal this year peter d arvan president and chief executive officer yes i think that s a fairly good range there s been no real one of the suppliers has announced a small increase kind of pre season this year but i think the numbers that we have talked about in the past are still intact mark w joslin senior vice president and chief financial officer yes let me just clarify that you mentioned 200 basis points of improvement for the year inflation inflation yes let s be clear about that that s inflation so the other margin impact as we discussed we ve gotten the vast majority of that benefit in the first quarter with maybe a little bit bleeding into the second quarter blake hirschman stephens incorporated analyst got it okay and then i know you ve kind of talked about base business sales growth expectations and kind of around price versus volume but to kind of slice it up a different way can you give any color as to how that splits out from an end market sales growth perspective like what level you re expecting in non discretionary r r versus larger discretionary r r versus new construction peter d arvan president and chief executive officer yes we say new construction so last year new pool construction was at 80 000 units and that was up from 75 000 units the year prior so i would expect a similar increase this year although we re a little bit behind because of the weather in the beginning of the year but there s still plenty of time to make that up the rest of the market so you have the organic growth with just the new pools in the market you have building material sales which for us has been strong so the renovation market continues to be strong so i don t expect anything from a different trend in that area as we talked about before a lot of what drives the or limits the demand or limits the improvement is labor and there hasn t been a big change in the labor pool so the demand is there so the same growth rates that you have seen in the past by category are probably going to maintain for the year again when it comes to a new pool construction there s not going to be a big shift there and those same contractors that are doing new pool construction are also doing renovation blake hirschman stephens incorporated analyst got it all right thanks a lot i ll turn it over operator the next question comes from steve volkmann from jefferies please go ahead stephen volkmann jefferies analyst all right good morning thanks for taking my question anything interesting to call out relative to some of your other costs like wages and transportation and so forth and any changes in those trends peter d arvan president and chief executive officer interesting to call out well i mentioned that the quarter was impacted by a couple things the one being favorable exchange and that should continue although as we get into the second quarter the impact is less significant there but will still benefit us assuming rates stay about where they are with us europe being the primary rate that impacts the expenses and the other thing that benefited us in the quarter was just the loss of the billing day so it impacts sales but it also impacts the number of expense days so fixed costs in particular get pushed out as i said i think on the last call we lose the day in the first quarter but gained it back in the third quarter and so a little bit heavier expenses there other than that the trends are pretty much as expected we benefited a little bit on the bonus line just in terms of how we book that based on expectations compared to last year not not big enough to really call out but a little bit of benefit there and everything else was as expected we did given the lower sales growth push out i think our folks done an excellent job of managing labor costs and so some of the hires and things that generally we d have gotten started on got pushed back a little bit and that helped us for the quarter stephen volkmann jefferies analyst okay great that s good color thanks and then just on the gross margin benefit from some of the advance buys that you did it sounds like you re saying those sort of fade through the second quarter and then we ll be kind of back to normal in the second half is that the way to read it peter d arvan president and chief executive officer yes so for perspective remember in the second quarter we ll do almost twice the sales volume that we did in the first quarter so by the end of the second quarter it kind of fades away third quarter will be about even and then on a year over year comp basis fourth quarter will be slightly negative because of the benefit we had last year in the fourth quarter stephen volkmann jefferies analyst okay and then just from a cash flow perspective did you i can t remember if you disclosed sort of order of magnitude of how many millions this might be mark w joslin senior vice president and chief financial officer millions of inventory stephen volkmann jefferies analyst yes mark w joslin senior vice president and chief financial officer so i think at the end of the year we said it was approximately 100 million peter d arvan president and chief executive officer right stephen volkmann jefferies analyst okay so we d expect that to come back out of inventory and into cash flow during this year peter d arvan president and chief executive officer right mark w joslin senior vice president and chief financial officer right correct stephen volkmann jefferies analyst superb thanks so much peter d arvan president and chief executive officer yes mark w joslin senior vice president and chief financial officer yes operator our next question comes from anthony lebiedzinski from sidoti company please go ahead anthony lebiedzinski sidoti company analyst yes good morning and thank you for taking the questions so just wondering as far as your outlook for new sales center build out so you opened the two new locations in the first quarter kind of how you are thinking about the balance of the year obviously you talked about earlier about acquisitions but just kind of organically i just wanted to check in how are you guys thinking about that peter d arvan president and chief executive officer sure so far this year we ve added six so there was four from the acquisition with adcock i m sorry so it s five net because four from the acquisition in adcock two new facilities have come online and we consolidated one for the year we re planning on at this point we have nine new approved so there s two new online already so expect another seven to come online before year end and they are in various stages of construction anthony lebiedzinski sidoti company analyst right and are these primarily in existing markets or are you going into any new markets peter d arvan president and chief executive officer no they re primarily in existing markets i mean if you look at our coverage anthony there s not many markets that we re not in basically when we add facility it s usually because we re running out of capacity in the existing facilities and we re following the market so to speak and the growing parts of the geography so we basically break off a portion that out of an existing branch and that becomes the seed for the new branch and then both of them continue to grow mark w joslin senior vice president and chief financial officer yes and just remember from a timing standpoint as pete said the seven will come later in the year after the season so from a revenue standpoint they really don t benefit us too much and there s a little bit of expense that comes with those as they get opened peter d arvan president and chief executive officer right and remember all of our new branches go on our focus list as do acquisitions to make sure they get the attention so that they come online and produce in line with the rest of the company anthony lebiedzinski sidoti company analyst got it that makes sense i was a little bit also surprised switching gears now to europe about the sales strength there i know it s a seasonally small quarter for them but just wondering as to how when you look at the european market does it present perhaps opportunities for to do some additional sales center expansion there or would that be more of a place where you would look to grow through acquisitions peter d arvan president and chief executive officer so i think the answer is yes and yes so europe is a good market for us they and remember as i said europe had a very very very good weather pattern i was over there a couple of weeks ago and they ve had a very nice spring so they re benefiting from that our team is very good and is executing we have a new facility planned in europe and i would tell you that our m a strategy for europe is no different than it is in the us we re strategic and opportunistic when we find something that makes sense great if not then we basically follow the same expansion strategy that we do here in the us anthony lebiedzinski sidoti company analyst okay all right thank you very much and best of luck mark w joslin senior vice president and chief financial officer thank you peter d arvan president and chief executive officer thanks anthony operator our next question comes from garik shmois from longbow research please go ahead garik shmois longbow research analyst hi thanks i just wondering if you could touch on how we should think about sg a and operating leverage the rest of the year just given that sales growth is expected to accelerate you deferred some personnel expenses into the second quarter due to some of the timing and some of the seasonality so any help on the drop through would be helpful mark w joslin senior vice president and chief financial officer sure garik just i think just going back to our guidance is probably the best way to answer that which what we look for generally on sg a is growth at about 60 of gross profit growth and in doing that then that provides us to the leverage in terms of how we get that leverage is that really goes to capacity creation initiatives that we have going on throughout the company which is ways to make better utilization of our investments and people facilities vehicles pool360 is one of the ways that we do that on the labor side and we ve had very good results there due to strong kind of focused effort from our team and really explaining to our customers the benefits to them and getting them new adoptions on pool360 so in any case that all the pool360 and number of other initiatives around capacity creation there what helps drive that operating leverage and using that 60 for the year and then kind of backing that end by quarter based on where we finished q1 and factoring in what i mentioned on exchange rates and billing day in the third quarter should help get that model out for you garik shmois longbow research analyst okay no that helps and then just one last question just on the 10 million to 15 million in weather related deferments just wondering and also a big number that grand scheme of things but a level of confidence and being able to recover the lost sale is just in the context of the labor constraints that you ve been highlighting for quite some time peter d arvan president and chief executive officer yes i think given that it s in the western half of the us so there are large markets and in the whole grand scheme of things with what we ll do in the west between now and year end it s really not that big a deal so we look at 10 million to 15 million i m very comfortable saying that 10 million you know could we have risk on 5 million if we have weather bad weather in the balance of the year at some point we could but in the whole grand scheme of what those markets will do i don t think it s really significant garik shmois longbow research analyst okay nice talk thanks peter d arvan president and chief executive officer yes operator operator instructions our next question comes from ken zener from keybanc please go ahead ken zener keybanc analyst good morning gentlemen mark w joslin senior vice president and chief financial officer good morning peter d arvan president and chief executive officer good morning ken ken zener keybanc analyst pete you have got like your stock hits an all time high you have got like this is whether volatility versus your old industry i imagine i just would ask some vanilla questions because you guys are obviously executing well and the story doesn t change that much so on these delayed products i get it i mean is it what type of product is it i know you got the gross margin benefit from your pre buys but i mean is it across the board or is it really more inaudible and poor maintenance coming out of winter or what s the kind of just 30 second what gets delayed is it everything or is a particular categories peter d arvan president and chief executive officer yes you re talking about the 20 million to 30 million plus ken zener keybanc analyst yes just been general like when you get a weather issue like this you know not heavy rains like texas but just kind of layer is it just more like a more northern climate where stuff just gets delayed period mark w joslin senior vice president and chief financial officer well to think about the fact that we re in this time of year when pools are starting to get open so you have a little bit of everything going on so the weather impacts construction days and construction days as both renovation and new build and then the delay and pool openings affects chemical usage and the start up expenses that you incur when you open a pool so you got some maintenance products peter d arvan president and chief executive officer the things that didn t pools that weren t properly maintained where things may have frozen in the winter or deferred maintenance from the end of the year inaudible i ll wait till the next season to change the light that had burned out so it really is across the board ken ken zener keybanc analyst okay and then looking at spend just to kind of think about this again i m just kind of refreshing but for the blue side like if a new pool that tends to be about 5 000 a unit and r r on the blue tends to be about 1 500 is that still the numbers that that you re kind of using in terms of expenditures per that category mark w joslin senior vice president and chief financial officer no absolutely that s about right ken zener keybanc analyst and then on the renovation which could include green or hardscape do you guys have a kind of number that when people are redoing a pool which could include not only the widening the pool pull piping et cetera but it could also include the concrete around it or finishings do you have a general number for when the pool gets renovated what that is and if that s half financed or is that all cash i m just trying to understand that r r side a little better peter d arvan president and chief executive officer yes and it s a big range ken as you know there is a lot of variation and the variation is driven by what the customer wants as well as how well the customer homeowner is feeling economically and so when you are sitting on equity in your home and you have a pool that is let s call it long in the tooth it needs a number of things and you re more likely to buy today because of all the features and benefits that have been having over time there is just such a wide variety of things that you can do with your pool in terms of the pool finishes and tile and fountains and fire and really the other thing too is ken is starting to appear and it s sorely needed in the industry is technology things that make a pool easier to own whether it s the next generation of robotic cleaners or whether it s being able to control your pool even on a retrofit basis from your phone those products are just starting to really come out and gain exposure in the market and that s also going to just it ll simply expand it will expand the market i mean there s a of the 5 5 million in ground pools for instance 3 5 million of those we believed operate on a mechanical time clock and every one of those is a candidate for an automation update which for relatively nominal amount allows you to control that pool from your phone so the long answer there is a wide variety and we ve expanded our share of products as well as our presence by opening these entity centers where homeowners can come in so we don t want have a specific number it s just a ken zener keybanc analyst yes no but what i was trying to understand there in the mechanical clock and i have god knows how inaudible mechanical clock in many industries you talk about a life cycle so pools appliances might be 10 years it s a very fungible number but i m wondering is as these in ground pools get older if in fact you are you experiencing arising need for r r because they re just literally breaking down you know what i mean you have to show but everything else is really just hitting points where it has to be greater upgrades than you ve had in the past right which is your combined not only with your expansion in the hardscape et cetera but the pool infrastructure itself is requiring do you see any of that i don t know how to think about a pool s life cycle i know pump score out and stuff like that but it seems like the pools because they ve been on the ground longer are actually facing greater upkeep themselves peter d arvan president and chief executive officer yes i mean we think about the interior of a pool i mean there s so many variables that come into play and it has to water chemistry being the biggest one you can have a pool that has great water chemistry and the water is always balanced and that pool finish will last a lot longer than one where the water chemistry is out of balance and people don t take care of it but we think about equipment pad life cycle similar to which you would expect for the appliances in your home and the interior of a pool is probably kind of like a 10 year cycle so but there are a lot of that has to do it s not just that it wore out it is design changes and features so some of it is not it s not that there s anything wrong with the finish it s just that it s not aesthetically pleasing and when somebody sees a picture of a new pool and says wow that s great and it s a pool that its basic form is a concrete shell what you put on it determines and what you put around it determines what it looks like ken zener keybanc analyst thank you very much sorry for that extended question peter d arvan president and chief executive officer no problem operator this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to pete arvan for any closing remarks peter d arvan president and chief executive officer great thank you very much for

president and chief executive officer reported we were pleased with our first quarter of 2019 earnings were 6 0 million compared to 5 8 million for the comparable quarter of 2018 a 3 3 increase the

for credit average interest bearing deposits for the 2019 quarter were 25 5 million or 2 2 less than the comparable quarter of 2018 first quarter of 2019 compared to first quarter of 2018 total

participants prepared remarks operator good morning and welcome to crown holdings first quarter 2019 conference call your lines have been placed on a listen only mode until the question and answer session please be advised that this conference is being recorded i would now like to turn the call over to mr thomas kelly senior vice president and chief financial officer sir you may begin thomas a kelly senior vice president and chief financial officer thank you christ and good morning with me on today s call is tim donahue president and chief executive officer on this call as in the earnings release we will be making a number of forward looking statements actual results could vary materially from such statements additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to vary is contained in the press release and in our sec filings including in our form 10 k for 2018 and subsequent filings earnings for the quarter were 0 77 per share compared to 0 67 in the prior year quarter comparable earnings per share increased to 1 5 in the quarter versus 0 94 in 2018 net sales grew 25 in 2019 versus 2018 primarily due to the acquisition of the transit packaging business in april 2018 and increased beverage can volumes partially offset by 100 million of unfavorable currency translation segment income in the quarter improved primarily due to the signode acquisition as higher global beverage can volumes were offset by lower european food can results and start up costs at the two new beverage can plants in europe as outlined in the release we estimate second quarter 2019 adjusted earnings of between 1 45 1 43 to 1 53 per share the reaffirmed full year adjusted earnings of between 5 20 and 5 40 per share these estimates assume exchange rates remain at their current levels and a full year tax rate of between 25 and 26 also consistent with our previous guidance we currently estimate 2019 full year adjusted free cash flow of approximately 775 million with between 400 million and 425 million in capital spending net leverage at the end of 2019 is expected to be in the low 4s with that i ll turn the call over to tim timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer thank you tom and good morning to everyone i ll be brief and then we ll open the call to questions as reflected in last night s release and as tom just summarized the first quarter was on plan and puts us directly on path to achieve free cash flow of 775 million for 2019 while results were mixed across the operating segments food and beverage unit demand was up in most geographies demonstrating the strong fundamentals across our global businesses we have reviewed the progress on major projects under way or recently completed in the release all of which are on the same timing as we described in february in a supplemental table to the release we have provided a currency impact on sales and segment income by operating segment so my comments will focus on currency neutral performance in americas beverage sales units advanced 2 5 due to solid performances across latin american operations with volumes in north america level to the prior year segment income improved 60 million due to the volume increases in latin american cans and mexican glass pricing recovery and 2018 start up costs from the three major projects in chihuahua monterrey and nichols now behind us our 2019 outlook for the segment remains positive unit volumes in european beverage advanced 3 over the prior year as strong performances in eastern europe france and spain offset softness in jordan and the uk as we noted in february start up cost and currency weighed on the seasonally small first quarter beginning with the second quarter comparable results will accelerate as we cycle through start up in currency with the second quarter and full year results expected to be in line with 2018 sales unit volumes in european food were up 3 in the first quarter with most product categories showing gains over 2018 segment income ex currency was off 4 million as contribution from the volume gains in the seasonally small first quarter was not enough to offset inflationary increases in costs such as energy and labor currently our expectation is for a normal seasonal pack and full year income performance to be in line with 2018 for your modeling purposes q2 will be a bit short of the prior year as we still experience currency headwinds with growth in the second half beverage can volumes in asia pacific advanced 1 as demand remain strong across southeast asia offsetting the impact from the closure of the two facilities in china adjusting for currency and step up depreciation from the acquisition segment income in transit was in line with the first quarter of 2018 strong demand in europe and protective offset some softness in the us strapping business excluding currency our 2019 transit outlook is for sales growth of 2 to 2 5 and segment income in line with 2018 directionally we expect q2 to be a bit short of last year s record performance with growth to be experienced in both q3 and q4 our gdp plus or minus business the transit performance is right in line with our pre acquisition expectations strong sales volumes and good cost control in north american food and closures drove the segment income growth in non reportables so in summary a solid start to the year with results mixed but overall on plan and as many of you are well aware the first quarter is seasonally small so it s far too early to comment on our seasonal food packs and with that chris we re now ready to take questions questions and answers operator thank you participants on the phone we will now begin the question and answer session operator instructions our first question will come from tyler langton of jpmorgan you have an open line tyler langton jpmorgan analyst yeah good morning thanks for taking my question thomas a kelly senior vice president and chief financial officer good morning tyler langton jpmorgan analyst just on americas beverage i think your margins were up around 140 basis points and you kind of mentioned the factors that driving that i mean is that and i know q1 is a seasonally slower quarter but is that sort of level improvement sustainable for the rest of the year if you could kind of provide some color on that timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer in a crystal ball the answer is we sure hope so i think we re going to see as far as i can see right now we re going to see considerable improvement again in q2 versus the prior year perhaps a little too early to call q3 and q4 but i think overall we re feeling much more positive about the segment i don t want to characterize the performance to q1 as you say it s a smaller quarter so any increase you have and specifically the lack of the start up costs in the first quarter this year compared to last year have a much more meaningful impact on a small quarter like q1 so i think q2 will see gains i think we ll have gains all year i think the percentage gains are as you get into the bigger quarters are just smaller that s all tyler langton jpmorgan analyst okay that s helpful and then in transit did you say flat segment income for the year was that including the impacts of like fx or excluding it and i guess if you can just provide a little bit more timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer so if we excluded fx we d be up a bit but with fx will be flat for the year tyler langton jpmorgan analyst got it okay timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer we re modeling about 7 million or 8 million of fx in the business i think for the full year tyler langton jpmorgan analyst and now you re seeing it just within transit i think you mentioned the u s strapping business was a little weaker europe protective up now are you seeing any signs of slowing instead of the other businesses that you have the transit competes in timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer yes what i would tell you is a little confusing in that we would have just given all the news that s coming out of europe now we would have expected europe to be a bit slower and europe actually had some acceleration across most of its product lines which we re still trying to understand just given the broader macro news coming out of europe right now in the u s i think more of it it had to do with some competitive efforts made by others and in our unwillingness to cut price so we ll see where it takes us i think in general and we re seeing this you know in some of our transit businesses and i m reading this in some general economic news i think people are just a bit more cautious now i don t think there s any real signs of a looming recession but people are a little bit more cautious and obviously the longer we go until we have a recession that cautious nature eventually they have to refill their pipeline so i think we re fairly confident we re going to have a another strong performance in transit and as i said this is a business that and we ve always maintained it s a gdp plus or minus business given the very low capital requirements of the business you re not expecting huge growth unless you do bolt on acquisitions so this is a business that s operating right in line with our expectations and continues to to flow enormous amounts of cash tyler langton jpmorgan analyst great thanks so much timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question will come from scott gaffner of barclays you have an open line scott gaffner barclays analyst thanks good morning tim good morning tom timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer good morning scott thomas a kelly senior vice president and chief financial officer good morning scott gaffner barclays analyst tim if we could just talk a little bit about the north american volumes i mean i think you said they were flat in the quarter and obviously the industry data was quite strong i think maybe you coming off a difficult comp year over year can you talk about what you re seeing relative to the industry wide why your volumes would have been flat timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer well i think what one thing we did talk about in february was that we expected to under index the market this year we ve over indexed the market for several years in a row where we re pretty tight on capacity as you know we were sourcing cans from the competition last year and incurring higher cost than we could produce those cans for and higher costs in terms of freight and we did make some decisions this year that for some contracts that rolled over and for some other situations we made some decisions that it didn t make a lot of sense for us to continue to outsell our own capacity so what we re trying to do is is only sell directly our capacity and so we ll under index this year but nothing wrong obviously the fundamentals in the market are extremely strong and the overall market and the demand for our customers from our locations and our capacity footprint is also strong it s just our operational change this year to try to reduce the extra costs that we were incurring last year at the end of the day scott we were making and sourcing cans for practice in some cases last year we don t that s a bad practice to get into we don t want to do that anymore scott gaffner barclays analyst completely agree if we look at the year over year change in our profit you said plus 16 million you mentioned a few things latam cans glass and start up costs and price recovery can you just help us get a little bit more granular on those buckets so that we can make our own judgment on the continued improvement as we move to the year timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer how much do i want to tell you so is the million dollar question right scott gaffner barclays analyst well maybe the easiest one is just i mean the start up costs sort of how much was that timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer well so i ll give you a number because it s i don t have the start i can tell you that our glass results in mexico were up 4 million year on year so that s an easy number to tell you and some of that will be start up from the new furnace last year but more to the point the furnace is fully operational and fully sold out this year so if we are talking 16 million ex currency you ve got 4 million coming out of glass boy nichols and nichols and monterrey there is probably 3 million in there just start up nichols our efficiency numbers in nichols are now 90 plus whereas this time last year we were probably still in the 70s i m trying to stay away from pricing obviously you can tell right the plants generally the system is running better operationally and so as i was describing earlier our willingness to give up volume and not try to make every can for every order and source from others is saving us money we re not experiencing any freight increases year on year and we re not changing labels is often so operationally in the factories we re running better but if you wanted to cut this up in four buckets i d say glass start up costs in monterrey and nichols better volumes in brazil pricing you can cut it up four ways times four is 16 something like that scott gaffner barclays analyst okay fair enough just last one on transit packaging i mean i know you don t have huge backlogs in that business but coming into 2019 i think you said the backlog at the end of 2018 were relatively strong did you see any significant shift in the backlog throughout the first quarter timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer so i would say the backlog is lower so at the end of 18 and we were stronger than at the end of 17 at the end of march this year it s stronger than it was at the end of december 18 but it s low a little bit lower about 3 or 4 lower than it was at the end of march of 18 and that s kind of in line with what i said there s a lot of hesitancy in the market right now for people to to step out and place orders but i think it s just a time our guys feel pretty confident that s just timing at this point and it s going to be recovered because they don t we don t see any underlying issues in the economy or real demand which is just people a being very cautious at the beginning of the year scott gaffner barclays analyst sounds good i appreciate it guys timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer thanks scott operator our next question will come from anthony pettinari of citi you have an open line anthony pettinari citigroup analyst good morning timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer good morning anthony pettinari citigroup analyst on the last call i think you talked about a 0 09 impact from fx on full year eps just marking to market what are your expectations for the year now and then assuming fx is a bit more of a headwind than it was at the beginning of the year has your free cash flow bridge changed at all compared to three months ago if you look at fx and then maybe just the performance of the individual businesses timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer so tom and i were talking while you were talking i think if we said 0 09 before maybe it s 0 10 or 0 11 now that the euro is a little touch weaker cash flow bridge hasn t really changed okay there s a little more currency in there but we are one thing i would say is that we are the north american beverage plants operationally running exceptionally well and perhaps they re running better quicker than we had anticipated so that you know the team would have come through with a budget and a target and we at corporate we d put all the hedge on that i just worried that they wouldn t get there as quick and i think they re getting there quicker than we anticipated so we re going to overcome currency with performance anthony pettinari citigroup analyst okay that s helpful and on non european bev i wondering if it was possible to break out vols in europe proper versus what you saw in the middle east and then in terms of the timing of lapping some of those headwinds in the middle east is that a 2q or 3q event and when can that when it can that part of the business kind of grow more in line with what continental europe to see timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer yeah so in europe and again we described to you back in february we were a little capacity constrained last year we ve got the three new lines up now we are experiencing start up and i ll touch upon one of the little one issue we had there but european volumes up about 4 5 in the quarter middle east down about 2 but operationally income in the middle east is only down about 0 5 million to 1 million from an operational standpoint so most of the shortfall you re seeing as currency and start up and then there is some price cost pressure in that again a small quarter so you don t have enough volume to overcome in the first quarter energy and other labor inflation that you ll be able to overcome in later quarters when you have more volume the one issue just to mention in with the start up one little problem we had exacerbating a start up in spain until i think april 2nd or april 3rd we weren t hooked up to the power grid in spain so we were running the plant the one line and then the second line of diesel generators and that s a little bit more expensive than you would like to do but we re that s behind us now so we re not going to experience that any longer anthony pettinari citigroup analyst okay that s very helpful i ll turn it over timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question will come from ghansham panjabi from baird you have an open line ghansham panjabi robert w baird co analyst hey guys good morning timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer hi ghansham ghansham panjabi robert w baird co analyst hi tim i guess going back to signode maybe you could just break out and i m sorry if i missed this but how machine sales did versus the consumables how does the cadence of volume factor in the quarter an early look at april they re starting up with a normal seasonality just give some more color on signode thanks timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer yeah i think you know most of the volume shortfall we saw the big volume shortfall we saw was within the u s strapping business and that s both plastic and steel strap for the reasons i described i think it s more to do with competitive pressure than anything else and that the team has been pretty firm on on price policy equipment and tools more or less right in line with the prior year and europe up protective up as i said demand in asia a little softer than we expected and mainly the asian business is a strapping business for a large part of the business are steel strapping business they ve got a big steel strapping business in australia and one of the big mill in australia was on strike in q1 so we didn t ship any strap to the one large customer there but generally february was a pretty soft month march firmed up a bit march was pretty much in line with last year so nothing out of the ordinary it s a as we ve described it s an extremely diverse business and individually if you looked at any one product line in any one geography the movements from period to period in terms of volume can be quite shocking up or down but it doesn t translate to a whole lot on the top line because individually everything is so small compared to the unit as a whole ghansham panjabi robert w baird co analyst okay and then just to clarify on u s the pricing comments you ve made i guess i really don t understand that i mean steel prices are still pretty and plastic prices pull back a little bit but what s driving this competitive sort of hesitancy if you will or these connected terms of what you represent from a pricing standpoint in the u s timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer yes you ve got the cru is pretty high and you ve got a couple of customers out there that are or couple of competitors out there that are trying to gain volume so it s just competition ghansham ghansham panjabi robert w baird co analyst okay and then just one final one in european food volumes were pretty strong but you called out in just energy and labor i haven t heard you really called it out in the past specific to that region just some more context on that thanks so much timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer yes i mean the only thing i was trying to point out is that every year or a lot of years we have inflationary pressure and you ve heard us talk about inflation before in north america as it relates to the ppi and we have similar mechanisms in the contracts in other geographies around the world plus or minus sometimes they work better than others but in a small quarter like q1 where there s the volume is well you do have volume gains there is not enough volume to offset price escalation that may price or cost escalation that maybe above your price modifiers energy has been i m sure if you talk to and i m talking about electricity if you talk to any manufacturer across europe they are going to tell you electricity rates across europe have been skyrocketing over the last couple of years and it s just something we have to do a better job covering and there are a lot of ways to cover it you can cover it with increased volume you can cover it with better cost management and you can cover it with better terms within a contract when those contracts come for renegotiation but it s just a it s a headwind that that s more meaningful in a small quarter like q1 ghansham panjabi robert w baird co analyst got it thanks so much tim timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer you re welcome operator our next question will come from mark wilde of bank of montreal you have an open line mark william wilde bmo capital markets analyst thanks good morning tim good morning tom timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer good morning mark thomas a kelly senior vice president and chief financial officer good morning mark mark william wilde bmo capital markets analyst tim just coming back to europe for a couple of things in the beverage can area can you give us some sense of how big those start up costs were in the first quarter and then just cadencing through the balance of the year timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer i could tell you that the start up in the first quarter is on the order of including the increased depreciation on the order of 10 million so it s not insignificant there are three lines and all three lines are larger lines they are not the smaller lines we typically put in asia for a start up for example they are pretty full lines just given the demand patterns that we see in europe and the fact that we re sold out in the expectation we have for continued can growth across europe as the sustainability push continues to become more meaningful so about 10 million a little we ll have a little bit in q2 maybe on the order of 3 million or 4 million but i do believe as we sit here today as i said in the prepared remarks i do believe that our performance in q2 if we were 15 million or 16 million short in q1 we are going to be pretty much right on top of q2 last year than q2 this year mark william wilde bmo capital markets analyst okay and then this sustainability growth in europe can you talk about what that really is translating to right now is it just discussions with customers about potential conversions or what are you actually seeing and hearing from them right now timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer we have to be little careful because you got one or two customers don t want us to say much but if you want to think about products which have typically been package in a competing substrate you ve got a number of customers now understanding and trialing cans for those products and so they are beyond talking they are now at the trialing stage mark william wilde bmo capital markets analyst okay all right and then finally just that new line or third line in cambodia is that actually some of the equipment that you re moving out of china timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer no that s new equipment the chinese equipment will go to one of the factories in vietnam and ho chi minh and the other line is slated to i think we re going to move in to da nang not da nang i m sorry hanoi so both will go to vietnam mark william wilde bmo capital markets analyst okay all right timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer it s just timing one is happening now the other will happen later mark william wilde bmo capital markets analyst okay very good i ll turn it over thanks tim timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question will come from debbie jones of deutsche bank you have an open line debbie jones deutsche bank analyst hi good morning timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer good morning thomas a kelly senior vice president and chief financial officer good morning debbie debbie jones deutsche bank analyst you mentioned in the release robust growth in southeast asia and brazil i know you talked about it a little bit but one i didn t catch the brazil growth if you mentioned that and two i was hoping to get some commentary on whether or not this is kind of above your expectations of what you ve been seeing if there s anything notable about trends in either of those regions that s changing driving the pack mix timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer so i think southeast asia was up on the order of close to 10 and that would have been pretty much in line with our expectation coming back to i don t have brazil i have latin america in front of me in latin america it looks like it s up about 7 7 5 in total i will tell you brazil is up more than that and then mexico and colombia are up a touch below that i think you know honestly speaking i think the brazil growth is a bit more than we expected now having said that they just came out of what two or three years of some of the worst economy in the recession they had from what 14 or 15 16 17 and it s a market that s undergoing incredible reforms whether they re political social economic i think the future is exceptionally bright for brazil so we re exceptionally bullish and notwithstanding our current capacity constraints until we get the new plant in rio already running in late q3 we expect brazil to be quite healthy throughout this full year debbie jones deutsche bank analyst okay that was actually my second question i was a little surprised by the growth and results i saw you are a bit capacity constraints given that the start up is until later this year so i was curious if you could just comment on that and then your thoughts on the overall supply demand balance in the region just because it does seem like there s a little bit trickling in from a lot of different directions but we are seeing the growth timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer yeah so i think certainly if you think about months the months of august or september through carnival we are all of us all the companies were sold out and then leading up to that you know a bit capacity constrained and how much inventory we can build we re coming out of carnival usually the month of march month of march april may are a little bit lighter so we do have the ability as the market grows this year compared to the prior year to experience growth i think in terms of utilization in the market the markets what 28 billion 29 billion cans and i think over the last couple of years we ve picked up 4 or 5 percentage points in the pack mix from glass to can so really positive and while there is a little bit excess capacity currently i think it s going to quickly be absorbed i don t see it creating any real issue in the near term i think this is a market that s 200 210 million people and as we ve said before the beer market is now 50 in cans united states is 70 in cans for beer and there s no reason why over the next what 5 7 10 years that the brazil can be 70 in cans and i think i know you guys follow the glass market i think the glass guys would tell you they are pretty much sold out in glass right now in brazil so as the fillers need more more packaging they re coming to the cans so it s pretty exciting right now in brazil debbie jones deutsche bank analyst great thanks and good luck in the quarter timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question will come from george staphos from bank of america you have an open line george staphos bank of america analyst thanks hi everyone good morning timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer hi george george staphos bank of america analyst thanks for the details i guess the first question that i have is on beverage cans a lot of my questions are already asked and answered but you know on the one hand you re seeing a very tight market condition across a lot of your geographies and that s a good thing on the other hand while you want to keep that market tight you often want to meet your customers needs for various reason including avoiding others who might be considering entering the market to come in are you finding with new customers with new facilities with discussions you re having with customers right now about potential additions projects would have you that the terms forgetting about pricing for a minute because i know you can t really go there but are they getting more favorable for you in terms of what is expected from the customer relative to what s expected from crown and are you finding that you re at least being able to majority sellout your new lines as they re coming on is that ratio heading higher from what you can see again given this currently really good market condition we haven t seen this in 20 30 years timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer yes so similar to the question you asked in february george because we talked about the cola wars of the 80s and i know that s what you re referring to i would say it s different by geography but certainly we are tight everywhere we re doing our best to bring up as much capacity as we can we ve got several projects in asia we ve got several in europe that just completed we ve got one under way in brazil and north america we ve got a situation where it s the biggest market in the world and traditionally it s been the most the least profitable on a percentage basis not necessary the least profitable on a cash flow basis but on a percentage basis so if you look at allocating capital and making capital decisions and returns it s the least attractive market historically so we re trying to get to a situation where we can make it a bit more attractive so that as we present opportunities and capital request to the company and to the board we can do it with the idea that it makes sense to do and now having said that whether the customers understand that or don t understand that i don t think they really care they ve kind of been in the driver seat for the last 30 years dictating terms to to the suppliers and clearly it s a little shocking for them but their margins are 40 and our margins are 10 so anytime they want to trade that margin profile and work back toward the middle we re prepared to do that but we re trying to get to a situation where returns justify new capital and the first goal is you want to service your customers with quality product and high service and we don t want to limit their ability to get their products on the shelf but at the same time we have to be we ve got to be fairly compensated for what we re trying to do you spent a lot of time george over the years in a number of different factories for a variety of different products that are made and you fully understand the engineering feat behind beverage cans at 3 000 cans a minute is no short fee so we do need to be fairly compensated for that and so that s what we are endeavoring to do at least here in north america and we ll see if we can do a little better in some of the other regions as well george staphos bank of america analyst and i realize it s a tough question to answer and ultimately no guarantees in life on anything but the window if you want to frame it that way do you see it staying at least as widely open as it is now to have more constructive discussions with your customers around the globe is there anything that you see on the horizon that maybe again it is giving you some caution in terms of your ability to again push better terms i guess more fairly compensated again beyond price terms all the other ways that you can bring value and get value for what you do how would you discuss that to the extent possible timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer probably i want to stay away from that the only thing i would say this is kind of you know this already but i ll say it anyway we have goals and aspirations and our competitors have goals and aspirations and so do our customers and those three different buckets of aspirations are not always aligned and so the one thing that gives you caution is how far do you push and how much risk are you willing to take and that goes along with capacity as well we ve had situations in the past when we thought it was a great idea to put a lot of capacity in because it look like things are going to be great for a long time and then the industry wakes up one day and it s not running at 97 utilization it s running at 88 or 90 and that s not a good answer for the beverage can business so we are always a bit cautious around how much capacity we re going to rush to put in understanding that that others may do the same and understanding that the other substrates whether they have issues or not currently they may figure out a solution to their issue and they ll become relevant again we re more relevant than we think they are right now george staphos bank of america analyst two last ones and i ll turn it over and the first one you can just to quickly relative to where you were a year ago that opportunity to gain share from other substrates and markets where environmental concerns is most pronounced has that accelerated or is it pretty much the same pace as we would ve seen a year ago and then a one off question there was a charge that you took for intangible amortization from prior acquisitions in the quarter you just reported what was that related to was it related to an acquisition that didn t necessarily have the value you thought it would have and yet write it down here thank you guys good luck in the quarter timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer so the first answer is it may or may not be at the same pace it was a year ago the sustainability question you had but i will tell you i certainly believe it a 180 degrees more today than i would have believed that a year ago so my conviction is much stronger today than it was a year ago i think others customers included their conviction levels are much higher george you re going have to give tom a little more we are little puzzled by the second question tom is looking at me puzzled george staphos bank of america analyst i thought there was a charge you took in the quarter in your non reportive that you took out of operating earnings for amortization of prior acquisitions did i miscast that timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer signode and thomas a kelly senior vice president and chief financial officer i don t think so the amortization we have is just the normal amortization from signode as well as timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer mivisa and empaque thomas a kelly senior vice president and chief financial officer mivisa and empaque which we had last year so i m not sure what that is george staphos bank of america analyst footnote one in the first quarter of 2019 crown recorded charges of 47 million for intangible amortization from prior acquisitions we can take it offline but that s what i was asking about thomas a kelly senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah that s the amortization of the intangibles it s not a one time it s just the normal amortization flowing through george staphos bank of america analyst okay thomas a kelly senior vice president and chief financial officer flows through every quarter george staphos bank of america analyst got it apologies guys have good quarter thomas a kelly senior vice president and chief financial officer thank you timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer thank you george operator our next question will come from adam josephson of keybanc capital markets you have an open line adam josephson keybanc capital markets analyst tim and tom good morning thomas a kelly senior vice president and chief financial officer good morning timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer hi adam adam josephson keybanc capital markets analyst tim just on the segment commentary for 19 correct me if i misheard you but i think you said for all segments ex americas beverage you would be flat ex currency and i think currency is going to be about at 20 million also drag this year so that would correct me if i m wrong that would imply that americas bev would be up pushing 60 million this year i know you didn t quantify americas bev but timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer yeah so let s just back up a second what i said was not ex currency so if when i talk about european beverage european food transit asia with the currency headwind for the full year they will all be more or less in line with the prior year adam josephson keybanc capital markets analyst okay and so but all of the growth this year will be in americas bev timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer that s and in the non reportable yes adam josephson keybanc capital markets analyst non reportable okay you mentioned you re obviously capacity constrained in north america we ve seen the cmi data it s been growing 3 3 5 last couple of quarters i ll ask you in a moment about what your longer term view is there but how long do you intend to remain this capacity constrained in north america and what if anything do you plan to do about it timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer well i think we ve been pretty clear that we re trying to get fair compensation for the products and services we provide before we dedicate any more capital to a market that historically has been the the lowest return market of any of the markets that we operate in around the world and we re prepared to consider that in the future but what not at the return rates that have existed over the last several years i do think the market will remain extremely tight there are some product categories within the market that are over sold right now there are some sizes that are short in the market but and i think as we look for the rest of the year and in the next year i wouldn t be surprised if can came growth is 1 5 to 3 that s a wide range but it s from quarter to quarter it s you don t know how it s going to play out but i think that i think we re starting to see customers react to pressure in certain jurisdictions where some other substrates are out of favor and they re looking to pack more in can so this could remain tight for some time adam josephson keybanc capital markets analyst and you re comfortable ceding share for a year or two in the meantime if it comes to that timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer i can t i can t tell you what others are going to do i can only tell you we re going to try to get fairly compensated before we make any more investments adam josephson keybanc capital markets analyst right and just on that longer term outlook tim 1 5 to 3 ish obviously the last 10 15 years the market s been flattish down a bit last two quarters up 3 5 or so is there something that you would point to is starting in the last starting six months ago that notably changed or did you see something building up such that you were not surprised to see these huge growth rates relative to what we ve seen over the past 10 15 i m just trying to understand what would have seemingly changed on a dime really in the last six months and why would that be sustainable timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer so beginning several years ago you started to see the an increase in energy drinks sparkling waters craft beers and then craft beer usage of cans accelerating but over the last six months what has happened that s allowed that s a bubble to the surface is that mass beer has not experienced the large declines that have experienced in several quarters before that so mass has been pretty and can has been or alcoholic in cans has been fairly consistent it s not been down so it has allowed the other categories to bubble up and show growth across the entire industry adam josephson keybanc capital markets analyst got it and just last question on the substrate shift and sustainability obviously glasses have been losing share over the years do you have any data as to cans versus plastic over the years have cans been gaining any share from plastic do you expect that to happen just because when we re talking sustainability i assume you re referring more to plastic than to glass although i could be mistaken but is there any data you have that support this idea that there has been a substrate shift away from plastic timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer yeah break it down into there is no plastic to speak of in beer and there s no glass to speak of in csd so in beer it s cans versus glass and soft drink it s cans versus pet i think the big thing that s happened in csd is the over the last decade the literage sold in two liter bottles the larger bottles are shrinking and it s more a single serve so their units maybe up but the leaders have moved a little bit i think it s in the united states maybe a little too early to say that we re seeing anything from the csd players but what you are seeing and we talked about this last time and i think it was specific to one of your questions adam for whatever reason we re seeing how to get that in i m sorry we re seeing new product introductions more and more considering the can whereas the can would not even have been considered 5 or 10 years ago now it s top of mind for people introducing new products adam josephson keybanc capital markets analyst thanks tim timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question will come from arun viswanathan of rbc capital markets you have an open line arun viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst hi thanks good morning guys timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer good morning arun viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst just wanted to ask i guess going back to the other issues around your position given that the beverage can growth is pretty robust here would you consider resourcing cans elsewhere if it came to that and you found yourself too constrained to meet your customer demand timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer well so what we try to do coming into this year is not have ourselves in the position where we have to source from others and from time to time through the industry we are all pretty good about helping each other out if somebody has a fire or a strike and certainly on commercial terms but if we have an issue a production issue that requires us or limits our capacity our ability to make cans to satisfy the contracts we have in place then we ll source cans but we re not actively trying to source cans just so we can say we re selling more cans arun viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst okay understood and then also just looking out i guess do you expect your overall growth kind of in on volumes to kind of continue at this in this 2 to 4 range and maybe if you can just run through your expectations for each geography mainly americas europe and apac and latin america i guess that will be great timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer yes so i think globally we expect 2 to 4 we ve been what 3 to 5 every year for the last 10 years i guess and this year maybe we re going to be on the order of 2 5 to 3 the largest market we have north america we re going to be largely flattish this year just because of capacity but the other markets brazil we re going to be up we re going to sell every can we can make so hopefully in the softer months of the brazilian winter week we obviously have compared to last year last year we would had capacity this year we will sell the capacity perhaps in brazil will be up high single digits mexico will be up europe with the new factories coming online especially as they come through learning curve and the start up is behind us in the second third and fourth quarters we could be up this year 8 to 10 that s obviously not a sustainable number that just a number that s in place because we ve got capacity coming on this year and some others had capacity coming on in the prior years middle east flattish that s a plus or minus 1 china we re going to be down substantially this year because we basically cut the business in half when we took three lines out we only have three lines left but southeast asia will be up 10 so it s a mixed bag but all in all it s fairly positive the only market where we re probably as somebody used the term earlier ceding share if we in fact are doing that is north america and we re just trying to do that until we get ourselves in the position where return rates justify more capital arun viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst great thanks and then on signode if i may lastly i guess how would you characterize the performance in the quarter and i guess how would you kind of view the trajectory from here i mean do you think there was any impact from macro headwinds in china and europe and have you seen any signs of life of those getting better and this baseline of earnings is there any seasonality that we should keep in mind for future quarters that would make those higher or lower or timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer yes so the second and third quarters are a bit stronger the seasonality is not as it cute as in beverage or food cans signode has an extremely small operation in china i think our revenues in china are 20 million but having said that the chinese us trade negotiations do have impacts throughout the asian region and as i said asia was a little softer i don t think that it hasn t anything do with the overall economies and notably india because india is our biggest market in the asian business i think it just has to do with the cautiousness of people that are the buyers currently i think that s going to come back only timing as i said earlier we were very surprised just given the macro news out of europe that the european business was as strong as it was in q1 and q2 looks like it ll be ok as well and north america as i described i don t think there s any fundamental underlying issue other than we decided to let some business go for price reasons but all in all it s going to be a pretty firm performance it will be flattish to last year which means they re going to overcome 8 million or 9 million of currency and the second quarter last year was was a blowout quarter if you remember so there will be a little short of that in the second quarter of this year but third and fourth quarters will be up against last year arun viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst great thanks timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question will come from chip dillon of vertical research you have an open line chip dillon vertical research analyst hi good morning tim and tom timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer hi chip thomas a kelly senior vice president and chief financial officer hi chip chip dillon vertical research analyst hey first question is basically when you look at the yield curve and i know it s started to steepen a little bit but it looks like interest rates especially in europe have gone straight down in the first quarter and i don t know if you have been thinking about or does it make sense to to do some refinancing or if you have maturities coming up that could lower your interest expense in reaction to that thomas a kelly senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah chip on the term loan side i mean that s the debt we plan on repaying with our cash flow to delever so that wouldn t be a good thing to refinance right now and on the fixed rate side most of that debt is not callable so we re not really in a position to refinance that timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer yeah chip this is the result of decades of bad policy across almost every country in europe right so hopefully this doesn t come to united states anytime soon this is it s almost remarkable that that real rates are negative right nominal rates might still be a touch positive real rates are negative it s unbelievable chip dillon vertical research analyst it is but if you are in a period where you have to borrow money there is that silver lining that you re not paying that much but that s not what we hear yet timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer but listen this is exactly what we did when we finance the signode acquisition tom would tell you if you whether you can see it in the annual report or not you look at we borrowed 8 and 10 year money under 3 unsecured just it s remarkable that i wouldn t lend money myself at that rate chip dillon vertical research analyst you re not alone on that one hey i don t think you gave us a split between europe proper and the middle east in that segment if you did i apologize for missing it do you have that timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer on volume yeah i said europe was up 4 5 and the middle east was down 2 chip dillon vertical research analyst all right and then lastly i know it s still early in the year but you look at the array of projects you have coming on and they re all coming on this year is it could we see next year s capex come down or said differently do you see visibility into certain areas i mean you mentioned brazil has some slack but that might change in the next year or two i mean should we expect to see more start ups next year in the bev cans space around the world by you timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer yeah listen my hope is one of the nice things about having the real privilege to run a company like crown is the opportunity and it s a it is a real privilege so my hope is that that number is not going to come down that we re going to continue to have opportunities and i think the exciting thing now globally in beverage cans just giving the given the high recycle recyclability of the product and the high recycled content that goes into the can sheet the opportunities look really promising so i think the answer is you re not going to see capital come down we re going to continue to have opportunities and we re going to continue to build a business and we re going to have an industry that continues to build over time here it s a pretty good time to be in beverage cans chip dillon vertical research analyst i hear you thank you timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question will come from gabe hajde you have an open line gabe hajde wells fargo analyst good morning tim and tom thank you for taking the question thomas a kelly senior vice president and chief financial officer good morning gabe hajde wells fargo analyst as george stated halfway through the call lot of questions have already been asked but if you could give us any sense for i know it s early in the season but any flooding impact to north american food plantings or discussions from customers that orders maybe a little bit later just because things got in the ground late timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer no i don t i don t you know from a lot of the products nothing is going into the ground yet right so this flooding will happen before the planting season and hopefully i can t talk about this with 100 specificity but hopefully the water recedes and the ground dries enough so they can get into the field and do the planting but we have not heard anything yet gabe hajde wells fargo analyst okay and maybe i ll try to take one last stab at the question in americas bev profitability when i look at ebitda margins i think they went from mid 19s to something in the mid 16s there are a couple issues in 2018 with higher transport cost and as you pointed out sourcing cans can you parse out for us or sort of help us understand what in your mind justifies putting more capital to work there from an ebitda perspective or how you look at it timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer the other big thing that happened in 18 versus 17 if you re looking at margins was a lot of 20 increase in the cost of aluminum so the denominator effect on a one for one pass through just in percentage terms reduces the margin not the absolute margin so yeah i m probably going to stay away from you re asking me to justify yes or no and putting capital on our business is making 16 versus 19 i think we ve been pretty clear that where we re at now and keep in mind our americas beverage includes latin america right so and we ve been more than happy to expand the businesses in mexico and brazil over the last several years and we ve been hesitant to do the same in north americas which leads you to understand that those margins are different in those geographies not a whole lot different but different enough that we ve been unwilling to put more capital in the us until we can reasonably restore margins in the u s to a level we like gabe hajde wells fargo analyst got it thank you tim one last one trying to take a different angle at the beverage can shipments they were stronger here in the fourth and the first quarter which are seasonally smaller can you do you have any from your vantage point any visibility as to if this is customers trying to better plan coming into the summer season or if it s some of these less sort of seasonally sensitive products that are being successful maybe sparkling water something like that timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer no i think it s as i answered the answer to adam s question i think we ve been seeing great momentum in a lot of the non alcoholic categories other than csd for the last several years we saw it all through last year but last year the big beer guys were down early in the year and they seem to have recovered and or stopped the slide in q4 and q1 so you re starting to see the other categories that performance come through the overall cmi data and i think that ll continue i think the promotions the beer guys are running the adequate promotions to continue to push the product and while the imports from mexico especially across the one label are doing continue to do exceptionally well the u s guys are doing a better job of maintaining their share and driving more volume allowing the growth in sparkling and energy to come to the top gabe hajde wells fargo analyst got it thank you good luck timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question will come from edlain rodriguez of ubs your line is open edlain rodriguez ubs analyst thank you good morning guys thomas a kelly senior vice president and chief financial officer good morning timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer good morning edlain rodriguez ubs analyst tim one quick one for you on signode i mean you ve talked about that the competitive pressure in the u s and your unwillingness to lower prices so how does that get resolved is it a question of demand is going to have to pickup where everyone want to be willing to raise prices so how does that get resolved in your view timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer well i think like any other competitive situation there is some business you re prepared to leave and there are some business you re not prepared to leave so you react to that and there will be other opportunities in the future but we are it is a i m not sure we showed you at the analyst day the revenues by product line by geography but it s so diverse that we don t get overly concerned from product to product across geography from quarter to quarter we re trying to run a business and have a policy that makes sense for the long term so it gets resolved by growing the business in other areas we re having an opportunity to recover what may have been lost a quarter ago or a year ago edlain rodriguez ubs analyst okay and as a follow up to that in terms of this unexpected strength you saw in europe like is it prebuy i mean are you able to tell at all what what s going on timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer yeah i don t think it s pre buy it just i think the demand was stronger than we expected and what i don t know is how weak they were in q1 last year in europe but they did better than expected and they did better than we expected and from our expectation and had to do as i said earlier just the macro news coming out of europe doesn t sound great and they were remarkably strong compared to that macro news and it looks like they re going to remain pretty firm throughout the year so i we will have to endeavor to understand some more but again i know i said it earlier i know it could be a little frustrating for you to hear it again all of these things the business is so diverse and the cost of the product to the customer is so small relative to the product they re protecting that volumes swings plus or minus don t necessarily move the income number plus or minus anywhere near the same ratio as you would expect in cans edlain rodriguez ubs analyst okay thank you very much timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question will come from brian maguire of goldman sachs you have an open line brian maguire goldman sachs analyst hey good morning timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer hi brian brian maguire goldman sachs analyst thanks for taking my question i had a two part question on aluminum sheet supply one just was there any impact in 1q from some of the 4q issues that you and others in the industry talked about and then sort of on a different note you talked about even be fairly compensated from your customers for capital you put in place some of the aluminum sheet guys particularly north america are talking the same language these days about needing to raise price in the market there being tight just wondering if you could remind us how those contracts are structured is that pass through to the customer or do you just pass through the raw aluminum price any kind of concern you might have about supply agreements for aluminum sheet and price increases there timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer so the issue that we faced in q4 with the sheet quality is behind us as we think about being fairly compensated yeah i was an aluminum guy i feel worse than i do as a can guy and the customers sort of beating our brains in and we ve been beating the aluminum guys brains in for 25 years and if i was an aluminum guy i d say i want to be fairly compensated as well and so the ingot prices quoted on the lme that that is what it is their margin to convert ingot to can sheet or end stock or tab stock is the negotiating point certainly in north america and for much of much of europe and many jurisdictions around the world these are strong pass throughs that we have with our customer base you always worry about the relative cost differential between your product and a product in another substrates but we re on the right side of the environmental argument right now and then there are some there are several customers that buy aluminum directly and we just tole the metal for them into can so i m less concerned about price right now i don t know what it takes for the aluminum guys to be happy with returns certainly if they double the price that s a problem for everybody but i don t think they re going to double the price i think they ve got some other percentage in mind i d be in the longer term certainly in the near term crown is pretty well fixed with supply i don t know how the others are fixed right now one of the big mills in tennessee went down for can sheet they re going to do auto stock and so supply is another issue just given the tariff situation and the tariff situation is not something that s sustainable just given the amount of aluminum that needs to come into the country to deal with domestic supply or domestic demand needs and not an issue for crown right now but longer term that needs to be resolved brian maguire goldman sachs analyst yeah i guess like my question is along the lines of if we are in this new period with like as george put across we haven t seen in 30 years the whole supply chain needs to react and do you think there is enough spare of capacity in aluminum sheet today to absorb that or do they need to put more capital to work and be compensated for it timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer yeah the answer is there s not enough capacity especially with the tennessee mill to going into auto there s not enough can capacity sheet capacity in the united states and we would certainly love to put them to put more have them put more capacity in just like our customers would like us to put more capacity in and it comes down to economics and so we all have to our problems are our problems and their problems are their problems and so we all have to manage our own problems and but you re right i mean the the question behind your question is the right question it just who is going to get there first and how are we going to make sure everybody is properly rewarded for the efforts and risks they re taking brian maguire goldman sachs analyst makes sense just last one from me i noticed some of the trade periodicals are reporting there was a probably a small pet food can plant in the uk that of all things is converting to plastic pouches and it did cite you as being one of the suppliers there just wanted to if you re expecting an impact from that or there could be some other customers you pickup but is that factored into your outlook for european food cans volume this year timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer yeah it s not a big number a little interesting in that they re going to go from a sustainable product to a pouch and so we ve talked about recyclability and so a pet bottle has some recyclability characteristics to it not like the can but it has some a pouch has none multi layer with all kinds of other contaminants in it it s pure trash so a little interesting that a food company would make that switch in an environment like europe right now where sustainability in the environment is top of mind for everybody if i was the beverage i was one of the beverage companies i want to know why they re not attacking the food companies the same why they are attacking the beverage company so but it s a small impact on us brian maguire goldman sachs analyst okay sounds good appreciate it timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question will come from neel kumar of morgan stanley you have an open line neel kumar morgan stanley analyst hi good morning thomas a kelly senior vice president and chief financial officer good morning timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer good morning neel kumar morgan stanley analyst with your contract renegotiations you ve obviously talked about getting benefits of pricing but if there have been any other terms you re looking to get improvements then like customer order patterns or freight timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer yeah so without going into detail the answer is yes neel kumar morgan stanley analyst okay and then i was just wondering in terms of your working capital expectations for the year are they still set to be flattish and what generally drove the 120 million working capital build in the first quarter is that just seasonal and in line with your expectations thomas a kelly senior vice president and chief financial officer yes we would expect the number to be flat for the year the build this year was more or less in line with last year that s not all working capital there is also the difference between for example cash interest and interest expense in there and some other things taxes versus cash tax but large leases the seasonal working capital build that we typically see plus some from signode had a little bit in the first quarter as well neel kumar morgan stanley analyst okay and then just lastly i guess versus your expectations coming into the year is your guidance for 2019 a little bit more back half weighted than you anticipated just because of weaker fx and some of the plant start ups or is it generally in line with your expectations timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer i think we characterized in february the performance this year would be stronger in the back half of the year versus the front half due to currency which was going to hit q1 and q2 and the start up the big start up costs in the beverage business in europe in q1 and a little bit more in q2 so that s kind of in line the only maybe we brought down internally our expectations for the second quarter just to touch just because currencies moved a little bit lower but we feel pretty strongly we can recover that in the back half neel kumar morgan stanley analyst thank you timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer thank you operator our last question will come from mark wilde of bank of montreal you have an open line mark william wilde bmo capital markets analyst yeah just a two quick follow ons tim one can you just give us a sense of kind of how we might think about sort of cadencing and comps for that middle eastern business for the balance of the year and then also on signode i recall about a year ago you saying you felt pretty good about kind of growth prospects for the first couple of years for signode because you thought a lot about was kind of dialed in and then you re talking about 2 or 2 5 growth here in 19 that doesn t seem like a real big growth number to me timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer so middle east i think we re generally going to have a flattish year so as i said volumes plus or minus 1 and i think we re going to see that flatten out in q2 through the balance of the year and income performance similar maybe plus or minus 2 million or 3 million versus the prior year so no big moves like we saw last year and then on signode at the risk of disagreeing with you i m going to disagree with you mark william wilde bmo capital markets analyst okay timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer so for a business that has roughly 2 5 billion in revenue or you spend 30 million in capital 2 to 2 5 growth is pretty good right i mean historically in the can industry if we had 2 or 2 5 growth we were doing back flips we are always thrilled we re kind of in this iphone world now where if things don t go up 10 every week somehow that s a disappointment but i ll take 2 5 growth all day long in a business that has 90 free cash flow conversion because it has very little capital requirement and then to the point where we can supplement it with bolt on or several years now something perhaps a little larger well that s a it s a nice position to be in from our standpoint i m happy to listen to why you re disappointed in that but i do disagree with that mark william wilde bmo capital markets analyst okay fair enough timothy j donahue president and chief executive officer okay thanks mark so chris i think you said that was the last call so that the last question so that concludes the call and we thank all of you for joining us and we ll speak to you again in july bye now operator thank you speakers and that concludes today s conference call thank you all for participating you may now disconnect duration 72 minutes call participants thomas a kelly senior vice president and chief
