nouriel roubini is not known for his optimism a perennial permabear who bears the moniker dr doom roubini is rarely sanguine that said he correctly called the housing bubble in the lead up to the global financial crisis and his analysis while rarely bullish has shown remarkable accuracy over the years so when roubini talks it s well worth a listen with that in mind we spoke with him to get his take on a number of market phenomena including the crypto craze the current state of monetary policy and global growth and more below is a lightly condensed and edited transcript of our discussion cfa institute dr roubini when you spoke with us in 2015 roughly six years after the financial crisis the focus was unconventional monetary policy and how it had yet to deliver a robust global recovery how have your views evolved since then nouriel roubini since 2015 the global economy has gone through periods of expansion where growth is positive and accelerating and periods of a slowdown where growth is decelerating there were two risk episodes one was august september 2015 and then the other one was january and february 2016 in both episodes there were worries about china and in the second episode there were also worries about us growth stalling signaling a slowdown in europe brexit worries and oil prices falling and in each one of those two episodes there was a short lived yet quite significant global equity market correction associated with a slowdown then we re in an expansion then a slowdown again in the first half of 2016 and then starting in the middle of 2016 with some of the clouds and worries about the us china oil bad policy impacts of brexit once those clouds were removed for a year and a half or two the global economy was growing in an expansion the year 2017 was truly one of global expansion when there was a synchronized acceleration of growth in the us europe japan most emerging markets but then last year that expansion became less synchronized the us and china were still growing relatively robustly but europe and the eurozone japan a bunch of emerging markets were fragile this recap brings us up to 2019 which is still likely to be a year of positive growth but i would call it a synchronized slowdown most major regions of the world are now slowing down some of them just towards potential but many of them like the eurozone may actually start sputtering towards something weaker than their level of potential economic growth so the good news might be that we don t have a global recession but since 2015 maybe we ve had only a period of 18 to maximum 24 months of a true global expansion from the middle of 2016 to the middle or first half of 2018 and since then it has been periods of mediocre growth or slowdown and now we are in this kind of late stage of the global cycle cfa institute was one of the founders of the systemic risk council shortly after the global financial crisis since then some systemic protections were put in place but others have been walked back what is your take let s begin by acknowledging that since the global financial crisis some of the risks that were in traditional financial institutions like banks have been reduced there is overall more liquidity more capital less leverage traditional bank depositors are safer now after reforms were implemented to limit the risk taking behavior of the regulated financial institutions but two things have happened that may be an element of concern over time one as you pointed out the regulatory pendulum is swinging back to say we over regulated after the global financial crisis and now we should reduce some of these regulations that process is ongoing in the united states with the trump administration there have been stages in the dodd frank legislation and regulation that suggest giving more leeway even to regulated financial institutions to take more risk and two the last crisis was a problem of excessive leverage in the household sector subprime and other mortgages and banks this time around they re beginning to see some excesses in the corporate sector and some of the risks have moved away from more regulated banks to less regulated or unregulated financial institutions so called shadow banks my concern is that now the pendulum may be going too far in the direction of light regulation and relying excessively on market discipline over time if and when there is a turnaround at some point in that credit cycle credit excesses may put a wide range of financial institutions at risk where specifically do you see credit building up dangerously well excessive debt certainly is present in the corporate sector these excesses manifest themselves in three different ways the rise of leveraged loans and covenant lite is one such area of potential risk the second area is that the significant buildup of high yield junk bonds and the pricing of those junk bonds in terms of spread is maybe too low compared with their potential riskiness and three even in investment grade now there is this phenomenon of fallen angels firms that used to be high grade but have had a deterioration in their financial condition and their rating is falling toward the lower end of that high yield borderline with the risk of downgrade to even below investment grade to high yield junk and the pricing again is not reflected in the fact that previously high grade firms are not looking at high grade now the optimists say that debt metrics for the corporate sector are healthy debt servicing ratios are low because both short and long rates have gone up but only gradually and people say the profitability of the corporate sector is still high and growth is still for the us somehow above potential gdp growth is 2 to 2 5 depending on how you predict it so as long as the economy continues to grow and profits are decent the debt servicing problems are not going to be severe this optimism may be justified right now but what if there are some shocks a slowdown of growth say or a slowdown of profitability or a widening of credit spreads for example spreads widening can take markets by surprise like it did in the beginning of 2016 when high yield spreads went from 300 to 900 in a matter of months or what happened with the leverage loans in the fourth quarter of 2018 then suddenly something that looked sustainable under one set of financial economic conditions becomes less sustainable we are not yet in the last inning of that credit re leveraging in the corporate sector but it is the beginning of a significant buildup of vulnerability should an economic slowdown occur it would hurt the corporate debt space a lot in my opinion we re starting to enter a more dangerous zone here speaking of potential vulnerabilities are you concerned about increasing indexation in the markets do you see any systemic implications arising out of such investment approaches index driven investments displacing active management is in my view positive it has been widely documented that most of the time active managers underperform on a long term basis net of fees personally i have most of my investments in these index funds that are very low cost weighted average fee of 0 10 per year so why should i pay 1 to 1 5 or 2 plus 20 for stuff that actually doesn t give me over time any real outcome many of these investments are essentially leverage beta that is why many small investors and even sophisticated ones are going in this direction furthermore even if there was an economic downturn that leads to dangerous significant correction i don t know whether passive investors will be more impulsive than active investors in trying to sell out of their positions you could even argue that some of the passive investors may have more inertia passive investors tend not to time the market and i would say are less likely to exacerbate the market cycles some are concerned by the price discovery risk posed by the proliferation of passive investments my answer is there s a lot of passive investment but there are enough active managers active analysts and other activists these have a clear motivation so i don t yet see this trend towards passive investment as either having a real systemic risk or something that impacts price discovery too much now in the credit space there is a phenomenon that has been pointed out by the imf bis and others that says we ve had massive debt issuance both private and public sector these instruments don t tend to be traded on exchanges they tend to be illiquid and over the counter and so the last three years there has been a growth of specialist credit focused funders that specialize in direct lending should there be a threat in the credit market then suddenly say high yield or leverage loans spread widened if many people were to dump this credit fund then you could have the equivalent of a bank run meaning suddenly there are firms that must sell these assets in an illiquid market further depressing the price of underlying securities that leads to further credit spread widening and can cause systemic damage if a bunch of them going belly up another concern is that the underlying is highly illiquid but passive funds typically offer their investors immediate liquidity so you can sell out of your position as if it was a bank account it s more like the repetition of something that looks like the maturity mismatch of traditional banks so that s an area that in terms of systemic risk combined with the mis pricing of some of these credit instruments could be a source of stress if and when the credit cycle turns around are there segments of the market that bring out your inner dr doom are there any self evident market assumptions out there that are illusory well i always try to be a realist i m neither negative pessimist nor optimist i apply a reasonably sophisticated analysis to what s going on in the world and the market then try to get it right and of course nobody is going get it right all the time are we close to a recession now there is a lot of concern out there now 10 years after the crisis that the typical us cycle does not last for decades my answer to that is expansions don t die a natural death australia may be an exception with positive growth now for 25 years usually expansions end because of economic or financial vulnerabilities exacerbated by a variety of policy mistakes we are probably not going to have a global recession this year but there is a buildup of excessive debt in the us and it s not just corporate in the us there is also a buildup of household debt including student loans and auto loans and even housing is showing some weakness given the rise in mortgage rates and changes in tax laws that make housing investment less beneficial and then there is also buildup of debt across the world for example i am keeping an eye on chinese private debt real estate lending as well as state and local government some emerging markets are highly leveraged either in the private and or public sector and in europe we still have some countries where public debt if there was another economic downturn could be a source of significant stress and the first country that comes to mind is italy its government is pursuing populist policies that will eventually lead to recession the debt dynamic may become unsustainable as well globally there is too much private and public debt both foreign and domestic we are lucky that although the leverage is high the debt servicing ratios appear manageable due to low interest rates however the process of policy normalization has started and interest rates may gradually go higher and even if some government bond yield offerings remain low the credit spread for public and private assets can start widening this can take place suddenly if the market gets nervous about economic fundamentals or geopolitical risks so slowly slowly we may be building up the seeds of the next economic downturn picking the exact time when the crisis will hit is almost impossible but we don t live in a safe world we ve kicked the can down the road in many ways one could argue central bankers kicked the proverbial can down the road in the past decade what policy advice would you give them straight after the crisis i was sympathetic and in favor of ben bernanke s stance on market policies because without these the crisis of 2008 09 could have evolved into great depression 2 0 remember that in the absence of monetary or fiscal stimulus the stock market crash of 1929 led to the great depression when thousands of banks were allowed to fail bernanke and his fellow central bankers learned this lesson and i think their actions including huge unconventional monetary stimulus when policy rates went to zero was necessary fiscal stimulus was necessary as was the policy of supporting illiquid but solvent financial institutions however now we are dealing with the legacy of these actions like the buildup of private and public debt we spoke about earlier although low inflation rates may allow the process of policy rate normalization to be very gradual the sheer amount of debt makes the global economy vulnerable to a severe crisis in summary central banks have not used the years of the recovery too effectively as the saying goes the best time to fix the roof on the house is when the sun shines so that it will be safe when the next storm hits vulnerabilities in the system are currently hidden and will emerge if and when the next economic downturn occurs bitcoin and cryptocurrencies grew out of distrust for central bankers you recently expressed strong views on this subject well i m an expert of asset bubbles and of financial crisis i ve studied so many historical bubbles i wrote a whole book crisis economics on bubbles and their busts i know one when i see one and of course knowing when there is a real bubble it s a long and complicated story but to me the whole crypto space is one of assets that are not really money they re not really a currency they re not a scalable means of payment they re not as stable in terms of store of value and what happened especially in 2017 when the price of bitcoin went from 2 000 all the way to 20 000 by the end of the year to me had all the features of a bubble especially telling was that by the second half of 2017 there were millions of people who didn t know anything about finance or portfolio investments driven by fomo or the fear of missing out buying bitcoin and all these other s tcoins to me it looked like an exponential parabolic bubble that s why i became very vocal towards the end of 2017 and guess what that bubble started to burst because there was no real fundamental value on these assets then even bitcoin since the peak has lost almost 85 of its value and that s the best one because thousands of these s tcoins were created as scams and have lost almost all of their value the top 10 cryptocurrencies excluding bitcoin the average loss of value since the peak has been between 92 and 93 this was to me the mother and the father of all bubbles and like every bubble it went out of control and then went bust and i was confident enough i was right that this was a bubble i did the us senate banking testimony with a 40 page paper calling cryptocurrency out for what it is and i was very vocal on twitter against this army of people who were totally delusional pleased to say i got this bubble right i looked at the three most popular tweets in your twitter feed expecting they would focus on your work on economic crises but your hottest posts relate to cryptocurrencies there s a lot of passion in this space does that give you any pause well i engage on twitter and i also have attended many of these crypto or blockchain conferences i met some of these individuals and i must say i ve never seen in my life people who on one side are so arrogant in their views who are total zealots and fanatics about this new asset class while at the same time completely and totally ignorant of basic economics finance money banking central banking monetary policy they want to reinvent everything about money but most of them are absolutely totally clueless the ratio between arrogant and ignorant is astounding i have never seen such a gap in my life these are fanatics some of them like criminals zealots scammers carnival barkers insiders who are just talking their book 24 7 there is an element of excess in every bubble but the typical bubble is an outgrowth of some technological evolution that maybe changes the world for the better the internet was in a bubble in the late 1990s but it was a real thing but valuations of many internet related stocks were sky high prices crashed and dot coms went bust but the internet kept on growing billions of people used it and it has changed the world cryptocurrency as a technology has absolutely no basis for success and the mother of all bubbles is now bust twitter and in person interactions with the fans of cryptocurrencies made me stronger and more secure in my belief was there one specific cryptocurrency mania episode that stands out in the fall of 2017 when the bubble was in full swing literally anybody i knew even random people in the street would stop me and the first thing they would say are you going to be part of the crypto movement should i buy bitcoin this was a typical late bubble behavior when some unsophisticated investors who are total suckers hear about the bubble they don t even know what it is that s normal fear of missing out and they jump on the bandwagon having no clue and the insiders took complete advantage of these suckers at prices of 20 000 per bitcoin and similar junk millions of people lost their shirts buying at the peak only to lose 80 to 90 of their investment in the next 12 months when you see these sucker investors in this case i call them the retail suckers get into this fomo frenzy then you know this bubble is about to burst so i saw it coming even in terms of the timing of it the saving grace of cryptocurrencies is that unlike other bubbles that exploded and led to some sort of a systemic crisis this asset class was relatively small unfortunately lots of suckers lost their shirts but it doesn t have any systemic implications what are some bubble spotting tools what does your crisis analysis framework involve it s a combination of a scientific approach and an art i ve been studying bubbles and asset and credit bubbles and their busts and financial crisis for 30 years now you have to separate say a student debt problem from a corporate problem from a household debt problem from a banking problem from the problems of non bank financial institutions or countries this gives you the basis for assessing the vulnerability to a currency crisis banking crisis payments crisis student debt crisis corporate or household issues each one of them is different depending on the country the situation the excesses can be one sector or the other with multiple feedback loops there is of course a huge body of academic literature which i have contributed to like many others on how to model the buildup of these financial vulnerabilities throughout history we had thousands of empirical case studies of crises of all types everything i learned over 30 years i put in crisis economics where i begin by stating that crises are not black swans rather i call crises white swans what did i mean by that my good friend and a brilliant thinker nassim taleb wrote black swan about the event that comes from the extreme tail of the distribution and cannot be predicted in advance but that everyone believes was explainable after the fact but for me financial crises are not tornadoes or earthquakes that escape prediction financial crises are instead more like hurricanes that develop from a buildup of economic and financial vulnerabilities and policy mistakes that eventually reach a tipping point a minsky moment when a buildup of excess debt and credit lead to excessive risk taking the behavior of many participants in the system leads to a buildup of both asset prices and a credit bubble that gets out of control at some point shocks occur and it is very hard to predict which shock will be the one but eventually something will end the boom and the bubble will burst now getting it right in terms of the exact timing of the bust is not easy but that buildup of financial vulnerabilities and policy mistakes doesn t happen over six months usually it happens over a number of years so if you are monitoring these excesses you can see where there is a buildup of say housing and mortgage debt a bubble that is not sustainable so you can use a combination of theoretical models and empirical studies and then compare the buildup stages to other financial or credit bubbles that is where the art of it comes in addition to the science to make a reasonable assessment of whether we are in the fifth sixth or seventh inning of that buildup let s say investors do see some bubbles on the horizon they want to park their assets somewhere uncorrelated where should they look to diversify the point is that investors wish to avoid financial vulnerabilities on one hand they wish to stay invested but on the other they seek capital preservation should a significant downturn occur not just a 10 correction not even a 20 bear market but something worse savvy investors may be able to find ways to buy protection against extreme market drawdowns it might be sophisticated tail risk hedge funds that really try to provide the insurance against another global financial crisis but you pay a premium in insurance like payments for a long time to protect yourself against something that may come up only once every 10 12 or 15 years your friend nassim taleb has questioned whether the safe haven status of us treasuries is justified what s your take do investors have viable alternatives one important investor belief is that equities bear the market risk whereas bonds are assumed to be safe the economic history suggests and financial risks over the last few decades confirm that even sovereigns can default we have seen this in the emerging markets i wrote a whole book about that and now even some developed economies under certain conditions can be vulnerable to a debt crisis this means in the countries with an unsustainable level of public debt that government bonds are not necessarily a safe alternative to equities specifically in the us our fiscal trajectory doesn t look sound at all the budget deficit this year is likely to be a trillion dollars and rising over the next decade with the retirement of baby boomers this gap is likely to get even worse therefore our already high debt is going to get higher and higher in relative terms the us is still in better shape than say europe and japan public debt as a percentage of the economy in most of europe and japan is higher than in the us potential growth is lower and in the us like in japan you can monetize your debt while individual members of the eurozone like italy do not have their own currencies europeans can monetize debts across all members of the eu at the same time but not individually that is why i don t worry about the us fiscal climate in the short term and even during the global financial crisis us treasuries and dollar assets became the safe haven remember that while the ground zero of the global financial crisis was here the us government debt obligations were in relative terms perceived as safer than others however the us fiscal trajectory if you take a medium to long term horizon of say 10 years is not sustainable so while they re safe now the much needed change in fiscal policy that addresses the problem is unlikely given the lack of bipartisanship i worry that the us will only deal with this problem when the crisis strikes many years from now and it may take this kind of severe crisis to force politicians to address the problems i don t see this happening otherwise we have seen what market imposed discipline can do in ireland spain portugal and greece to force adjustments there has not yet been market discipline in the us plus the us dollar enjoys the privileged reserve currency status what that means is that this particular can will be kicked far down the road but the reckoning will eventually occur i don t expect this reckoning to take place in the next five years but given current trends give it 10 years even the us fiscal outlook will become unsustainable so despite very real longer term concerns in the short to medium term us debt will continue to offer some stability do you have other good news what capital market developments are you most excited about i think that one of the most positives things is that there is a technological revolution that will probably change the world it s a combination of artificial intelligence machine learning big data and the internet of things that is leading to a manufacturing revolution a fintech revolution a biotech revolution and potentially an energy revolution there are lots of major disruptions that are going to eventually increase productivity and create more goods and services in that context i would argue that the future of financial services has nothing to do with cryptocurrencies or so called blockchain technology the real revolution in financial services is fintech but fintech has nothing to do with crypto fintech is going be a combination of artificial intelligence and big data and the ubiquitous internet it will revolutionize payment systems credit allocation capital market functions insurance investment management financial advice etc so that s the good news the bad news is that these technological innovations are capital intensive this means if you are a venture capitalist you will do great if you are in the top 20 of distribution in terms of human capital plus skilled and educated ai will make you smarter you will be able to use these innovations to become more productive and make more money but if you are a low or even medium skilled worker or your job s blue collar then increasingly this technological revolution will threaten your prosperity therefore i fear that income and wealth inequality will be getting worse we can see this already in the backlash against trade against migration against globalization the big disruptions in the next 10 to 20 years are not going to be necessarily related to trade and globalization but to these technological disruptions unless we find a way to broaden the human capital through education we need to ensure that in the digital and ai economy most people thrive or face a severe populist backlash in certain sectors or parts of the world so i m a technological optimist these news tools will revolutionize many aspects of our lives so as consumers we re all going to benefit i am worried that as producers some people are not going to have income and jobs to benefit from the cheaper goods and services which will spark a lot of social unrest to conclude dr roubini knowing what you know now what advice would you give to your younger self one thing i see everywhere is a very low level of financial literacy most people don t know basic economics and lack basic finance skills most of those people who were asking me should i buy bitcoin did not even appreciate the difference between stocks and bonds or types of markets or the basics of credit and interest rates this has two unfortunate consequences first people don t save enough if you don t start saving when you re young you re not going have enough retirement money to live comfortably in a world where life expectancy is becoming longer and longer you have to start saving because social security is not going to be sufficient secondly when they do save people sometimes save in a reckless way they buy risky things they gamble they trade too much they go into stupid bubbles like bitcoin or the other fads of the day an unsophisticated retail investor should save as much as they can invest in a diversified portfolio of mostly index funds and leave it alone there is no reason to pay huge fees to hedge fund managers buy and hold equities with some allocation to liquid stuff and invest until you retire in a passive low cost index fund it doesn t take a lot of sophistication but most people don t do it so i wish there was a required basic course in college if not earlier in high school on financial literacy so that any young person knows it s important to save and invest in an intelligent way the stakes are high and if you make basic mistakes they will cost a lot down the line so that s what i would give as advice to anybody if you liked this post don t forget to subscribe to the enterprising investor all posts are

topshot a general view shows the financial district of lujiazui in shanghai early on june 23 2016 afp photo johannes eisele photo credit should read johannes eisele afp getty images a decade has passed since the start of the great recession the momentous downturn that shook the global economy as none had since the 1930s in the intervening years the world has experienced a slow but consistent recovery economic dangers however are now apparent at every turn a new global debt crisis trade wars between great powers and a chinese slowdown the imf has cut its world growth forecast for 2019 to 3 5 per cent compared to 3 9 per cent in july 2018 citing lower growth in both advanced and emerging economies and the rising likelihood of a negative economic shock some market analysts are now warning of a possible global recession this year far earlier than most have anticipated but how much danger are we in and what would be the economic and political consequences of a new crash on the surface it is unclear what explains the new mood of pessimism in our interconnected world global growth is intimately linked to the fortunes of the largest economies most of which have enjoyed sustained recoveries since the 2008 crisis since 2012 chinese gdp has grown at an annual rate of 6 8 per cent weaker than in the pre crisis period growth peaked at 14 per cent in 2007 but still strong enough to support the growth of the chinese middle class and stimulate the economies of its major trading partners the us recovery has been slow by historic standards but growth in 2018 2 9 per cent was buoyed by donald trump s tax cuts which dramatically inflated corporate profits japan s growth has been low but stable unsurprising in view of its rapidly falling population which declined by 449 000 in 2018 only the eurozone has continued to struggle growing by just 1 8 per cent in 2018 but all is not as it seems the us recovery has been highly unstable and unequally distributed with loose monetary policy interest rates are currently 2 to 2 25 per cent required to sustain unremarkable growth rates which have varied by almost five percentage points between the best and worst performing states real average american wages in 2018 had the same purchasing power as 40 years ago meanwhile corporate debt has reached a record level 45 per cent of gdp and stock markets still appear overvalued

rail airports and road upgrades which has also underpinned growth in economies dependent upon chinese demand for their exports such as germany brazil russia and south africa once heralded as part of the insurgent brics economies are all growing at annual rates of 1 5 per cent or less according to recent figures germany avoided recession by the narrowest of margins with zero growth in the final quarter of 2018 while italy has returned to negative growth in the uk growth last year was the weakest since 2012 and output fell by 0 4 per cent in december world growth was buoyant in 2016 and 2017 with more than three quarters of the world growing at or above trend rates andy haldane the bank of england s chief economist told me but there was a notable slowing during 2018 today more of the world is running below trend than above this slowing has been strikingly simultaneous across the us the euro area and china private debt meanwhile has resurged in many countries notably in china australia canada and some of the nordic states and many emerging markets are now in debt distress meaning they have defaulted or cannot service their debts without broad sustainable growth risks accumulate and uncertainty rises as alfie stirling chief economist at the new economics foundation told me almost by definition shocks are caused by uncertainty over events rather than by events themselves the global economy s problem is less the inevitable downturn in the business cycle but the array of forces that may upset a delicate equilibrium these can be distilled into five categories financial instability in china global monetary tightening rising interest rates and the end of quantitative easing or qe the unresolved eurozone crisis a shock to global trade and rising private debt in the developed world first china the myth is that the country has grown rapidly by pursuing a model of export led growth based on cheap labour and an undervalued currency this is the story that the us tells itself in order to justify its trade war with china the trump administration has so far imposed 250bn of tariffs on chinese goods prompting beijing to retaliate in kind but since the 2008 financial crisis exports have not been the main contributor to chinese growth instead growth has been sustained by an extraordinary keynesian stimulus programme worth almost 20 per cent of gdp as well as investing heavily in public infrastructure projects the chinese government has promoted private lending by state backed institutions the corporate debt to gdp ratio now stands at 160 per cent while chinese households have also hugely increased their borrowing household debt as a share of gdp reached a record high of 50 per cent in 2017 this bodes ill for the country s financial stability a fall in house prices and mortgage lending could lead property bubbles to implode slower growth could also tip highly indebted chinese corporations into bankruptcy and threaten the solvency of some lenders though the state could intervene to rescue them it has fewer resources to draw on than in 2009 any attempt to address the country s financial bubble means reduced lending which constrains growth for decades the communist party has maintained a tacit bargain with the emerging middle class authoritarian rule in return for annual economic growth of at least 7 per cent a financial crisis would hurt the government politically but ongoing stagnation could be more dangerous as french historian alexis de tocqueville observed in his classic 1856 work the old regime and the revolution a text much studied by china s leaders revolutions frequently occur when growth falls below rising expectations in the trade off between financial stability and growth china is likely to continue to favour the latter and when the bubble does eventually burst while the chinese financial system is relatively insulated some parts of the the world will feel the effects indeed the uk as host to the hong kong and shanghai banking corporation hsbc is more exposed than almost any other economy but the main impact of any crisis in china would be the global chain reaction it sets off because it is the engine of growth for so many other economies coupled with a us recession an eventuality that most analysts consider likely over the next three years events in china could lead to a new global downturn as adam tooze the economic historian and author of crashed told me the hopes of the west continue to rest on beijing pulling off a stunning exercise in macroeconomic juggling while donald trump hurls knives at them the second economic trend to worry about is monetary tightening after the 2008 crash interest rates were reduced to record lows while central banks sought to boost demand through qe 10trn of new money was injected into the global financial system by purchasing government bonds but this year may herald the end of the post crash decade of easy money as interest rates are increased across the world and qe is unwound perhaps the most significant consequence would be unmanageable debt in the global south it is an obvious truth albeit rarely stated that the only countries to have experienced acute debt distress are those that borrow in a foreign currency or lack control over their own monetary policy the former category mainly emerging economies in south asia eastern europe and latin america could be severely affected by monetary tightening as capital flows out of these economies and back to the us in search of higher returns another consequence will be rising volatility in equity markets where stocks and shares are exchanged the market capitalisation to gdp ratio the total value of all publicly traded stocks relative to gdp suggests that us stocks remain overvalued even after a correction in december 2018 and increasing volatility suggests that investors know it as long as the tune of easy money continues to play these worries are far from most minds but when the music stops equity markets in many developed economies could endure what some would regard as a long overdue correction the third cause for concern is the sick man of the world the eurozone growth has long been anaemic in the currency area with the outlook for greece and italy particularly grim in the absence of control over their monetary policy there are only two ways for these countries to escape the debt trap a major state backed stimulus programme or internal devaluation through cuts to wages and production costs germany the eurozone s hegemon has a strong preference for the latter its economic competitiveness is based on wage repression and a rigid approach to controlling inflation if we can do it why can t you germany asks the inconvenient truth of course is that the currency union makes this harder for southern european countries and easier for northern ones the euro makes german exports look cheap and greek ones look expensive acting as a huge economic boost to the former and a constraint on the latter the only sustainable and indeed fair way to deal with the divergence is to make major fiscal transfers the redistribution of income and wealth from north to south but political reality precludes this solution the german state and its allies in northern europe would block any continent wide pro growth reforms for fear of the inflationary consequences germany will also continue to veto anything that resembles debt mutualisation the sharing of sovereign debt across eu states as a result austerity will prevail stunting the southern european economies growth and immiserating their people without structural reforms that promote growth in these economies the disparity between north and south will only further widen over the long term if unaddressed this surely can only have one outcome the break up of the currency union itself the fourth ominous storm cloud for the world is the potential for a collapse in global trade because of growing protectionism most notably in the us and the uk this follows a decade of slowing global trade and investment flows which some have termed slowbalisation trade flows initially recovered healthily from the 2007 08 financial crisis but have fallen since from as much as 61 per cent of global gdp in 2011 to 58 per cent today but the real indicator of slowbalisation has been falling capital flows the cross border movement of money for trade and investment the period of financial globalisation between 1980 and 2007 saw global cross border capital flows increase three times faster than trade flows but between 2007 and 2017 these capital flows fell by 65 per cent financial globalisation has proven to be its own undoing rising financial instability culminating in the 2008 crisis and growing inequality in large parts of the global north have led to a backlash against all forms of global economic integration the fragmentation of globalisation and the subsequent reaction has fuelled the rise of populist movements and the resurgence of the radical left especially in this country and the us alongside the slowdown in china the imf has highlighted a disorderly brexit as one of the biggest threats to world growth in 2019 the same is true of an escalating trade war between the us and china were the us to impose new tariffs on chinese imports the slowing chinese economy would be further harmed while american growth would also fall perhaps tipping the country into an early recession and as the revolt against globalisation spreads few can predict where the next trade crisis will emerge finally private debt in the global north continues to pose a threat to financial stability steve keen an australian economist describes private debt as the elephant in the living room of the world economy in the us corporate debt is at an all time high of 45 per cent of gdp higher than during both the dot com bubble of 2000 and the housing bubble of 2007 ann pettifor a leading heterodox economist and one of the few to predict the last financial crash told me that margin debt debt used purely for speculative purposes has gone ballistic on the new york stock exchange a significant contribution to the financial crisis was the securitisation of us mortgage debt with ordinary mortgages transformed into complex financial securities used as collateral for further borrowing after the crisis the value of this market collapsed but risk soon spread to new sectors vindicating us economist hyman minsky s prediction that that which can be securitised will be securitised in the us last year the value of securities issued based on car loans credit card debt student loans and various other unsecured debt exceeded commercial and residential mortgage backed securities combined meanwhile australia and canada are experiencing what tooze calls unsustainable booms based on rising property prices that could collapse at any time when lending conditions tighten house prices may fall potentially creating overlapping financial crises in these economies while most of these risks are unlikely to trigger a global recession in 2019 the near term outlook for the world is bleak perhaps the greatest cause for concern is that when the next recession does arrive as it will we will be even less prepared than we were in 2008 monetary policy is already ultra loose uk interest rates stand at 0 75 per cent compared to 5 per cent before the crash and national debt levels have significantly risen reducing the space for fiscal stimulus public spending and tax cuts the risk is that in the event we hit an iceberg there aren t enough lifeboats to go around as economists are fond of saying this reflects a more profound problem the reason debt levels are still so high and interest rates so low is that the recovery from the financial crisis has been so weak gdp levels may have recovered but growth in investment productivity and wages has been dismal especially in the us and the uk more than at any point in previous history living standards have become detached from employment growth currently at an all time high in the uk if the recovery has been characterised by stagnant wages and productivity falling investment and rising poverty what will the next recession look like history teaches us that when the status quo only offers stagnation or decline voters will look for radical alternatives so far discontent has been largely channelled into increasing support for the populist right whose posturing disguises an essential respect for free market capitalism but as the sheen falls off the likes of donald trump and boris johnson defenders of the status quo face a far more worrying prospect the election of a cohort of leaders who identify as socialists the next recession may not be as large as 2008 but it could still represent a far greater rupture
federal reserve taking stock economic and financial market cross currents mean the federal reserve has adopted a more patient data dependent approach to monetary policy for 2019 after having raised rates systematically once a quarter through 2018 at present markets believe that the fed s neutral stance will eventually give way to policy easing with fed funds futures contracts nearly pricing in a 25 basis point rate cut by the summer of 2021 however we continue to believe that the next move is more likely to be an interest rate increase after all the economy is running strongly with little spare capacity this is generating rising wage pressures in the labour market which should keep consumer confidence and spending supported we hope that positive political sentiment regarding us china trade relations can be turned into a concrete deal in the next couple of months if it can this would be a major boost for the global economy broader inflation pressures are set to build too with gasoline prices now responding to higher oil costs while the pick up in worker pay and benefits is another contributing factor in an environment of decent economic performance and rising inflation pressures amidst hopefully decreasing trade concerns we believe the federal reserve will overcome its current reticence and hike rates 25 basis points late in the summer equities and gasoline prices bank of england it all depends on brexit by slashing its 2019 forecast the bank of england has made it pretty clear that it will remain on the sidelines for the time being but with wage growth rising rapidly the bank has kept the door to further tightening ajar everything depends on brexit though if a deal is approved and the uk leaves after perhaps only a short delay then a rate hike could come back into play a lot depends on how quickly the economy recovers the scale of the economic slowdown in the first quarter means august may be too early but a november rate rise is possible short article 50 extension 2 3 months unless a deal is agreed quickly no deal fears will quickly return as the extension draws to a close article 50 could be extended again but the ongoing cliff edge uncertainty means the chances of a 2019 rate hike would quickly fade long article 50 extension 9 12 months this would provide more of a reprieve for businesses and the temporary dip in uncertainty could tempt the boe into hiking rates over the summer again this relies on the economy rebounding and it s equally possible a long extension results in a prolonged pause at the bank of england five brexit scenarios people s bank of china targeting credit growth for private companies the chinese central bank pboc has started to support private companies january saw cny257 5 billion injected into private firms via the one year targeted medium lending facility tmlf this replaced a one year medium lending facility mlf injection of cny286 billion in december the more recent tmlf has an interest rate of 3 15 15 basis points lower we believe that the pboc will use the tmlf to replace the mlf in 2019 as it will take time for private companies to recover from the us china trade dispute even if there s a truce as expected the pboc also cut the reserve requirement ratio rrr in january by one percentage point we forecast three further rrr cuts this year if the economy continues to grow at a slower pace this will help soften interbank interest rates we no longer expect the pboc to cut the 7 day policy rate as the central government has made negative comments about a low interest rate policy we have also changed our view on and now expect it to hit 6 75 by the end of 2019 the change is based on the falling as well as a hopes of positive progress in trade talks usd cny and the dollar index bank of japan more of what doesn t work having spent many years printing money running negative interest rates targeting zero or negative bond yields and failing to make any notable impression on unrealistic inflation targets now is the time for the bank of japan to think of trying something a bit different instead the response to recent data weakness and concern that the japanese yen might start to appreciate again has been to warn of a return to measures that have so demonstrably failed to work in the past the four measures outlined by kuroda in an interview with the asahi shimbun were lower the negative short term rate cut the long term yield target back below zero percent buy more assets expand the monetary base which sounds like another way of saying option 3 with the momentum still ebbing from this economy there is a good chance that we see some or all of the policy measures suggested above though aside from a short term sentiment induced bounce we don t think markets will significantly respond to these measures and we don t think they will have any meaningful bearing on the boj s attempts to hit its inflation targets or stimulate growth japan s equity and bond markets out of sync norges bank still set to hike in march and probably again in the second half of 2019 despite the slowdown in global momentum over the past couple of quarters the norwegian economy remains solid an expected increase of around 10 in oil investment this year should partly offset the weaker external demand and inflation already running a touch above the 2 target will be further supported by rising wage growth and the fact that the norwegian krone has remained relatively weak we expect the norwegian central bank will follow through on its commitment to raise interest rates to 1 at the march meeting this will likely make the norges bank the only g10 central bank to raise interest rates in 1q however the norwegian economy is unlikely to remain entirely immune from global headwinds so while the nb is likely to continue to signal another hike in the second half of the year and we still think that is the most likely outcome future hikes are increasingly contingent on an improvement in the global outlook inflation has returned to target since the middle of 2018 the riksbank may not hike again this cycle with the swedish economy now clearly slowing inflation still anaemic and the global outlook worsening at the start of 2019 it looks increasingly like the riksbank s december hike could turn into a one and done the riksbank s current interest rate forecast implies another hike in the second half of 2019 and two more per year after that on past form the april meeting would likely see yet another downward revision the 11th since 2015 unless inflation picks up materially in the february and march figures but the february meeting showed policymakers may be shifting their stance a touch dropping a long standing reference to avoiding krona appreciation the swedish currency has actually depreciated by 10 over the past year and a half comments since the extremely weak january inflation figure also sought to downplay the likelihood of delaying the next rate hike so unless there is a further deterioration in the data over the next couple of months we may see a slightly more hawkish stance in april this would mean keeping the interest rate forecast intact though we still expect an announcement that qe reinvestments will continue at a reduced rate until the end of 2020 riksbank forecast for inflation and krona remains inconsistent swiss national bank still far from normalisation we do not expect a change in monetary policy at the next meeting of the swiss national bank on 21 march in fact we believe that monetary policy will remain unchanged for the foreseeable future the snb will probably maintain an ultra accommodative monetary policy at least until 2021 with the reference interest rate set at 0 75 while intervening when it deems it necessary on the foreign exchange market there are two reasons for this inflation is still low consumer price inflation stood at 0 9 in 2018 which is still low but the highest since 2018 with the fall in oil prices and the slowdown in economic activity inflation is expected to remain low throughout 2019 and most probably lower than in 2020 this should not prompt the snb to tighten monetary policy the swiss central bank is actually mainly worried about the evolution of the swiss franc at its last meeting it still considered the currency to be highly valued we believe that will still be the case at the march meeting indeed while in april 2018 the franc was trading at 1 20 the currency has since tended to appreciate and is now around 1 13 knowing the harm that the highly valued franc can do to the swiss economy the snb is seeking to avoid a strong appreciation at all costs the main policy rate of the snb will probably remain at 0 75 even longer if a recession looms in the united states and the eurozone by the end of 2020 swiss inflation bank of canada being patient over recent months the bank of canada has adopted a less hawkish tone the committee kept rates on hold back in october and for the time being it looks like policymakers will keep it that way that said we still expect the bank to hike rates at least once if not twice later in the year when it comes to economic fundamentals things look pretty good a strong jobs market should help support household activity while the prospects for canadian manufacturing look decent away from the energy sector add in the fact that core inflation looks set to stay around the 2 target and further rate hikes seem likely still our view on the bank of canada depends on three key factors the severity of any housing market downturn trade developments between the us and china in particular the potential impact on canadian exports to the us oil prices consumer spending growth slowed in 2018 but a decent jobs market makes for a better 2019 reserve bank of australia not so relaxed the australian economic story hasn t really changed bits of the economy namely the labour market continue to look in great shape though there s little wage inflation and it doesn t look as though that will change anytime soon the corporate sector is sending out mixed messages capital expenditure intentions remain steady but sentiment is falling and the housing market continues to decline although there are no signs of a rout if nothing else were changing the rba would probably continue to sit on its hands indicating that the next move in rates was up while also hinting strongly that nothing was likely to change for a very long time the most recent rba statement and supporting comments from rba governor philip lowe instead suggest that the risks to the economy are now broadly balanced and that the next move could therefore be up or down what has changed is probably the perception of the external economy with data from around the region including china taking a turn for the worse and exacerbated by things like the dalian port ban for australian coal bank bill futures have raced to price in the possibility of rate cuts this year we suspect this will not happen and that rates will instead stay where they are for even longer in the background the decline in 3m nyse usd libor and associated pass through to australian bank bill swap rates has done a lot of the rba s easing for them just as the initial increase took away any need to hike this could go on a while bank bill swap and usd libor ois spreads reserve bank of new zealand upside surprise after a run of surprisingly good data reality seems to have caught up with new zealand in recent months the big dip in the unemployment rate in 3q was partially revised away and partially reversed in 4q18 house price growth moderated and exports like the rest of the region slipped governor adrian orr has been circumspect about the economy for some time now the first paragraph of the february monetary policy statement says about all you need to know the official cash rate ocr remains at 1 75 percent we expect to keep the ocr at this level through 2019 and 2020 the direction of our next ocr move could be up or down like australia markets are taking more of a bet on rates going down than on going up but we suspect conditions would need to worsen substantially from here to warrant an actual cut this might be something to think about in the event of no trade deal between the us and china at the moment the signs are looking more promising so no cut and rates on hold for a prolonged time remains the most likely outcome new zealand implied 3m rates and cash rate this publication has been prepared by ing solely

and adjusted ebitda1 were in line with expectations given the typical seasonal slowdown in several of our businesses and the negative impact of lower activity and investments being made in our pipe coating business our annual 2018 results demonstrated the company s ability to deliver positive results from our diversified portfolio despite not having any contribution from a large pipe coating project and are aligned with expectations we communicated one year ago mr orr added future growth in earnings will be underpinned by the continued stability of our diversified base business particularly in north america and the strengthening of our backlog from the securing of projects that are now visible and are under bid the strengthening of the offshore capex cycle coupled with a

arrangement to acquire all of the shares of zcl composites inc zcl for 10 00 per share in cash and by way of a statutory plan of arrangement the price per share implies an aggregate fully diluted equity value for zcl of approximately 308 million zcl is north america s largest manufacturer and supplier of environmentally friendly fiberglass reinforced plastic underground storage tanks zcl has two plants in canada four in the us and one in the netherlands serving the fuel water wastewater and oil gas markets the arrangement will be considered by zcl shareholders on march 26 2019 and requires the approval of 66 2 3rd of the votes cast at the meeting subject to receipt of shareholder and court approval closing of the transaction is expected in early april 2019 shawcor has entered into a commitment letter with the toronto dominion bank and national bank of canada as co lead arrangers providing a us 500 million four year senior unsecured revolving credit facility the credit facility the credit facility will be used to fund the arrangement and replace shawcor s existing senior credit facility shawcor anticipates that a portion of the credit facility will be syndicated to other banks or financial institutions it is anticipated that the credit facility will be entered into prior to the end of the first quarter of 2019 on january 30 2019 the company gave notice to the senior note holders that it will repay on march 7 2019 the entire principal amount outstanding with a accrued interest approximately us 199 8 million and a make whole amount estimated at approximately us 5 2 million offshore guyana deepwater projects on october 4 2018 the company announced that its pipe coating division had been assigned work from saipem valued at approximately c 110 million to provide thermal insulation and anticorrosion coating services for the liza i and ii deepwater development projects located offshore guyana coating work under the liza i project commenced in march 2018 at shawcor s channelview texas facility and additional work will be completed at shawcor s veracruz mexico facility work on liza i is expected to be completed during the first quarter of 2019 coating work under the larger liza ii project which is conditional on a final investment decision or fid by the pipeline operator is expected to be executed at the veracruz and channelview facilities 1 1 outlook shawcor s financial performance is correlated with oil and gas infrastructure spending and the resultant demand for the company s products and services adjusted ebitda1 for the fourth quarter of 2018 was in line with expectations and reflected typical seasonal slowdowns in several of the company s businesses along with the ongoing investments in the pipe coating business for idle assets and project pursuit costs in preparation for the expected increase in activity in the second half of 2019 and beyond the fourth quarter saw continued momentum in north american demand for shawcor s products and services specifically in composite pipe technologies pipe coating products and integrity management field services full year 2018 results were slightly better than the expectations the company communicated a year ago based on the annualized adjusted ebitda1 run rate of the fourth quarter of 2016 2018 was a pivotal year as it demonstrated that the company can deliver profitable results on its diversified base business despite having no contribution from the core pipe coating business or a large pipe coating project the company expects that its operating results in the first half of 2019 will be negatively impacted by the continued lower pipe coating activity higher costs for idle assets and large project pursuits and a very soft winter drilling and completion season in western canada the company expects revenues to sequentially improve throughout 2019 particularly in the second half of the year and to deliver improved annual operating results over 2018 this expectation reflects stable demand throughout the year for the base business particularly in north america and increased activity in pipe coating in the second half of the year from international and offshore projects 1 ebitda and adjusted ebitda are non gaap measures and do not have standardized meanings under gaap and are not necessarily comparable to similar measures provided by other companies see section 6 0 reconciliation of non gaap measures for further details and a reconciliation of ebitda and adjusted ebitda the company believes that 2018 represented the bottom of the offshore global oil gas capex cycle and that this market is poised for consistent growth over the next several years the likelihood of large projects being sanctioned to replace production in the near to medium term is strengthening driven by several years of absent investment or short cycle investment prioritization in the industry now coming to an end as key reservoirs are no longer able to sustain peak production levels the increase in high decline rate shale production and geopolitical challenges which are affecting several important producing regions additionally the increased demand for greener technology will be supportive of investments in gas specifically lng the company continues to see demand growth in north america land markets and an increased level of activity in the international and offshore markets as evidenced in its current bids outstanding the company remains well positioned to capitalize on this continuing positive trend in project activity through its global footprint technology portfolio and execution history the company continued its strategic efforts to position itself as the partner of choice in the pursuit of several large projects which are characterized as greater than 100 million in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2018 the liza i ii awards representing approximately 110 million of work related to deep water development projects located offshore guyana provided further evidence that the low point in the offshore pipe coating cycle has been reached liza i and ii is a multi phase project and characteristic of the type of project planning that the company is seeing with greater frequency in an effort to reduce large project costs operators are engaging large global engineering procurement contracting epc companies who are utilizing standardized engineering approaches and selecting preferred suppliers to participate in the planning process significantly earlier than in the past this new contracting approach gives shawcor greater visibility and awareness on future possible project wins recently this same process was followed in an as yet unsanctioned offshore australia project where a conditional non binding letter of award was signed between the selected epc company and shawcor for a scope of work that is estimated at over 100 million in revenue for 2020 although the exact timing of when large projects are sanctioned is difficult to predict the company believes that there is still a strong likelihood that some of these projects will be sanctioned in 2019 and beyond because they are not directly linked to oil and gas commodity prices as they involve energy security or reservoir access considerations based on this the company believes that its diversified base business and expected higher pipe coating activity in 2019 will deliver improved operating results particularly in the second half of the year however the company has confidence to deliver stronger results in 2020 from the expected build in backlog in 2019 as confidence has increased that the investment in international projects will be sanctioned with a positive impact on the offshore pipe coating business shawcor continued its growth strategy of diversifying the base business through organic and inorganic initiatives investments in expanding the composite product offering both in operating envelope and geographic reach deployment of next generation inspection technology and capacity expansion in the automotive heat shrink market have been made in addition the company announced that it had entered into an arrangement agreement to acquire all of the shares of zcl composites inc north america s largest manufacturer and supplier of environmentally friendly fiberglass reinforced plastic underground storage tanks this inorganic investment is supported by long term fundamental drivers similar to those which support shawcor such as aging infrastructure and it leverages shawcor s material science expertise in advanced composite materials to provide customers with superior systems for both their conveyance and storage needs it further demonstrates shawcor s commitment to diversifying its portfolio and increasing its base business to provide a foundation for long term technology developments and profitable base business growth further detail on the outlook for the pipeline and pipe services segment by region and in the petrochemical and industrial segment is set out below pipeline and pipe services segment north america market demand in shawcor s north american pipeline segment businesses is closely tied to well completions and the build out of new and the repair replacement of old transmission pipeline infrastructure these activities drive the demand for small diameter pipe coating and joint protection composite pipe for gathering line applications octg pipe inspection and refurbishment and gathering line girth weld inspection it is expected that demand in north american land activity will continue in line with rig counts and wells completed particularly in the united states however the rate of growth will slow down in the first half of 2019 due to the lack of take away capacity in the permian basin and early indications that suggest a soft winter season in western canada and resume in the second half of 2019 as take away capacity in the permian is addressed through several transmission pipeline projects currently underway the increased breadth of the company s portfolio as well as the continued adoption rate of shawcor s composite pipe systems technology over traditional steel products is helping to absorb these slight headwinds in addition the company continues to experience strong demand for its pipe coating capabilities from increased activity in the gulf of mexico and larger diameter onshore transmission line projects which is improving the utilization of our u s based coating facilities pipeline and pipe services segment latin america the company continues to expect increased activity in the recently reactivated facilities in mexico and brazil related to the continued activity in the gulf of mexico and smaller offshore brazilian projects this is supported by the liza ii project that is now under contract which is expected to be executed in the company s veracruz facility and contribute positive results in the second half of 2019 pipeline and pipe services segment europe middle east africa and russia emar shawcor s emar pipeline region continues to be negatively impacted by reduced capital spending by national and international energy companies the company will continue executing work on the awarded contract to provide anti corrosion and concrete weight coatings related to an offshore qatar pipeline the company continues to pursue several large projects in the region that if won could provide significant work beyond 2019 pipeline and pipe services segment asia pacific the region s project activity will continue to be depressed due to the lack of offshore project investments the company is actively pursuing several large projects that are related to the development of gas reservoirs that could be awarded in 2019 in addition composite products have recommenced their penetration in the australian onshore market and are gaining traction in several other countries in the region as composites gain further acceptance petrochemical and industrial segment shawcor s petrochemical and industrial segment businesses continue to deliver solid revenue and operating income based on stable demand in the global automotive market and european and north american industrial markets these markets generally follow gdp activity however the segment is well positioned to capture the growing trend of electrification on automobiles with specified sealing water blocking and insulating systems along with customized application equipment for tier i assembly customers demand for wire and cable products continues to be strong and supply chain constraints for drawn wire from copper rods have eased from the third quarter of 2018 order backlog the company s order backlog consists of firm customer orders only and represents the revenue the company expects to realize on booked orders over the succeeding twelve months the company reports the twelve month billable backlog because it provides a leading indicator of significant changes in consolidated revenue the order backlog of 459 million as at december 31 2018 was above the 395 million order backlog as at september 30 2018 reflecting the inclusion of the liza ii project and other awards moving from bid to backlog in addition to the backlog the company closely monitors its bidding activity and the value of outstanding firm bids is over 1 0 billion up 160 million from last quarter due to increasing bidding activity for pipe coating in the offshore and international markets included in the firm bid is an as yet unsanctioned offshore australia project where a conditional non binding letter of award was signed between the selected epc company and shawcor for a scope of work that is estimated at over 100 million in revenue for 2020 the company is also working with customers on a number of other projects and the budgetary estimates at the end of the fourth quarter were almost 1 9 billion although the timing of these projects remains uncertain the company s bid and budgetary figures represent a diverse portfolio of opportunities to sustain and build the backlog through 2019 and beyond 2 0 consolidated information and results from

well as to determine compliance with debt covenants and to manage its capital structure these non gaap measures do not have standardized meanings under ifrs and are not necessarily comparable to similar measures provided by other companies the company discloses these measures because it believes that they provide further information and assist readers in understanding the results of the company s operations and financial position these measures should not be considered in isolation or used in substitution for other measures of performance prepared in accordance with gaap the following is a reconciliation of the non gaap measures reported by the company ebitda and adjusted ebitda ebitda is a non gaap measure defined as earnings before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda is also a non gaap measure defined as ebitda adjusted for items which do not impact day to day operations the company believes that ebitda and adjusted ebitda are useful supplemental measures that provide a meaningful indication of the company s results from principal business activities prior to the consideration of how these activities are financed or the tax impacts in various jurisdictions and for comparing its operating performance with the performance of other companies that have different financing capital or tax structures the company presents adjusted ebitda as a measure of ebitda that excludes the impact of transactions that are outside the company s normal course of business or day to day operations adjusted ebitda is used by many analysts in the oil and gas industry as one of several important analytical tools to evaluate financial performance and is a key metric in business valuations it is also considered important by

the report based on anecdotal information collected by the 12 regional fed banks through february 25 said consumer spending was also held back by harsh winter weather and higher costs of credit manufacturing strengthened but companies reported concerns about weakening global demand higher costs due to tariffs and ongoing trade policy uncertainty the report is likely to support the decision by many fed officials to pledge patience on future interest rate hikes which has prompted dovish shifts elsewhere and that was exactly the message from john williams president of the fed s new york regional bank i expect growth to slow considerably relative to last year to around 2 per cent mr williams said in the text of a speech three developments contribute to this view a downturn in global growth heightened geopolitical uncertainty and the effects of tighter financial conditions mr williams said the base case outlook looked good but various uncertainties continue to loom large therefore we can afford to be flexible and wait for the data to guide our approach hint the fed s not rushing to lift rates mr williams said the current federal funds rate of 2 4 per cent puts us right at neutral nab fx strategist rodrigo catril said mr williams comments signal a fed on hold we note previous indications from the fed suggested that the current rate was at the lower end of the range of

neutral range that s a marked retreat from its january statement the policy interest rate will need to rise over time into a neutral range to achieve the inflation target as for the bank of england rate setter michael saunders said it should wait and see how brexit unfolds before shifting its policy stance the possibility that monetary tightening might be needed in the future does not necessarily mean we need to tighten now saunders said in a speech at imperial college in london given that at present economic growth is probably not strong enough to create excess demand and inflation is reasonably well behaved for now it makes sense to wait and to see how brexit developments unfold later today european central bank policymakers meet while no policy moves are expected the

more than 8 out of every 10 of these jobs were full time westpac noted that the data now posts a challenge for rba to credibly maintain its gdp growth forecasts at 3 in 2019 and 2 75 in 2020 thus rba

november rba lowe income growth to provide counterweight to falling house price rba governor philip lowe said in a speech that nationwide housing prices have fallen by 9 since peaking in 2017 bringing them back to level in mid 2016 he noted that declines of this magnitude are unusual but they are no unprecedented movement in house prices would influence consumer spending building activity access to finance by small businesses and profitability of financial institutions though labor market is expected to continue to tighten with gradual increase in wage growth and faster income growth that should provide a counterweight to the effect on spending of lower housing prices and overall lowe said the adjustment in our housing market is manageable for the overall economy it is unlikely to derail our economic expansion it will also have some positive side effects by making housing more affordable for many people on monetary policy lowe also noted that a strong labour market is the central ingredient in the expected pick up in inflation wag growth would boost household income and spending and provide a counterweight to the fall in housing price and a lot depends upon the labour market rba will continue to assess the shifts in the global economy trends in household spending and how the tension between the labour market and output indicators resolves itself lowe also reiterated that the probabilities for the next move to go up or down are reasonably evenly balanced boj harada should strengthen monetary easing without delay if economy deteriorates boj board member yutaka harada warned that the economy is facing increasing risks including slowdown in china trade tensions and weak private consumptions also subdued inflation could reinforce the public view of low inflation which would delay the achievement of the 2 target he urged that if the economy deteriorates to the extent that achieving the inflation target in the long term becomes difficult it s necessary to strengthen monetary easing without delay for now harada said boj should commit to loose monetary policy unless prices show stronger movements than currently anticipated and the conduct of monetary policy should be data dependent not calendar based he also warned that past episodes of premature monetary tightening worsened the economy driven down prices and output and led to declines in interest rates in the longer term fed kaplan us economy is more more interest rate sensitive than it has been historically dallas fed president robert kaplan warned in a speech yesterday that in the event of an economic downturn level growth and credit quality of corporate debt could contribute to a deterioration in financial conditions which could in turn amplify the severity of a growth slowdown in the u s economy thus vigilance is warranted and fed will continue to monitor corporate debt meanwhile he is also sensitive to these corporate debt developments in light of the historically high level of u s government debt and the forward estimates for the path of government debt to gdp an elevated level of corporate debt along with the high level of u s government debt is likely to mean that the u s economy is much more interest rate sensitive than it has been historically separately minneapolis fed president neel kashkari reiterated his view that the us is not full employment yet and there is room for growth he said here is still slack in the labor market and until we see wages growth really pick up i m going to believe that there are still more americans out there thus i m very focused on wages as the best indicator overall of how tight is the labor force boc to maintain tightening bias despite growing downside risks boc is widely expected to leave the policy rate unchanged at 1 75 today since the last meeting economic data released pointed to slowdown in canada s growth momentum although governor stephen poloz has recently affirmed at the central bank should still increase the policy rate to the neutral level at some point the timing is data dependent it is important to monitor how the members react to the broad based data disappointment of late governor poloz noted in a speech two weeks ago that the policy rate would need to move up into a neutral range over time to a point where it is not stimulating or constraining economic growth he added however that the path back to that neutral range is highly uncertain and any move should be data dependent more in boc preview risk on growth is to the downside more on canada and boc looking ahead boc rate decision is the main focus today also canada will release trade balance labor productivity and ivey pmi us will release adp employment and trade balance fed will also release beige book economic report aud usd daily

by the 2008 global financial crisis the modern 1929 crash set off a vicious chain reaction across europe by 2010 it had irreparably damaged the foundations of the eurozone causing the establishment to bend its own rules and commit crimes against logic in order to bail out its banker friends by 2013 the neoliberal ideology that had legitimised the eu s oligarchic technocracy had plunged millions into misery even through the enactment of official policies socialism for the financiers and harsh austerity for the many these policies were practised as much by conservatives as by social democrats by 2015 the surrender of the syriza government in greece had divided and disheartened the left robbing europe of the short lived hope that progressives rising up in the streets would alter the balance of power since then anger has combined with hopelessness to create a vacuum soon filled by the organised misanthropy of a nationalist international triumphing across europe and making donald trump a very happy man against the background of an establishment that increasingly resembles the unhappy weimar republic and of the recalcitrant racists produced by the crisis s deflationary forces the european union is fragmenting with angela merkel on the way out and emmanuel macron s european agenda dead on arrival the european election in may could prove the last chance progressives have to make a difference at a pan european level since it was created in 2016 diem25 democracy in europe movement 2025 has resolved to make the most of this opportunity first we prepared our programme the new deal for europe then we invited other movements and parties to help develop it and to create together our european spring the first transnational list pursuing a common policy agenda across europe before discussing this project the left must address two issues dividing and weakening progressives across europe borders and the eu borders vs free movement something very odd has been happening in recent years many on the left have come to view open borders as bad for the working class jean luc mélenchon of la france insoumise has said several times i ve never been in favour of freedom of arrival in a speech on posted workers at the european parliament in july 2016 he said migrants were taking the bread out of the mouths of french workers he has since regretted this statement though his views on the impact of migration on french wages have not changed this is not new in 1907 morris hillquit the founder of the socialist party of america tabled a resolution to end the wilful importation of cheap foreign labour arguing that migrants were a pool of unconscious strike breakers what is new is that much of the left seems to have forgotten lenin s fierce reaction in 1915 to hillquit s call for curbs on migration we think that one cannot be internationalist and be at the same time in favour of such restrictions such socialists are in reality jingoists lenin had provided the context in an article on 29 october 1913 there can be no doubt that dire poverty alone compels people to abandon their native land and that the capitalists exploit the immigrant workers in the most shameless manner but only reactionaries can shut their eyes to the progressive significance of this modern migration of nations capitalism is drawing the masses of the working people of the whole world breaking down national barriers and prejudices uniting workers from all countries diem25 adopts lenin s apt analysis walls that curb the free movement of people and goods are a reactionary response to capitalism the socialist response is to bring down the walls and allow capitalism to undermine itself while we organise transnational resistance to capitalist exploitation everywhere it is not migrants who steal the jobs of native workers but governmental austerity which is part of the class war waged on behalf of the domestic bourgeoisie this is why we are adamant that xenophobia lite must never be allowed to contaminate our agenda as my friend slavoj žižek says a leftist nationalism is a cruel and inane response to national socialism so diem25 s position on newcomers is that we refuse to differentiate between migrants and refugees and we call upon europe to letthemin the left s best strategy comrades from across europe call us utopian and say the eu cannot be reformed they may well be right so for argument s sake let us agree that the eu is unreformable is progressives best response to adopt lexit the leftwing campaign for the controlled disintegration of the eu some of my happiest memories are of addressing large audiences in germany in 2015 soon after syriza s surrender to angela merkel and the troika the international monetary fund european central bank and european commission they were desperate to convey that what had been done to greece had not been done in their name the name of the german people i remember how relieved they were on hearing the diem25 call to form one transnational movement to unify to fight together to seize control of eu institutions european investment bank eib ecb etc and re deploy them in the interests of all europeans i still feel the elation of our german comrades on hearing our idea to run greek candidates in germany and german candidates in greece to signify that our movement is transnational that it intends to take over the neoliberal order s institutions everywhere and at once not to wreck them but to make them work for the many in brussels berlin athens paris everywhere compare this with how they would have felt had i told them that the eu was unreformable and must be disbanded that greeks must fall back to their nation state and try to build socialism there while germans did the same once we succeeded our delegations could meet to discuss collaboration between our newly sovereign progressive states our german comrades would undoubtedly have felt deflated and returned home depressed thinking that they would have to face the german establishment as germans not as part of a transnational movement if i am right it does not matter whether the eu is or isn t reformable but it does matter that we put forward concrete proposals on what we would do with eu institutions not utopian proposals but complete descriptions of what we would do this week next month in the next year under the existing rules and with the existing instruments how we would reassign the role of the awful european stability mechanism reorient the ecb s quantitative easing and finance immediately and without new taxes a green transition and campaign against poverty why such a detailed agenda to show voters that there is an alternative even within the rules designed by the establishment to further the interests of the top 1 no one expects the eu institutions to adopt our proposals least of all us all we want is for voters to see what could be done instead of what is being done so that they can see through the establishment without turning to the xenophobic right this is the only way the left can escape its confines and build abroad progressive coalition towards a democratic constitution diem25 s new deal for europe aims at this it shows how the lives of the majority of people can be improved in the short run under existing rules and with the current institutions and it maps out the transformation of these institutions while charting a constitutional assembly process that will in the longer run lead to a democratic european constitution to replace all existing treaties and it demonstrates how the new mechanisms we will be introducing from day 1 can help us pick up the pieces if despite our best efforts the eu disintegrates everyone talks about the importance of the green transition what they do not say is where the money will come from and who will plan it our answer is clear europe needs to invest 2 trillion between 2019 and 2023 in green technologies energy etc we propose that the eib issues an additional volume of its bonds 500bn annually for four years and that the ecb announces that if their value drops it will purchase these on the secondary bond market with that announcement and the glut of savings around the world the ecb will not have to spend a single euro as the eib bonds will sell out a new european green transition agency modelled on the marshall plan s organisation for european economic cooperation the oecd s precursor will channel those funds to green projects across the continent this proposal requires no new taxes builds on an existing european bond and is fully legal under existing rules the same applies to our other proposals such as our anti poverty fund we propose that the billions of profits of the european system of central banks from assets purchased under the ecb s quantitative easing or from the target2 payment system be used to provide every european under the poverty line with food shelter and energy security another example is our plan to restructure the eurozone s public debt the ecb mediates between states and money markets to reduce their total debt burden but without printing money or making germany pay for or guarantee the public debt of the more indebted countries as these demonstrate our new deal combines technically competent plans implementable under the eu s existing framework with a radical departure from austerity and the troika s bailout logic and it goes further by tabling new institutions that prepare for a post capitalist european future a plan for post capitalism proposes to partly socialise capital and the returns from automation big business corporations right to operate in the eu will be conditional on transferring a percentage of their shares to a new european equity fund the dividends from these will then fund a universal basic dividend ubd to be paid to each european citizen independently of other welfare payments or unemployment insurance our proposals for reforming the euro are another radical change before getting bogged down in changing the charter of the ecb we plan to create a public digital payments platform in every eurozone country using their national tax office s existing digital platform taxpayers would have the opportunity to purchase digital tax credits which they can use to pay one another or to pay future taxes at a substantial discount these credits would be denominated in euros but transferable only between taxpayers within a single country so would be impervious to sudden capital flight governments would be able to create a limited number of these fiscal euros to be given to citizens in need or used for the funding of public projects fiscal euros would allow stressed governments to stimulate demand lessen the tax burden and ultimately reduce the crushing power of the ecb and costs of exiting the euro or of the euro s disintegration in the long term public digital payment platforms would form a managed system of country specific euros that work like an international clearing union a modern version of john maynard keynes s 1944 vision for the bretton woods system which sadly failed to materialise our new deal for europe is a comprehensive plan for smartly re deploying existing institutions in the interests of the majority planning for a radical post capitalist green future and preparing to pick up the pieces if the eu collapses a european spring is possible the left s great foes are disunity and incoherence unity is crucial but it should not be pursued at the expense of coherence consider the state of the european left party how can it appeal to voters this may when it is represented in greece by a party that in government implements the harshest austerity in the history of capitalism on behalf of the troika while many of its leading lights in countries like france and germany are eurosceptic well meaning leftwing friends ask why doesn t diem25 join up with jean luc mélenchon s la france

involved blanchard in particular said running higher deficits to save the planet was a good idea they still see a limit out there somewhere but as long as the u s economy grows faster than the

growth in china decelerated to the slowest pace since 1990 last year underlining the challenges the country faces amid sluggish global demand and a more protectionist united states china s leaders haven t been sitting on their hands however as an abundance of policy measures have been initiated since last summer when the first wave of us tariffs struck but with the fiscal and monetary loosening being stepped up amid a continuing downtrend in growth is the government risking undoing the progress it s made on deleveraging the economy as the government grapples an ongoing slowdown at least one battle could be about to end as negotiations in the sino us trade dispute reportedly move to the final stages it s worth being reminded however that china s economy started losing steam long before us president trump triggered the trade war and growth in 2018 was already under pressure from deleveraging and other structural reforms those reforms whilst they have been inflicting short term pain were considered to be crucial in streamlining inefficient state owned enterprises and making china s huge debt burden sustainable in the long run but with the state desperate to kick start a flagging economy it now risks fuelling borrowing by companies and local governments and possibly worsening the debt bubble that has been steadily building over the years there is no doubt that the us levies on chinese imports totalling 250 billion have hurt china s exporters but perhaps the biggest impact of trump s trade war has been the uncertainty it has generated for businesses both in china and globally rather than the actual tariffs themselves trump s tough stance on the issue has taken china by surprise and does not reflect too well on president xi jingping s leadership that probably makes the need for an economic rebound all the more urgent hence is why the government is expected to approve a raft of stimulus measures at this week s annual gathering of political leaders and delegates the national people s congress the biggest boost to the economy could come from tax cuts totalling 2 trillion yuan with the most significant being the reduction in value added tax vat for manufacturing firms as well as for the transportation and construction sectors spending will also increase with more infrastructure projects being planned and together with lower tax receipts they are expected to push up the budget deficit for 2019 to 2 8 of gdp from 2 6 in 2018 more worrying though is the increase in the ceiling of the amount of debt local governments are allowed to issue private borrowing is also being encouraged with the government setting a target for commercial banks to increase lending to small businesses by 30 this means more cuts in the reserve requirement ratio rrr are likely with the people s bank of china pboc having cut it five times already since the beginning of 2018 the cuts in rrr are not the only method monetary policy has been slowly loosened the central bank has been regularly carrying out reverse repo operations to inject liquidity into the banking system the pboc has been relying on reverse repos to boost liquidity rather than cutting interest rates signalling that it will only move to lower its benchmark one year policy lending rate as a last resort while it s too early to see the accumulated impact of all these measures they seem to have been enough to change investor sentiment towards the country s undervalued stocks chinese stocks have been rallying strongly since january on the back of rising optimism of a resolution to the us china trade conflict the stock market got an additional lift from this week s stimulus news sending the leading share indices the csi 300 index and the sse composite index to 9 month highs year to date their gains stand at an incredible 27 8 and 24 3 respectively the chinese yuan has also been rallying appreciating by about 2 5 against the us dollar so far during 2019 it hit a 7 month high of 6 6718 to the dollar in february but analysts are not predicting further appreciation for the currency with a median forecast of 6 70 for the year end the yuan s direction in the coming months will probably depend a lot on what happens on the trade front the talks appeared to have gained considerable momentum over the past couple of weeks with a special summit between trump and xi at the end of march to sign a potential deal looking likely u s secretary of state mike pompeo sounded upbeat on monday saying the two countries were on the cusp of a deal there s still plenty that could go wrong however although china appears to have conceded on many of the sticking points such as putting an end to forced technology transfers and providing better protection for the intellectual property of foreign companies their enforcement and ensuring that china follows through with its pledges could still make or break any deal a setback in the talks at this stage of the negotiations could be hugely negative for chinese equities as well as for global risk appetite the australian dollar which is sensitive to both broader risk sentiment and china related trades could come under selling pressure if an agreement is scuppered a downside break of the 0 70 handle would be an easy target if the trade optimism faded opening the way for the january 2016 trough of 0 6824 if though a trade accord was finalised the aussie could overcome the bearish forces driven by expectations of an rba rate cut to reclaim it s 50 day moving average currently around 0 7130 clearing this level would bring the january top of 0 7295 back within reach traders should be wary however of how much further the risk rally can run if trade talks are successfully concluded most of the gains in equities and other risk assets enjoyed during the past few weeks have been on the back of speculation that a deal is nearing this suggests there may be limited scope for an extension of the rally once an agreement is reached and opens the prospect of buy the rumour sell the news response by the markets assuming that the us and china do manage to sign a deal soon the focus will shift to how soon the stimulus measures will begin to feed through the real economy a rebound in chinese growth in the second half of the year could provide a lifeline for the world economy which has also been fast hitting the brakes but the boost to growth could come at a heavy price as authorities risk stimulating the economy to the extent that debt surges to unsustainable levels for which the only remedy would be a sharp tightening in monetary policy subsequently china s drastic attempts at preventing a hard landing could be responsible for causing exactly that down the line for the moment though china has bought itself some time by seemingly appeasing us trade demands and announcing a series of policy tools to reinvigorate growth they ve also taken the pressure off expectations about economic performance in 2019 by lowering the target for gdp growth the government is aiming for growth of between 6 6 5 for the year even slower than 2018 s 6 6 as it acknowledges the challenges facing the economy

it s time to call donald trump s trade war what it is an experiment in economic torture only the u s president is dabbling in both roles on the one hand his tariffs are giving china quite a wallop delivering sadistic pain and humiliation to asia s biggest economy on the other the pain is being felt at home where key trump support groups including farmers are taking hits and nursing bruises but it s this latter role that of self harm that dominates america s 2019 given signs that china may best trump china s xi jinping isn t bowing to trump s demands rather trump is bowing to growing evidence that american workers are bearing the brunt of his torture economics trump s claims washington is winning are belied by two new research papers that suggest the self defeating nature of the trade war in one economists including pinelopi goldberg of the world bank calculate that trump s tariffs are erasing about 69 billion from gross domestic product or 0 4 in another economists from the federal reserve bank of new york princeton university and columbia university found trump s levies on 250 billion of chinese goods are causing a 165 billion disruption to supply chains as such nobel economist paul krugman concludes that trump s taxes made america poorer overall trump boosters counter that you should see the other guy didn t president xi just scale back china s 2019 gdp ambitions by half a percentage point from 2018 xi s 6 to 6 5 target would after all mean the slowest growth in about three decades the real point though is how little xi is conceding to trump odds are xi will get away with pledges to buy more u s goods and police intellectual property right infractions a bit more that will be a stinging blow to hardliners including former trump consigliere steve bannon angling for wholesale changes to beijing s state run enterprise model there was plenty of evidence before trump went all tariff happy that things would end this way in june 2017 world bank economist caroline freund warned against a misguided obsession with bilateral trade deficits in trump s zero sum worldview any such imbalance suggests the surplus holder is a thief but when u s unemployment is historically low as it is now economic policymakers should focus elsewhere one such focus is a structural shift in the sino u s commercial relationship hedge fund investor j kyle bass of hayman capital management summed it up nicely in a recent bloomberg op ed the key bass wrote with daniel babich is prodding beijing to dismantle an industrial policy that grants unique advantages namely widespread government subsidies protected domestic markets and regulatory preferences to chinese government affiliated national champions that means moving to end china s long standing policy of bulk economic espionage and theft which annually costs america s economy at least 300 billion according to u s government estimates bass wrote with daniel babich any such effort requires xi scrapping the joint venture requirement the main mechanism china inc used to appropriate foreign technology yet their worst fears may be coming true trump does indeed appear to be telling his negotiators to get a deal any deal to calm markets that would defeat the entire purpose of the exercise and forgo a historic chance to make china more of a stakeholder in global affairs than a mere shareholder what s more xi arguably would come out the dominant in this affair beijing would be free to continue coddling its state owned national champions xi also would have a freer hand to slow or in some cases reverse the market opening steps of recent decades and all for very little with some headline grabbing soybean purchases or holding the yuan steady to firmer xiconomics can get back to business that business make no mistake is about making america the economic submissive xi s made in china 2025 juggernaut aims to dominate the future of renewable energy semiconductors software aerospace self driving vehicles pharmaceuticals robotics and artificial intelligence trump by radical contrast wants to return america to 1985 how else can one describe his efforts to bring back coal browbeat detroit into making less fuel efficient cars and engineer a plaza accord 2 0 this latter mention was a 1985 deal on currencies hammered out by the biggest industrialized economies it took place at the plaza hotel a new york institution that trump would later own for a spell any similar move to weaken the dollar would be a pyrrhic victory at best since the u s only manufactures domestically a fraction of what it did in the 80s exchange rates wouldn t get trumponomics very far nor will a weaker dollar or increased chinese agricultural purchases do anything to increase productivity they won t prod silicon valley to focus more on true innovation than on selling ads and data they won t repair america s crumbling infrastructure or increase internet speeds they won t reduce the inequality trump made worse with a badly designed 1 5 trillion tax cut they won t revitalize an american education system falling behind asian peers they won t halt a runaway debt that just surged past the 22 trillion mark yet indications are that trump up against his pain threshold is about to cry uncle try as it may to spin this as a euphoric win trump s white house is using its safe word to end this torture experiment for trump the stopping point is wall street traders communicating their disgust the stock market really does seem to play some primal role in trump s psyche in 2017 trump cited the dow jones industrial average s 25 rally as proof he was an economic magician yet the market s 2018 stumble bore trump s fingerprints as his trade war crimped world growth in december alone the standard poor s 500 ended up or down more than 1 a sizable gyration nine times that s compared to eight times in all of 2017 as scandals and investigations swirl around trump s white house his legislative prospects are grim hopes for a win on north korean denuclearization didn t pan out hence trump s desire for a china trade deal he can sell as proof that the art of the deal president has still got it yet trump s role as slave to stock moves make xi master of this u s china trade affair and xi fully knows it

agustin carstens general manager of the bank for international settlements when the bank for international settlements looked to replace outgoing general manager jaime caruana a spaniard at the end of 2017 it decided to break with almost 88 years of tradition by handing the role to somebody who wasn t from either europe or canada namely mexican central bank chief agustin carstens for carstens his appointment reflects the growing importance of emerging economies to the global financial system with the credibility of latin american central banks in particular receiving more recognition as efforts to maintain financial stability after years of economic turmoil have allowed the region s banking systems to flourish at last central banks in the region have been evolving and have been adhering to better practices and in terms of traditional mandates of central banks they have delivered quite well during the last couple of decades carstens tells euromoney from his bis office in basel switzerland there are obviously exceptions here and there but by and large especially in terms of controlling inflation financial stability has improved dramatically with respect to what we had in the 1980s and parts of the 1990s those debt crises in the final decades of the 20th century in latin america were typically accompanied by repeated bouts of hyperinflation even today the region is home to the country with the highest inflation in the world venezuela which according to the imf saw consumer prices rise by more than one million percent last year but while venezuela is obviously considered an outlier most latin american economies experience far lower levels of inflation now than in the past carstens says the persistent inflationary pressure faced by latin american central banks still sets them apart from other emerging market regions compare it with emerging asia he says where inflation tends to be one or two points below latin america to a large extent this is attributable to the fact that there is a lot of inertial inflation which means that if there is an inflationary shock this tends to persist longer than in other latitudes he says also many if not all of the latin american economies are quite commodity based mexico for example is less commodity based but still for public finance oil is very important as is the weight of food in the cpi this means that inflation tends to be far more sensitive to commodity prices than in other regions and that also makes the conduct of monetary policies more complicated another challenge latin american central banks face albeit one they share with policymakers in other emerging market regions has been the transition in many countries to an open economy and the subsequent impact of capital flows on exchange rates sometimes there are massive capital inflows which implies that there can be a wide appreciation in real and nominal terms in the exchange rate says carstens in contrast sudden stops in capital flows can pressure the exchange rate and generate other sorts of problems in particular in the fight against inflation so this has called for latin american central banks to look at the broader range of policies how to deal with capital flow volatility and take into consideration what are generally called macro prudential policies personal resonance for carstens the experience of a sudden reversal of capital flows has personal resonance given mexico s tequila crisis in 1994 when foreign investors alarmed by domestic tensions and rising interest rates in the us started pulling money out of the country at the time carstens was the chief economist at mexico s central bank mexico had dusted itself down from the bruising experience of the 1980s debt crisis by embarking on a series of structural reforms including opening up its economy and privatizing the banks but the country still maintained a fixed exchange rate regime mainly as a way to manage inflation as capital drained away and mexico s international reserves depleted it was impossible to keep parity with the dollar in place says carstens mexico had no choice but to let the peso float the conventional thinking at the time was that to have flexible exchange rate regimes in small open economies was crazy it was not advisable he says mexico was probably the first emerging market that proved that it could manage a flexible exchange rate regime if there were appropriate fiscal monetary and financial policies the crisis was solved adequately and established the basis for a more solid macro framework that mexico has enjoyed since then so what did they learn there were many lessons learned one was the flexibility of the exchange rate the others included the importance of having a well supervised and regulated financial market and banking system to have very prudent external and internal debt management and it was also very important to have the autonomy of the central bank during the recovery process you have to work every day to preserve your macro strength and i think latin american countries should not forget that agustin carstens those lessons have now been adopted widely across the region and this is one reason why latin america s financial markets are more robust than they were just a quarter of a century ago back then the main problem was to have a more predictable and more stable macro financial environment in latin america that would allow for longer duration issuance of bonds in the domestic markets says carstens i remember when i was in mexico in 1994 at the time of our crisis the average maturity of our internal debt was seven days now the average maturity is more in the seven to eight years range so you can imagine the difficulties we faced in developing a medium to long term capital market when the government couldn t even place debt for more than seven days this progress has also been matched in other latin american countries so macro discipline and macro stability is deeper ingrained the big test for the region s central banks came in 2008 as the subprime mortgage blow out and the collapse of lehman brothers plunged the global financial system into crisis by that time carstens had become mexico s finance minister but the memories of the tequila crisis were still fresh while many g20 finance ministers were talking about expansionary fiscal policies carstens was thinking the opposite that mexico needed to embark on a big fiscal contraction to avoid running up a large fiscal deficit and potentially scaring away investors the signal of fiscal sustainability was very important so as not to induce capital outflows in particular given that our main trading partner the us economy was in crisis he says i remember at the time having hearings in congress where representatives would tell me that the imf which traditionally calls for fiscal discipline was saying that then it was time to spend they basically were complaining that i was advocating for a tougher stance than the one the imf was calling for at the end of the day it worked out well but it was difficult to pull it off at the time the guiding hand of past crises that informed carstens thinking was also shared by central bankers across latin america as they successfully responded to the fallout from the global financial crisis at the time many of these countries were either still in the recovery process or it had not been so long since they were in recovery he says therefore the lessons they learned from their own crises were still very ingrained in the minds of many of the policymakers unprecedented stimulus in january 2010 as the crisis was still resonating in many parts of the world carstens became governor of banco de mexico or banxico the country s central bank it was an era of unprecedented global monetary stimulus and rock bottom interest rates that inflated asset prices and saw a deluge of money pouring into emerging market economies particularly in mexico i remember very markedly during the first years after the global financial crisis around 2010 to 2014 we were experiencing substantial capital inflows and banco de mexico s board decided to have a more aggressive policy towards accumulating international reserves he says that in a way was a form of macro prudential policy first under the anticipation that at some point the very low levels of global interest rates would be reversed and in those circumstances we might need some of the accumulated foreign exchange to stabilize our currency market for carstens a reversal of the expansionary monetary policies of the last decade by central banks in the developed world is one of the biggest risks latin america s central bankers face today for the last 10 years or so latin american economies in general have faced a relatively benign external environment from the point of view of having plenty of international liquidity he says obviously the main central banks like the fed the european central bank the bank of japan they re being very mindful of the spill over effects of their actions and they have been exercising considerable forward guidance but that doesn t take away the fact that the higher rates in the main advanced economies might pose some pressures on some emerging economies this requires latin american economies to be particularly mindful about the need to have their houses in order to try to mitigate any vulnerabilities and therefore be in a position to face tighter financial conditions ahead china too may also become an issue for those latin american economies that depend on that country s demand for commodities to help prop up prices countries should feel good that so far the shock absorbing capacity of their economies has been important but more shocks might come in the future and also in some cases there have been some slippages in policy conduct carstens says you have to work every day to preserve your macro strength and i think latin american countries should not forget that

river on august 22 2018 we completed a strategic combination with raging river exploration inc raging river by way of a plan of arrangement in which baytex acquired all of the issued and outstanding common shares of raging river the strategic combination increased our light oil exposure and operational control of our properties while strengthening our balance sheet the addition of these operated assets to our portfolio increased our inventory of drilling prospects and our ability to effectively allocate capital production from raging river s properties is approximately 90 light oil from the viking and duvernay areas our 2018 results include 132 days of operations from the raging river assets from august 22 to december 31 in q4 2018 production from the raging river assets averaged 26 035 boe d 93 oil and ngl reserves associated with the raging river assets increased by 4 on a 2p basis to 111 mmboe as compared to year end 2017 operating results 2018 was a defining year as we repositioned baytex as a north american crude oil producer with strong free cash flow and an improved balance sheet we have successfully integrated the two companies undertaken a detailed strategic review of our operations confirmed the organic growth opportunities in our diversified portfolio of assets and delivered on our near term operational targets production averaged 98 890 boe d 83 oil

range of 79 000 to 80 000 boe d production from the legacy baytex assets excluding raging river averaged 72 855 boe d in q4 2018 and 71 293 boe d for 2018 exploration and development expenditures totaled 184 million in q4 2018 and 496 million for full year 2018 in line with our guidance range of 450 500 million we participated in the completion of 353 198 6 net wells with a 99 success rate during the year eagle ford and viking light oil our eagle ford assets in south texas is one of the premier oil resource plays in north america these assets generate a strong operating netback and free cash flow and contain a significant inventory of development prospects in 2018 we allocated 39 of our exploration and development expenditures to these assets production averaged 38 437 boe d 78 liquids during q4 2018 as compared to 37 198 boe d in q3 2018 production for 2018 averaged 37 076 boe d as compared to 36 678 boe d in 2017 in 2018 the eagle ford generated an operating netback of 479 million and free cash flow of 285 million we continue to see strong well performance driven by enhanced completions in the oil window of our acreage in 2018 we participated in the drilling of 91 20 8 net wells and commenced production from 120 26 2 net wells the wells that have been on production for more than 30 days during 2018 established 30 day initial production rates of approximately 1 750 boe d per well 65 light oil and condensate which represents an approximate 20 improvement over 2017 during q4 2018 we commenced production from 31 5 9 net wells which averaged 30 day initial production rates of approximately 1 800 boe d per well six of these were new appraisal wells in our northern austin chalk fracture trend and demonstrated 30 day initial production rates of approximately 1 600 boe d per well our viking asset is a shallow light oil resource play in western canada during q4 2018 production from the viking averaged 23 784 boe d excluding heavy oil up from 22 158 boe d for the period august 22 to september 30 we maintained a steady pace of development in q4 2018 with five drilling rigs and 1 5 frac crews executing our program resulting in 83 65 5 net wells the extended reach horizontal results continue to exceed expectations with multiple previously untested sections proving economic heavy oil our heavy oil assets at peace river and lloydminster produced a combined 26 339 bbl d during the fourth quarter as compared to 27 036 bbl d in q3 2018 the reduced volumes reflect the optimization of our heavy oil program during q4 2018 due to volatile heavy oil prices which was mitigated somewhat by the addition of heavy oil assets acquired as part of the raging river combination our peace river assets are located in northwest alberta through our innovative multi lateral horizontal drilling and production techniques we are able to generate some of the strongest capital efficiencies in the oil and gas industry in 2018 we drilled 12 12 0 net oil wells with average 30 day initial production rates of approximately 500 boe d per well this program included 8 8 0 net wells in our northern seal area which delivered approximately 25 higher 30 day initial production rates than our field wide average we deferred three completions during q4 2018 due to low heavy oil prices our lloydminster assets are characterized by multiple stacked pay formations at relatively shallow depths the area has been successfully developed through vertical and horizontal drilling water flood steam assisted gravity drainage operations and more recently the implementation of polymer flooding to further enhance reserves recovery we drilled 86 61 9 net oil wells in 2018 in addition we successfully completed the expansion of our kerrobert thermal project with productive capability increasing to approximately 2 000 bbl d during q4 2018 east duvernay shale light oil we continue to prudently advance the delineation of the east duvernay shale an early stage high operating netback light oil resource play where we have amassed over 450 sections of land in 2018 our focus shifted to the pembina area where we control over 270 sections of 100 working interest land with five wells on production we have delineated approximately 35 sections representing 175 potential drilling opportunities these wells generated average 30 day initial production rates of approximately 575 boe d per well 88 liquids during q4 2018 production from the east duvernay shale averaged 1 432 boe d up from 650 boe d for the period august 22 to september 30 financial review

continuing in effect or where changes are proposed such changes being adopted as anticipated readers are cautioned that such assumptions although considered reasonable by baytex at the time of preparation may prove to be incorrect actual results achieved will vary from the information provided herein as a result of numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties and other factors such factors include but are not limited to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices and price differentials availability and cost of gathering processing and pipeline systems failure to comply with the covenants in our debt agreements the availability and cost of capital or borrowing that our credit facilities may not provide sufficient liquidity or may not be renewed risks associated with a

for the year ended december 31 2018 to be filed with canadian securities regulatory authorities and the u s securities and exchange commission not later than march 31 2019 and in our other public filings the above summary of assumptions and risks related to forward looking statements has been provided in order to provide shareholders and potential investors with a more complete perspective on baytex s current and future operations and such information may not be appropriate for other purposes there is no representation by baytex that actual results achieved will be the same in whole or in part as those referenced in the forward looking statements and baytex does not undertake any obligation to update publicly or to revise any of the included forward looking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise except as may be required by applicable securities law all amounts in this press release are stated in canadian dollars unless otherwise specified non gaap financial and capital management measures adjusted funds flow is not a measurement based on generally accepted accounting principles gaap in canada but is a financial term commonly used in the oil and gas industry we define adjusted funds flow as cash flow from operating activities adjusted for changes in non cash operating working capital asset retirement obligations settled and transaction costs our determination of adjusted funds flow may not be comparable to other issuers we consider adjusted funds flow a key measure that provides a more complete understanding of operating performance and our ability to generate funds for exploration and development expenditures debt repayment settlement of our abandonment obligations and potential future dividends in addition we use a ratio of net debt to adjusted funds flow to manage our capital structure we eliminate settlements of abandonment obligations from cash flow from operations as the amounts can be discretionary and may vary from period to period depending on our capital programs and the maturity of our operating areas the settlement of abandonment obligations are managed with our capital budgeting process which considers available adjusted funds flow changes in non cash working capital are eliminated in the determination of adjusted funds flow as the timing of collection payment and incurrence is variable and by excluding them from the calculation we are able to provide a more meaningful measure of our cash flow on a continuing basis transaction costs associated with the raging river combination are excluded from adjusted funds flow as we consider the costs non recurring and not reflective of our ability to generate adjusted funds flow on an ongoing basis for a reconciliation of adjusted funds flow to cash flow from operating activities see management s discussion and analysis of the operating and financial results for the three months and year ended december 31 2018 free cash flow is not a measurement based on gaap in canada we define free cash flow as adjusted funds flow less sustaining capital sustaining capital is an estimate of the amount of exploration and development expenditures required to offset production declines on an annual basis and maintain flat production volumes exploration and development expenditures is not a measurement based on gaap in canada we define exploration and development expenditures as additions to exploration and evaluation assets combined with additions to oil and gas properties we use exploration and development expenditures to measure and evaluate the performance of our capital programs the total amount of exploration and development expenditures is managed as part of our budgeting process and can vary from period to period depending on the availability of adjusted funds flow and other sources of liquidity net debt is not a measurement based on gaap in canada we define net debt to be the sum of monetary working capital which is current assets less current liabilities excluding current financial derivatives and onerous contracts and the principal amount of both the long term notes and the bank loan we believe that this measure assists in providing a more complete understanding of our cash liabilities and provides a key measure to assess our liquidity the current portion of financial derivatives is excluded as the valuation of the underlying contracts is subject to a high degree of volatility prior to the ultimate settlement onerous contracts are excluded from net debt as the underlying contracts do not represent an available source of liquidity we use the principal amounts of the bank loan and long term notes outstanding in the calculation of net debt as these amounts represent our ultimate repayment obligation at maturity the carrying amount of debt issue costs associated with the bank loan and long term notes is excluded on the basis that these amounts have already been paid by baytex at inception of the contract and do not represent an additional source of liquidity or repayment obligation bank ebitda is not a measurement based on gaap in canada we define bank ebitda as our consolidated net income attributable to shareholders before interest taxes depletion and depreciation and certain other non cash items as set out in the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facilities bank ebitda is used to measure compliance with certain financial covenants operating netback is not a measurement based on gaap in canada but is a financial term commonly used in the oil and gas industry operating netback is equal to petroleum and natural gas sales less blending expense royalties production and operating expense and transportation expense divided by barrels of oil equivalent sales volume for the applicable period our determination of operating netback may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures for other entities we believe that this measure assists in characterizing our ability to generate cash margin on a unit of production basis and is a key measure used to evaluate our operating performance advisory regarding oil and gas information the reserves information contained in this press release has been prepared in accordance with national instrument 51 101 standards of disclosure for oil and gas activities of the canadian securities administrators ni 51 101 complete ni 51 101 reserves disclosure will be included in our annual information form for the year ended december 31 2018 which will be filed on or before march 31 2019 listed below are cautionary statements that are specifically required by ni 51 101 where applicable oil equivalent amounts have been calculated using a conversion rate of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil boes may be misleading particularly if used in isolation a boe conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead with respect to finding and development costs the aggregate of the exploration and development costs incurred in the most recent financial year and the change during that year in estimated future development costs generally will not reflect total finding and development costs related to reserves additions for that year this press release contains estimates of the net present value of our future net revenue from our reserves such amounts do not represent the fair market value of our reserves this press release contains metrics commonly used in the oil and natural gas industry such as recycle ratio operating netback and reserves life index these terms do not have a standardized meaning and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies and therefore should not be used to make such comparisons such metrics have been included in this press release to provide readers with additional measures to evaluate baytex s performance however such measures are not reliable indicators of baytex s future performance and future performance may not compare to baytex s performance in previous periods and therefore such metrics should not be unduly relied upon this press release discloses drilling locations for our east duvernay shale assets drilling locations refer to baytex s total proved probable and unbooked locations proved locations and probable locations account for drilling locations in our inventory that have associated proved and or probable reserves and are derived from our most recent independent reserves evaluation dated as at december 31 2018 potential drilling opportunities are unbooked locations that are internal estimates based on our prospective acreage and an assumption as to the number of wells that can be drilled per section based on industry practice and internal review unbooked locations do not have attributed reserves unbooked locations are farther away from existing wells and therefore there is more uncertainty whether wells will be drilled in such locations and if drilled there is more uncertainty whether such wells will result in additional oil and gas reserves resources or production in the east duvernay shale baytex s net drilling locations for the east duvernay shale assets include 6 proved 9 probable and 160 unbooked locations references herein to average 30 day initial production rates and other short term production rates are useful in confirming the presence of hydrocarbons however such rates are not determinative of the rates at which such wells will commence production and decline thereafter and are not indicative of long term performance or of ultimate recovery while encouraging readers are cautioned not to place reliance on such rates in calculating aggregate production for us or the assets for which such rates are provided a pressure transient analysis or well test interpretation has not been carried out in respect of all wells accordingly we caution that the test results should be considered to be preliminary notice to united states readers the petroleum and natural gas reserves contained in this press release have generally been prepared in accordance with canadian disclosure standards which are not comparable in all respects to united states or other foreign disclosure standards for example the united states securities and exchange commission the sec requires oil and gas issuers in their filings with the sec to disclose only proved reserves but permits the optional disclosure of probable reserves each as defined in sec rules canadian securities laws require oil and gas issuers disclose their reserves in accordance with ni 51 101 which requires disclosure of not only proved reserves but also probable reserves additionally ni 51 101 defines proved reserves and probable reserves differently from the sec rules accordingly proved and probable reserves disclosed in this press release may not be comparable to united states standards probable reserves are higher risk and are generally believed to be less likely to be accurately estimated or recovered than proved reserves in addition under canadian disclosure requirements and industry practice reserves and production are reported using gross volumes which are volumes prior to deduction of royalty and similar payments the sec rules require reserves and production to be presented using net volumes after deduction of applicable royalties and similar payments moreover baytex has determined and disclosed estimated future net revenue from its reserves using forecast prices and costs whereas the sec rules require that reserves be estimated using a 12 month average price calculated as the arithmetic average of the first day of the month price for each month within the 12 month period prior to the end of the reporting period as a consequence of the foregoing baytex s reserve estimates and production volumes in this press release may not be comparable to those made by companies utilizing united states reporting and disclosure standards baytex

please visit our website atwww symphonyasia com market overview concerns over economic and geopolitical risks contributed to weaker financial markets in 4q18 in particular expectations of weaker economic growth trade tensions between the us and china the possibility of a disorderly exit by the united kingdom from the european union the us government shutdown and less accommodative fiscal policies particularly by the us federal reserve weighed on investor sentiment although the international monetary fund s imf world economic outlook update in january 2019 projects global growth to slow from 3 7 in 2018 to 3 5 in 2019 asia will continue to grow at a relatively faster pace emerging and developing asia are expected to grow at 6 3 and 6 4 in 2019 and 2020 respectively the relatively faster growth is driving consumption from an expanding middle class market liberalisation and intra regional trade in the region we continue to expect these long term trends benefit symphony s investment portfolio although some of the risks that affected financial markets in 4q18 have abated there remains downside risks to the business environment less accommodative financial policies and a threat of a no deal brexit could impact global economic growth there is also political uncertainty surrounding the elections in thailand where symphony has material investments which may have an impact on the perception of businesses operating there however governments tend to lean towards pro market policies so we feel that the effect of these risks will be short term in nature for example we currently see the us federal reserve posture towards more gradual rate hikes and there has also been a more reconciliatory tone with regards to trade tensions between the us and china the weaker investor sentiment in late 2018 and early 2019 has generally reduced asset valuations although this has had some impact on our nav we have seen more interesting opportunities come to market which has increased our deal flow we are currently exploring a number of opportunities some of which we hope to close in the first half of 2019 in regard to existing investments symphony s portfolio companies continue to grow and remain well positioned to benefit from the growth and changing demographics in the region company update symphony international holdings limited s symphony or the

symphony s listed investments accounted for 54 6 of nav at 31 december 2018 or us 0 524 per share which is down from 61 6 of nav at 30 september 2018 the change is predominantly due to a decline in

and 32 respectively in q4 2018 year over year the growth was driven by the hotel and mixed use business following the consolidation of the nh hotel group sa nh group in october 2018 the relatively slower ebitda and net profit growth compared to revenue was due to lower profitability of the restaurant business which had same store sales decline a mismatch in sales recognition from residential developments and higher personnel related expenses from properties under management letting rights in 4q18 core revenue from hotel and related services operations increased by 194 from thb8 4 billion to thb24 5 billion due to the inclusion of the nh group and robust growth from non nh group related hotels overseas although mint s hotels in bangkok continued to perform well operations in the provinces of thailand were impacted from the slowdown in inbound tourism from china and some european countries mint continued to expand its restaurant business with the total number of outlets increasing by 96 to 2 270 quarter over quarter the majority of the new outlets were the pizza company dairy queen and the coffee club mint entered into a joint venture agreement with the vietnam investments group to be the master franchisee for the coffee club brand in vietnam total core revenue for the restaurant group declined by 5 in 4q18 year over year to thb5 8 billion due to a slowdown in australia and strategic outlet closures in singapore which was partially offset by sales growth in thailand core ebitda from this business segment declined by 37 during the same period due to heightened margin pressure from same store sales contraction new openings and higher marketing expenses the retail trading operations benefited from an increase in the number of retail outlets by 38 during 4q18 during the quarter the value of symphony s investment in mint declined by us 53 1 million from us 310 9 million at 30 september 2018 to 257 8 million at 31 december 2018 the change in valuation is due to a decline in mint s share price by 16 6 from thb40 75 to thb34 0 and a depreciation in the onshore thai baht rate by 0 6 doing the same period subsequent to 31 december 2018 and at the time of this report mint s share price had partially recovered to thb38 75 and the thai baht had strengthened to 31 645 per us dollar which increased the value for this investment to us 302 2

ottawa as widely anticipated the bank of canada left its key interest rate unchanged at 1 75 percent on march 6 citing a weaker than expected outlook both domestically and globally the bank dropped its seemingly entrenched mantra that the policy interest rate will need to rise into a neutral range from its current accommodative level now the interest rate outlook is even more opaque than in january when the boc made an effort to inject some ambiguity into the timing of future rate hikes however the boc gave no hint at a potential rate cut even as talk of an economic recession mounted after dismal fourth quarter of 2018 economic growth of 0 4 percent it will take time to gauge the persistence of below potential growth said the boc in its march 6 press release university of waterloo economic professor jean paul lam says the bank is no longer talking about getting back to the neutral range for its key rate which is estimated to be between 2 5 and 3 5 percent they ve given up on being very forward looking right now lam said in an interview he adds that it s the first time in a long while he has seen the boc in a mostly reactionary mode given what economic data comes in they are not trusting their models they are not trusting in terms of where they see the economy going they are just reacting to whatever data is coming he said that is a position they haven t been in for a long time in terms of how to set policy economists agree there is little justification for a rate hike for most of 2019 the bank of canada has already raised rates by 1 25 percent since mid 2017

net wells and commenced production from 120 26 2 net wells the wells that have been on production for more than 30 days during 2018 established 30 day initial production rates of approximately 1 750 boe d per well 65 light oil and condensate which represents an approximate 20 improvement over 2017 during q4 2018 we commenced production from 31 5 9 net wells which averaged 30 day initial production rates of approximately 1 800 boe d per well six of these were new appraisal wells in our northern austin chalk fracture trend and demonstrated 30 day initial production rates of approximately 1 600 boe d per well our viking asset is a shallow light oil resource play in western canada during q4 2018 production from the viking averaged 23 784 boe d excluding heavy oil up from 22 158 boe d for the period august 22 to september 30 we maintained a steady pace of development in q4 2018 with five drilling rigs and 1 5 frac crews executing our program resulting in 83 65 5 net wells the extended reach horizontal results continue to exceed expectations with multiple previously untested sections proving economic heavy oil our heavy oil assets at peace river and lloydminster produced a combined 26 339 bbl d during the fourth quarter as compared to 27 036 bbl d in q3 2018 the reduced volumes reflect the optimization of our heavy oil program during q4 2018 due to volatile heavy oil prices which was mitigated somewhat by the addition of heavy oil assets acquired as part of the raging river combination our peace river assets are located in northwest alberta through our innovative multi lateral horizontal drilling and production techniques we are able to generate some of the strongest capital efficiencies in the oil and gas industry in 2018 we drilled 12 12 0 net oil wells with average 30 day initial production rates of approximately 500 boe d per well this program included 8 8 0 net wells in our northern seal area which delivered approximately 25 higher 30 day initial production rates than our field wide average we deferred three completions during q4 2018 due to low heavy oil prices our lloydminster assets are characterized by multiple stacked pay formations at relatively shallow depths the area has been successfully developed through vertical and horizontal drilling water flood steam assisted gravity drainage operations and more recently the implementation of polymer flooding to further enhance reserves recovery we drilled 86 61 9 net oil wells in 2018 in addition we successfully completed the expansion of our kerrobert thermal project with productive capability increasing to approximately 2 000 bbl d during q4 2018 east duvernay shale light oil we continue to prudently advance the delineation of the east duvernay shale an early stage high operating netback light oil resource play where we have amassed over 450 sections of land in 2018 our focus shifted to the pembina area where we control over 270 sections of 100 working interest land with five wells on production we have delineated approximately 35 sections representing 175 potential drilling opportunities these wells generated average 30 day initial production rates of approximately 575 boe d per well 88 liquids during q4 2018 production from the east duvernay shale averaged 1 432 boe d up from 650 boe d for the period august 22 to september 30 financial review our financial results for q4 2018 were negatively impacted by the sharp decline in global benchmark crude oil prices and the significant widening of canadian light and heavy oil differentials in q4 2018 the price for west texas intermediate light oil wti averaged us 58 81 bbl as compared to us 69 50 bbl in q3 2018 the discount for canadian heavy oil as measured by the price differential between western canadian select wcs and wti averaged us 39 42 bbl in q4 2018 as compared to us 22 25 bbl in q3 2018 the discount for canadian light oil as measured by the price differential between canadian mixed sweet blend msw and wti averaged us 26 51 bbl in q4 2018 as compared to us 6 82 bbl in q3 2018 as a result of the challenging pricing environment we generated adjusted funds flow of 111 million 0 20 per basic share in q4 2018 compared to 171 million 0 46 per basic share in q3 2018 full year adjusted funds flow was 473 million 1 35 per basic share compared to 348 million 1 48 basic per share in 2017 we generated an operating netback 17 15 boe in q4 2018 as compared to 31 39 boe in q3 2018 and 21 78 boe in q4 2017 the eagle ford generated an operating netback of 35 42 boe during q4 2018 while our canadian operations generated an operating netback of 5 54 boe in the eagle ford our assets are proximal to gulf coast markets with light oil and condensate production priced off the lls crude oil benchmark which is a function of the brent price in q4 2018 the price for lls averaged us 66 64 bbl as compared to us 75 25 bbl in q3 2018 during q4 2018 our light oil and condensate realized price in the eagle ford of us 62 87 bbl or 83 28 bbl represented a us 3 77 bbl discount to lls the following table summarizes our operating netbacks for the periods noted three months ended

to the wcs benchmark 2 the term operating netback does not have any standardized meaning as prescribed by canadian generally accepted accounting principles gaap and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies where similar terminology is used we refer you to the advisory on non gaap measures at the end of this press release financial liquidity we maintain strong financial liquidity with our credit facilities approximately 50 undrawn and our first long term note maturity not until 2021 our net debt totaled 2 265 billion at december 31 2018 which includes four series of long term notes that total 1 6 billion our credit facilities total approximately 1 085 billion comprised of us 575 million of revolving credit facilities and a 300 million non revolving term loan the credit facilities which mature in june 2020 are not borrowing base facilities and do not require annual or semi annual reviews we expect to request an extension to the credit facilities in 2019 risk management as part of our normal operations we are exposed to movements in commodity prices in an effort to manage these exposures we utilize various financial derivative contracts crude by rail and capital allocation optimization to reduce the volatility in our adjusted funds flow we realized a financial derivatives loss of 73 million in 2018 as compared to a gain of 8 million in 2017 for 2019 we have entered into hedges on approximately 30 of our net crude oil exposure this includes 25 of our net wti exposure with 2 fixed at us 62 85 bbl and 23 hedged utilizing a 3 way option structure that provides a us 10 bbl premium to wti when wti is at or below us 55 64 bbl and allows upside participation to us 73 65 bbl in addition we have entered into a brent based 3 way option structure for 3 000 bbl d that provides a us 10 bbl premium to brent when brent is at or below us 59 50 bbl and allows upside participation to us 78 68 bbl we have also entered into hedges on approximately 24 of our net natural gas exposure through a combination of aeco swaps at c 2 37 mcf and nymex swaps at us 3 10 mmbtu crude by rail is an integral part of our egress and marketing strategy for our heavy oil production for 2019 we expect to deliver 11 000 bbl d approximately 40 of our heavy oil volumes to market by rail up from 9 000 bbl d in 2018 commencing january 1 2019 approximately 70 of our crude by rail commitments are wti based contracts with no wcs pricing exposure in addition we have entered into wcs differential hedges on approximately 10 of our net heavy oil exposure at a wti wcs differential of us 17 34 bbl a complete listing of our financial derivative contracts can be found in note 19 to our 2018 financial statements outlook for 2019 stronger commodity prices following the pricing challenges of the fourth quarter global benchmark prices have recently improved with wti currently trading at us 57 bbl as compared to a low of us 42 bbl in december 2018 in addition following the government of alberta s announcement on december 2 2018 of temporary production curtailments canadian light and heavy oil differentials have narrowed substantially in q1 2019 the wti wcs price differential averaged us 12 29 bbl and the wti msw price differential averaged us 4 85 bbl this combination of improved wti prices and the narrowing of canadian differentials are expected to have a positive impact to our adjusted funds flow free cash flow and debt repayment further deleveraging remains a top priority for 2019 adjusted funds flow in excess of exploration and development expenditures leasing expenditures and asset retirement obligations will be used to reduce our indebtedness based on the forward strip for 2019 our adjusted funds flow forecast has increased by 32 from 605 million in december 2018 to approximately 800 million which will support our debt reduction initiative our plan for year end is to reduce our net debt to ebitda ratio to approximately 2 2x as we continue to drive debt levels down we will be positioned to enhance shareholder returns through a combination of organic growth through disciplined capital allocation the reinstatement of a dividend and or share buybacks corporate level production volumes are strong as a result of current activity levels excellent well performance in the eagle ford and outstanding operating efficiency across all of our assets q1 2019 volumes are trending above 97 000 boe d activity levels are on pace for 155 million capex in q1 2019 approximately 33 of q1 2019 corporate capital investment is being directed to the eagle ford while 52 is allocated to the viking light oil assets we continue to see approximately 3 drilling rigs and 1 5 frac crews in the eagle ford and 5 rigs and 1 5 completion crews in the viking with our usual seasonal slowdown in canada during the second quarter this puts us on track for the full year to drill approximately 245 net wells 85 extended reach horizontals in the viking and bring approximately 30 net wells on production in the eagle ford we are executing a small heavy oil development program through the first half of 2019 with the potential to scale activity higher should oil prices and visibility to egress improve east shale duvernay appraisal progress in q1 2019 we are drilling four wells at pembina with completion activities scheduled

volumes to tight oil negative technical revisions for shale gas and natural gas liquids are the result of the removal of certain drilling locations on our eagle ford acreage as well as

continuing in effect or where changes are proposed such changes being adopted as anticipated readers are cautioned that such assumptions although considered reasonable by baytex at the time of preparation may prove to be incorrect actual results achieved will vary from the information provided herein as a result of numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties and other factors such factors include but are not limited to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices and price differentials availability and cost of gathering processing and pipeline systems failure to comply with the covenants in our debt agreements the availability and cost of capital or borrowing that our credit facilities may not provide sufficient liquidity or may not be renewed risks associated with a third party operating our eagle ford properties the cost of developing and operating our assets depletion of our reserves risks associated with the exploitation of our properties and our ability to acquire reserves new regulations on hydraulic fracturing restrictions on or access to water or other fluids changes in government regulations that affect the oil and gas industry regulations regarding the disposal of fluids changes in environmental health and safety regulations public perception and its influence on the regulatory regime restrictions or costs imposed by climate change initiatives variations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates risks associated with our hedging activities changes in income tax or other laws or government incentive programs uncertainties associated with

for the year ended december 31 2018 to be filed with canadian securities regulatory authorities and the u s securities and exchange commission not later than march 31 2019 and in our other public filings the above summary of assumptions and risks related to forward looking statements has been provided in order to provide shareholders and potential investors with a more complete perspective on baytex s current and future operations and such information may not be appropriate for other purposes there is no representation by baytex that actual results achieved will be the same in whole or in part as those referenced in the forward looking statements and baytex does not undertake any obligation to update publicly or to revise any of the included forward looking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise except as may be required by applicable securities law all amounts in this press release are stated in canadian dollars unless otherwise specified non gaap financial and capital management measures adjusted funds flow is not a measurement based on generally accepted accounting principles gaap in canada but is a financial term commonly used in the oil and gas industry we define adjusted funds flow as cash flow from operating activities adjusted for changes in non cash operating working capital asset retirement obligations settled and transaction costs our determination of adjusted funds flow may not be comparable to other issuers we consider adjusted funds flow a key measure that provides a more complete understanding of operating performance and our ability to generate funds for exploration and development expenditures debt repayment settlement of our abandonment obligations and potential future dividends in addition we use a ratio of net debt to adjusted funds flow to manage our capital structure we eliminate settlements of abandonment obligations from cash flow from operations as the amounts can be discretionary and may vary from period to period depending on our capital programs and the maturity of our operating areas the settlement of abandonment obligations are managed with our capital budgeting process which considers available adjusted funds flow changes in non cash working capital are eliminated in the determination of adjusted funds flow as the timing of collection payment and incurrence is variable and by excluding them from the calculation we are able to provide a more meaningful measure of our cash flow on a continuing basis transaction costs associated with the raging river combination are excluded from adjusted funds flow as we consider the costs non recurring and not reflective of our ability to generate adjusted funds flow on an ongoing basis for a reconciliation of adjusted funds flow to cash flow from operating activities see management s discussion and analysis of the operating and financial results for the three months and year ended december 31 2018 free cash flow is not a measurement based on gaap in canada we define free cash flow as adjusted funds flow less sustaining capital sustaining capital is an estimate of the amount of exploration and development expenditures required to offset production declines on an annual basis and maintain flat production volumes exploration and development expenditures is not a measurement based on gaap in canada we define exploration and development expenditures as additions to exploration and evaluation assets combined with additions to oil and gas properties we use exploration and development expenditures to measure and evaluate the performance of our capital programs the total amount of exploration and development expenditures is managed as part of our budgeting process and can vary from period to period depending on the availability of adjusted funds flow and other sources of liquidity net debt is not a measurement based on gaap in canada we define net debt to be the sum of monetary working capital which is current assets less current liabilities excluding current financial derivatives and onerous contracts and the principal amount of both the long term notes and the bank loan we believe that this measure assists in providing a more complete understanding of our cash liabilities and provides a key measure to assess our liquidity the current portion of financial derivatives is excluded as the valuation of the underlying contracts is subject to a high degree of volatility prior to the ultimate settlement onerous contracts are excluded from net debt as the underlying contracts do not represent an available source of liquidity we use the principal amounts of the bank loan and long term notes outstanding in the calculation of net debt as these amounts represent our ultimate repayment obligation at maturity the carrying amount of debt issue costs associated with the bank loan and long term notes is excluded on the basis that these amounts have already been paid by baytex at inception of the contract and do not represent an additional source of liquidity or repayment obligation bank ebitda is not a measurement based on gaap in canada we define bank ebitda as our consolidated net income attributable to shareholders before interest taxes depletion and depreciation and certain other non cash items as set out in the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facilities bank ebitda is used to measure compliance with certain financial covenants operating netback is not a measurement based on gaap in canada but is a financial term commonly used in the oil and gas industry operating netback is equal to petroleum and natural gas sales less blending expense royalties production and operating expense and transportation expense divided by barrels of oil equivalent sales volume for the applicable period our determination of operating netback may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures for other entities we believe that this measure assists in characterizing our ability to generate cash margin on a unit of production basis and is a key measure used to evaluate our operating performance advisory regarding oil and gas information the reserves information contained in this press release has been prepared in accordance with national instrument 51 101 standards of disclosure for oil and gas activities of the canadian securities administrators ni 51 101 complete ni 51 101 reserves disclosure will be included in our annual information form for the year ended december 31 2018 which will be filed on or before march 31 2019 listed below are cautionary statements that are specifically required by ni 51 101 where applicable oil equivalent amounts have been calculated using a conversion rate of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil boes may be misleading particularly if used in isolation a boe conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead with respect to finding and development costs the aggregate of the exploration and development costs incurred in the most recent financial year and the change during that year in estimated future development costs generally will not reflect total finding and development costs related to reserves additions for that year this press release contains estimates of the net present value of our future net revenue from our reserves such amounts do not represent the fair market value of our reserves this press release contains metrics commonly used in the oil and natural gas industry such as recycle ratio operating netback and reserves life index these terms do not have a standardized meaning and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies and therefore should not be used to make such comparisons such metrics have been included in this press release to provide readers with additional measures to evaluate baytex s performance however such measures are not reliable indicators of baytex s future performance and future performance may not compare to baytex s performance in previous periods and therefore such metrics should not be unduly relied upon this press release discloses drilling locations for our east duvernay shale assets drilling locations refer to baytex s total proved probable and unbooked locations proved locations and probable locations account for drilling locations in our inventory that have associated proved and or probable reserves and are derived from our most recent independent reserves evaluation dated as at december 31 2018 potential drilling opportunities are unbooked locations that are internal estimates based on our prospective acreage and an assumption as to the number of wells that can be drilled per section based on industry practice and internal review unbooked locations do not have attributed reserves unbooked locations are farther away from existing wells and therefore there is more uncertainty whether wells will be drilled in such locations and if drilled there is more uncertainty whether such wells will result in additional oil and gas reserves resources or production in the east duvernay shale baytex s net drilling locations for the east duvernay shale assets include 6 proved 9 probable and 160 unbooked locations references herein to average 30 day initial production rates and other short term production rates are useful in confirming the presence of hydrocarbons however such rates are not determinative of the rates at which such wells will commence production and decline thereafter and are not indicative of long term performance or of ultimate recovery while encouraging readers are cautioned not to place reliance on such rates in calculating aggregate production for us or the assets for which such rates are provided a pressure transient analysis or well test interpretation has not been carried out in respect of all wells accordingly we caution that the test results should be considered to be preliminary notice to united states readers the petroleum and natural gas reserves contained in this press release have generally been prepared in accordance with canadian disclosure standards which are not comparable in all respects to united states or other foreign disclosure standards for example the united states securities and exchange commission the sec requires oil and gas issuers in their filings with the sec to disclose only proved reserves but permits the optional disclosure of probable reserves each as defined in sec rules canadian securities laws require oil and gas issuers disclose their reserves in accordance with ni 51 101 which requires disclosure of not only proved reserves but also probable reserves additionally ni 51 101 defines proved reserves and probable reserves differently from the sec rules accordingly proved and probable reserves disclosed in this press release may not be comparable to united states standards probable reserves are higher risk and are generally believed to be less likely to be accurately estimated or recovered than proved reserves in addition under canadian disclosure requirements and industry practice reserves and production are reported using gross volumes which are volumes prior to deduction of royalty and similar payments the sec rules require reserves and production to be presented using net volumes after deduction of applicable royalties and similar payments moreover baytex has determined and disclosed estimated future net revenue from its reserves using forecast prices and costs whereas the sec rules require that reserves be estimated using a 12 month average price calculated as the arithmetic average of the first day of the month price for each month within the 12 month period prior to the end of the reporting period as a consequence of the foregoing baytex s reserve estimates and production volumes in this press release may not be comparable to those made by companies utilizing united states reporting and disclosure standards baytex energy corp baytex energy corp is an oil and gas corporation based in calgary alberta the company is engaged in the acquisition development and production of crude oil and natural gas in the western

article robert j burrowes elite banking at your expense how secretive tax havens are used to steal your money tax havens are locations around the world where wealthy individuals criminals and terrorists as well as governments and government agencies such as the cia banks corporations hedge funds international organizations such as the vatican and crime syndicates such as the mafia can stash their money so that they can avoid regulation and oversight and very often evade tax according to nicholas shaxson tax havens are now at the heart of the global economy which is why as he explains it the term tax haven is a bit of a misnomer because such places aren t just about tax what they sell is escape from the laws rules and taxes of jurisdictions elsewhere usually with secrecy as their prime offering see the tax haven in the heart of britain a tax haven or secrecy jurisdiction then is a place that seeks to attract business by offering politically stable facilities to help people or entities get around the rules laws and regulations of jurisdictions elsewhere see treasure islands tax havens and the men who stole the world tax havens are a vitally important part of the global infrastructure of corruption and criminality see giant leak of offshore financial records exposes global array of crime and corruption that enables privileged individuals and their organizations to legally and illegally steal money from the rest of us particularly those in developing countries and to have the services of a vast network of accountants bankers lawyers and politicians often from captured legislatures to help them do it and to ensure that they get away with it how many tax havens are there where are they how much money do they have who uses them why how do they work why does all this matter to us and what can we do about them tax havens how many and where are they in his book treasure islands tax havens and the men who stole the world author and financial journalist nicholas shaxson identified about sixty secrecy jurisdictions or offshore groups around the world which he divided into four categories as follows the most important category by far is those tax havens that form the spider s network of havens centred on the city of london it has three main layers there are two inner rings britain s crown dependencies of jersey guernsey which includes the sub havens of sark alderney and brecqhou and the isle of man and its overseas territories such as the cayman islands bermuda the british virgin islands and gibralter which are substantially controlled by britain the third layer is an outer ring with a more diverse array of havens like hong kong singapore the bahamas dubai and ireland which are outside britain s direct control but have strong historical and current links to that country and the city of london which i will discuss below this network controls almost one half of all international bank assets the second category of tax havens is those in europe notably including switzerland luxembourg see explore the documents luxembourg leaks database the netherlands belgium and austria as well as microstates such as liechtenstein and monaco while geneva bankers had sheltered the secret money of european elites since at least the eighteenth century the european havens got going during world war i as governments raised taxes sharply to pay for the war the third category of tax havens is that focused on the united states it has three tiers as well at the federal level the us government offers a range of tax exemptions secrecy provisions and laws designed to attract foreign money this means for example that us banks can legally accept proceeds from a range of crimes as long as the crimes are committed overseas the second tier involves individual us states such as florida where central south american elites do their banking and the countries adversely impacted are prevented by us secrecy provisions from accessing relevant data and where much mob and drugs money is hidden too delaware nevada and wyoming where even terrorist money is protected by secrecy provisions the third tier of the us network is the overseas satellites such as the american virgin islands the marshall islands liberia and panama with the latter according to jeffrey robinson being one of the filthiest money laundering sinks in the world see the sink terror crime and dirty money in the offshore world as shaxson notes offshore finance has quietly been at the heart of neoconservative schemes to project us power around the globe for years few people have noticed the fourth category of tax havens identified by shaxson includes those that do not fit in the categories above such as somalia and uganda the incomplete list of tax havens on the website tax havens of the world will give you some idea of where these secrecy jurisdictions are located but there are important omissions in this list notably including the city of london corporation for a brief look at 15 tax havens again notably excluding some of the most important and some of the corporations that use them see what are the world s best tax havens and for a highly instructive and utterly sobering video documentary on british tax havens see the spider s web britain s second empire this documentary will inform you among many more important things that the building housing her majesty s revenue and customs the uk tax office is owned by an offshore company in bermuda to summarize the central aspect of the development of tax havens following world war ii the british establishment an old boys network of privileged elites had carved out a lucrative vehicle for themselves in the offshore world after the demise of empire they transformed themselves from administrators of empire to financial handlers for the global elite and multinational corporations see the spider s web britain s second empire before concluding this section it is worth emphasizing that as shaxson explains it the offshore world is not a bunch of independent states exercising their sovereign rights to set their laws and tax systems as they see fit it is a set of networks of influence controlled by the world s major powers notably britain and the united states each network is deeply interconnected with the others he goes on the world s most important tax havens are not exotic palm fringed islands as many people suppose but some of the world s most powerful countries shaxson quotes marshall langer a prominent supporter of secrecy jurisdictions it does not surprise anyone when i tell them that the most important tax haven in the world is an island they are surprised however when i tell them that the island is manhattan moreover the second most important tax haven is located on an island it is called the city of london the city of london corporation what is the city of london corporation also known as the square mile it is a 1 22 square mile slab of prime central london real estate that stretches from the thames at victoria embankment clockwise up through fleet street the barbican centre then to liverpool street in the north east then back down to the thames just west of the tower of london see treasure islands tax havens and the men who stole the world according to shaxson the city of london corporation the modern period of which dates from 1067 yes that is not a typing error is the local government authority for the 1 2 square mile slab of prime real estate in central london that is the city of london the corporation is an ancient semi alien entity lodged inside the british nation state a prehistoric monster which had mysteriously survived into the modern world as a 19th century would be city reformer put it importantly shaxson explains the role of the city of london corporation as a municipal authority is its least important attribute this is a hugely resourced international offshore lobbying group pushing for international financial deregulation tax cutting and tax havenry around the world moreover it is the hub of a global network of tax havens sucking up offshore trillions from around the world and sending it or the business of handling it to london notably so powerful is the city of london that no sovereign or government of britain in a thousand years has had the courage to seriously take it on and attempt to subject it to british government control see the tax haven in the heart of britain how much money is in tax havens so how much of the world s wealth is stashed in tax havens around the globe according to the tax justice network in its 2012 report written by james s henry the price of offshore revisited new estimates for missing global private wealth income inequality and lost taxes a significant fraction of global private financial wealth by our estimates at least 21 to 32 trillion as of 2010 has been invested virtually tax free through the world s still expanding black hole of more than 80 offshore secrecy jurisdictions we believe this range to be conservative he goes on to emphasize that this is just financial wealth a big share of the real estate yachts racehorses gold bricks and many other things that count as non financial wealth are also owned via offshore structures where it is impossible to identify the owners henry also notes that given that credit suisse estimated global wealth in 2011 at 231 trillion the amount of money in secrecy jurisdictions is conservatively estimated at 10 of global wealth but other figures do indeed suggest this estimate is low shaxson cites compelling evidence that more than half of world trade passes at least on paper through tax havens over half of all banking assets and a third of foreign direct investment by multinational corporations are routed offshore moreover as long ago as 2008 the us government accountability office reported that 83 of the 100 biggest corporations in the usa had subsidiaries in tax havens and the following year using a broader definition the tax justice network discovered that ninety nine of europe s hundred largest companies used offshore subsidiaries and in each country the largest user by far was a bank see treasure islands tax havens and the men who stole the world in any case the most recent estimate by the tax justice network indicates tax losses to profit shifting by multinational companies a pplying a methodology developed by researchers at the international monetary fund to an improved dataset of around 500 billion a year see new estimates reveal the extent of tax avoidance by multinationals to reiterate then on the understanding that these estimates are probably quite low by 2010 between us21 and us32 trillion had been taken out of circulation so that it was beyond the laws financial regulations and taxes that the rest of us cannot escape but that figure has been added to by half a trillion dollars each year since by moving more money into tax havens and don t forget this figure does not include non financial wealth how many gold bricks yachts artworks and racehorses do you own and have stashed away somewhere free of scrutiny who uses tax havens and why as i mentioned above tax havens are used by wealthy individuals including businesspeople sports and pop stars criminals and terrorists as well as governments and their agencies banks corporations such as amazon and google international organizations and crime syndicates such as the medellin cartel while motives vary in essence the lack of regulation and oversight as well as tax evasion are the reasons that individuals and organizations use them an individual might want to hide stolen wealth to evade tax or cheat a divorced spouse out of their share of the family fortune a bank corporation crime syndicate international or terrorist organization might want to evade scrutiny of the source of their money and or evade tax on windfall or even ongoing profits legal and or otherwise a government might want to hide the dirty money it uses to finance black ops that is illegal and secret military violence such as that carried out by the cia but there are myriad explanations in john christensen s analysis of over 100 offshore clients of accounting firm deloitte touche he studied in jersey he found that the clients were engaging in insider trading market rigging failure to disclose conflicts of interest weapons trading illicit political donations contract kickbacks bribery fraudulent invoicing trade mispricing and tax evasion see the spider s web britain s second empire most people have heard of the money stashed away by corrupt dictators like suharto in indonesia ferdinand marcos in the philippines and mobuto sese seko of zaire now democratic republic of the congo each of whom stole from the people of their country however they could only do this with the help of western enablers and ongoing elite resistance to developing country attempts to create a more transparent and fairer process for collecting tax on cross border financial flows as a result alex cobham of the tax justice network observes worldwide developing nations lose in excess of 1trillion per year in capital flight and tax evasion to wealthy countries see the spider s web britain s second empire but these more public examples while terrible tend to obscure two important facts the amount stolen from sub saharan africans for example between 1970 and 2008 was at least five times the total amount of their foreign debt during that period see the spider s web britain s second empire and by highlighting these examples attention is drawn away from even worse and ongoing examples of such criminality by those corrupt criminal individuals and organizations including banks accountancy and legal firms corporations international organizations crime syndicates and governments committed to using outright theft fraud money laundering and other devices to steal wealth from ordinary people all over the world so for example if one follows the money trails of various lucrative financial operations some technically legal but immoral and others simply illegal apart from the world s major corporations one quickly comes across the names of the major and well known banks and financial institutions such as the bank of england barclays goldman sachs jpmorgan chase the big four accountancy firms deloitte ernst young ey kpmg and pricewaterhousecoopers and elite lawyers such as those in london s magic circle like clifford chance mourant du feu jeune and slaughter and may see for example treasure islands tax havens and the men who stole the world new estimates reveal the extent of tax avoidance by multinationals and looting with putin apparently like major corporations and crime syndicates few banks accountancy firms and lawyers have ethics policies that require them to follow the law and to exercise due diligence check out a client before signing a contract so that they can steer clear of handling illegal and immoral profits especially if they are monstrous in fact according to a us senate report virtually every major bank in the world especially the biggest in north america and europe holds accounts for offshore banks and or banks in suspect jurisdictions see the sink terror crime and dirty money in the offshore world as eva joly mep vice chair of the panama papers committee of the european parliament succinctly puts it ordinary people are paying taxes rich people are not see the spider s web britain s second empire the vatican but perhaps the example which best illustrates the moral depravity of those who use tax havens is the vatican in his carefully researched book operation gladio the unholy alliance between the vatican the cia and the mafia author paul l williams recounts the efforts of the cia former nazis the sicilian american mafia the vatican and even freemasonry to resist an anticipated postwar invasion of western europe by those godless communists in the soviet union by establishing stay behind units clandestine military and paramilitary units throughout the countries of europe belgium denmark italy netherlands norway portugal led by former nazis and composed of die hard fascist fanatics this alliance to fight the cold war against the former soviet union and the rising tide of progressive governments in europe and the rest of the world particularly as the us war on vietnam gathered pace led as williams chillingly puts it to the toppling of governments wholesale slaughter and financial devastation around the world it was also of course the forerunner to its equivalent operation condor to resist and destroy if possible the spread of progressive movements ranging from communism to liberation theology throughout central south america while the vatican played a number of unsavory roles in this alliance including its facilitation of massive numbers of heroin addictions its use of counterfeit securities participation in false flag attacks that killed thousands and strings of gangland slayings support of military juntas that massacred tens of thousands and the purging of progressive priests including archbishop óscar romero of san salvador and two jesuit priests denounced by fr jorge mario bergoglio now pope francis in argentina see who is pope francis jorge mario bergoglio and argentina s dirty war and causing the financial destitution of thousands of families one of its key ongoing functions designed to maximize the vatican s power while highlighting its moral and spiritual bankruptcy was to act as god s banker for many of these operations see operation gladio the unholy alliance between the vatican the cia and the mafia it did this for example by accepting mafia medellin cartel collected drugs money for a 15 20 cut into the vatican bank technically istituto per le opere di religione or institute for the works of religion and then laundering it through its shell companies such as cisalpine overseas bank astolfine sa united trading corporation erin sa bellatrix sa belrose sa starfield sa and nordeurop establishment in tax havens in the bahamas liechtenstein luxembourg panama and switzerland with the cia providing services such as the transport of mafia medellin cocaine to drug dealers in the us its share of the drug profits cycled through its own cia controlled banks including continental illinois castle bank trust and bank of credit and commerce international but eventually involving many of the most prestigious banks in the us as the money was passed to the vatican bank were used to finance key aspects of operations gladio and condor with weapons also supplied by the cia from nato arsenals but there was plenty of vatican money in these operations too as an aside so devastating was the fallout from the ongoing exposure of the many aspects of vatican corruption that by the beginning of the twenty first century roman catholic membership was falling by 400 000 per year in the usa alone but the trend was even stronger in europe with magnificent churches and cathedrals becoming museums visited solely by tourists parishes being boarded up seminaries and convents closed and parochial schools consolidated and this was before the plague of pedophilia had fully hit further decimating the church s tattered reputation to this day the vatican bank remains one of the world s leading laundries for dirty money see operation gladio the unholy alliance between the vatican the cia and the mafia how do tax havens work each tax haven offers its own unique combination of services after all it is a tough market competing for the world s wealth and so each jurisdiction has developed its own set of services designed to maximize its attractiveness to potential clients in essence this means that there is some ongoing competition to reduce regulatory and oversight requirements so that each tax haven can attract clientele this has become so extreme that basic requirements of banking for those who do it legally such as proof of identity are not required in the offshore world in fact even your true name can be withheld if you wish it is easier to avoid any risk of embarrassment from exposure this way as a result virtually any jurisdiction will open an account or as many accounts as you want in whatever names you specify then usually employing a variety of devices ranging from secret bank accounts nominee directors usually locals who play no part in the organization bar give it their name and structures such as shell companies that exist on paper and perhaps a wall plaque somewhere but nothing else and trusts which unlike the legitimate version appear to separate responsibility and control from the benefits of ownership but actually do not to processes such as transfer pricing a technique by which companies shift paper profits into low tax countries and costs into high tax countries to minimize or eliminate tax payments and often employing a convoluted process that rapidly shifts monies through several jurisdictions so that it becomes untraceable because authorities must get permission to access each jurisdiction in turn in any effort to trace the money profits are effectively hidden and any accountability to authorities of any kind utterly eliminated see treasure islands tax havens and the men who stole the world for one simple example of such a strategy employing a technique known as the double irish dutch sandwich which is legal see google shifted 23bn to tax haven bermuda in 2017 filing shows but you can read other examples here the tech giants will never pay their fair share of taxes unless we make them and 7 corporate giants accused of evading billions in taxes why does the existence of tax havens matter to us well the simple answer to this question is that just a fraction of the money hidden in tax havens would feed clothe house and provide clean water medical care and educational opportunities to everyone on earth it would eliminate the 100 000 deaths by starvation related diseases each day it would eliminate poverty and homelessness and as one byproduct of having these material needs met it would facilitate the emergence of an informed engaged and empowered human population to tackle the vast range of environmental climate and military threats that currently threaten biosphere collapse and imminent human extinction see human extinction by 2026 a last ditch strategy to fight for human survival as professor prem sikka puts it more simply because of the penetration by financial services executives of the british state including the treasury it deprives people of opportunities to have healthcare education security justice and ultimately a fulfilling life see the spider s web britain s second empire fundamentally then tax havens and their secrecy are at the heart of those elite institutions and processes that functionally undermine democracy and give extraordinary power to certain anonymous individuals and their entities without accountability see the spider s web britain s second empire of course the elites that control the tax haven networks are not about to let this change tax havens are simply too important as part of the global infrastructure for maintaining elite profit power and privilege and for resisting grassroots efforts to bring peace justice and ecological sanity to our world and that is why they are protected by government legislation and legal systems with an army of accountants auditors bankers businesspeople lawyers and politicians ensuring that they remain protected so don t forget laws are designed to control and punish you no matter how trivial your infringement a parking fine a littering offence a petty theft but if you have enough money the law simply does not exist and you can evade taxes legally and in the full knowledge that your vast profits even from immorally acquired wealth such as sex trafficking gun running endangered species trafficking conflict diamonds and drug trafficking are lawful and will escape regulation and oversight of any kind see the rule of law unjust and violent let me give a personal example i have been a war tax resister since 1983 i have a conscientious objection to paying taxes to the australian government to deploy military forces in other countries to kill people in my name so instead of paying taxes to kill for many years i donated the equivalent amount to organizations engaged in peace development environment and human rights work and to pay the rent for my use of indigenous land as some of many outcomes to this conscientious and highly public resistance garnering national media attention at times in 1991 i was bankrupted in 1992 i was convicted of contempt of court for my conscientious refusal to cooperate with the bankruptcy trustee and in 1993 my passport was seized in 1999 i was advised that i will be bankrupt forever because of my ongoing conscientious refusal to finance the killing in the same period since 1983 trillions and trillions of dollars of tax have been illegally and secretly evaded as wealthy individuals and corporations criminals and crime syndicates international organizations and governments channel their incomes and profits through tax havens laws and legal systems throughout the world make this possible and provided it is done correctly it is quite straightforward to avoid any penalties for secretly evading payment of taxes or hiding money acquired through criminal activity but the point as you can see is that tax evasion by wealthy individuals and corporations meant that many of these individuals and corporations didn t pay taxes to kill people either they just didn t pay taxes at all o f course their motive was personal gain their way was legal they incurred no penalty and of course they didn t pay an equivalent amount to support peace and justice causes more fundamentally however the trillions of dollars they took from the global economy were made by killing and exploiting people and the planet in a significant variety of other ways ranging from sex trafficking gun running conflict diamonds and trafficking in drugs and endangered species to simply starving people to death at the rate of 100 000 people each day by managing the global economy using tax havens as a primary tool to extract maximum profit richard brooks documents how this legal exploitation occurs in another way in his book the great tax robbery how britain became a tax haven for fat cats and big business the vast tax evasion by elites in britain including by diverting funds through tax havens attracts just five prosecutions each year per 1 billion of evasion of direct taxes in contrast benefits fraud by those on unemployment and disability pensions attract 9 000 prosecutions each year per 1 billion of fraud so theft by the poor warrants the full force of the law but not theft by elites who write the law and largely control the political and legal processes in relation to it hence under the guise of relationship taxing that is building a relationship between tax authorities and corporate executives and tailoring tax payments to corporate wishes to the extent the law allows corporations have long known that if you don t like the law we ll see what we can do as is obvious from this example attempts at government reform including to defeat tax havens in the direction of making elites financially and legally accountable both nationally and internationally for the responsibilities which the rest of us cannot escape are invariably for show and in any case achieve zero of substance for example the attempt to approve a blacklist of tax havens at the g20 gathering in 2009 was resisted by the chinese premier on behalf of chinese elites who like other national elites keen to have political control but judicial separation from their offshore centres opposed the listing of notorious havens hong kong and macau see treasure islands tax havens and the men who stole the world the global elite is clearly in control with national governments and international organizations powerlessly doing as instructed so complete is this control in fact that brooks notes that in britain anti tax avoidance laws had to be relaxed to accommodate companies tax avoidance schemes brooks concludes that british taxation policy really had been so comprehensively captured by the world s biggest corporations that screw the poor policies could be written into the statute books at their whim without a pang of conscience being felt anywhere in whitehall clearly however his comment can be applied to virtually any government in the world so does it matter to you that these tax havens exist and do what they do what can be done about tax havens authors such as nicholas shaxson and richard brooks suggest a raft of measures to correct the large number of faults that facilitate the secrecy protection from regulation and tax evasion that individuals corporations organizations criminals and terrorists utilize in tax havens for shaxson these include financial reforms such as blacklisting of tax havens so that their rogue state status is public knowledge greater transparency for example through government sharing of information about the local income and assets of each other s citizens and by requiring multinational corporate activities in each country to be made visible rather than hidden behind international figures promoting the needs of developing countries which need their tax bases protected far more than they need aid or debt relief confronting the british spider s web of tax havens by abolishing the city of london corporation and submerging it into a unified and fully democratic london taxing an entire multinational group as a single unit and then allocating the appropriate amounts of its income out to the different jurisdictions in which it was earned and allow it to be taxed as each jurisdiction decides onshore tax reform such as a land value tax because land cannot be moved offshore and so tax on it must be paid locally and by a direct distribution of mineral wealth in any country to each of its inhabitants who can then be taxed tackling the enablers the accountants lawyers individual bankers businesspeople and not just the clients so that they go to jail rethinking the meaning of corporate responsibility because corporations are given a wealth of capital in public infrastructure an educated and healthy workforce with which to work so that corporations are transparent about their affairs and pay tax as part of their corporate responsibility re evaluating the meaning of corruption insiders abusing the common good in secrecy and getting away with it and so worsening inequality and entrenching vested interests and unaccountable power so that we see more clearly all of the actors and their activities and changing the culture that fawns over people who abuse the system for personal gain see treasure islands tax havens and the men who stole the world and some progress appears to be occurring along lines he suggests for example a version of automatic information exchange aie by which governments make sure that essential information is made available to other jurisdictions as a matter of routine has been discussed by the oecd and while full of loopholes see loophole usa the vortex shaped hole in global financial transparency some commitments have been made for the list of commitments as at november 2018 see aeoi commitments however the usa has not made this commitment and while switzerland for example finds this objectionable see the u s hasn t signed the aeoi agreement reciprocity demanded the reality is that it makes little difference for example ico services which specializes in the formation of offshore companies and offshore banking will assist you to get around the aeoi requirement their website advertises that asset holders need to start looking for alternative jurisdictions for protecting their assets there are some reputable jurisdictions that are still outside the aeoi e g cyprus but u s states of delaware and some others shouldn t be dismissed but if you want a more established name to help you take advantage of a tax haven in the usa you really can t go past rothschild co so to check out what they are offering here is rothschild s primer how to launder money in u s real estate and avoid blacklists moreover the aeoi agreement outlaws bank secrecy but not trust secrecy which dates from the crusades on which the british model is based the trust lies at the core of the british secrecy model so it does not address the cornerstone of british tax haven secrecy and explains why the british were happy to see the cayman islands commit to the aeoi in short the british government would be happy to kill off bank secrecy so that they can capture a larger market share based on trust secrecy see the spider s web britain s second empire separately from this initiative in 2018 the uk parliament enacted a new law requiring its overseas territories including notorious tax havens like bermuda the cayman islands and the british virgin islands to start disclosing the owners of corporations they register by 2020 in theory this could shut down a huge amount of offshore tax evasion and other financial crimes because individuals from anywhere in the world including the united states have long been able to set up secret corporations in these tax havens to stash their money see new uk law may shut down the biggest tax havens aside from the u s however while the report pointed out that the new law obviously does not impact the usa or of course switzerland or and the easy rerouting options available if these havens are effectively or even actually shut down it failed to mention that this initiative does not in any way address the city of london corporation so the impact of this initiative must be very limited unless it is followed by some pretty drastic initiatives in westminster washington bern and elsewhere in summary while one cannot disagree with any of shaxson s fine suggestions or be displeased that public pressure has led to some effort being made by the oecd and the uk parliament to address elements of the tax haven scourge the reality is that the extent of the changes necessary are not going to happen without enormous grassroots pressure strategically applied and they are very unlikely to happen as reforms of the existing capitalist system this is simply because the global elite is solidly in control of the institutions and processes of global capitalism including its compliant governments and international organizations and will readily stymie any attempt at serious reform of tax havenry particularly given the number of major reforms needed and the number of nations in which these reforms must be enacted to state two obvious examples the city of london corporation has not existed for 1 000 years because it has no defense and the changes noted above have only made the us more attractive as a secrecy jurisdiction meanwhile with the aim of promoting financial innovation switzerland has recently made things easier for smaller financial technology companies thus making tax havenry more attractive to those who might not have otherwise considered it see swiss watchdog to propose looser anti money laundering rules for fintechs so given that most tax havens are protected by host government legislation and there is no international mechanism to control them the tax haven industry generally is not under threat of being held to account in any significant way and despite the more elaborate explanation offered above there is a simple reason for this unofficially of course illegal money laundered through tax havens has become an essential and sometimes stabilizing element of the global financial system see drug money saved banks in global crisis claims un advisor so what can we do that will make a difference given the deeply entrenched and long standing nature of this problem clearly it needs to be addressed at various levels fundamentally we can nurture our children so that we do not destroy their conscience see my promise to children remember all of those corrupt criminal accountants bankers businesspeople priests and popes lawyers and politicians that kept creeping up in the discussion above the people who maintain the entire infrastructure that allows tax havens to exist and those who manage and profit from it too do they care about you do they care about the people in africa asia and central south america who starve as a result of the types of policies that allow tax havens to exist and function do they care about those driven into poverty and homelessness in modern industrial economies because vast sums are drained out of them and hidden in secrecy jurisdictions do they care about the people killed by the military and other violence from which they profit and then hide the proceeds to evade tax do they care about the earth fundamentally do they care about themselves of course not but this is only because they are extraordinarily psychologically damaged individuals see the global elite is insane revisited with a more complete explanation in why violence and fearless psychology and fearful psychology principles and practice if we inflict enormous violence on a child throughout their childhood to compel their obedience how can we expect them to grow up to lead a life of integrity based on their conscience courage compassion empathy and love those who use tax havens are truly poor little rich boys and girls see love denied the psychology of materialism violence and war and why set up a shell company in panama the psychology driving illicit financial flows beyond tackling the problem at its source however we can also tackle manifestations of the problem but not by lobbying elites and their political agents there are no votes in it in any case to control this depravity for which they are well rewarded for a start we can boycott all of the major private banks in favor of those smaller or member owned banks that have a serious commitment to peace justice and ecological sustainability or we can seek out equivalent institutions like credit unions we can also create public banks based on ethical principles see what are public banks and how do they operate an introduction we can boycott large corporations like amazon apple gap google ikea microsoft and starbucks that use tax havens none of these corporations is a monopoly there are alternatives which can be investigated and employed assuming we can t go without some version of the product or service they offer whenever you can find a locally owned outlet that offers a local product or service we can boycott the catholic church god does not ask that you morally or financially support a corrupt organization that doesn t understand or represent morality and spirituality remember it was jesus who threw the moneychangers out of the temple if our conscience speaks loudly enough we can decline employment by any organization that is unethical such as those that use tax havens we can refuse to gamble refuse to buy the services of a sex worker who might even be illegally trafficked into the work refuse to buy the products of endangered species see for example killing elephants for pet food condemned and refuse to use illicit drugs these products and services are virtually always offered by industries controlled by criminal organizations so by buying them you are only harming yourself and or other people or species about whom you could choose to exercise a duty of care while also not contributing to the diversion of financial resources into tax havens we can encourage unions with members who work for organizations using tax havens to take a stand on the issue we can support existing organizations that work on the problem preferably those that offer grassroots alternatives the tax justice network an activist think tank and its sister organization the global alliance for tax justice campaign for systemic change if we are genuinely ambitious we can develop comprehensive nonviolent strategies to compel particular individuals and organizations to desist from using tax havens or even compel countries to close down tax havens see nonviolent campaign strategy this can easily be part of a larger strategy to transform the global economy into one that satisfies human and ecological needs particularly given the imminence of biosphere collapse as noted above see the flame tree project to save life on earth if violence and exploitation in all of their guises concern you consider signing the online pledge of the people s charter to create a nonviolent world so here is a final question for you to consider what might the world look like if all those trillions of dollars were being shared and spent where they are most needed biodata robert j burrowes has a lifetime commitment to understanding and ending human violence he has done extensive research since 1966 in an effort to understand why human beings are violent and has been a nonviolent activist since 1981 he is the author of why

wall street wants more stimulus from china more money from the government is a backstop to equities so why not sadly judging by this week s two sessions meeting in beijing they are not going to get what the chinese government used to give the communist party leaders are meeting this week to iron out the economic wrinkles and discuss what sectors of the economy should be opened up to increased foreign direct investment china has reached a point where it needs more foreign capital to grow here is what we know about the current fiscal and monetary stimulus plans coming out of china so far lower taxes but no corporate income tax breaks premier li keqiang announced yesterday that the government will reduce taxes and fees totaling 2 trillion yuan or around 298 billion this year that s almost twice as much fiscal stimulus than originally planned last year china made 1 3 trillion yuan in tax cuts as the economy showed signs of slowing amidst a creeping trade war with the u s cutting the vat and social security tax sst are the major components of the announced package but the contribution from each component was not mentioned during yesterday s meeting at the national people s congress in beijing to support the tax and fee cuts for the corporate sector beijing is asking state owned banks and some of its state owned enterprises to hand over larger portions of their profits this is a potential headwind for the ishares china large cap fxi exchange traded fund which is heavily invested in chinese soes and banks fxi was down 0 3 early wednesday underperforming the deutsche china a shares ashr etf li also said government officials will need to live within their means there are plans to reduce government spending on official overseas visits and even local travel for politicians general public expenditures will also be reduced beijing cut vat rates to 16 for manufacturing and 10 for agriculture transport service construction leasing services wholesale and retail sales and real estate the vat rate of 6 bracket remains for financial telecom and other services the three percentage points cut off the manufacturing vat tax was within market estimates but the other vat reductions were less than expected nomura securities economist ting lu estimates the announced vat rate cuts could save taxpayers around 617 billion yuan below market expectations but that is because a considerable proportion of high tech enterprises are already benefitting from tax reductions due to special tax treatments within the social security tax system provincial governments will be given more leeway as to how much they can cut from paychecks li said companies do not have to pay for back sst taxes owed in china an employer s contribution rate for pensions can be cut to 16 depending on the province where the company has set up shop for example the pension tax rates for employers in some cities such as guangzhou and shenzhen have been reduced to 14 for some time now it is unclear if those important china cities will lower rates even more if investors were hoping for the equivalent of a c corp tax break their hopes were dashed by keqiang on tuesday the same goes for real estate this year s report maintained the same line on real estate as it did last year with the goal of maintaining a stable and healthy development of the property sector seeing how china is a top down centrally managed economy li said electricity costs for manufacturing industrial and commercial use should be cut by 10 sell china utilities monetary policy 2018 bloomberg finance lp interest rates remain low and dependent on inflation inflation is forecast to come in under 3 premier li called for more efforts to resolve the financing difficulties in the corporate sector especially for small and medium size enterprises he requested the central bank devise more targeted reserve ratio requirement cuts so smaller banks wopuld open up their accounts to loan to smaller businesses in china he also said he wanted to see larger banks increase credit supply to the market especially long term bank loans for manufacturing he said he will require the large state owned banks to increase loans to smaller businesses by more than 30 this year so china has a mandate from the government now to lend to small and midsize businesses market access china s national development reform commission chairman he lifeng said during a press conference on wednesday that the country should open up agriculture mining manufacturing and more service industries to foreign companies consumer spending accounted for 76 5 of gdp growth in 2018 and has become the floor in which the chinese economy stands on in case of tariff escalation from washington one of the takeaways from this week s npc talks was beijing s interest in boosting domestic consumption it ranked fourth on the task list of the 2019 government work report compared to seventh in the 2018 report ting of nomura pointed out this is a sign that beijing is increasingly recognizing short term headwinds and is attempting to stimulate domestic consumption to stem the slowdown he says 2019 bloomberg finance lp yesterday s working report also mentioned deepening reforms in electricity oil gas and railway industries which implies these mostly state run industries could experience more forceful reforms this year more importantly equal treatment to foreign companies under chinese law was also a highlight though it is also unclear if this goes into effect immediately unfair treatment by chinese regulators and the courts is a top concern among u s businesses in china according to a recent survey by the american chamber of commerce in china as far as more opening up of the chinese economy is concerned this year s working report on foreign investment went from promoting stable foreign investment growth last year to increasing the attraction to foreign capital last year marked the 40th anniversary of china s opening to the world the report also promises to further allow for the operation of wholly foreign owned enterprises in more industries this suggests china is determined to have a more open attitude to foreign capital though this could be rhetoric designed to placate washington into thinking they are somehow winning the trade war by forcing china to become a freer market so far this year investors have seen a massive rally in chinese stocks thanks to increased exposure to mainland equities in the msci china index and positive developments in the trade war but investors who are expecting more stimulus might end up being disappointed unless state banks start handing out loans to any company out there just to keep gdp within target it s possible so long as the market perceives tariffs are no longer going up and china may or may not benefit from expanding credit then china stocks are likely to recover from last year s bear market
tax havens are locations around the world where wealthy individuals criminals and terrorists as well as governments and government agencies such as the cia banks corporations hedge funds international organizations such as the vatican and crime syndicates such as the mafia can stash their money so that they can avoid regulation and oversight and very often evade tax according to nicholas shaxson tax havens are now at the heart of the global economy which is why as he explains it the term tax haven is a bit of a misnomer because such places aren t just about tax what they sell is escape from the laws rules and taxes of jurisdictions elsewhere usually with secrecy as their prime offering see the tax haven in the heart of britain a tax haven or secrecy jurisdiction then is a place that seeks to attract business by offering politically stable facilities to help people or entities get around the rules laws and regulations of jurisdictions elsewhere see treasure islands tax havens and the men who stole the world tax havens are a vitally important part of the global infrastructure of corruption and criminality see giant leak of offshore financial records exposes global array of crime and corruption that enables privileged individuals and their organizations to legally and illegally steal money from the rest of us particularly those in developing countries and to have the services of a vast network of accountants bankers lawyers and politicians often from captured legislatures to help them do it and to ensure that they get away with it how many tax havens are there where are they how much money do they have who uses them why how do they work why does all this matter to us and what can we do about them tax havens how many and where are they in his book treasure islands tax havens and the men who stole the world author and financial journalist nicholas shaxson identified about sixty secrecy jurisdictions or offshore groups around the world which he divided into four categories as follows the most important category by far is those tax havens that form the spider s network of havens centred on the city of london it has three main layers there are two inner rings britain s crown dependencies of jersey guernsey which includes the sub havens of sark alderney and brecqhou and the isle of man and its overseas territories such as the cayman islands bermuda the british virgin islands and gibralter which are substantially controlled by britain the third layer is an outer ring with a more diverse array of havens like hong kong singapore the bahamas dubai and ireland which are outside britain s direct control but have strong historical and current links to that country and the city of london which i will discuss below this network controls almost one half of all international bank assets the second category of tax havens is those in europe notably including switzerland luxembourg see explore the documents luxembourg leaks database the netherlands belgium and austria as well as microstates such as liechtenstein and monaco while geneva bankers had sheltered the secret money of european elites since at least the eighteenth century the european havens got going during world war i as governments raised taxes sharply to pay for the war the third category of tax havens is that focused on the united states it has three tiers as well at the federal level the us government offers a range of tax exemptions secrecy provisions and laws designed to attract foreign money this means for example that us banks can legally accept proceeds from a range of crimes as long as the crimes are committed overseas the second tier involves individual us states such as florida where central south american elites do their banking and the countries adversely impacted are prevented by us secrecy provisions from accessing relevant data and where much mob and drugs money is hidden too delaware nevada and wyoming where even terrorist money is protected by secrecy provisions the third tier of the us network is the overseas satellites such as the american virgin islands the marshall islands liberia and panama with the latter according to jeffrey robinson being one of the filthiest money laundering sinks in the world see the sink terror crime and dirty money in the offshore world as shaxson notes offshore finance has quietly been at the heart of neoconservative schemes to project us power around the globe for years few people have noticed the fourth category of tax havens identified by shaxson includes those that do not fit in the categories above such as somalia and uganda the incomplete list of tax havens on the website tax havens of the world will give you some idea of where these secrecy jurisdictions are located but there are important omissions in this list notably including the city of london corporation for a brief look at 15 tax havens again notably excluding some of the most important and some of the corporations that use them see what are the world s best tax havens and for a highly instructive and utterly sobering video documentary on british tax havens see the spider s web britain s second empire this documentary will inform you among many more important things that the building housing her majesty s revenue and customs the uk tax office is owned by an offshore company in bermuda to summarize the central aspect of the development of tax havens following world war ii the british establishment an old boys network of privileged elites had carved out a lucrative vehicle for themselves in the offshore world after the demise of empire they transformed themselves from administrators of empire to financial handlers for the global elite and multinational corporations see the spider s web britain s second empire before concluding this section it is worth emphasizing that as shaxson explains it the offshore world is not a bunch of independent states exercising their sovereign rights to set their laws and tax systems as they see fit it is a set of networks of influence controlled by the world s major powers notably britain and the united states each network is deeply interconnected with the others he goes on the world s most important tax havens are not exotic palm fringed islands as many people suppose but some of the world s most powerful countries shaxson quotes marshall langer a prominent supporter of secrecy jurisdictions it does not surprise anyone when i tell them that the most important tax haven in the world is an island they are surprised however when i tell them that the island is manhattan moreover the second most important tax haven is located on an island it is called the city of london the city of london corporation what is the city of london corporation also known as the square mile it is a 1 22 square mile slab of prime central london real estate that stretches from the thames at victoria embankment clockwise up through fleet street the barbican centre then to liverpool street in the north east then back down to the thames just west of the tower of london see treasure islands tax havens and the men who stole the world according to shaxson the city of london corporation the modern period of which dates from 1067 yes that is not a typing error is the local government authority for the 1 2 square mile slab of prime real estate in central london that is the city of london the corporation is an ancient semi alien entity lodged inside the british nation state a prehistoric monster which had mysteriously survived into the modern world as a 19th century would be city reformer put it importantly shaxson explains the role of the city of london corporation as a municipal authority is its least important attribute this is a hugely resourced international offshore lobbying group pushing for international financial deregulation tax cutting and tax havenry around the world moreover it is the hub of a global network of tax havens sucking up offshore trillions from around the world and sending it or the business of handling it to london notably so powerful is the city of london that no sovereign or government of britain in a thousand years has had the courage to seriously take it on and attempt to subject it to british government control see the tax haven in the heart of britain how much money is in tax havens so how much of the world s wealth is stashed in tax havens around the globe according to the tax justice network in its 2012 report written by james s henry the price of offshore revisited new estimates for missing global private wealth income inequality and lost taxes a significant fraction of global private financial wealth by our estimates at least 21 to 32 trillion as of 2010 has been invested virtually tax free through the world s still expanding black hole of more than 80 offshore secrecy jurisdictions we believe this range to be conservative he goes on to emphasize that this is just financial wealth a big share of the real estate yachts racehorses gold bricks and many other things that count as non financial wealth are also owned via offshore structures where it is impossible to identify the owners henry also notes that given that credit suisse estimated global wealth in 2011 at 231 trillion the amount of money in secrecy jurisdictions is conservatively estimated at 10 of global wealth but other figures do indeed suggest this estimate is low shaxson cites compelling evidence that more than half of world trade passes at least on paper through tax havens over half of all banking assets and a third of foreign direct investment by multinational corporations are routed offshore moreover as long ago as 2008 the us government accountability office reported that 83 of the 100 biggest corporations in the usa had subsidiaries in tax havens and the following year using a broader definition the tax justice network discovered that ninety nine of europe s hundred largest companies used offshore subsidiaries and in each country the largest user by far was a bank see treasure islands tax havens and the men who stole the world in any case the most recent estimate by the tax justice network indicates tax losses to profit shifting by multinational companies a pplying a methodology developed by researchers at the international monetary fund to an improved dataset of around 500 billion a year see new estimates reveal the extent of tax avoidance by multinationals to reiterate then on the understanding that these estimates are probably quite low by 2010 between us21 and us32 trillion had been taken out of circulation so that it was beyond the laws financial regulations and taxes that the rest of us cannot escape but that figure has been added to by half a trillion dollars each year since by moving more money into tax havens and don t forget this figure does not include non financial wealth how many gold bricks yachts artworks and racehorses do you own and have stashed away somewhere free of scrutiny who uses tax havens and why as i mentioned above tax havens are used by wealthy individuals including businesspeople sports and pop stars criminals and terrorists as well as governments and their agencies banks corporations such as amazon and google international organizations and crime syndicates such as the medellin cartel while motives vary in essence the lack of regulation and oversight as well as tax evasion are the reasons that individuals and organizations use them an individual might want to hide stolen wealth to evade tax or cheat a divorced spouse out of their share of the family fortune abank corporation crime syndicate internationalor terrorist organization might want to evade scrutiny of the source of their money and orevade tax on windfall or even ongoing profits legal and or otherwise a government might want to hide the dirty money it uses to finance black ops that is illegal and secret military violence such as that carried out by the cia but there are myriad explanations in john christensen s analysis of over 100 offshore clients of accounting firm deloitte touche he studied in jersey he found that the clients were engaging in insider trading market rigging failure to disclose conflicts of interest weapons trading illicit political donations contract kickbacks bribery fraudulent invoicing trade mispricing and tax evasion see the spider s web britain s second empire most people have heard of the money stashed away by corrupt dictators like suharto in indonesia ferdinand marcos in the philippines and mobuto sese seko of zaire now democratic republic of the congo each of whom stole from the people of their country however they could only do this with the help of western enablers and ongoing elite resistance to developing country attempts to create a more transparent and fairer process for collecting tax on cross border financial flows as a result alex cobham of the tax justice network observes worldwide developing nations lose in excess of 1trillion per year in capital flight and tax evasion to wealthy countries see the spider s web britain s second empire but these more public examples while terrible tend to obscure two important facts the amount stolen from sub saharan africans for example between 1970 and 2008 was at least five times the total amount of their foreign debt during that period see the spider s web britain s second empire and by highlighting these examples attention is drawn away from even worse and ongoing examples of such criminality by those corrupt criminal individuals and organizations including banks accountancy and legal firms corporations international organizations crime syndicates and governments committed to using outright theft fraud money laundering and other devices to steal wealth from ordinary people all over the world so for example if one follows the money trails of various lucrative financial operations some technically legal but immoral and others simply illegal apart from the world s major corporations one quickly comes across the names of the major and well known banks and financial institutions such as the bank of england barclays goldman sachs jpmorgan chase the big four accountancy firms deloitte ernst young ey kpmg and pricewaterhousecoopers and elite lawyers such as those in london s magic circle like clifford chance mourant du feu jeune and slaughter and may see for example treasure islands tax havens and the men who stole the world new estimates reveal the extent of tax avoidance by multinationals and looting with putin apparently like major corporations and crime syndicates few banks accountancy firms and lawyers have ethics policies that require them to follow the law and to exercise due diligence check out a client before signing a contract so that they can steer clear of handling illegal and immoral profits especially if they are monstrous in fact according to a us senate report virtually every major bank in the world especially the biggest in north america and europe holds accounts for offshore banks and or banks in suspect jurisdictions see the sink terror crime and dirty money in the offshore world as eva joly mep vice chair of the panama papers committee of the european parliament succinctly puts it ordinary people are paying taxes rich people are not see the spider s web britain s second empire the vatican but perhaps the example which best illustrates the moral depravity of those who use tax havens is the vatican in his carefully researched book operation gladio the unholy alliance between the vatican the cia and the mafia author paul l williams recounts the efforts of the cia former nazis the sicilian american mafia the vatican and even freemasonry to resist an anticipated postwar invasion of western europe by those godless communists in the soviet union by establishing stay behind units clandestine military and paramilitary units throughout the countries of europe belgium denmark italy netherlands norway portugal led by former nazis and composed of die hard fascist fanatics this alliance to fight the cold war against the former soviet union and the rising tide of progressive governments in europe and the rest of the world particularly as the us war on vietnam gathered pace led as williams chillingly puts it to the toppling of governments wholesale slaughter and financial devastation around the world it was also of course the forerunner to its equivalent operation condor to resist and destroy if possible the spread of progressive movements ranging from communism to liberation theology throughout central south america while the vatican played a number of unsavory roles in this alliance includingits facilitation of massive numbers of heroin addictions its use of counterfeit securities participation in false flag attacks that killed thousands and strings of gangland slayings support of military juntas that massacred tens of thousands and the purging of progressive priests including archbishop óscar romero of san salvadorand two jesuit priests denounced by fr jorge mario bergoglio now pope francis in argentina see who is pope francis jorge mario bergoglio and argentina s dirty war and causing the financial destitution of thousands of families one of its key ongoing functions designed to maximize the vatican s power while highlighting its moral and spiritual bankruptcy was to act as god s banker for many of these operations see operation gladio the unholy alliance between the vatican the cia and the mafia it did this for example by accepting mafia medellin cartel collected drugs money for a 15 20 cut into the vatican bank technically istituto per le opere di religione or institute for the works of religion and then laundering it through its shell companies such as cisalpine overseas bank astolfine sa united trading corporation erin sa bellatrix sa belrose sa starfield sa and nordeurop establishment in tax havens in the bahamas liechtenstein luxembourg panama and switzerland with the cia providing services such as the transport of mafia medellin cocaine to drug dealers in the us its share of the drug profits cycled through its own cia controlled banks including continental illinois castle bank trust and bank of credit and commerce international but eventually involving many of the most prestigious banks in the us as the money was passed to the vatican bank were used to finance key aspects of operations gladio and condor with weapons also supplied by the cia from nato arsenals but there was plenty of vatican money in these operations too as an aside so devastating was the fallout from the ongoing exposure of the many aspects of vatican corruption that by the beginning of the twenty first century roman catholic membership was falling by 400 000 per year in the usa alone but the trend was even stronger in europe with magnificent churches and cathedrals becoming museums visited solely by tourists parishes being boarded up seminaries and convents closed and parochial schools consolidated and this was before the plague of pedophilia had fully hit further decimating the church s tattered reputation to this day the vatican bank remains one of the world s leading laundries for dirty money see operation gladio the unholy alliance between the vatican the cia and the mafia how do tax havens work each tax haven offers its own unique combination of services after all it is a tough market competing for the world s wealth and so each jurisdiction has developed its own set of services designed to maximize its attractiveness to potential clients in essence this means that there is some ongoing competition to reduce regulatory and oversight requirements so that each tax haven can attract clientele this has become so extreme that basic requirements of banking for those who do it legally such as proof of identity are not required in the offshore world in fact even your true name can be withheld if you wish it is easier to avoid any risk of embarrassment from exposure this way as a result virtually any jurisdiction will open an account or as many accounts as you want in whatever names you specify then usually employing a variety of devices ranging from secret bank accounts nominee directors usually locals who play no part in the organization bar give it their name and structures such as shell companies that exist on paper and perhaps a wall plaque somewhere but nothing else and trusts which unlike the legitimate version appear to separate responsibility and control from the benefits of ownership but actually do not to processes such as transfer pricing a technique by which companies shift paper profits into low tax countries and costs into high tax countries to minimize or eliminate tax payments and often employing a convoluted process that rapidly shifts monies through several jurisdictions so that it becomes untraceable because authorities must get permission to access each jurisdiction in turn in any effort to trace the money profits are effectively hidden and any accountability to authorities of any kind utterly eliminated see treasure islands tax havens and the men who stole the world for one simple example of such a strategy employing a technique known as the double irish dutch sandwich which is legal see google shifted 23bn to tax haven bermuda in 2017 filing shows but you can read other examples here the tech giants will never pay their fair share of taxes unless we make them and 7 corporate giants accused of evading billions in taxes why does the existence of tax havens matter to us well the simple answer to this question is that just a fraction of the money hidden in tax havens would feed clothe house and provide clean water medical care and educational opportunities to everyone on earth it would eliminate the 100 000 deaths by starvation related diseases each day it would eliminate poverty and homelessness and as one byproduct of having these material needs met it would facilitate the emergence of an informed engaged and empowered human population to tackle the vast range of environmental climate and military threats that currently threaten biosphere collapse and imminent human extinction see human extinction by 2026 a last ditch strategy to fight for human survival as professor prem sikka puts it more simply because of the penetration by financial services executives of the british state including the treasury it deprives people of opportunities to have healthcare education security justice and ultimately a fulfilling life see the spider s web britain s second empire fundamentally then tax havens and their secrecy are at the heart of those elite institutions and processes that functionally undermine democracy and give extraordinary power to certain anonymous individuals and their entities without accountability see the spider s web britain s second empire of course the elites that control the tax haven networks are not about to let this change tax havens are simply too important as part of the global infrastructure for maintaining elite profit power and privilege and for resisting grassroots efforts to bring peace justice and ecological sanity to our world and that is why they are protected by government legislation and legal systems with an army of accountants auditors bankers businesspeople lawyers and politicians ensuring that they remain protected so don t forget laws are designed to control and punish you no matter how trivial your infringement a parking fine a littering offence a petty theft but if you have enough money the law simply does not exist and you can evade taxes legally and in the full knowledge that your vast profits even from immorally acquired wealth such as sex trafficking gun running endangered species trafficking conflict diamonds and drug trafficking are lawful and will escape regulation and oversight of any kind see the rule of law unjust and violent let me give a personal example i have been a war tax resister since 1983 i have a conscientious objection to paying taxes to the australian government to deploy military forces in other countries to kill people in my name so instead of paying taxes to kill for many years i donated the equivalent amount to organizations engaged in peace development environment and human rights work and to pay the rent for my use of indigenous land as some of many outcomes to this conscientious and highly public resistance garnering national media attention at times in 1991 i was bankrupted in 1992 i was convicted of contempt of court for my conscientious refusal to cooperate with the bankruptcy trustee and in 1993 my passport was seized in 1999 i was advised that i will be bankrupt forever because of my ongoing conscientious refusal to finance the killing in the same period since 1983 trillions and trillions of dollars of tax have been illegally and secretly evaded as wealthy individuals and corporations criminals and crime syndicates international organizations and governments channel their incomes and profits through tax havens laws and legal systems throughout the world make this possible and provided it is done correctly it is quite straightforward to avoidany penalties for secretly evading payment of taxes or hiding money acquired through criminal activity but the point as you can see is that tax evasion by wealthy individuals and corporations meant that many of these individuals and corporations didn t pay taxes to killpeople either they just didn t pay taxes at all o f course their motive was personal gain their way was legal they incurred no penalty and of course they didn t pay an equivalent amount to support peace and justice causes more fundamentally however the trillions of dollars they took from the global economy were made by killing and exploiting people and the planet in a significant variety of other ways ranging from sex trafficking gun running conflict diamonds and trafficking in drugs and endangered species to simply starving people to death at the rate of 100 000 people each day by managing the global economy using tax havens as a primary tool to extract maximum profit richard brooks documents how this legal exploitation occurs in another way in his book the great tax robbery how britain became a tax haven for fat cats and big business the vast tax evasion by elites in britain including by diverting funds through tax havens attracts just five prosecutions each year per 1 billion of evasion of direct taxes in contrast benefits fraud by those on unemployment and disability pensions attract 9 000 prosecutions each year per 1 billion of fraud so theft by the poor warrants the full force of the law but not theft by elites who write the law and largely control the political and legal processes in relation to it hence under the guise of relationship taxing that is building a relationship between tax authorities and corporate executives and tailoring tax payments to corporate wishes to the extent the law allows corporations have long known that if you don t like the law we ll see what we can do as is obvious from this example attempts at government reform including to defeat tax havens in the direction of making elites financially and legally accountable both nationally and internationally for the responsibilities which the rest of us cannot escape are invariably for show and in any case achieve zero of substance for example the attempt to approve a blacklist of tax havens at the g20 gathering in 2009 was resisted by the chinese premier on behalf of chinese elites who like other national elites keen to have political control but judicial separation from their offshore centres opposed the listing of notorious havens hong kong and macau see treasure islands tax havens and the men who stole the world the global elite is clearly in control with national governments and international organizations powerlessly doing as instructed so complete is this control in fact that brooks notes that in britain anti tax avoidance laws had to be relaxed to accommodate companies tax avoidance schemes brooks concludes that british taxation policy really had been so comprehensively captured by the world s biggest corporations that screw the poor policies could be written into the statute books at their whim without a pang of conscience being felt anywhere in whitehall clearly however his comment can be applied to virtually any government in the world so does it matter to you that these tax havens exist and do what they do what can be done about tax havens authors such as nicholas shaxson and richard brooks suggest a raft of measures to correct the large number of faults that facilitate the secrecy protection from regulation and tax evasion that individuals corporations organizations criminals and terrorists utilize in tax havens for shaxson these include financial reforms such as blacklisting of tax havens so that their rogue state status is public knowledge greater transparency for example through government sharing of information about the local income and assets of each other s citizens and by requiring multinational corporate activities in each country to be made visible rather than hidden behind international figures promoting the needs of developing countries which need their tax bases protected far more than they need aid or debt relief confronting the british spider s web of tax havens by abolishing the city of london corporation and submerging it into a unified and fully democratic london taxing an entire multinational group as a single unit and then allocating the appropriate amounts of its income out to the different jurisdictions in which it was earned and allow it to be taxed as each jurisdiction decides onshore tax reform such as a land value tax because land cannot be moved offshore and so tax on it must be paid locally and by a direct distribution of mineral wealth in any country to each of its inhabitants who can then be taxed tackling the enablers the accountants lawyers individual bankers businesspeople and not just the clients so that they go to jail rethinking the meaning of corporate responsibility because corporations are given a wealth of capital in public infrastructure an educated and healthy workforce with which to work so that corporations are transparent about their affairs and pay tax as part of their corporate responsibility re evaluating the meaning of corruption insiders abusing the common good in secrecy and getting away with it and so worsening inequality and entrenching vested interests and unaccountable power so that we see more clearly all of the actors and their activities and changing the culture that fawns over people who abuse the system for personal gain see treasure islands tax havens and the men who stole the world and some progress appears to be occurring along lines he suggests for example a version of automatic information exchange aie by which governments make sure that essential information is made available to other jurisdictions as a matter of routine has been discussed by the oecd and while full of loopholes see loophole usa the vortex shaped hole in global financial transparency some commitments have been made for the list of commitments as at november 2018 see aeoi commitments however the usa has not made this commitment and while switzerland for example finds this objectionable see the u s hasn t signed the aeoi agreement reciprocity demanded the reality is that it makes little difference for example ico services which specializes in the formation of offshore companies and offshore banking will assist you to get around the aeoi requirement their website advertises that asset holders need to start looking for alternative jurisdictions for protecting their assets there are some reputable jurisdictions that are still outside the aeoi e g cyprus but u s states of delaware and some others shouldn t be dismissed but if you want a more established name to help you take advantage of a tax haven in the usa you really can t go past rothschild co so to check out what they are offering here is rothschild s primer how to launder money in u s real estate and avoid blacklists moreover the aeoi agreement outlaws bank secrecy but not trust secrecy which dates from the crusades on which the british model is based the trust lies at the core of the british secrecy model so it does not address the cornerstone of british tax haven secrecy and explains why the british were happy to see the cayman islands commit to the aeoi in short the british government would be happy to kill off bank secrecy so that they can capture a larger market share based on trust secrecy see the spider s web britain s second empire separately from this initiative in 2018 the uk parliament enacted a new law requiring its overseas territories including notorious tax havens like bermuda the cayman islands and the british virgin islands to start disclosing the owners of corporations they register by 2020 in theory this could shut down a huge amount of offshore tax evasion and other financial crimes because individuals from anywhere in the world including the united states have long been able to set up secret corporations in these tax havens to stash their money see new uk law may shut down the biggest tax havens aside from the u s however while the report pointed out that the new law obviously does not impact the usa or of course switzerland or and the easy rerouting options available if these havens are effectively or even actually shut down it failed to mention that this initiative does not in any way address the city of london corporation so the impact of this initiative must be very limited unless it is followed by some pretty drastic initiatives in westminster washington bern and elsewhere in summary while one cannot disagree with any of shaxson s fine suggestions or be displeased that public pressure has led to some effort being made by the oecd and the uk parliament to address elements of the tax haven scourge the reality is that the extent of the changes necessary are not going to happen without enormous grassroots pressure strategically applied and they are very unlikely to happen as reforms of the existing capitalist system this is simply because the global elite is solidly in control of the institutions and processes of global capitalism including its compliant governments and international organizations and will readily stymie any attempt at serious reform of tax havenry particularly given the number of major reforms needed and the number of nations in which these reforms must be enacted to state two obvious examples the city of london corporation has not existed for 1 000 years because it has no defense and the changes noted above have only made the us more attractive as a secrecy jurisdiction meanwhile with the aim of promoting financial innovation switzerland has recently made things easier for smaller financial technology companies thus making tax havenry more attractive to those who might not have otherwise considered it see swiss watchdog to propose looser anti money laundering rules for fintechs so given that most tax havens are protected by host government legislation and there is no international mechanism to control them the tax haven industrygenerally is not under threat of being held to account in any significant way and despite the more elaborate explanation offered above there is a simple reason for this unofficially of course illegal money laundered through tax havens has become an essential and sometimes stabilizing element of the global financial system see drug money saved banks in global crisis claims un advisor so what can we do that will make a difference given the deeply entrenched and long standing nature of this problem clearly it needs to be addressed at various levels fundamentally we can nurture our children so that we do not destroy their conscience see my promise to children remember all of those corrupt criminal accountants bankers businesspeople priests and popes lawyers and politicians that kept creeping up in the discussion above the people who maintain the entire infrastructure that allows tax havens to exist and those who manage and profit from it too do they care about you do they care about the people in africa asia and central south america who starve as a result of the types of policies that allow tax havens to exist and function do they care about those driven into poverty and homelessness in modern industrial economies because vast sums are drained out of them and hidden in secrecy jurisdictions do they care about the people killed by the military and other violence from which they profit and then hide the proceeds to evade tax do they care about the earth fundamentally do they care about themselves of course not but this is only because they are extraordinarily psychologically damaged individuals see the global elite is insane revisited with a more complete explanation in why violence and fearless psychology and fearful psychology principles and practice if we inflict enormous violence on a child throughout their childhood to compel their obedience how can we expect them to grow up to lead a life of integrity based on their conscience courage compassion empathy and love those who use tax havens are truly poor little rich boys and girls see love denied the psychology of materialism violence and war and why set up a shell company in panama the psychology driving illicit financial flows beyond tackling the problem at its source however we can also tackle manifestations of the problem but not by lobbying elites and their political agents there are no votes in it in any case to control this depravity for which they are well rewarded for a start we can boycott all of the major private banks in favor of those smaller or member owned banks that have a serious commitment to peace justice and ecological sustainability or we can seek out equivalent institutions like credit unions we can also create public banks based on ethical principles see what are public banks and how do they operate an introduction we can boycott large corporations like amazon apple gap google ikea microsoft and starbucks that use tax havens none of these corporations is a monopoly there are alternatives which can be investigated and employed assuming we can t go without some version of the product or service they offer whenever you can find a locally owned outlet that offers a local product or service we can boycott the catholic church god does not ask that you morally or financially support a corrupt organization that doesn t understand or represent morality and spirituality remember it was jesus who threw the moneychangers out of the temple if our conscience speaks loudly enough we can decline employment by any organization that is unethical such as those that use tax havens we can refuse to gamble refuse to buy the services of a sex worker who might even be illegally trafficked into the work refuse to buy the products of endangered species see for example killing elephants for pet food condemned and refuse to use illicit drugs these products and services are virtually always offered by industries controlled by criminal organizations so by buying them you are only harming yourself and or other people or species about whom you could choose to exercise a duty of care while also not contributing to the diversion of financial resources into tax havens we can encourage unions with members who work for organizations using tax havens to take a stand on the issue we can support existing organizations that work on the problem preferably those that offer grassroots alternatives the tax justice network an activist think tank and its sister organization the global alliance for tax justice campaign for systemic change if we are genuinely ambitious we can develop comprehensive nonviolent strategies to compel particular individuals and organizations to desist from using tax havens or even compel countries to close down tax havens see nonviolent campaign strategy this can easily be part of a larger strategy to transform the global economy into one that satisfies human and ecological needs particularly given the imminence of biosphere collapse as noted above see the flame tree project to save life on earth if violence and exploitation in all of their guises concern you consider signing the online pledge of the people s charter to create a nonviolent world so here is a final question for you to consider what might the world look like if all those trillions of dollars were being shared and spent where they are most needed robert j burrowes has a lifetime commitment to understanding and ending human violence he has done extensive research since 1966 in an effort to understand why human beings are violent and has been a nonviolent activist since 1981 he is the author of why violence his email address is and his website is here
by robert j burrowes daylesford australia 6 march 2019 tax havens are locations around the world where wealthy individuals criminals and terrorists as well as governments and government agencies such as the cia banks corporations hedge funds international organizations such as the vatican and crime syndicates such as the mafia can stash their money so that they can avoid regulation and oversight and very often evade tax according to nicholas shaxson tax havens are now at the heart of the global economy which is why as he explains it the term tax haven is a bit of a misnomer because such places aren t just about tax what they sell is escape from the laws rules and taxes of jurisdictions elsewhere usually with secrecy as their prime offering see the tax haven in the heart of britain a tax haven or secrecy jurisdiction then is a place that seeks to attract business by offering politically stable facilities to help people or entities get around the rules laws and regulations of jurisdictions elsewhere see treasure islands tax havens and the men who stole the world tax havens are a vitally important part of the global infrastructure of corruption and criminality see giant leak of offshore financial records exposes global array of crime and corruption that enables privileged individuals and their organizations to legally and illegally steal money from the rest of us particularly those in developing countries and to have the services of a vast network of accountants bankers lawyers and politicians often from captured legislatures to help them do it and to ensure that they get away with it how many tax havens are there where are they how much money do they have who uses them why how do they work why does all this matter to us and what can we do about them tax havens how many and where are they in his book treasure islands tax havens and the men who stole the world author and financial journalist nicholas shaxson identified about sixty secrecy jurisdictions or offshore groups around the world which he divided into four categories as follows the most important category by far is those tax havens that form the spider s network of havens centred on the city of london it has three main layers there are two inner rings britain s crown dependencies of jersey guernsey which includes the sub havens of sark alderney and brecqhou and the isle of man and its overseas territories such as the cayman islands bermuda the british virgin islands and gibralter which are substantially controlled by britain the third layer is an outer ring with a more diverse array of havens like hong kong singapore the bahamas dubai and ireland which are outside britain s direct control but have strong historical and current links to that country and the city of london which i will discuss below this network controls almost one half of all international bank assets the second category of tax havens is those in europe notably including switzerland luxembourg see explore the documents luxembourg leaks database the netherlands belgium and austria as well as microstates such as liechtenstein and monaco while geneva bankers had sheltered the secret money of european elites since at least the eighteenth century the european havens got going during world war i as governments raised taxes sharply to pay for the war the third category of tax havens is that focused on the united states it has three tiers as well at the federal level the us government offers a range of tax exemptions secrecy provisions and laws designed to attract foreign money this means for example that us banks can legally accept proceeds from a range of crimes as long as the crimes are committed overseas the second tier involves individual us states such as florida where central south american elites do their banking and the countries adversely impacted are prevented by us secrecy provisions from accessing relevant data and where much mob and drugs money is hidden too delaware nevada and wyoming where even terrorist money is protected by secrecy provisions the third tier of the us network is the overseas satellites such as the american virgin islands the marshall islands liberia and panama with the latter according to jeffrey robinson being one of the filthiest money laundering sinks in the world see the sink terror crime and dirty money in the offshore world as shaxson notes offshore finance has quietly been at the heart of neoconservative schemes to project us power around the globe for years few people have noticed the fourth category of tax havens identified by shaxson includes those that do not fit in the categories above such as somalia and uganda the incomplete list of tax havens on the website tax havens of the world will give you some idea of where these secrecy jurisdictions are located but there are important omissions in this list notably including the city of london corporation for a brief look at 15 tax havens again notably excluding some of the most important and some of the corporations that use them see what are the world s best tax havens and for a highly instructive and utterly sobering video documentary on british tax havens see the spider s web britain s second empire this documentary will inform you among many more important things that the building housing her majesty s revenue and customs the uk tax office is owned by an offshore company in bermuda to summarize the central aspect of the development of tax havens following world war ii the british establishment an old boys network of privileged elites had carved out a lucrative vehicle for themselves in the offshore world after the demise of empire they transformed themselves from administrators of empire to financial handlers for the global elite and multinational corporations see the spider s web britain s second empire before concluding this section it is worth emphasizing that as shaxson explains it the offshore world is not a bunch of independent states exercising their sovereign rights to set their laws and tax systems as they see fit it is a set of networks of influence controlled by the world s major powers notably britain and the united states each network is deeply interconnected with the others he goes on the world s most important tax havens are not exotic palm fringed islands as many people suppose but some of the world s most powerful countries shaxson quotes marshall langer a prominent supporter of secrecy jurisdictions it does not surprise anyone when i tell them that the most important tax haven in the world is an island they are surprised however when i tell them that the island is manhattan moreover the second most important tax haven is located on an island it is called the city of london the city of london corporation what is the city of london corporation also known as the square mile it is a 1 22 square mile slab of prime central london real estate that stretches from the thames at victoria embankment clockwise up through fleet street the barbican centre then to liverpool street in the north east then back down to the thames just west of the tower of london see treasure islands tax havens and the men who stole the world according to shaxson the city of london corporation the modern period of which dates from 1067 yes that is not a typing error is the local government authority for the 1 2 square mile slab of prime real estate in central london that is the city of london the corporation is an ancient semi alien entity lodged inside the british nation state a prehistoric monster which had mysteriously survived into the modern world as a 19th century would be city reformer put it importantly shaxson explains the role of the city of london corporation as a municipal authority is its least important attribute this is a hugely resourced international offshore lobbying group pushing for international financial deregulation tax cutting and tax havenry around the world moreover it is the hub of a global network of tax havens sucking up offshore trillions from around the world and sending it or the business of handling it to london notably so powerful is the city of london that no sovereign or government of britain in a thousand years has had the courage to seriously take it on and attempt to subject it to british government control see the tax haven in the heart of britain how much money is in tax havens so how much of the world s wealth is stashed in tax havens around the globe according to the tax justice network in its 2012 report written by james s henry the price of offshore revisited new estimates for missing global private wealth income inequality and lost taxes a significant fraction of global private financial wealth by our estimates at least 21 to 32 trillion as of 2010 has been invested virtually tax free through the world s still expanding black hole of more than 80 offshore secrecy jurisdictions we believe this range to be conservative he goes on to emphasize that this is just financial wealth a big share of the real estate yachts racehorses gold bricks and many other things that count as non financial wealth are also owned via offshore structures where it is impossible to identify the owners henry also notes that given that credit suisse estimated global wealth in 2011 at 231 trillion the amount of money in secrecy jurisdictions is conservatively estimated at 10 of global wealth but other figures do indeed suggest this estimate is low shaxson cites compelling evidence that more than half of world trade passes at least on paper through tax havens over half of all banking assets and a third of foreign direct investment by multinational corporations are routed offshore moreover as long ago as 2008 the us government accountability office reported that 83 of the 100 biggest corporations in the usa had subsidiaries in tax havens and the following year using a broader definition the tax justice network discovered that ninety nine of europe s hundred largest companies used offshore subsidiaries and in each country the largest user by far was a bank see treasure islands tax havens and the men who stole the world in any case the most recent estimate by the tax justice network indicates tax losses to profit shifting by multinational companies a pplying a methodology developed by researchers at the international monetary fund to an improved dataset of around 500 billion a year see new estimates reveal the extent of tax avoidance by multinationals to reiterate then on the understanding that these estimates are probably quite low by 2010 between us21 and us32 trillion had been taken out of circulation so that it was beyond the laws financial regulations and taxes that the rest of us cannot escape but that figure has been added to by half a trillion dollars each year since by moving more money into tax havens and don t forget this figure does not include non financial wealth how many gold bricks yachts artworks and racehorses do you own and have stashed away somewhere free of scrutiny who uses tax havens and why as i mentioned above tax havens are used by wealthy individuals including businesspeople sports and pop stars criminals and terrorists as well as governments and their agencies banks corporations such as amazon and google international organizations and crime syndicates such as the medellin cartel while motives vary in essence the lack of regulation and oversight as well as tax evasion are the reasons that individuals and organizations use them an individual might want to hide stolen wealth to evade tax or cheat a divorced spouse out of their share of the family fortune a bank corporation crime syndicate international or terrorist organization might want to evade scrutiny of the source of their money and or evade tax on windfall or even ongoing profits legal and or otherwise a government might want to hide the dirty money it uses to finance black ops that is illegal and secret military violence such as that carried out by the cia but there are myriad explanations in john christensen s analysis of over 100 offshore clients of accounting firm deloitte touche he studied in jersey he found that the clients were engaging in insider trading market rigging failure to disclose conflicts of interest weapons trading illicit political donations contract kickbacks bribery fraudulent invoicing trade mispricing and tax evasion see the spider s web britain s second empire most people have heard of the money stashed away by corrupt dictators like suharto in indonesia ferdinand marcos in the philippines and mobuto sese seko of zaire now democratic republic of the congo each of whom stole from the people of their country however they could only do this with the help of western enablers and ongoing elite resistance to developing country attempts to create a more transparent and fairer process for collecting tax on cross border financial flows as a result alex cobham of the tax justice network observes worldwide developing nations lose in excess of 1trillion per year in capital flight and tax evasion to wealthy countries see the spider s web britain s second empire but these more public examples while terrible tend to obscure two important facts the amount stolen from sub saharan africans for example between 1970 and 2008 was at least five times the total amount of their foreign debt during that period see the spider s web britain s second empire and by highlighting these examples attention is drawn away from even worse and ongoing examples of such criminality by those corrupt criminal individuals and organizations including banks accountancy and legal firms corporations international organizations crime syndicates and governments committed to using outright theft fraud money laundering and other devices to steal wealth from ordinary people all over the world so for example if one follows the money trails of various lucrative financial operations some technically legal but immoral and others simply illegal apart from the world s major corporations one quickly comes across the names of the major and well known banks and financial institutions such as the bank of england barclays goldman sachs jpmorgan chase the big four accountancy firms deloitte ernst young ey kpmg and pricewaterhousecoopers and elite lawyers such as those in london s magic circle like clifford chance mourant du feu jeune and slaughter and may see for example treasure islands tax havens and the men who stole the world new estimates reveal the extent of tax avoidance by multinationals and looting with putin apparently like major corporations and crime syndicates few banks accountancy firms and lawyers have ethics policies that require them to follow the law and to exercise due diligence check out a client before signing a contract so that they can steer clear of handling illegal and immoral profits especially if they are monstrous in fact according to a us senate report virtually every major bank in the world especially the biggest in north america and europe holds accounts for offshore banks and or banks in suspect jurisdictions see the sink terror crime and dirty money in the offshore world as eva joly mep vice chair of the panama papers committee of the european parliament succinctly puts it ordinary people are paying taxes rich people are not see the spider s web britain s second empire the vatican but perhaps the example which best illustrates the moral depravity of those who use tax havens is the vatican in his carefully researched book operation gladio the unholy alliance between the vatican the cia and the mafia author paul l williams recounts the efforts of the cia former nazis the sicilian american mafia the vatican and even freemasonry to resist an anticipated postwar invasion of western europe by those godless communists in the soviet union by establishing stay behind units clandestine military and paramilitary units throughout the countries of europe belgium denmark italy netherlands norway portugal led by former nazis and composed of die hard fascist fanatics this alliance to fight the cold war against the former soviet union and the rising tide of progressive governments in europe and the rest of the world particularly as the us war on vietnam gathered pace led as williams chillingly puts it to the toppling of governments wholesale slaughter and financial devastation around the world it was also of course the forerunner to its equivalent operation condor to resist and destroy if possible the spread of progressive movements ranging from communism to liberation theology throughout central south america while the vatican played a number of unsavory roles in this alliance including its facilitation of massive numbers of heroin addictions its use of counterfeit securities participation in false flag attacks that killed thousands and strings of gangland slayings support of military juntas that massacred tens of thousands and the purging of progressive priests including archbishop óscar romero of san salvador and two jesuit priests denounced by fr jorge mario bergoglio now pope francis in argentina see who is pope francis jorge mario bergoglio and argentina s dirty war and causing the financial destitution of thousands of families one of its key ongoing functions designed to maximize the vatican s power while highlighting its moral and spiritual bankruptcy was to act as god s banker for many of these operations see operation gladio the unholy alliance between the vatican the cia and the mafia it did this for example by accepting mafia medellin cartel collected drugs money for a 15 20 cut into the vatican bank technically istituto per le opere di religione or institute for the works of religion and then laundering it through its shell companies such as cisalpine overseas bank astolfine sa united trading corporation erin sa bellatrix sa belrose sa starfield sa and nordeurop establishment in tax havens in the bahamas liechtenstein luxembourg panama and switzerland with the cia providing services such as the transport of mafia medellin cocaine to drug dealers in the us its share of the drug profits cycled through its own cia controlled banks including continental illinois castle bank trust and bank of credit and commerce international but eventually involving many of the most prestigious banks in the us as the money was passed to the vatican bank were used to finance key aspects of operations gladio and condor with weapons also supplied by the cia from nato arsenals but there was plenty of vatican money in these operations too as an aside so devastating was the fallout from the ongoing exposure of the many aspects of vatican corruption that by the beginning of the twenty first century roman catholic membership was falling by 400 000 per year in the usa alone but the trend was even stronger in europe with magnificent churches and cathedrals becoming museums visited solely by tourists parishes being boarded up seminaries and convents closed and parochial schools consolidated and this was before the plague of pedophilia had fully hit further decimating the church s tattered reputation to this day the vatican bank remains one of the world s leading laundries for dirty money see operation gladio the unholy alliance between the vatican the cia and the mafia how do tax havens work each tax haven offers its own unique combination of services after all it is a tough market competing for the world s wealth and so each jurisdiction has developed its own set of services designed to maximize its attractiveness to potential clients in essence this means that there is some ongoing competition to reduce regulatory and oversight requirements so that each tax haven can attract clientele this has become so extreme that basic requirements of banking for those who do it legally such as proof of identity are not required in the offshore world in fact even your true name can be withheld if you wish it is easier to avoid any risk of embarrassment from exposure this way as a result virtually any jurisdiction will open an account or as many accounts as you want in whatever names you specify then usually employing a variety of devices ranging from secret bank accounts nominee directors usually locals who play no part in the organization bar give it their name and structures such as shell companies that exist on paper and perhaps a wall plaque somewhere but nothing else and trusts which unlike the legitimate version appear to separate responsibility and control from the benefits of ownership but actually do not to processes such as transfer pricing a technique by which companies shift paper profits into low tax countries and costs into high tax countries to minimize or eliminate tax payments and often employing a convoluted process that rapidly shifts monies through several jurisdictions so that it becomes untraceable because authorities must get permission to access each jurisdiction in turn in any effort to trace the money profits are effectively hidden and any accountability to authorities of any kind utterly eliminated see treasure islands tax havens and the men who stole the world for one simple example of such a strategy employing a technique known as the double irish dutch sandwich which is legal see google shifted 23bn to tax haven bermuda in 2017 filing shows but you can read other examples here the tech giants will never pay their fair share of taxes unless we make them and 7 corporate giants accused of evading billions in taxes why does the existence of tax havens matter to us well the simple answer to this question is that just a fraction of the money hidden in tax havens would feed clothe house and provide clean water medical care and educational opportunities to everyone on earth it would eliminate the 100 000 deaths by starvation related diseases each day it would eliminate poverty and homelessness and as one byproduct of having these material needs met it would facilitate the emergence of an informed engaged and empowered human population to tackle the vast range of environmental climate and military threats that currently threaten biosphere collapse and imminent human extinction see human extinction by 2026 a last ditch strategy to fight for human survival as professor prem sikka puts it more simply because of the penetration by financial services executives of the british state including the treasury it deprives people of opportunities to have healthcare education security justice and ultimately a fulfilling life see the spider s web britain s second empire fundamentally then tax havens and their secrecy are at the heart of those elite institutions and processes that functionally undermine democracy and give extraordinary power to certain anonymous individuals and their entities without accountability see the spider s web britain s second empire of course the elites that control the tax haven networks are not about to let this change tax havens are simply too important as part of the global infrastructure for maintaining elite profit power and privilege and for resisting grassroots efforts to bring peace justice and ecological sanity to our world and that is why they are protected by government legislation and legal systems with an army of accountants auditors bankers businesspeople lawyers and politicians ensuring that they remain protected so don t forget laws are designed to control and punish you no matter how trivial your infringement a parking fine a littering offence a petty theft but if you have enough money the law simply does not exist and you can evade taxes legally and in the full knowledge that your vast profits even from immorally acquired wealth such as sex trafficking gun running endangered species trafficking conflict diamonds and drug trafficking are lawful and will escape regulation and oversight of any kind see the rule of law unjust and violent let me give a personal example i have been a war tax resister since 1983 i have a conscientious objection to paying taxes to the australian government to deploy military forces in other countries to kill people in my name so instead of paying taxes to kill for many years i donated the equivalent amount to organizations engaged in peace development environment and human rights work and to pay the rent for my use of indigenous land as some of many outcomes to this conscientious and highly public resistance garnering national media attention at times in 1991 i was bankrupted in 1992 i was convicted of contempt of court for my conscientious refusal to cooperate with the bankruptcy trustee and in 1993 my passport was seized in 1999 i was advised that i will be bankrupt forever because of my ongoing conscientious refusal to finance the killing in the same period since 1983 trillions and trillions of dollars of tax have been illegally and secretly evaded as wealthy individuals and corporations criminals and crime syndicates international organizations and governments channel their incomes and profits through tax havens laws and legal systems throughout the world make this possible and provided it is done correctly it is quite straightforward to avoid any penalties for secretly evading payment of taxes or hiding money acquired through criminal activity but the point as you can see is that tax evasion by wealthy individuals and corporations meant that many of these individuals and corporations didn t pay taxes to kill people either they just didn t pay taxes at all o f course their motive was personal gain their way was legal they incurred no penalty and of course they didn t pay an equivalent amount to support peace and justice causes more fundamentally however the trillions of dollars they took from the global economy were made by killing and exploiting people and the planet in a significant variety of other ways ranging from sex trafficking gun running conflict diamonds and trafficking in drugs and endangered species to simply starving people to death at the rate of 100 000 people each day by managing the global economy using tax havens as a primary tool to extract maximum profit richard brooks documents how this legal exploitation occurs in another way in his book the great tax robbery how britain became a tax haven for fat cats and big business the vast tax evasion by elites in britain including by diverting funds through tax havens attracts just five prosecutions each year per 1 billion of evasion of direct taxes in contrast benefits fraud by those on unemployment and disability pensions attract 9 000 prosecutions each year per 1 billion of fraud so theft by the poor warrants the full force of the law but not theft by elites who write the law and largely control the political and legal processes in relation to it hence under the guise of relationship taxing that is building a relationship between tax authorities and corporate executives and tailoring tax payments to corporate wishes to the extent the law allows corporations have long known that if you don t like the law we ll see what we can do as is obvious from this example attempts at government reform including to defeat tax havens in the direction of making elites financially and legally accountable both nationally and internationally for the responsibilities which the rest of us cannot escape are invariably for show and in any case achieve zero of substance for example the attempt to approve a blacklist of tax havens at the g20 gathering in 2009 was resisted by the chinese premier on behalf of chinese elites who like other national elites keen to have political control but judicial separation from their offshore centres opposed the listing of notorious havens hong kong and macau see treasure islands tax havens and the men who stole the world the global elite is clearly in control with national governments and international organizations powerlessly doing as instructed so complete is this control in fact that brooks notes that in britain anti tax avoidance laws had to be relaxed to accommodate companies tax avoidance schemes brooks concludes that british taxation policy really had been so comprehensively captured by the world s biggest corporations that screw the poor policies could be written into the statute books at their whim without a pang of conscience being felt anywhere in whitehall clearly however his comment can be applied to virtually any government in the world so does it matter to you that these tax havens exist and do what they do what can be done about tax havens authors such as nicholas shaxson and richard brooks suggest a raft of measures to correct the large number of faults that facilitate the secrecy protection from regulation and tax evasion that individuals corporations organizations criminals and terrorists utilize in tax havens for shaxson these include financial reforms such as blacklisting of tax havens so that their rogue state status is public knowledge greater transparency for example through government sharing of information about the local income and assets of each other s citizens and by requiring multinational corporate activities in each country to be made visible rather than hidden behind international figures promoting the needs of developing countries which need their tax bases protected far more than they need aid or debt relief confronting the british spider s web of tax havens by abolishing the city of london corporation and submerging it into a unified and fully democratic london taxing an entire multinational group as a single unit and then allocating the appropriate amounts of its income out to the different jurisdictions in which it was earned and allow it to be taxed as each jurisdiction decides onshore tax reform such as a land value tax because land cannot be moved offshore and so tax on it must be paid locally and by a direct distribution of mineral wealth in any country to each of its inhabitants who can then be taxed tackling the enablers the accountants lawyers individual bankers businesspeople and not just the clients so that they go to jail rethinking the meaning of corporate responsibility because corporations are given a wealth of capital in public infrastructure an educated and healthy workforce with which to work so that corporations are transparent about their affairs and pay tax as part of their corporate responsibility re evaluating the meaning of corruption insiders abusing the common good in secrecy and getting away with it and so worsening inequality and entrenching vested interests and unaccountable power so that we see more clearly all of the actors and their activities and changing the culture that fawns over people who abuse the system for personal gain see treasure islands tax havens and the men who stole the world and some progress appears to be occurring along lines he suggests for example a version of automatic information exchange aie by which governments make sure that essential information is made available to other jurisdictions as a matter of routine has been discussed by the oecd and while full of loopholes see loophole usa the vortex shaped hole in global financial transparency some commitments have been made for the list of commitments as at november 2018 see aeoi commitments however the usa has not made this commitment and while switzerland for example finds this objectionable see the u s hasn t signed the aeoi agreement reciprocity demanded the reality is that it makes little difference for example ico services which specializes in the formation of offshore companies and offshore banking will assist you to get around the aeoi requirement their website advertises that asset holders need to start looking for alternative jurisdictions for protecting their assets there are some reputable jurisdictions that are still outside the aeoi e g cyprus but u s states of delaware and some others shouldn t be dismissed but if you want a more established name to help you take advantage of a tax haven in the usa you really can t go past rothschild co so to check out what they are offering here is rothschild s primer how to launder money in u s real estate and avoid blacklists moreover the aeoi agreement outlaws bank secrecy but not trust secrecy which dates from the crusades on which the british model is based the trust lies at the core of the british secrecy model so it does not address the cornerstone of british tax haven secrecy and explains why the british were happy to see the cayman islands commit to the aeoi in short the british government would be happy to kill off bank secrecy so that they can capture a larger market share based on trust secrecy see the spider s web britain s second empire separately from this initiative in 2018 the uk parliament enacted a new law requiring its overseas territories including notorious tax havens like bermuda the cayman islands and the british virgin islands to start disclosing the owners of corporations they register by 2020 in theory this could shut down a huge amount of offshore tax evasion and other financial crimes because individuals from anywhere in the world including the united states have long been able to set up secret corporations in these tax havens to stash their money see new uk law may shut down the biggest tax havens aside from the u s however while the report pointed out that the new law obviously does not impact the usa or of course switzerland or and the easy rerouting options available if these havens are effectively or even actually shut down it failed to mention that this initiative does not in any way address the city of london corporation so the impact of this initiative must be very limited unless it is followed by some pretty drastic initiatives in westminster washington bern and elsewhere in summary while one cannot disagree with any of shaxson s fine suggestions or be displeased that public pressure has led to some effort being made by the oecd and the uk parliament to address elements of the tax haven scourge the reality is that the extent of the changes necessary are not going to happen without enormous grassroots pressure strategically applied and they are very unlikely to happen as reforms of the existing capitalist system this is simply because the global elite is solidly in control of the institutions and processes of global capitalism including its compliant governments and international organizations and will readily stymie any attempt at serious reform of tax havenry particularly given the number of major reforms needed and the number of nations in which these reforms must be enacted to state two obvious examples the city of london corporation has not existed for 1 000 years because it has no defense and the changes noted above have only made the us more attractive as a secrecy jurisdiction meanwhile with the aim of promoting financial innovation switzerland has recently made things easier for smaller financial technology companies thus making tax havenry more attractive to those who might not have otherwise considered it see swiss watchdog to propose looser anti money laundering rules for fintechs so given that most tax havens are protected by host government legislation and there is no international mechanism to control them the tax haven industry generally is not under threat of being held to account in any significant way and despite the more elaborate explanation offered above there is a simple reason for this unofficially of course illegal money laundered through tax havens has become an essential and sometimes stabilizing element of the global financial system see drug money saved banks in global crisis claims un advisor so what can we do that will make a difference given the deeply entrenched and long standing nature of this problem clearly it needs to be addressed at various levels fundamentally we can nurture our children so that we do not destroy their conscience see my promise to children remember all of those corrupt criminal accountants bankers businesspeople priests and popes lawyers and politicians that kept creeping up in the discussion above the people who maintain the entire infrastructure that allows tax havens to exist and those who manage and profit from it too do they care about you do they care about the people in africa asia and central south america who starve as a result of the types of policies that allow tax havens to exist and function do they care about those driven into poverty and homelessness in modern industrial economies because vast sums are drained out of them and hidden in secrecy jurisdictions do they care about the people killed by the military and other violence from which they profit and then hide the proceeds to evade tax do they care about the earth fundamentally do they care about themselves of course not but this is only because they are extraordinarily psychologically damaged individuals see the global elite is insane revisited with a more complete explanation in why violence and fearless psychology and fearful psychology principles and practice if we inflict enormous violence on a child throughout their childhood to compel their obedience how can we expect them to grow up to lead a life of integrity based on their conscience courage compassion empathy and love those who use tax havens are truly poor little rich boys and girls see love denied the psychology of materialism violence and war and why set up a shell company in panama the psychology driving illicit financial flows beyond tackling the problem at its source however we can also tackle manifestations of the problem but not by lobbying elites and their political agents there are no votes in it in any case to control this depravity for which they are well rewarded for a start we can boycott all of the major private banks in favor of those smaller or member owned banks that have a serious commitment to peace justice and ecological sustainability or we can seek out equivalent institutions like credit unions we can also create public banks based on ethical principles see what are public banks and how do they operate an introduction we can boycott large corporations like amazon apple gap google ikea microsoft and starbucks that use tax havens none of these corporations is a monopoly there are alternatives which can be investigated and employed assuming we can t go without some version of the product or service they offer whenever you can find a locally owned outlet that offers a local product or service we can boycott the catholic church god does not ask that you morally or financially support a corrupt organization that doesn t understand or represent morality and spirituality remember it was jesus who threw the moneychangers out of the temple if our conscience speaks loudly enough we can decline employment by any organization that is unethical such as those that use tax havens we can refuse to gamble refuse to buy the services of a sex worker who might even be illegally trafficked into the work refuse to buy the products of endangered species see for example killing elephants for pet food condemned and refuse to use illicit drugs these products and services are virtually always offered by industries controlled by criminal organizations so by buying them you are only harming yourself and or other people or species about whom you could choose to exercise a duty of care while also not contributing to the diversion of financial resources into tax havens we can encourage unions with members who work for organizations using tax havens to take a stand on the issue we can support existing organizations that work on the problem preferably those that offer grassroots alternatives the tax justice network an activist think tank and its sister organization the global alliance for tax justice campaign for systemic change if we are genuinely ambitious we can develop comprehensive nonviolent strategies to compel particular individuals and organizations to desist from using tax havens or even compel countries to close down tax havens see nonviolent campaign strategy this can easily be part of a larger strategy to transform the global economy into one that satisfies human and ecological needs particularly given the imminence of biosphere collapse as noted above see the flame tree project to save life on earth if violence and exploitation in all of their guises concern you consider signing the online pledge of the people s charter to create a nonviolent world so here is a final question for you to consider what might the world look like if all those trillions of dollars

paraguay staff concluding statement of the 2019 article iv mission a concluding statement describes the preliminary findings of imf staff at the end of an official staff visit or mission in most cases to a member country missions are undertaken as part of regular usually annual consultations under article iv of the imf s articles of agreement in the context of a request to use imf resources borrow from the imf as part of discussions of staff monitored programs or as part of other staff monitoring of economic developments the authorities have consented to the publication of this statement the views expressed in this statement are those of the imf staff and do not necessarily represent the views of the imf s executive board based on the preliminary findings of this mission staff will prepare a report that subject to management approval will be presented to the imf executive board for discussion and decision paraguay has grown rapidly in the past decade and a half contributing to a sharp drop in poverty prudent macro policies with low inflation and low government deficits played an important role vulnerabilities have declined with a significant reduction of both external and public debt the key challenge going forward will be to sustain this rapid growth as the factors that have propelled it in the past including the boom in agriculture commodity prices may provide less support going forward improving the business climate and governance will be key to continued convergence to higher living standards near term outlook gdp grew by around 3¾ percent in 2018 driven by strong domestic demand fueled by a rebound in credit growth while the contribution of net exports was negative but growth was uneven a strong first half of the year was followed by a weaker second half as paraguay felt spillovers from regional financial turbulence the crisis in argentina led to an increase in risk aversion toward the region which contributed to a depreciation of the guarani against the dollar although by less than the depreciation experienced by neighboring countries as a result the guaraní appreciated sharply vis à vis the argentinean peso and the brazilian real the impact was felt in a sharp drop in tourism and cross border trade weather related shocks in agriculture also contributed to the slowdown in growth for 2019 growth is expected to reach around 3½ percent growth is being affected by a drought early in the planting season which will reduce the soybean harvest this should be partially offset by a pickup of tourism and cross border trade which will benefit from the unwinding of the real exchange rate shock that occurred in 2018 risks to growth are broadly balanced developments in neighboring countries will be key agricultural commodity prices are another risk factor the strength of domestic demand is also uncertain and will depend on the recovery of government investment now that the transition to a new government is completed the continued commitment of the new government to the fiscal responsibility law is welcome fiscal policy in 2019 will be neutral with the deficit changing little from that in 2018 nontax revenue estimates in the budget appear as in previous years overly optimistic and reaching the target will necessitate containing expenditure as has been done in the past the monetary policy rate was on hold in 2018 and both gdp growth and gdp levels remained broadly in line with potential inflation fell to 3 2 percent by the end of the year the result of the decline in oil prices and the reduction in prices of imports from neighboring countries in february 2019 the bcp cut the monetary policy rate from 5¼ to 5 percent citing uncertainty about the external environment and incipient weakening of domestic demand the current monetary policy stance appears appropriate year on year inflation should move back to 4 percent by year s end the middle of the central bank s target range as last year s real exchange rate appreciation reverses exchange rate flexibility should help to absorb shocks exchange rate intervention should continue to aim at preventing disorderly market conditions and mitigating excess volatility only longer term growth challenges paraguay has grown rapidly with real gdp growing by an average 4½ percent annually in the past decade and a half well above the latin america average this has contributed to a sharp decrease in poverty rates from 58 percent in 2002 to 26 percent currently nonetheless poverty remains high by regional standards rapid growth was partly the result of a bounce back from the crisis in the late 1990s and prudent macro economic policies inflation and exchange rate volatility came down as the central bank shifted to inflation targeting while prudent fiscal policy reduced public debt from 52 percent in 2002 to around 20 percent currently fiscal policy remained conservative during the commodity price boom as a result paraguay did not go through the boom bust that its neighboring countries experienced the global agricultural commodity price boom which led to a sharp expansion of agricultural exports also played an important role in dollar terms agricultural exports are now 5 times what they were in 2003 sowing areas for the main crops are 2½ times what they were fifteen years go the surge in commodity prices spilled over to the non tradable sector through an appreciation of the real exchange rate which boosted incomes the rapid growth in incomes led to a surge in domestic demand in some respects the economy looks very different from fifteen years ago the share of electricity and water has fallen by two thirds to 8 percent of gdp the share of services is now almost 50 percent of gdp exports have diversified and external vulnerabilities have declined total external debt of the private and public sector has fallen from almost 200 percent of gdp in 2002 to 40 percent currently the key question going forward is how to maintain rapid growth of real incomes paraguay s economy is still heavily dependent on the agriculture sector but agricultural prices are already off previous highs and may decline further as global demand slows and agricultural land cannot continue to expand at the same rate as in the past future growth will increasingly need to come from the non agriculture non electricity export sector which is growing rapidly but is still small for this higher private sector investment is needed including from abroad improving the business climate and governance low taxes and low energy prices are important attractions of paraguay for domestic and foreign investors but these are offset by a weak business climate and governance a better business climate and improved governance would help facilitate diversification and productivity growth compared to other countries in the western hemisphere and europe paraguay scores relatively weak on business climate and governance indicators cross country data show that there is a strong link between the value of these indicators and gdp per capita policies that focus on improving transport infrastructure rule of law and the quality of education would be particularly helpful the mission estimates that reforms in these areas would not only have the largest impact on growth but also have the most support from the private sector in this context the mission welcomes the new government initiatives to increase the ease of doing business these include legislation to simplify the process of small business registration a new bankruptcy law and legislation to allow companies to use moveable assets as collaterals the government is also seeking to get rid of outdated bureaucratic procedures for businesses and to increase digitization in government services to facilitate higher competition in key industries the national commission for competition has been revived which is tasked with combating monopolies and improving the transparency of industry regulations fiscal policy prudent fiscal policies in the past 15 years have reduced the debt to gdp ratio but fiscal space is limited as the deficit is close to the 1 5 percent ceiling under the fiscal responsibility law while fiscal space is limited spending needs are large to create room for the investment needed for some of the identified reform areas revenues which are low by international standards need to be increased current headline tax rates are low but effective tax rates are even lower the personal income tax rate is 10 percent but this tax yields only 0 1 percent of gdp reducing exemptions and deductions and improving tax compliance will raise effective tax rates even if headline rates remain unchanged the mission looks forward to the proposals of the tax commission that is tasked with modernizing and simplifying the tax system there should also be some room to reprioritize expenditure within the existing envelope spending levels in paraguay are low compared with other countries but spending composition is lopsided with a high share of government expenditure going to wages while there is a need to increase infrastructure and social spending including health and education indeed the government wage bill in paraguay is similar as a percent of gdp to that in other countries in the region even though the role of the government is much smaller the mission looks forward to the upcoming recommendations of the expenditure review commission financial sector financial soundness indicators show the banking sector is well capitalized and profitable and risk based supervision is progressing supervision of financial cooperatives should continue to be strengthened there is scope to improve supervision of the casas de credito and casas comerciales supervision standards for this sector should be adopted quickly it remains important to establish a pension fund supervisor currently pension funds administer the public s trusted money under a few overly rigid rules but without oversight supervision would mitigate risks allow pension funds to invest in a wider range of assets and facilitate the development of a domestic capital market restoring the long term sustainability of the pension system is another challenge that should be tackled now before the demographic windfall dissipates this can be achieved through timely and gentle parametric adjustments to pension age benefits and contribution rates implementing all these structural reforms and continuing with prudent macroeconomic policies would allow paraguay to continue growing rapidly and improving living standards for all paraguayans we would like to thank the government for its warm hospitality
by the haitian masses have mobilized a new wave of protest against the corrupt government of president jovenel moïse it began with demonstrations last summer in july and august re emerged in november and december and exploded again in the first two weeks of february when hundreds of thousands marched in all the major cities of the country from the capital of port au prince to the northern city of cap haïtien the demonstrators demanded an investigation into what happened to billions of dollars of funds from venezuela an end to austerity measures and price increases for basic goods and the resignation of moïse and his prime minister jean henry céant the government predictably responded with a combination of concessions and repression it rescinded the price increases and promised investigations into corruption but neither moïse nor céant agreed to step down at the same time the police and army backed up by the un forces nominally in haiti to ensure peace cracked down on the protests killing 26 people and injuring 77 since february 7 taking the long view of this crisis the uprising is the latest example of revolt against the strategies pursued by great empires since haiti s birth as an independent nation state more than two centuries ago in the more recent past american imperialism s imposition of neoliberal structural adjustment programs on haiti in the 1980s followed by two u s backed coups against former president jean bertrand aristide undermined the project of social reform to address the country s deep social inequality now those grievances are again bursting out into the open the slave revolution led by toussaint l ouverture succeeded in driving out haiti s french masters in 1804 and fending off britain and spain and yet imperialism would not leave haiti alone though the world s imperial powers couldn t directly colonize haiti they could compel the free black republic to pay an enormous price for its liberation isolating it from the world economy and in the case of france forcing haiti to pay 21 billion in today s dollars for the loss of its slaves these powers also meddled in haitian politics backing different factions of the ruling class that has exploited and oppressed the country s peasantry and small working class for the last two centuries the u s repeatedly invaded the country to back up its handpicked autocrats occupying from 1915 to 1934 and creating a domestic military force with the sole purpose of repressing the haitian masses during the cold war the u s supported the brutal regime of françois papa doc duvalier as an ally against castro s cuba he ruled the country through terror enforced by his own paramilitary force the ton ton macoutes after papa doc s death in 1971 the u s backed his son and anointed successor jean claude baby doc duvalier this father son dictatorship killed between 30 000 and 60 000 people in order to cement its rule over the course of nearly 30 years under the influence of washington in the 1980s baby doc implemented a neoliberal economic program with the aim of turning the country into a giant export processing zone based on exploitation of workers drawn out of the peasant majority and into the cities these plans for sweatshop development failed triggering a mass movement called lavalas that drove baby doc from the country and eventually led to elections in 1991 won by liberation theologist and leader of the struggle jean bertrand aristide he and his party fanmi lavalas hoped to implement a program of social democratic reforms to alleviate the country s desperate poverty but the u s and haiti s ruling class united against him with the military staging a coup that drove aristide into exile after protests within haiti and internationally the u s returned aristide to power but on the condition that he agree to implement washington s neoliberal program count years lost to the coup as part of his term and agree to step down in 1996 while aristide succeeded in abolishing the despised haitian army and did resist some of washington s neoliberal dictates he implemented other parts of them and so did his successor and ally rené préval who governed until aristide won re election in 2001 back in office he continued to advocate redistribution of wealth and demand reparations from france for the debt imposed on haiti after the revolution but he was unable to implement many reforms and many in his government became corrupt leading to mass disillusionment with his rule the haitian ruling class and the right took advantage of this to stage a campaign of destabilization then in 2004 with the country reeling the u s kidnapped aristide and forced him into exile after this second coup washington and its allies deployed un forces to occupy the country from 2004 until 2017 when they were replaced with a smaller force assigned supposedly to ensure the rule of law when new elections were held in 2006 préval again won but he at best implemented neoliberalism with a human face failing to enact any significant reforms in the interests of the masses as a result the country s workers the urban poor and peasants have suffered ever worsening poverty the world bank estimates that 59 percent of the nation s 10 5 million people live below the official poverty line of 2 41 a day while a shocking 24 percent survive in extreme poverty defined as less than 1 23 a day and with such poverty comes hunger so pervasive that usaid estimates half the population is undernourished then in 2010 a devastating earthquake struck flattening whole sections of port au prince where housing had been built with next to no regulation in accordance with neoliberal doctrine the haitian government estimated that the quake killed 300 000 people while other analysts put the total at about 100 000 more than 1 3 million people were displaced and close to 40 000 were still living in camps as of 18 months ago on top of that three hurricanes thomas in 2010 sandy in 2012 and matthew in 2016 swept through the country destroying villages farmlands and whole sections of cities with devastating floods matthew was the worst it killed 546 people displaced 175 500 and pushed 806 000 into extreme food insecurity the social conditions wrought by imperialism and the haitian ruling class turned a series of natural disasters into a social catastrophe the u s and other international donors disbursed 10 billion in foreign assistance and promised in the words of bill clinton to build back better instead they betrayed the country and its people the biggest scandal centered on the red cross which raised half a billion dollars from appeals and claimed to have built homes for 130 000 people after the earthquake but as an investigation by propublica and npr proved only six permanent homes were built aid largely bypassed the haitian state and ended up in the coffers of international ngos most based in washington and other imperial cities as a result the haitian state was incapacitated and private services provided by international and local agencies proliferated to such an extent that haiti has been called the republic of ngos the development that did happen merely laid out the red carpet for the predatory tourist industry and established new sweatshop complexes even much of that failed to materialize and the un which had promised to provide disaster relief behaved as its critics predicted like an occupying army repressing protests by a desperate population worst of all un troops introduced cholera into the country for the first time a fact the un denied until 2016 the ensuing epidemic killed 10 000 people and only recently subsided abandoned betrayed and disillusioned the haitian masses largely sat out a series of elections that brought american backed neoliberal puppets to power michel martelly a former kompa singer nicknamed sweet micky narrowly won an election riddled with controversy ruled as a neoliberal technocrat and restored the dreaded haitian army with the sole purpose of domestic repression he handpicked his successor moïse a businessman whose most recent enterprise is a failed export oriented banana plantation moïse won the presidency in 2016 with only 18 percent of voters participating in the election martelly and moïse proved themselves venal rulers who plundered the state coffers for their own enrichment they saw an opportunity in venezuela s petrocaribe alliance flush with money from high oil prices at the time hugo chávez launched it in 2005 to promote a regional reformist strategy of state led capitalist development as an alternative to washington s neoliberal consensus venezuela sold oil to 12 caribbean countries at 60 percent of the market rate with the remaining 40 percent paid for by long term low interest loans to the consternation of the u s haiti joined petrocaribe in 2007 then president préval promised to use the 4 billion in credit to build hospitals schools and roads however the corrupt governments led by martelly and moïse gobbled up more than 2 billion of the funds for themselves and their cronies the scandal became public when a haitian senate commission published a 650 page investigative report on the petrocaribe program according to the new york times it implicated much of haiti s political class in inflating government contracts funneling money to ghost companies and a host of other financial improprieties after oil prices collapsed venezuela entered a crisis of its own which was further compounded by u s sanctions the crisis brought the petrocaribe program to a close and left haiti billions of dollars in debt to venezuela desperate for funds the haitian state turned to the imf last year for a 96 million loan which unsurprisingly came with neoliberal strings attached it required haiti to cut its fuel subsidy and sell it at prevailing market prices immediately jacking up gas prices by 50 percent predictably this inflamed an already rising inflation rate with prices increasing by double digit percentages each year since 2014 putting all kinds of basic necessities out of reach for many households desperate and enraged the people of haiti want answers and they have been flooding into the streets in repeated waves of protest since last summer in february protests shut down most of the country s cities and marchers converged on moïse s house in the elite suburb of pétion ville after a guard beat a woman protester the crowd pelted his property with stones protesters are calling for the president and prime minister to resign an end to austerity measures and an investigation into the theft of the petrocaribe funds with the backing of the u s and un the haitian state responded with brutality deploying the police and army against the february demonstrations moïse refused to resign i jovenel moïse head of state will not give the country up to armed gangs and drug traffickers he declared he and céant did offer to trim their perks promised further investigations into the misspending of the petrocaribe funds increased the minimum wage and lowered prices of basic goods but who would trust this utterly corrupt regime either to investigate itself for its crimes or enact reforms in the interests of its people the rising against the government has precipitated an even deeper crisis in haitian society as imports of food distribution of water and shipments of fuel have been interrupted disgracefully novum energy which has a contract to supply fuel to the country stopped its tankers from unloading 60 000 barrels of gas and 260 000 barrels of diesel because the government was behind in payments thereby exacerbating shortages of fuel while the protests have subsided for now the haitian masses face big challenges ahead various reformists have attempted to position themselves as a credible alternative but their strategy blazed by aristide and his party fanmi lavalas hit the inevitable contradictions of trying to run capitalism with a human face under the thumb of american imperialism ominously the haitian right is also re emerging and putting itself forward as an alternative to the corrupt neoliberal rulers baby doc s son nicolas duvalier is even rumored to be considering a run for the presidency in the next election meanwhile the haitian left which struggled to position itself as a force independent of aristide s reformism is trying to rebuild itself amid the new wave of protests one thing is for sure the u s is part of the problem perhaps the most important part facing the haitian people the trump administration has proven itself utterly hypocritical it backed the current venal regime to the hilt and betrayed promises to haitians in the u s in a blatantly racist fashion trump s double standards are brazen on the one hand his administration denounces nicolás maduro in venezuela on wildly exaggerated claims while the u s plots a coup to overthrow him on the other it supports moïse s brutal and corrupt rule in haiti and thus only calls for new elections which it will rig in favor of neoliberal candidates as a face saving solution why because moïse and his ilk are useful puppets for washington s imperial ambitions including against venezuela moïse s government for example joined the u s and 17 other countries in the organization of american states in passing a resolution refusing to recognize maduro s government trump has also betrayed promises to haitians in the u s and on its border in mexico during the 2016 campaign he promised haitians that he wanted to be your greatest champion but in office he has proved himself their greatest enemy infamously in a meeting in the oval office he complained about immigrants coming from shithole countries like haiti trump rescinded temporary protected status tps to haitians which had allowed 59 000 to stay in the country since the earthquake that led to an exodus of haitians crossing into canada in the hopes of finding safe haven there while the courts have put a stay on that order those with tps still face an uncertain future moreover amid the spiraling crisis in haiti thousands have left the country for latin america and many of those have attempted to enter the u s through mexico only to be denied entry at the border haitians have become the target of anti migrant xenophobia and racism throughout the region most horrifically in the dominican republic which deported 120 000 haitians last year haiti and its people are thus caught in an organic crisis precipitated by imperialism neoliberal capitalism and the failure and collapse of reformism within the country and region nevertheless the haitian masses have yet again demonstrated their determination to fight for democracy and equality their resistance offers the country s left the opportunity to rebuild and lead a new wave of struggle amid this crisis activists in the u s must defend the right of haitians to determine their own fate including overthrowing and replacing the current corrupt neoliberal government and we must oppose the u s its imperialist allies and the un from interfering in their fight for liberation instead the u s and france should be forced to pay reparations to haiti for the debt trap in which they ensnared the country and for the neoliberal program they imposed on it so that the people have the resources to rebuild society in their own interests and we must agitate for the indefinite extension of tps for any haitians requesting it and open u s borders for haitians and all other migrants seeking safe haven we should see the haitian struggle as part of our revolutionary struggle for a new internationalist socialist society that puts people and the environment before profit this piece

press release hansard mark patterson nz first thank you mr speaker my question is to the minister of forestry what reports has he seen regarding the one billion trees programme oral questions questions to ministers question no 1 forestry mark patterson nz first thank you mr speaker my question is to the minister of forestry what reports has he seen regarding the one billion trees programme speaker right the member had a bit of emphasis but he left a word out please read it as on the sheet 1 mark patterson nz first to the minister of forestry what recent reports has he seen regarding the one billion trees programme hon shane jones minister of forestry one report which puts into both political administrative and fiscal action is the 1 8 million that underwrites the ngā mahuri o ngāti hine programme where 20 young men from 15 to 22 learn while you earn this is a practical endeavour to ensure that we are swelling the ranks of the future workers for the one billion trees programme and in addition to that today i had the pleasure of hosting a delegation of a commercial character from germany who had heard about the billion trees programme and have come to new zealand to explore investment opportunities mark patterson what feedback has he heard regarding this programme hon shane jones in the interests of time i shall be uncharacteristically modest and pithy the feedback is a reminder that pastoral care is an important dimension when creating the new ranks of workers it s a reminder to industry as they seek to rely also on migrant labour that in the absence of suitable pastoral care dimensions their entreaties will fall on barren ears mark patterson what other training initiatives is the government supporting in the forestry sector hon shane jones this government has rehabilitated an industrial sector neglected for the last nine years the forestry sector are increasing their appetite for investment increasing the number of people that they seek to hire and increasing the number of trees they hope to plant it s important that we bear in mind that there are not only opportunities for those youngsters in the four winds of aotearoa to join this industry we re also focusing on boosting the ranks of young women coming through the university of canterbury and as does befit my very sensitive nature i hope to announce that shortly question no 2 prime minister 2 hon simon bridges leader of the opposition to the prime minister does she stand by all her government s statements policies and actions rt hon jacinda ardern prime minister yes hon simon bridges does she agree with grant robertson who is reported as saying there was no recommendation in the tax working group report excluding māori from the capital gains tax rt hon jacinda ardern if the member was willing to characterise the member s statements correctly then i would agree with minister robertson hon simon bridges what does she say about volume 1 of the tax working group report page 15 headed summary of recommendations which makes quite clear there are recommendations around māori being excluded from a capital gains tax speaker order order the hon kelvin davis will stand withdraw and apologise hon kelvin davis i withdraw and apologise speaker and if i d been able to tell who the other member was who interjected in that impolite manner that person would have been too please start the question again hon simon bridges what does she say about tax working group volume 1 page 15 headed summary of recommendations which makes quite clear recommendations about exemption of māori and report volume 2 which says māori freehold land merits specific treatment under an extension the taxation of capital gains this could take the form of an exclusion rt hon jacinda ardern firstly may i commend the member for finally reading the report secondly speaker order order i want to be able to hear the answer if we have about 10 people yelling there is no chance of that occurring the prime minister will start again rt hon jacinda ardern what the group clearly recommended was that we engage further with māori to determine the most appropriate treatment of transactions relating to collectively owned māori assets they recommended that we think about it i d really like to question the member where exactly is he trying to go with this issue where exactly hon simon bridges does she accept it s not where i m going it s where her government s going on a capital gains tax and will her government exclude māori from any capital gains tax it imposes rt hon jacinda ardern again i question the motivation behind this line of questioning secondly speaker order order the member will resume her seat it has been a long practice in this house not to question indirectly the motivations of members in that way and i m going to ask the prime minister not to do that again if people have specific things to say they should say it but indirect implicit criticism of that nature is not acceptable rt hon jacinda ardern again i refer them back to the report which encouraged the government to consider whether particular circumstances such as disposing of māori freehold land or where assets are hon dr nick smith are you going to exempt māori rt hon jacinda ardern transferred within iwi whether or not we should give specific consideration to an exemption in the same way that for instance if you had land passed down after death hon dr nick smith are you going to exempt them rt hon jacinda ardern whether there should be a 12 months exemption these are exemptions they asked us to consider and for very good reasons speaker now before we have any more supplementaries i m going to warn the father of the house after he s been here since i think 1990 i think he made five inappropriate interjections during that time bringing me he made five inappropriate interjections bringing me into the debate i think i ve warned him about this about 10 times in the last year and i d like him to learn rt hon winston peters if any owner māori or otherwise was holding land in trusteeship for future generations how could a capital gains tax possibly apply when they do not intend to benefit from any capital gains themselves rt hon jacinda ardern yes the member is making the point around intent of sale and again i d like to make the point that of course as has been the case for a number of years and successive governments we have for instance a 17 5 percent tax rate that applies to māori authorities and now is the member stating that he disagrees with that provision as well hon simon bridges will her government exclude māori from any capital gains tax it imposes rt hon jacinda ardern as i have reiterated the tax working group has as a group including a range of representatives acknowledged that it warrants consideration we have made no decisions but unlike the other side of the house we can see when there are circumstances that are particular that do warrant consideration it seems to me the national party now has a strategy where they don t support 17 5 percent tax rates for māori authorities we might be interested in sharing that with iwi leaders hon grant robertson what does the prime minister make of the fact that the questioning around this issues says will māori be exempted rather than saying will māori freehold land be exempted why does she think someone might make that kind of statement speaker order i think asking the prime minister to read the minds of other members is inappropriate rt hon winston peters will the potential tax considerations to be put before inland revenue have regard to how much a person feels like they are a māori or whether they discovered that somewhat the same way as columbus discovered america purely by accident speaker i m going to move on i m going to work i think for the last time today on the basis that that was not deliberately disorderly i think we ve had a couple from ministers that are heading in that direction and from this side as well hon simon bridges does she agree with grant robertson who said yesterday the tax working group report did not include recommendations of taxes like a capital gains tax a water tax a fertiliser tax a nitrate tax and agricultural emissions tax rt hon jacinda ardern i sat in this house when member nathan guy rattled off a series of taxes where there was no commentary in the tax working group on any of those issues i am happy as i said to debate the facts of the report if there was accuracy around it hon simon bridges is it the prime minister not me who hasn t read cullen s report rt hon jacinda ardern no hon simon bridges well has she read pages 16 and 17 of volume one under the heading summary of recommendations of the report which recommends not only all of those taxes i outlined before but also recommends here an environmental footprint tax and a natural capital enhancement tax aren t all of those taxes recommended in this report rt hon jacinda ardern it would be good to have a rational discussion about the tax working group s recommendations all of which in the environmental section ask us to consider the entirety of what s happening in the environmental space without the scaremongering that is coming from that side of the house and the inaccuracy from that side of the house and i have to say the environmental inaction that we are having to deal with on this side of the house because of nine years of an absolute failed government hon simon bridges so is she so brave that she s going to give new zealand page 16 an agricultural emissions tax a nitrate tax a water tax a fertiliser tax page 17 an environmental footprint tax and a natural capital enhancement tax given this is in her words our nuclear free moment rt hon jacinda ardern at least i recognised we have a nuclear free moment on that side of the house we had such inaction that the tax working group felt the need to have to traverse an entire range of issues because we are dealing with environmental degradation that has built up over years first point second point we of course are still considering all elements of the tax working group and when we have a response we will share it but if the member wants to be a responsible politician he might engage in a debate based on fact not fiction hon simon bridges can we just clear up given that grant robertson doesn t accept that those taxes are in the report that she does indeed accept factually there is a nitrate tax a water tax an agricultural emissions tax and the various other taxes i ve mentioned actually in this cullen working group report rt hon jacinda ardern when that member releases his workings on kiwisaver then let s talk speaker no order i think it wasn t an invitation to talk it was a direct question which will have an appropriate response rt hon jacinda ardern i accept very few of that member s assertions based on his record speaker the prime minister mightn t have been in the house yesterday i can t remember at the stage when i did admonish tracey martin for essentially answering a question indicating that she didn t accept the word of the member it was a factual question it was properly prepared if it was inaccurate it s a matter of privilege and the prime minister will answer it rt hon jacinda ardern for clarity i do not accept the member s characterisation of the tax working group s report hon simon bridges it s pretty simple are there the taxes i have mentioned listed as recommendations on pages 16 and 17 of volume one of cullen s tax working group report rt hon jacinda ardern in the interim hon simon bridges yes or no rt hon jacinda ardern not with the specificity that the member has detailed hon simon bridges has she read this report rt hon jacinda ardern of course i have rt hon winston peters when the prime minister referred to the possible record of past statements of the primary questioner did she have regard to the fact that they had their response to the tax working group s 21 february report out within minutes of it being published that means they couldn t have read it rt hon jacinda ardern certainly a level of detail speaker order come on one of you rt hon jacinda ardern there s certainly a level of detail that could not have been traversed in that time hon simon bridges does she accept that both michael cullen in his public advocacy for the report and grant robertson her finance minister are clearly treating the report options as absolute recommendations such as the kiwisaver offsets and the recommendations such as the māori exemption from a capital gains tax as merely options rather than recommendations and aren t they being incredibly political in their handling of this report since its release rt hon jacinda ardern absolutely not i think you ll find that sir michael cullen has had to come out and defend the tax working group because it has been mischaracterised so badly by the opposition again we on this side of the house welcome a debate on this issue all that we ask from the other side of the house is accuracy in the way it s portrayed and that s all i m sure the members of the tax working group are asking for as well hon simon bridges in light of the fact that she doesn t even know the taxes in the report who s being accurate or inaccurate speaker order rephrase the question well you ve used a question ok question no 3 finance 3 kiritapu allan labour to the minister of finance what recent reports has he seen on the economy hon grant robertson minister of finance i have seen a number of reports that highlight the strong future for sustainable growth in the new zealand economy last week statistics new zealand released its building consents data for the year to january 2019 the data showed that the number of consents for new dwellings has hit a 44 year high at 33 576 auckland continued to show strong growth with new dwellings consented rising by 20 percent while wellington was up 18 percent kiritapu allan what reports has he seen on the international context for the new zealand economy hon grant robertson overnight the chinese government announced that economic growth is forecast to be slower in china in 2019 than in 2018 in part due to trade tensions while growth there remains robust the slowing trend is similar to what we are seeing in the forecasts of global economic growth from both the world bank and the imf our own economic fundamentals in new zealand remain solid but as a relatively small trading nation we must remain resilient to any factors that are beyond our control this underlines the importance of our commitment to fiscal responsibility which gives us options in the face of any future shocks kiritapu allan how is the government responding to international economic factors hon grant robertson we have a plan for modernising and diversifying our economy to be more resilient in the face of this changing environment under our trade for all agenda we are pursuing more trade opportunities for kiwi firms including an nz eu free trade agreement so that we have a more diverse range of export markets at home we are making investments to transition from an economy based on housing speculation and population growth to one driven by more productive sustainable and inclusive growth this includes through our just transitions programme the provincial growth fund the green investment fund r d tax credits and record investment in skills and training among others question no 4 finance 4 hon amy adams national selwyn to the minister of finance does he believe new zealand s international competitiveness is an important consideration in setting tax policy hon grant robertson minister of finance i believe there are many considerations to take into account when setting tax policy these include fairness across the tax system inequality simplicity and indeed competitiveness hon amy adams does he think that the tax working group s recommended capital gains tax on 100 percent of the net gain at full marginal rates would be internationally competitive when that would give us the third highest capital gains tax rate in the oecd and contrasts with australia who only tax half the gain made speaker there were three legs but the hon grant robertson i think it s important not to isolate out any one part of the tax system as the member will be well aware the top tax rate in australia is significantly higher than it is in new zealand they also have other taxes both at a state and federal level and stamp duty so i think it s unwise to pick out one part of the tax system when making those kinds of comparisons hon amy adams how many of the oecd countries the prime minister referred to in question time yesterday tax inflationary gains or include no discount as part of their capital taxation regimes hon grant robertson i don t have all of that information there but i know that there is a range of regimes some of which include discounts and some which don t hon amy adams well has he read appendix a of the tax working group report which says that for the purposes of its recommendations assets are assumed to grow at a 3 percent nominal annual rate which is made up of 2 percent inflation and just 1 percent real growth hon grant robertson i have indeed read that hon amy adams well then can he confirm that those recommendations mean taking one third of the capital gain in tax when the other two thirds is just made up of inflation and mean that the government would be taking every single dollar of real gain made in tax hon grant robertson no i wouldn t accept that i d want to go and test that more thoroughly what i would be able to say to the member is that very few schemes around the world can find a way if they re going to be simple of accounting for inflation in the way that she wants these are the recommendations of the working group that we ll work through there are many other countries in the world in fact in the oecd all bar us and belgium who have some form of scheme like this who make it work we will look at the international examples as we consider the proposals of the working group hon amy adams how can the minister who has acknowledged that the tax working group recommended 100 percent of the gain at full marginal rates be taxed and said that the capital gain is made up of two thirds inflation one third gain dispute that that means therefore that the 33 percent of the tax on 100 percent of the gain is the equivalent of every single dollar of real gain made hon grant robertson i said that i wanted to go back and check the member s characterisation of the report that s what i will do but again i say to the member looking at that in isolation from the rest of the company tax regime that the owners of those companies will pay does not give a fair reflection of what the tax impact would be on any company or on any individual person who owns a company hon amy adams how can he claim that he does concern himself with international competitiveness when considering tax when he is now actively considering a capital gains tax with the third highest marginal rate in the oecd twice the scope of australia s and one that the tax working group s own modelling shows would take every single dollar of real gain made hon grant robertson as i said we re considering international competitiveness alongside other issues like fairness for example like simplicity i would note that we re not the first government to have undertaken a tax working group the 2010 tax working group on which the previous government based their decisions around for instance making changes to building depreciation meant that new zealand had after that the highest effective tax rate for foreign investment into manufacturing plants in new zealand as a result of a decision that the previous government made so international competitiveness hasn t always been at the top of the mind for previous governments question no 5 housing and urban development 5 hon judith collins national papakura to the minister of housing and urban development what is the total estimated market value of the 10 355 houses the government has contracted and committed to build under the kiwibuild programme and how many parliamentary terms do these contracts fall due over hon phil twyford minister of housing and urban development five and a half billion dollars of new affordable homes are contracted and committed through kiwibuild until 2028 depending on when elections are called this could be four terms hon judith collins why is the minister confident that he can sell 5 5 billion worth of houses when he only has 313 pre qualified kiwibuild buyers hon phil twyford because the demand modelling shows that across the country there are large numbers of first home buyers and those 10 355 that we ve contracted and committed will be built and they will be sold over the 10 year period hon judith collins how many of the contracts that the government has signed to supply future kiwibuild houses have a provision to allow the government to withdraw from the contract if it transpires that there is little buyer demand for what has been contracted hon phil twyford there are no provisions to withdraw from the contract because this government unlike the party on the other side of this house is committed to building affordable homes and fixing the housing crisis that s what we re doing hon judith collins how many completed kiwibuild houses sit empty in wānaka not sold hon phil twyford there are currently five homes in the wānaka development that are unsold they ve been completed only in the last month or so and they are on the market and available for kiwibuild purchasers hon judith collins is the minister aware that the kiwibuild contract signed in this term will bind future governments to underwrite property developers for kiwibuild houses even if the kiwibuild programme is cancelled by an incoming government hon phil twyford well we intend to be around for a very long time and we re going to be building affordable homes throughout that period so i don t expect that s going to be a problem for this side of the house or that side hon chris hipkins is the minister aware that the housing policy and the contracts entered into as part of the housing policy are consistent with contracts entered into by successive governments around privatising prisons using public private partnerships or any other range of contracts that governments enter into that extend beyond the term of a single parliament hon phil twyford yes i am aware it s the kind of contract that we ve entered into to build kiwibuild homes in fact the arrangements that we re entering into with some of the country s largest residential builders are multi year contracts to build hundreds and hundreds of new affordable homes that s about investing in the future of the next generation question no 6 education 6 jan tinetti labour to the minister of education what recent announcements has he made to create space and improve classrooms in secondary schools hon chris hipkins minister of education last thursday i announced 25 million for a major redevelopment of wellington girls college this school has a growing roll and it s been relying on ageing relocatable classrooms to manage their space this multimillion dollar investment by the government will provide wellington girls college with 16 new classrooms relieving the pressure that they have on their school providing them with extra teaching space extending their hall and increasing the provision for learning support and student counselling jan tinetti what other recent investments has the government made to improve the quality of classrooms and school buildings for students hon grant robertson there s more hon chris hipkins there s more a few days before that i announced 20 million to fix botany downs secondary college this money will pay to fix their leaky roofs and cladding on the nine buildings that contain 70 of their 84 classrooms it will also cover the cost of temporary teaching spaces so that there is minimum disruption to student learning while the work is being done these announcements are part of the hundreds of millions of dollars in announcements the government has made since our first budget last year question no 7 health 7 hon michael woodhouse national to the minister of health is he satisfied the extra costs incurred by dhbs are having a positive effect on the volume of health services provided if so what measures is he using to gauge the effect hon dr david clark minister of health i m satisfied that this government s record investment in health speaker i m going to get the member to speak up i think we re having a bit of a volume problem with our system hon dr david clark ok i am satisfied that this government s record investment in health is making a real difference to our public health service including to both patients and the staff that deliver their care as health minister i m more concerned with outcomes rather than simply the volume of services that s why we ve reduced the cost of going to the doctor for around 600 000 new zealanders so that they can get treatment early and prevent small problems becoming more serious however as the member asks about the volume of services we are seeing increases indeed for example so far this financial year district health boards dhbs have completed 45 456 mri scans which is 5 124 more than the same period last year over the same period we ve also delivered 8 000 more first specialist assessments and the number of people waiting for ophthalmology services has reduced from 10 200 people in may 2017 to just over 4 000 in december of course there is more to be done but progress is being made lastly in terms of measures the member knows full well there are dozens of performance measures built into our health system that record the delivery of services and the ministry of health uses the data to assist dhbs to improve their services more health services are being delivered to more new zealanders hon michael woodhouse well is he aware that the ministry of health s own statistics page has not been updated with that data since august 2016 hon dr david clark i m not sure exactly which page that member s referring to but he may need to refresh his web browser certainly the previous national government s health targets are being regularly updated and we re not printing them in the major newspapers and spending tens of thousands of dollars to promote a narrow range of political targets but you can see on there the targets being followed through of course there are a wide range measures indeed in my letter to dhbs in december i highlighted some of the ones i was concerned about hon michael woodhouse is he aware that the now defunct health target data indicates reductions in volume and timeliness in four of the five targets since he removed them and the data on the sixth target which is elective surgery has not even been released hon dr david clark the electives target was retired previously the member knows that as to the others certainly in the first quarter of the 2017 18 year since then in the comparative quarter the most recent quarter we re actually delivering on one more of the targets even though they re not ours than the previous government was hon michael woodhouse is the failure to release the elective surgery throughput data due to significant reductions in throughput as a consequence of industrial action hon dr david clark of course i don t have those numbers right in front of me but what i can say is that we re seeing more services delivered to more new zealanders and that is what we want to see i ve related to the member a large list of examples of more services being delivered and that member knows it hon michael woodhouse well isn t it true that that list is simply what the minister chooses to share and he has not yet told the new zealand public what s important to him in terms of health targets when will he do that hon dr david clark as i ve said we are focused on delivering outcomes for patients that is my concern as health minister the previous government s narrow targets are not something that i am going to commit us to because i actually believe it s more important to have better health outcomes for new zealanders than to have avastin injections and skin lesion removals done in more expensive settings just because it pumps up the statistics that s what the previous government did question no 8 agriculture 8 hon nathan guy national ōtaki to the minister of agriculture does he stand by all his statements hon damien o connor minister of agriculture yes hon nathan guy does he stand by his statements in the house yesterday that were a capital gains to be brought in it may mean that farms are more affordable for young new zealanders if so what makes him think that a young farmer wants to purchase land with significant environmental taxes and a potential capital gains tax down the track hon damien o connor i guess the member s referring to the independent report on taxation that has been put out by michael cullen and a group of people the issue of affordability is something that has been referred to there have been many many comments out around the country on that report and we welcome them most of them are sensible are considered except those from the national party can i say that i don t only rely on my own wisdom i can refer to perhaps independent commentators who have referred to this particular issue dominick stephens from westpac in fact said the current uneven tax system encourages investment heavily focused on capital gain rather than income generation such as residential property and farms and in effect turns people away from investing in more income focused investments that s just one of many many comments referring to the issue of affordability of farms hon nathan guy does he stand by his statement in relation to proposed taxes on farmers on rnz this morning and i m going to quote we haven t been through the figures if so why hasn t he worked out the cost of these proposed figures on farmers and rural communities hon damien o connor because no decisions have been made on them hon nathan guy what does the minister say to reassure farmers like federated farmers otago president simon davies who says after he s worked hard hon shane jones scaremongering making it up making it up hon nathan guy and made short term sacrifices and i ll quote it would be very disappointing to find the government then takes a third when i sell it speaker before the member answers i m just going to indicate the national party has an additional five supplementary questions as a result of the interjection from mr jones hon damien o connor if that person was one of the 10 people that turned up to that member s meeting down in otago all i d suggest to him is that he does not listen to the figures put to him by nathan guy i could refer to stephen bell who wrote in the farmers weekly young farmers still say finding affordable land particularly for dairy is the biggest obstacle to farm ownership they attribute that to previous generations paying too much for land and banking on capital gains farming needs to put its focus on operating profit rather than long term land value gains hon nathan guy why is he refuting our figures on this side of the house when he hasn t even done the figures himself or asked his officials to do any work on these proposals and what does he say to federated farmers today who are out there saying that the national party figures indeed may be a bit light hon damien o connor because i m not prepared to stand up and lie to farmers like that member is hon nathan guy i raise a point of order mr speaker i ve taken offence to that comment and i wish that that minister should withdraw and apologise speaker yeah i do want to think about it i want to think about it it s certainly an offence to indicate that a member has lied in the house i m going to get a little bit of advice traditionally it s not been an offence to i muted my own mic traditionally it s not been an offence to indicate that people have told untruths deliberately outside the house but that was a pretty aggressive reflection on a member i think i ve worked myself to the point now where it was such a yeah no i ve had some advice which i don t like very much i have worked myself to the point where i think it is a comment which could be characterised as being offensive and for that reason i will require the member to withdraw it and to apologise hon damien o connor i withdraw and apologise i raise a point of order mr speaker speaker now i want to warn the member that he s not to reflect on the ruling and the apology he s just had we ve had a member very nearly get into big trouble hon damien o connor i appreciate that mr speaker it s a clarity of whether i have the opportunity to answer the question that s all i m asking speaker well i think if the member had more that he wanted to say he should ve said it before he was offensive right further supplementary hon nathan guy too right when he said the biggest challenge in agriculture yesterday was succession does he not realise the biggest challenge facing agriculture right now is more taxes imposed by this government and potentially a capital gains tax hon damien o connor i absolutely reject that assertion if he sat down and listened to farmers across this country he wouldn t talk such rubbish question no 9 social development 9 priyanca radhakrishnan labour to the minister for social development what evidence if any has she received that demonstrates a positive impact of the service delivery changes in work and income offices hon carmel sepuloni minister for social development recently i received an update on the work that the ministry of social development is undertaking to strengthen service culture including an update on the pilot of a client experience survey called heartbeat so far the pilot survey has had nearly 1 200 responses which rate the client experience at work and income as 8 2 out of 10 it s also great to see the high engagement of māori clients who make up 35 percent of survey respondents and who are a key group we want to work better with priyanca radhakrishnan what other evidence has the minister received hon carmel sepuloni between april 2018 to january 2019 and the equivalent period the year before there has been a 3 percent decrease in the average number of trespass orders issued each month over the same period the number of reviews of decisions being sought by clients on average each month decreased by 11 percent meaning that less people are needing to dispute their entitlements and more people are speaker fewer hon carmel sepuloni receiving accurate assessments of entitlement also the number of complaints for the december 2018 quarter has decreased by 11 1 percent when compared to the december 2017 quarter priyanca radhakrishnan why is this important hon carmel sepuloni good question most new zealanders will need the support of the ministry of social development or work and income at some stage during their life for a range of reasons support while unemployed while studying due to disability or illness or when accessing superannuation all of these people deserve to be treated with respect have their dignity upheld and be provided with effective support these survey results and other feedback are valuable for informing continual improvement to the welfare system sixteen months in this is a good start but there is much more to do and i am confident that under this new government things will only get better for both clients and staff at work and income hon paula bennett is it because of the service delivery changes where sanctions and expectations on beneficiaries that the jobseeker benefit has gone up by over 11 000 people in the last 12 months hon carmel sepuloni that member knows that the proportion of new zealanders on benefit is currently 9 9 percent this time last year it was 9 8 percent the increase in numbers is due to population growth i think that member needs to reflect on her time as the minister for social development when following the reforms nearly 50 percent of those who left benefit were back on it within 18 months question no 10 education 10 dr shane reti national whangarei to the minister of education does he stand by all his policies and actions around the review of vocational education and his work in the portfolio hon chris hipkins minister of education yes dr shane reti when asked in invercargill on friday if you make a mistake here will you resign did he reply yes hon chris hipkins yes dr shane reti how is it fair to have six weeks consultation on a proposal which could rip the heart out of communities speaker order order hon chris hipkins i m happy to respond to that mr speaker i absolutely reject the assertion in the member s question with regard to the time frame for consultation there s actually a drive from people within the sector to have the consultation period in a very intense and truncated period because of the uncertainty that the sector currently faces even without this consultation and the potential damage that prolonged uncertainty could do to their ability to recruit students particularly international students dr shane reti when he said in the house yesterday that the government has not predetermined an outcome on the reforms why then has the tertiary education commission tec issued a hui invitation in whangarei on friday to hunt out people for the proposed regional leadership groups hon chris hipkins i m not familiar with the tec proposing to do that i ll certainly take the member at his word that they might have done that i have given the tec an instruction that they need to be working up the proposals they need to be continuing to work on the proposals but we haven t made decisions on them dr shane reti what is his response to skills active ito chair mr sam napia who says that the consultation process is a sham the outcomes are predetermined and a six week consultation period and three day hui invitation are completely inconsistent with treaty of waitangi and māori consultation protocols hon chris hipkins i absolutely reject the notion that the consultation is a sham dr shane reti i seek leave to table an email from ito chair mr sam napia detailing those statements speaker is there any objection to that document being tabled it s only been sent to the member has it dr shane reti yes it has speaker is there any objection to that being tabled there appears to be none document by leave laid on the table of the house hon grant robertson what factors does the minister believe led to the parlous financial state that the vocational education sector has found itself in hon chris hipkins there has been a significant underinvestment in vocational education and training including a decision made in the early 2010s to cut significant amounts of funding from the polytech sector which is one of the reasons we had to put 100 million into them this year alone in order to keep the lights on question no 11 statistics 11 dr jian yang national to the minister of statistics what recent reports has he seen on census 2018 hon chris hipkins minister of education on behalf of the minister of statistics i receive regular updates from officials insofar as it is appropriate within the bounds of statistics new zealand s statutory independence dr jian yang what advice has he received in relation to reports that māori risk losing an electorate seat if issues with census 2018 cannot be resolved hon chris hipkins i believe that the minister has not received any advice on that thus far dr jian yang what advice has he received in relation to reports that health boards and schools in regions such as northland east coast and manukau risk underfunding if issues with census 2018 cannot be resolved hon chris hipkins i repeat my answer to the previous question i understand the minister has not received advice on those things as yet dr jian yang why did he two months after the census reject concerns from the opposition and state that census 2018 would be more successful than previous censuses hon chris hipkins the census has clearly had some challenges and there s no one on this side of the house who would doubt that but i note that the business case under which the census was operated was approved by the previous government dr jian yang why is it that his department over the last year has had the time to create a bingo tool to determine one s level of privilege but it cannot a year after the census count the number of people living in new zealand hon chris hipkins that would be a question for the chief statistician dr jian yang three hundred and sixty five days after the census can he tell parliament when the census 2018 results will be available hon chris hipkins no again that would be a question for the chief statistician question no 12 health 12 hon ruth dyson labour port hills to the minister of health what recent announcement if any has he made about mental health facilities in canterbury hon dr david clark minister of health last thursday i joined the prime minister at canterbury district health board s hillmorton campus while there we announced funding for the construction of new facilities to house a range of mental health services that are currently provided at the ageing princess margaret hospital these include services for mothers and babies as well as child adolescent and family in patient services and adults with high and complex needs eating disorder services will also be shifted to hillmorton a total of 79 million has been approved for this much needed project out of the 750 million set aside in budget 2018 for capital investments in health which was the largest capital injection in health in at least a decade hon ruth dyson what facilities will be built with this 79 million investment hon dr david clark the new facilities at hillmorton will contain an integrated family service centre with a 16 bed in patient and day patient child adolescent and family service and a 13 bed and five to seven cot space for mothers and babies it will also include eating disorders in patient and out patient services a separate high and complex needs unit will include in patient adult beds work is due to begin next year with relocated services expected to start operating from hillmorton in 2022 hon ruth dyson how will these new facilities benefit patients and the staff who care for them hon dr david clark the current facilities at princess margaret hospital are far from ideal both patients and staff deserve better we need to ensure that we have physical environments that support people s treatment and recovery this development will deliver purpose built facilities that reflect modern methods of care it will create a flexible environment for mothers and their families children and adolescents and it will include access to the outdoors and green spaces it means the incredibly hard working and dedicated staff at princess margaret hospital who have maintained a high quality of health support for their patients despite their physical work environment will also

parliament questions and answers march 6 oral questions questions to ministers question no 1 forestry mark patterson nz first thank you mr speaker my question is to the minister of forestry what reports has he seen regarding the one billion trees programme speaker right the member had a bit of emphasis but he left a word out please read it as on the sheet 1 mark patterson nz first to the minister of forestry what recent reports has he seen regarding the one billion trees programme hon shane jones minister of forestry one report which puts into both political administrative and fiscal action is the 1 8 million that underwrites the ngā mahuri o ngāti hine programme where 20 young men from 15 to 22 learn while you earn this is a practical endeavour to ensure that we are swelling the ranks of the future workers for the one billion trees programme and in addition to that today i had the pleasure of hosting a delegation of a commercial character from germany who had heard about the billion trees programme and have come to new zealand to explore investment opportunities mark patterson what feedback has he heard regarding this programme hon shane jones in the interests of time i shall be uncharacteristically modest and pithy the feedback is a reminder that pastoral care is an important dimension when creating the new ranks of workers it s a reminder to industry as they seek to rely also on migrant labour that in the absence of suitable pastoral care dimensions their entreaties will fall on barren ears advertisement scroll to continue reading mark patterson what other training initiatives is the government supporting in the forestry sector hon shane jones this government has rehabilitated an industrial sector neglected for the last nine years the forestry sector are increasing their appetite for investment increasing the number of people that they seek to hire and increasing the number of trees they hope to plant it s important that we bear in mind that there are not only opportunities for those youngsters in the four winds of aotearoa to join this industry we re also focusing on boosting the ranks of young women coming through the university of canterbury and as does befit my very sensitive nature i hope to announce that shortly question no 2 prime minister 2 hon simon bridges leader of the opposition to the prime minister does she stand by all her government s statements policies and actions rt hon jacinda ardern prime minister yes hon simon bridges does she agree with grant robertson who is reported as saying there was no recommendation in the tax working group report excluding māori from the capital gains tax rt hon jacinda ardern if the member was willing to characterise the member s statements correctly then i would agree with minister robertson hon simon bridges what does she say about volume 1 of the tax working group report page 15 headed summary of recommendations which makes quite clear there are recommendations around māori being excluded from a capital gains tax speaker order order the hon kelvin davis will stand withdraw and apologise hon kelvin davis i withdraw and apologise speaker and if i d been able to tell who the other member was who interjected in that impolite manner that person would have been too please start the question again hon simon bridges what does she say about tax working group volume 1 page 15 headed summary of recommendations which makes quite clear recommendations about exemption of māori and report volume 2 which says māori freehold land merits specific treatment under an extension the taxation of capital gains this could take the form of an exclusion rt hon jacinda ardern firstly may i commend the member for finally reading the report secondly speaker order order i want to be able to hear the answer if we have about 10 people yelling there is no chance of that occurring the prime minister will start again rt hon jacinda ardern what the group clearly recommended was that we engage further with māori to determine the most appropriate treatment of transactions relating to collectively owned māori assets they recommended that we think about it i d really like to question the member where exactly is he trying to go with this issue where exactly hon simon bridges does she accept it s not where i m going it s where her government s going on a capital gains tax and will her government exclude māori from any capital gains tax it imposes rt hon jacinda ardern again i question the motivation behind this line of questioning secondly speaker order order the member will resume her seat it has been a long practice in this house not to question indirectly the motivations of members in that way and i m going to ask the prime minister not to do that again if people have specific things to say they should say it but indirect implicit criticism of that nature is not acceptable rt hon jacinda ardern again i refer them back to the report which encouraged the government to consider whether particular circumstances such as disposing of māori freehold land or where assets are hon dr nick smith are you going to exempt māori rt hon jacinda ardern transferred within iwi whether or not we should give specific consideration to an exemption in the same way that for instance if you had land passed down after death hon dr nick smith are you going to exempt them rt hon jacinda ardern whether there should be a 12 months exemption these are exemptions they asked us to consider and for very good reasons speaker now before we have any more supplementaries i m going to warn the father of the house after he s been here since i think 1990 i think he made five inappropriate interjections during that time bringing me he made five inappropriate interjections bringing me into the debate i think i ve warned him about this about 10 times in the last year and i d like him to learn rt hon winston peters if any owner māori or otherwise was holding land in trusteeship for future generations how could a capital gains tax possibly apply when they do not intend to benefit from any capital gains themselves rt hon jacinda ardern yes the member is making the point around intent of sale and again i d like to make the point that of course as has been the case for a number of years and successive governments we have for instance a 17 5 percent tax rate that applies to māori authorities and now is the member stating that he disagrees with that provision as well hon simon bridges will her government exclude māori from any capital gains tax it imposes rt hon jacinda ardern as i have reiterated the tax working group has as a group including a range of representatives acknowledged that it warrants consideration we have made no decisions but unlike the other side of the house we can see when there are circumstances that are particular that do warrant consideration it seems to me the national party now has a strategy where they don t support 17 5 percent tax rates for māori authorities we might be interested in sharing that with iwi leaders hon grant robertson what does the prime minister make of the fact that the questioning around this issues says will māori be exempted rather than saying will māori freehold land be exempted why does she think someone might make that kind of statement speaker order i think asking the prime minister to read the minds of other members is inappropriate rt hon winston peters will the potential tax considerations to be put before inland revenue have regard to how much a person feels like they are a māori or whether they discovered that somewhat the same way as columbus discovered america purely by accident speaker i m going to move on i m going to work i think for the last time today on the basis that that was not deliberately disorderly i think we ve had a couple from ministers that are heading in that direction and from this side as well hon simon bridges does she agree with grant robertson who said yesterday the tax working group report did not include recommendations of taxes like a capital gains tax a water tax a fertiliser tax a nitrate tax and agricultural emissions tax rt hon jacinda ardern i sat in this house when member nathan guy rattled off a series of taxes where there was no commentary in the tax working group on any of those issues i am happy as i said to debate the facts of the report if there was accuracy around it hon simon bridges is it the prime minister not me who hasn t read cullen s report rt hon jacinda ardern no hon simon bridges well has she read pages 16 and 17 of volume one under the heading summary of recommendations of the report which recommends not only all of those taxes i outlined before but also recommends here an environmental footprint tax and a natural capital enhancement tax aren t all of those taxes recommended in this report rt hon jacinda ardern it would be good to have a rational discussion about the tax working group s recommendations all of which in the environmental section ask us to consider the entirety of what s happening in the environmental space without the scaremongering that is coming from that side of the house and the inaccuracy from that side of the house and i have to say the environmental inaction that we are having to deal with on this side of the house because of nine years of an absolute failed government hon simon bridges so is she so brave that she s going to give new zealand page 16 an agricultural emissions tax a nitrate tax a water tax a fertiliser tax page 17 an environmental footprint tax and a natural capital enhancement tax given this is in her words our nuclear free moment rt hon jacinda ardern at least i recognised we have a nuclear free moment on that side of the house we had such inaction that the tax working group felt the need to have to traverse an entire range of issues because we are dealing with environmental degradation that has built up over years first point second point we of course are still considering all elements of the tax working group and when we have a response we will share it but if the member wants to be a responsible politician he might engage in a debate based on fact not fiction hon simon bridges can we just clear up given that grant robertson doesn t accept that those taxes are in the report that she does indeed accept factually there is a nitrate tax a water tax an agricultural emissions tax and the various other taxes i ve mentioned actually in this cullen working group report rt hon jacinda ardern when that member releases his workings on kiwisaver then let s talk speaker no order i think it wasn t an invitation to talk it was a direct question which will have an appropriate response rt hon jacinda ardern i accept very few of that member s assertions based on his record speaker the prime minister mightn t have been in the house yesterday i can t remember at the stage when i did admonish tracey martin for essentially answering a question indicating that she didn t accept the word of the member it was a factual question it was properly prepared if it was inaccurate it s a matter of privilege and the prime minister will answer it rt hon jacinda ardern for clarity i do not accept the member s characterisation of the tax working group s report hon simon bridges it s pretty simple are there the taxes i have mentioned listed as recommendations on pages 16 and 17 of volume one of cullen s tax working group report rt hon jacinda ardern in the interim hon simon bridges yes or no rt hon jacinda ardern not with the specificity that the member has detailed hon simon bridges has she read this report rt hon jacinda ardern of course i have rt hon winston peters when the prime minister referred to the possible record of past statements of the primary questioner did she have regard to the fact that they had their response to the tax working group s 21 february report out within minutes of it being published that means they couldn t have read it rt hon jacinda ardern certainly a level of detail speaker order come on one of you rt hon jacinda ardern there s certainly a level of detail that could not have been traversed in that time hon simon bridges does she accept that both michael cullen in his public advocacy for the report and grant robertson her finance minister are clearly treating the report options as absolute recommendations such as the kiwisaver offsets and the recommendations such as the māori exemption from a capital gains tax as merely options rather than recommendations and aren t they being incredibly political in their handling of this report since its release rt hon jacinda ardern absolutely not i think you ll find that sir michael cullen has had to come out and defend the tax working group because it has been mischaracterised so badly by the opposition again we on this side of the house welcome a debate on this issue all that we ask from the other side of the house is accuracy in the way it s portrayed and that s all i m sure the members of the tax working group are asking for as well hon simon bridges in light of the fact that she doesn t even know the taxes in the report who s being accurate or inaccurate speaker order rephrase the question well you ve used a question ok question no 3 finance 3 kiritapu allan labour to the minister of finance what recent reports has he seen on the economy hon grant robertson minister of finance i have seen a number of reports that highlight the strong future for sustainable growth in the new zealand economy last week statistics new zealand released its building consents data for the year to january 2019 the data showed that the number of consents for new dwellings has hit a 44 year high at 33 576 auckland continued to show strong growth with new dwellings consented rising by 20 percent while wellington was up 18 percent kiritapu allan what reports has he seen on the international context for the new zealand economy hon grant robertson overnight the chinese government announced that economic growth is forecast to be slower in china in 2019 than in 2018 in part due to trade tensions while growth there remains robust the slowing trend is similar to what we are seeing in the forecasts of global economic growth from both the world bank and the imf our own economic fundamentals in new zealand remain solid but as a relatively small trading nation we must remain resilient to any factors that are beyond our control this underlines the importance of our commitment to fiscal responsibility which gives us options in the face of any future shocks kiritapu allan how is the government responding to international economic factors hon grant robertson we have a plan for modernising and diversifying our economy to be more resilient in the face of this changing environment under our trade for all agenda we are pursuing more trade opportunities for kiwi firms including an nz eu free trade agreement so that we have a more diverse range of export markets at home we are making investments to transition from an economy based on housing speculation and population growth to one driven by more productive sustainable and inclusive growth this includes through our just transitions programme the provincial growth fund the green investment fund r d tax credits and record investment in skills and training among others question no 4 finance 4 hon amy adams national selwyn to the minister of finance does he believe new zealand s international competitiveness is an important consideration in setting tax policy hon grant robertson minister of finance i believe there are many considerations to take into account when setting tax policy these include fairness across the tax system inequality simplicity and indeed competitiveness hon amy adams does he think that the tax working group s recommended capital gains tax on 100 percent of the net gain at full marginal rates would be internationally competitive when that would give us the third highest capital gains tax rate in the oecd and contrasts with australia who only tax half the gain made speaker there were three legs but the hon grant robertson i think it s important not to isolate out any one part of the tax system as the member will be well aware the top tax rate in australia is significantly higher than it is in new zealand they also have other taxes both at a state and federal level and stamp duty so i think it s unwise to pick out one part of the tax system when making those kinds of comparisons hon amy adams how many of the oecd countries the prime minister referred to in question time yesterday tax inflationary gains or include no discount as part of their capital taxation regimes hon grant robertson i don t have all of that information there but i know that there is a range of regimes some of which include discounts and some which don t hon amy adams well has he read appendix a of the tax working group report which says that for the purposes of its recommendations assets are assumed to grow at a 3 percent nominal annual rate which is made up of 2 percent inflation and just 1 percent real growth hon grant robertson i have indeed read that hon amy adams well then can he confirm that those recommendations mean taking one third of the capital gain in tax when the other two thirds is just made up of inflation and mean that the government would be taking every single dollar of real gain made in tax hon grant robertson no i wouldn t accept that i d want to go and test that more thoroughly what i would be able to say to the member is that very few schemes around the world can find a way if they re going to be simple of accounting for inflation in the way that she wants these are the recommendations of the working group that we ll work through there are many other countries in the world in fact in the oecd all bar us and belgium who have some form of scheme like this who make it work we will look at the international examples as we consider the proposals of the working group hon amy adams how can the minister who has acknowledged that the tax working group recommended 100 percent of the gain at full marginal rates be taxed and said that the capital gain is made up of two thirds inflation one third gain dispute that that means therefore that the 33 percent of the tax on 100 percent of the gain is the equivalent of every single dollar of real gain made hon grant robertson i said that i wanted to go back and check the member s characterisation of the report that s what i will do but again i say to the member looking at that in isolation from the rest of the company tax regime that the owners of those companies will pay does not give a fair reflection of what the tax impact would be on any company or on any individual person who owns a company hon amy adams how can he claim that he does concern himself with international competitiveness when considering tax when he is now actively considering a capital gains tax with the third highest marginal rate in the oecd twice the scope of australia s and one that the tax working group s own modelling shows would take every single dollar of real gain made hon grant robertson as i said we re considering international competitiveness alongside other issues like fairness for example like simplicity i would note that we re not the first government to have undertaken a tax working group the 2010 tax working group on which the previous government based their decisions around for instance making changes to building depreciation meant that new zealand had after that the highest effective tax rate for foreign investment into manufacturing plants in new zealand as a result of a decision that the previous government made so international competitiveness hasn t always been at the top of the mind for previous governments question no 5 housing and urban development 5 hon judith collins national papakura to the minister of housing and urban development what is the total estimated market value of the 10 355 houses the government has contracted and committed to build under the kiwibuild programme and how many parliamentary terms do these contracts fall due over hon phil twyford minister of housing and urban development five and a half billion dollars of new affordable homes are contracted and committed through kiwibuild until 2028 depending on when elections are called this could be four terms hon judith collins why is the minister confident that he can sell 5 5 billion worth of houses when he only has 313 pre qualified kiwibuild buyers hon phil twyford because the demand modelling shows that across the country there are large numbers of first home buyers and those 10 355 that we ve contracted and committed will be built and they will be sold over the 10 year period hon judith collins how many of the contracts that the government has signed to supply future kiwibuild houses have a provision to allow the government to withdraw from the contract if it transpires that there is little buyer demand for what has been contracted hon phil twyford there are no provisions to withdraw from the contract because this government unlike the party on the other side of this house is committed to building affordable homes and fixing the housing crisis that s what we re doing hon judith collins how many completed kiwibuild houses sit empty in wānaka not sold hon phil twyford there are currently five homes in the wānaka development that are unsold they ve been completed only in the last month or so and they are on the market and available for kiwibuild purchasers hon judith collins is the minister aware that the kiwibuild contract signed in this term will bind future governments to underwrite property developers for kiwibuild houses even if the kiwibuild programme is cancelled by an incoming government hon phil twyford well we intend to be around for a very long time and we re going to be building affordable homes throughout that period so i don t expect that s going to be a problem for this side of the house or that side hon chris hipkins is the minister aware that the housing policy and the contracts entered into as part of the housing policy are consistent with contracts entered into by successive governments around privatising prisons using public private partnerships or any other range of contracts that governments enter into that extend beyond the term of a single parliament hon phil twyford yes i am aware it s the kind of contract that we ve entered into to build kiwibuild homes in fact the arrangements that we re entering into with some of the country s largest residential builders are multi year contracts to build hundreds and hundreds of new affordable homes that s about investing in the future of the next generation question no 6 education 6 jan tinetti labour to the minister of education what recent announcements has he made to create space and improve classrooms in secondary schools hon chris hipkins minister of education last thursday i announced 25 million for a major redevelopment of wellington girls college this school has a growing roll and it s been relying on ageing relocatable classrooms to manage their space this multimillion dollar investment by the government will provide wellington girls college with 16 new classrooms relieving the pressure that they have on their school providing them with extra teaching space extending their hall and increasing the provision for learning support and student counselling jan tinetti what other recent investments has the government made to improve the quality of classrooms and school buildings for students hon grant robertson there s more hon chris hipkins there s more a few days before that i announced 20 million to fix botany downs secondary college this money will pay to fix their leaky roofs and cladding on the nine buildings that contain 70 of their 84 classrooms it will also cover the cost of temporary teaching spaces so that there is minimum disruption to student learning while the work is being done these announcements are part of the hundreds of millions of dollars in announcements the government has made since our first budget last year question no 7 health 7 hon michael woodhouse national to the minister of health is he satisfied the extra costs incurred by dhbs are having a positive effect on the volume of health services provided if so what measures is he using to gauge the effect hon dr david clark minister of health i m satisfied that this government s record investment in health speaker i m going to get the member to speak up i think we re having a bit of a volume problem with our system hon dr david clark ok i am satisfied that this government s record investment in health is making a real difference to our public health service including to both patients and the staff that deliver their care as health minister i m more concerned with outcomes rather than simply the volume of services that s why we ve reduced the cost of going to the doctor for around 600 000 new zealanders so that they can get treatment early and prevent small problems becoming more serious however as the member asks about the volume of services we are seeing increases indeed for example so far this financial year district health boards dhbs have completed 45 456 mri scans which is 5 124 more than the same period last year over the same period we ve also delivered 8 000 more first specialist assessments and the number of people waiting for ophthalmology services has reduced from 10 200 people in may 2017 to just over 4 000 in december of course there is more to be done but progress is being made lastly in terms of measures the member knows full well there are dozens of performance measures built into our health system that record the delivery of services and the ministry of health uses the data to assist dhbs to improve their services more health services are being delivered to more new zealanders hon michael woodhouse well is he aware that the ministry of health s own statistics page has not been updated with that data since august 2016 hon dr david clark i m not sure exactly which page that member s referring to but he may need to refresh his web browser certainly the previous national government s health targets are being regularly updated and we re not printing them in the major newspapers and spending tens of thousands of dollars to promote a narrow range of political targets but you can see on there the targets being followed through of course there are a wide range measures indeed in my letter to dhbs in december i highlighted some of the ones i was concerned about hon michael woodhouse is he aware that the now defunct health target data indicates reductions in volume and timeliness in four of the five targets since he removed them and the data on the sixth target which is elective surgery has not even been released hon dr david clark the electives target was retired previously the member knows that as to the others certainly in the first quarter of the 2017 18 year since then in the comparative quarter the most recent quarter we re actually delivering on one more of the targets even though they re not ours than the previous government was hon michael woodhouse is the failure to release the elective surgery throughput data due to significant reductions in throughput as a consequence of industrial action hon dr david clark of course i don t have those numbers right in front of me but what i can say is that we re seeing more services delivered to more new zealanders and that is what we want to see i ve related to the member a large list of examples of more services being delivered and that member knows it hon michael woodhouse well isn t it true that that list is simply what the minister chooses to share and he has not yet told the new zealand public what s important to him in terms of health targets when will he do that hon dr david clark as i ve said we are focused on delivering outcomes for patients that is my concern as health minister the previous government s narrow targets are not something that i am going to commit us to because i actually believe it s more important to have better health outcomes for new zealanders than to have avastin injections and skin lesion removals done in more expensive settings just because it pumps up the statistics that s what the previous government did question no 8 agriculture 8 hon nathan guy national ōtaki to the minister of agriculture does he stand by all his statements hon damien o connor minister of agriculture yes hon nathan guy does he stand by his statements in the house yesterday that were a capital gains to be brought in it may mean that farms are more affordable for young new zealanders if so what makes him think that a young farmer wants to purchase land with significant environmental taxes and a potential capital gains tax down the track hon damien o connor i guess the member s referring to the independent report on taxation that has been put out by michael cullen and a group of people the issue of affordability is something that has been referred to there have been many many comments out around the country on that report and we welcome them most of them are sensible are considered except those from the national party can i say that i don t only rely on my own wisdom i can refer to perhaps independent commentators who have referred to this particular issue dominick stephens from westpac in fact said the current uneven tax system encourages investment heavily focused on capital gain rather than income generation such as residential property and farms and in effect turns people away from investing in more income focused investments that s just one of many many comments referring to the issue of affordability of farms hon nathan guy does he stand by his statement in relation to proposed taxes on farmers on rnz this morning and i m going to quote we haven t been through the figures if so why hasn t he worked out the cost of these proposed figures on farmers and rural communities hon damien o connor because no decisions have been made on them hon nathan guy what does the minister say to reassure farmers like federated farmers otago president simon davies who says after he s worked hard hon shane jones scaremongering making it up making it up hon nathan guy and made short term sacrifices and i ll quote it would be very disappointing to find the government then takes a third when i sell it speaker before the member answers i m just going to indicate the national party has an additional five supplementary questions as a result of the interjection from mr jones hon damien o connor if that person was one of the 10 people that turned up to that member s meeting down in otago all i d suggest to him is that he does not listen to the figures put to him by nathan guy i could refer to stephen bell who wrote in the farmers weekly young farmers still say finding affordable land particularly for dairy is the biggest obstacle to farm ownership they attribute that to previous generations paying too much for land and banking on capital gains farming needs to put its focus on operating profit rather than long term land value gains hon nathan guy why is he refuting our figures on this side of the house when he hasn t even done the figures himself or asked his officials to do any work on these proposals and what does he say to federated farmers today who are out there saying that the national party figures indeed may be a bit light hon damien o connor because i m not prepared to stand up and lie to farmers like that member is hon nathan guy i raise a point of order mr speaker i ve taken offence to that comment and i wish that that minister should withdraw and apologise speaker yeah i do want to think about it i want to think about it it s certainly an offence to indicate that a member has lied in the house i m going to get a little bit of advice traditionally it s not been an offence to i muted my own mic traditionally it s not been an offence to indicate that people have told untruths deliberately outside the house but that was a pretty aggressive reflection on a member i think i ve worked myself to the point now where it was such a yeah no i ve had some advice which i don t like very much i have worked myself to the point where i think it is a comment which could be characterised as being offensive and for that reason i will require the member to withdraw it and to apologise hon damien o connor i withdraw and apologise i raise a point of order mr speaker speaker now i want to warn the member that he s not to reflect on the ruling and the apology he s just had we ve had a member very nearly get into big trouble hon damien o connor i appreciate that mr speaker it s a clarity of whether i have the opportunity to answer the question that s all i m asking speaker well i think if the member had more that he wanted to say he should ve said it before he was offensive right further supplementary hon nathan guy too right when he said the biggest challenge in agriculture yesterday was succession does he not realise the biggest challenge facing agriculture right now is more taxes imposed by this government and potentially a capital gains tax hon damien o connor i absolutely reject that assertion if he sat down and listened to farmers across this country he wouldn t talk such rubbish question no 9 social development 9 priyanca radhakrishnan labour to the minister for social development what evidence if any has she received that demonstrates a positive impact of the service delivery changes in work and income offices hon carmel sepuloni minister for social development recently i received an update on the work that the ministry of social development is undertaking to strengthen service culture including an update on the pilot of a client experience survey called heartbeat so far the pilot survey has had nearly 1 200 responses which rate the client experience at work and income as 8 2 out of 10 it s also great to see the high engagement of māori clients who make up 35 percent of survey respondents and who are a key group we want to work better with priyanca radhakrishnan what other evidence has the minister received hon carmel sepuloni between april 2018 to january 2019 and the equivalent period the year before there has been a 3 percent decrease in the average number of trespass orders issued each month over the same period the number of reviews of decisions being sought by clients on average each month decreased by 11 percent meaning that less people are needing to dispute their entitlements and more people are speaker fewer hon carmel sepuloni receiving accurate assessments of entitlement also the number of complaints for the december 2018 quarter has decreased by 11 1 percent when compared to the december 2017 quarter priyanca radhakrishnan why is this important hon carmel sepuloni good question most new zealanders will need the support of the ministry of social development or work and income at some stage during their life for a range of reasons support while unemployed while studying due to disability or illness or when accessing superannuation all of these people deserve to be treated with respect have their dignity upheld and be provided with effective support these survey results and other feedback are valuable for informing continual improvement to the welfare system sixteen months in this is a good start but there is much more to do and i am confident that under this new government things will only get better for both clients and staff at work and income hon paula bennett is it because of the service delivery changes where sanctions and expectations on beneficiaries that the jobseeker benefit has gone up by over 11 000 people in the last 12 months hon carmel sepuloni that member knows that the proportion of new zealanders on benefit is currently 9 9 percent this time last year it was 9 8 percent the increase in numbers is due to population growth i think that member needs to reflect on her time as the minister for social development when following the reforms nearly 50 percent of those who left benefit were back on it within 18 months question no 10 education 10 dr shane reti national whangarei to the minister of education does he stand by all his policies and actions around the review of vocational education and his work in the portfolio hon chris hipkins minister of education yes dr shane reti when asked in invercargill on friday if you make a mistake here will you resign did he reply yes hon chris hipkins yes dr shane reti how is it fair to have six weeks consultation on a proposal which could rip the heart out of communities speaker order order hon chris hipkins i m happy to respond to that mr speaker i absolutely reject the assertion in the member s question with regard to the time frame for consultation there s actually a drive from people within the sector to have the consultation period in a very intense and truncated period because of the uncertainty that the sector currently faces even without this consultation and the potential damage that prolonged uncertainty could do to their ability to recruit students particularly international students dr shane reti when he said in the house yesterday that the government has not predetermined an outcome on the reforms why then has the tertiary education commission tec issued a hui invitation in whangarei on friday to hunt out people for the proposed regional leadership groups hon chris hipkins i m not familiar with the tec proposing to do that i ll certainly take the member at his word that they might have done that i have given the tec an instruction that they need to be working up the proposals they need to be continuing to work on the proposals but we haven t made decisions on them dr shane reti what is his response to skills active ito chair mr sam napia who says that the consultation process is a sham the outcomes are predetermined and a six week consultation period and three day hui invitation are completely inconsistent with treaty of waitangi and māori consultation protocols hon chris hipkins i absolutely reject the notion that the consultation is a sham dr shane reti i seek leave to table an email from ito chair mr sam napia detailing those statements speaker is there any objection to that document being tabled it s only been sent to the member has it dr shane reti yes it has speaker is there any objection to that being tabled there appears to be none document by leave laid on the table of the house hon grant robertson what factors does the minister believe led to the parlous financial state that the vocational education sector has found itself in hon chris hipkins there has been a significant underinvestment in vocational education and training including a decision made in the early 2010s to cut significant amounts of funding from the polytech sector which is one of the reasons we had to put 100 million into them this year alone in order to keep the lights on question no 11 statistics 11 dr jian yang national to the minister of statistics what recent reports has he seen on census 2018 hon chris hipkins minister of education on behalf of the minister of statistics i receive regular updates from officials insofar as it is appropriate within the bounds of statistics new zealand s statutory independence dr jian yang what advice has he received in relation to reports that māori risk losing an electorate seat if issues with census 2018 cannot be resolved hon chris hipkins i believe that the minister has not received any advice on that thus far dr jian yang what advice has he received in relation to reports that health boards and schools in regions such as northland east coast and manukau risk underfunding if issues with census 2018 cannot be resolved hon chris hipkins i repeat my answer to the previous question i understand the minister has not received advice on those things as yet dr jian yang why did he two months after the census reject concerns from the opposition and state that census 2018 would be more successful than previous censuses hon chris hipkins the census has clearly had some challenges and there s no one on this side of the house who would doubt that but i note that the business case under which the census was operated was approved by the previous government dr jian yang why is it that his department over the last year has had the time to create a bingo tool to determine one s level of privilege but it cannot a year after the census count the number of people living in new zealand hon chris hipkins that would be a question for the chief statistician dr jian yang three hundred and sixty five days after the census can he tell parliament when the census 2018 results will be available hon chris hipkins no again that would be a question for the chief statistician question no 12 health 12 hon ruth dyson labour port hills to the minister of health what recent announcement if any has he made about mental health facilities in canterbury hon dr david clark minister of health last thursday i joined the prime minister at canterbury district health board s hillmorton campus while there we announced funding for the construction of new facilities to house a range of mental health services that are currently provided at the ageing princess margaret hospital these include services for mothers and babies as well as child adolescent and family in patient services and adults with high and complex needs eating disorder services will also be shifted to hillmorton a total of 79 million has been approved for this much needed project out of the 750 million set aside in budget 2018 for capital investments in health which was the largest capital injection in health in at least a decade hon ruth dyson what facilities will be built with this 79 million investment hon dr david clark the new facilities at hillmorton will contain an integrated family service centre with a 16 bed in patient and day patient child adolescent and family service and a 13 bed and five to seven cot space for mothers and babies it will also include eating disorders in patient and out patient services a separate high and complex needs unit will include in patient adult beds work is due to begin next year with relocated services expected to start operating from hillmorton in 2022 hon ruth dyson how will these new facilities benefit patients and the staff who care for them hon dr david clark the current facilities at princess margaret hospital are far from ideal both patients and staff deserve better we need to ensure that we have physical environments that support people s treatment and recovery this development will deliver purpose built facilities that reflect modern methods of care it will create a flexible environment for mothers and their families children and adolescents and it will include access to the outdoors and green spaces it means the incredibly hard working and dedicated staff at princess margaret hospital who have maintained a high quality of health support for their patients despite their physical work environment will also benefit scoop media

what recent reports has he seen regarding the one billion trees programme hon shane jones minister of forestry one report which puts into both political administrative and fiscal action is the 1 8 million that underwrites the ngā mahuri o ngāti hine programme where 20 young men from 15 to 22 learn while you earn this is a practical endeavour to ensure that we are swelling the ranks of the future workers for the one billion trees programme and in addition to that today i had the pleasure of hosting a delegation of a commercial character from germany who had heard about the billion trees programme and have come to new zealand to explore investment opportunities mark patterson what feedback has he heard regarding this programme hon shane jones in the interests of time i shall be uncharacteristically modest and pithy the feedback is a reminder that pastoral care is an important dimension when creating the new ranks of workers it s a reminder to industry as they seek to rely also on migrant labour that in the absence of suitable pastoral care dimensions their entreaties will fall on barren ears mark patterson what other training initiatives is the government supporting in the forestry sector hon shane jones this government has rehabilitated an industrial sector neglected for the last nine years the forestry sector are increasing their appetite for investment increasing the number of people that they seek to hire and increasing the number of trees they hope to plant it s important that we bear in mind that there are not only opportunities for those youngsters in the four winds of aotearoa to join this industry we re also focusing on boosting the ranks of young women coming through the university of canterbury and as does befit my very sensitive nature i hope to announce that shortly question no 2 prime minister 2 hon simon bridges leader of the opposition to the prime minister does she stand by all her government s statements policies and actions rt hon jacinda ardern prime minister yes hon simon bridges does she agree with grant robertson who is reported as saying there was no recommendation in the tax working group report excluding māori from the capital gains tax rt hon jacinda ardern if the member was willing to characterise the member s statements correctly then i would agree with minister robertson hon simon bridges what does she say about volume 1 of the tax working group report page 15 headed summary of recommendations which makes quite clear there are recommendations around māori being excluded from a capital gains tax speaker order order the hon kelvin davis will stand withdraw and apologise hon kelvin davis i withdraw and apologise speaker and if i d been able to tell who the other member was who interjected in that impolite manner that person would have been too please start the question again hon simon bridges what does she say about tax working group volume 1 page 15 headed summary of recommendations which makes quite clear recommendations about exemption of māori and report volume 2 which says māori freehold land merits specific treatment under an extension the taxation of capital gains this could take the form of an exclusion rt hon jacinda ardern firstly may i commend the member for finally reading the report secondly speaker order order i want to be able to hear the answer if we have about 10 people yelling there is no chance of that occurring the prime minister will start again rt hon jacinda ardern what the group clearly recommended was that we engage further with māori to determine the most appropriate treatment of transactions relating to collectively owned māori assets they recommended that we think about it i d really like to question the member where exactly is he trying to go with this issue where exactly hon simon bridges does she accept it s not where i m going it s where her government s going on a capital gains tax and will her government exclude māori from any capital gains tax it imposes rt hon jacinda ardern again i question the motivation behind this line of questioning secondly speaker order order the member will resume her seat it has been a long practice in this house not to question indirectly the motivations of members in that way and i m going to ask the prime minister not to do that again if people have specific things to say they should say it but indirect implicit criticism of that nature is not acceptable rt hon jacinda ardern again i refer them back to the report which encouraged the government to consider whether particular circumstances such as disposing of māori freehold land or where assets are hon dr nick smith are you going to exempt māori rt hon jacinda ardern transferred within iwi whether or not we should give specific consideration to an exemption in the same way that for instance if you had land passed down after death hon dr nick smith are you going to exempt them rt hon jacinda ardern whether there should be a 12 months exemption these are exemptions they asked us to consider and for very good reasons speaker now before we have any more supplementaries i m going to warn the father of the house after he s been here since i think 1990 i think he made five inappropriate interjections during that time bringing me he made five inappropriate interjections bringing me into the debate i think i ve warned him about this about 10 times in the last year and i d like him to learn rt hon winston peters if any owner māori or otherwise was holding land in trusteeship for future generations how could a capital gains tax possibly apply when they do not intend to benefit from any capital gains themselves rt hon jacinda ardern yes the member is making the point around intent of sale and again i d like to make the point that of course as has been the case for a number of years and successive governments we have for instance a 17 5 percent tax rate that applies to māori authorities and now is the member stating that he disagrees with that provision as well hon simon bridges will her government exclude māori from any capital gains tax it imposes rt hon jacinda ardern as i have reiterated the tax working group has as a group including a range of representatives acknowledged that it warrants consideration we have made no decisions but unlike the other side of the house we can see when there are circumstances that are particular that do warrant consideration it seems to me the national party now has a strategy where they don t support 17 5 percent tax rates for māori authorities we might be interested in sharing that with iwi leaders hon grant robertson what does the prime minister make of the fact that the questioning around this issues says will māori be exempted rather than saying will māori freehold land be exempted why does she think someone might make that kind of statement speaker order i think asking the prime minister to read the minds of other members is inappropriate rt hon winston peters will the potential tax considerations to be put before inland revenue have regard to how much a person feels like they are a māori or whether they discovered that somewhat the same way as columbus discovered america purely by accident speaker i m going to move on i m going to work i think for the last time today on the basis that that was not deliberately disorderly i think we ve had a couple from ministers that are heading in that direction and from this side as well hon simon bridges does she agree with grant robertson who said yesterday the tax working group report did not include recommendations of taxes like a capital gains tax a water tax a fertiliser tax a nitrate tax and agricultural emissions tax rt hon jacinda ardern i sat in this house when member nathan guy rattled off a series of taxes where there was no commentary in the tax working group on any of those issues i am happy as i said to debate the facts of the report if there was accuracy around it hon simon bridges is it the prime minister not me who hasn t read cullen s report rt hon jacinda ardern no hon simon bridges well has she read pages 16 and 17 of volume one under the heading summary of recommendations of the report which recommends not only all of those taxes i outlined before but also recommends here an environmental footprint tax and a natural capital enhancement tax aren t all of those taxes recommended in this report rt hon jacinda ardern it would be good to have a rational discussion about the tax working group s recommendations all of which in the environmental section ask us to consider the entirety of what s happening in the environmental space without the scaremongering that is coming from that side of the house and the inaccuracy from that side of the house and i have to say the environmental inaction that we are having to deal with on this side of the house because of nine years of an absolute failed government hon simon bridges so is she so brave that she s going to give new zealand page 16 an agricultural emissions tax a nitrate tax a water tax a fertiliser tax page 17 an environmental footprint tax and a natural capital enhancement tax given this is in her words our nuclear free moment rt hon jacinda ardern at least i recognised we have a nuclear free moment on that side of the house we had such inaction that the tax working group felt the need to have to traverse an entire range of issues because we are dealing with environmental degradation that has built up over years first point second point we of course are still considering all elements of the tax working group and when we have a response we will share it but if the member wants to be a responsible politician he might engage in a debate based on fact not fiction hon simon bridges can we just clear up given that grant robertson doesn t accept that those taxes are in the report that she does indeed accept factually there is a nitrate tax a water tax an agricultural emissions tax and the various other taxes i ve mentioned actually in this cullen working group report rt hon jacinda ardern when that member releases his workings on kiwisaver then let s talk speaker no order i think it wasn t an invitation to talk it was a direct question which will have an appropriate response rt hon jacinda ardern i accept very few of that member s assertions based on his record speaker the prime minister mightn t have been in the house yesterday i can t remember at the stage when i did admonish tracey martin for essentially answering a question indicating that she didn t accept the word of the member it was a factual question it was properly prepared if it was inaccurate it s a matter of privilege and the prime minister will answer it rt hon jacinda ardern for clarity i do not accept the member s characterisation of the tax working group s report hon simon bridges it s pretty simple are there the taxes i have mentioned listed as recommendations on pages 16 and 17 of volume one of cullen s tax working group report rt hon jacinda ardern in the interim hon simon bridges yes or no rt hon jacinda ardern not with the specificity that the member has detailed hon simon bridges has she read this report rt hon jacinda ardern of course i have rt hon winston peters when the prime minister referred to the possible record of past statements of the primary questioner did she have regard to the fact that they had their response to the tax working group s 21 february report out within minutes of it being published that means they couldn t have read it rt hon jacinda ardern certainly a level of detail speaker order come on one of you rt hon jacinda ardern there s certainly a level of detail that could not have been traversed in that time hon simon bridges does she accept that both michael cullen in his public advocacy for the report and grant robertson her finance minister are clearly treating the report options as absolute recommendations such as the kiwisaver offsets and the recommendations such as the māori exemption from a capital gains tax as merely options rather than recommendations and aren t they being incredibly political in their handling of this report since its release rt hon jacinda ardern absolutely not i think you ll find that sir michael cullen has had to come out and defend the tax working group because it has been mischaracterised so badly by the opposition again we on this side of the house welcome a debate on this issue all that we ask from the other side of the house is accuracy in the way it s portrayed and that s all i m sure the members of the tax working group are asking for as well hon simon bridges in light of the fact that she doesn t even know the taxes in the report who s being accurate or inaccurate speaker order rephrase the question well you ve used a question ok question no 3 finance 3 kiritapu allan labour to the minister of finance what recent reports has he seen on the economy hon grant robertson minister of finance i have seen a number of reports that highlight the strong future for sustainable growth in the new zealand economy last week statistics new zealand released its building consents data for the year to january 2019 the data showed that the number of consents for new dwellings has hit a 44 year high at 33 576 auckland continued to show strong growth with new dwellings consented rising by 20 percent while wellington was up 18 percent kiritapu allan what reports has he seen on the international context for the new zealand economy hon grant robertson overnight the chinese government announced that economic growth is forecast to be slower in china in 2019 than in 2018 in part due to trade tensions while growth there remains robust the slowing trend is similar to what we are seeing in the forecasts of global economic growth from both the world bank and the imf our own economic fundamentals in new zealand remain solid but as a relatively small trading nation we must remain resilient to any factors that are beyond our control this underlines the importance of our commitment to fiscal responsibility which gives us options in the face of any future shocks kiritapu allan how is the government responding to international economic factors hon grant robertson we have a plan for modernising and diversifying our economy to be more resilient in the face of this changing environment under our trade for all agenda we are pursuing more trade opportunities for kiwi firms including an nz eu free trade agreement so that we have a more diverse range of export markets at home we are making investments to transition from an economy based on housing speculation and population growth to one driven by more productive sustainable and inclusive growth this includes through our just transitions programme the provincial growth fund the green investment fund r d tax credits and record investment in skills and training among others question no 4 finance 4 hon amy adams national selwyn to the minister of finance does he believe new zealand s international competitiveness is an important consideration in setting tax policy hon grant robertson minister of finance i believe there are many considerations to take into account when setting tax policy these include fairness across the tax system inequality simplicity and indeed competitiveness hon amy adams does he think that the tax working group s recommended capital gains tax on 100 percent of the net gain at full marginal rates would be internationally competitive when that would give us the third highest capital gains tax rate in the oecd and contrasts with australia who only tax half the gain made speaker there were three legs but the hon grant robertson i think it s important not to isolate out any one part of the tax system as the member will be well aware the top tax rate in australia is significantly higher than it is in new zealand they also have other taxes both at a state and federal level and stamp duty so i think it s unwise to pick out one part of the tax system when making those kinds of comparisons hon amy adams how many of the oecd countries the prime minister referred to in question time yesterday tax inflationary gains or include no discount as part of their capital taxation regimes hon grant robertson i don t have all of that information there but i know that there is a range of regimes some of which include discounts and some which don t hon amy adams well has he read appendix a of the tax working group report which says that for the purposes of its recommendations assets are assumed to grow at a 3 percent nominal annual rate which is made up of 2 percent inflation and just 1 percent real growth hon grant robertson i have indeed read that hon amy adams well then can he confirm that those recommendations mean taking one third of the capital gain in tax when the other two thirds is just made up of inflation and mean that the government would be taking every single dollar of real gain made in tax hon grant robertson no i wouldn t accept that i d want to go and test that more thoroughly what i would be able to say to the member is that very few schemes around the world can find a way if they re going to be simple of accounting for inflation in the way that she wants these are the recommendations of the working group that we ll work through there are many other countries in the world in fact in the oecd all bar us and belgium who have some form of scheme like this who make it work we will look at the international examples as we consider the proposals of the working group hon amy adams how can the minister who has acknowledged that the tax working group recommended 100 percent of the gain at full marginal rates be taxed and said that the capital gain is made up of two thirds inflation one third gain dispute that that means therefore that the 33 percent of the tax on 100 percent of the gain is the equivalent of every single dollar of real gain made hon grant robertson i said that i wanted to go back and check the member s characterisation of the report that s what i will do but again i say to the member looking at that in isolation from the rest of the company tax regime that the owners of those companies will pay does not give a fair reflection of what the tax impact would be on any company or on any individual person who owns a company hon amy adams how can he claim that he does concern himself with international competitiveness when considering tax when he is now actively considering a capital gains tax with the third highest marginal rate in the oecd twice the scope of australia s and one that the tax working group s own modelling shows would take every single dollar of real gain made hon grant robertson as i said we re considering international competitiveness alongside other issues like fairness for example like simplicity i would note that we re not the first government to have undertaken a tax working group the 2010 tax working group on which the previous government based their decisions around for instance making changes to building depreciation meant that new zealand had after that the highest effective tax rate for foreign investment into manufacturing plants in new zealand as a result of a decision that the previous government made so international competitiveness hasn t always been at the top of the mind for previous governments question no 5 housing and urban development 5 hon judith collins national papakura to the minister of housing and urban development what is the total estimated market value of the 10 355 houses the government has contracted and committed to build under the kiwibuild programme and how many parliamentary terms do these contracts fall due over hon phil twyford minister of housing and urban development five and a half billion dollars of new affordable homes are contracted and committed through kiwibuild until 2028 depending on when elections are called this could be four terms hon judith collins why is the minister confident that he can sell 5 5 billion worth of houses when he only has 313 pre qualified kiwibuild buyers hon phil twyford because the demand modelling shows that across the country there are large numbers of first home buyers and those 10 355 that we ve contracted and committed will be built and they will be sold over the 10 year period hon judith collins how many of the contracts that the government has signed to supply future kiwibuild houses have a provision to allow the government to withdraw from the contract if it transpires that there is little buyer demand for what has been contracted hon phil twyford there are no provisions to withdraw from the contract because this government unlike the party on the other side of this house is committed to building affordable homes and fixing the housing crisis that s what we re doing hon judith collins how many completed kiwibuild houses sit empty in wānaka not sold hon phil twyford there are currently five homes in the wānaka development that are unsold they ve been completed only in the last month or so and they are on the market and available for kiwibuild purchasers hon judith collins is the minister aware that the kiwibuild contract signed in this term will bind future governments to underwrite property developers for kiwibuild houses even if the kiwibuild programme is cancelled by an incoming government hon phil twyford well we intend to be around for a very long time and we re going to be building affordable homes throughout that period so i don t expect that s going to be a problem for this side of the house or that side hon chris hipkins is the minister aware that the housing policy and the contracts entered into as part of the housing policy are consistent with contracts entered into by successive governments around privatising prisons using public private partnerships or any other range of contracts that governments enter into that extend beyond the term of a single parliament hon phil twyford yes i am aware it s the kind of contract that we ve entered into to build kiwibuild homes in fact the arrangements that we re entering into with some of the country s largest residential builders are multi year contracts to build hundreds and hundreds of new affordable homes that s about investing in the future of the next generation question no 6 education 6 jan tinetti labour to the minister of education what recent announcements has he made to create space and improve classrooms in secondary schools hon chris hipkins minister of education last thursday i announced 25 million for a major redevelopment of wellington girls college this school has a growing roll and it s been relying on ageing relocatable classrooms to manage their space this multimillion dollar investment by the government will provide wellington girls college with 16 new classrooms relieving the pressure that they have on their school providing them with extra teaching space extending their hall and increasing the provision for learning support and student counselling jan tinetti what other recent investments has the government made to improve the quality of classrooms and school buildings for students hon grant robertson there s more hon chris hipkins there s more a few days before that i announced 20 million to fix botany downs secondary college this money will pay to fix their leaky roofs and cladding on the nine buildings that contain 70 of their 84 classrooms it will also cover the cost of temporary teaching spaces so that there is minimum disruption to student learning while the work is being done these announcements are part of the hundreds of millions of dollars in announcements the government has made since our first budget last year question no 7 health 7 hon michael woodhouse national to the minister of health is he satisfied the extra costs incurred by dhbs are having a positive effect on the volume of health services provided if so what measures is he using to gauge the effect hon dr david clark minister of health i m satisfied that this government s record investment in health speaker i m going to get the member to speak up i think we re having a bit of a volume problem with our system hon dr david clark ok i am satisfied that this government s record investment in health is making a real difference to our public health service including to both patients and the staff that deliver their care as health minister i m more concerned with outcomes rather than simply the volume of services that s why we ve reduced the cost of going to the doctor for around 600 000 new zealanders so that they can get treatment early and prevent small problems becoming more serious however as the member asks about the volume of services we are seeing increases indeed for example so far this financial year district health boards dhbs have completed 45 456 mri scans which is 5 124 more than the same period last year over the same period we ve also delivered 8 000 more first specialist assessments and the number of people waiting for ophthalmology services has reduced from 10 200 people in may 2017 to just over 4 000 in december of course there is more to be done but progress is being made lastly in terms of measures the member knows full well there are dozens of performance measures built into our health system that record the delivery of services and the ministry of health uses the data to assist dhbs to improve their services more health services are being delivered to more new zealanders hon michael woodhouse well is he aware that the ministry of health s own statistics page has not been updated with that data since august 2016 hon dr david clark i m not sure exactly which page that member s referring to but he may need to refresh his web browser certainly the previous national government s health targets are being regularly updated and we re not printing them in the major newspapers and spending tens of thousands of dollars to promote a narrow range of political targets but you can see on there the targets being followed through of course there are a wide range measures indeed in my letter to dhbs in december i highlighted some of the ones i was concerned about hon michael woodhouse is he aware that the now defunct health target data indicates reductions in volume and timeliness in four of the five targets since he removed them and the data on the sixth target which is elective surgery has not even been released hon dr david clark the electives target was retired previously the member knows that as to the others certainly in the first quarter of the 2017 18 year since then in the comparative quarter the most recent quarter we re actually delivering on one more of the targets even though they re not ours than the previous government was hon michael woodhouse is the failure to release the elective surgery throughput data due to significant reductions in throughput as a consequence of industrial action hon dr david clark of course i don t have those numbers right in front of me but what i can say is that we re seeing more services delivered to more new zealanders and that is what we want to see i ve related to the member a large list of examples of more services being delivered and that member knows it hon michael woodhouse well isn t it true that that list is simply what the minister chooses to share and he has not yet told the new zealand public what s important to him in terms of health targets when will he do that hon dr david clark as i ve said we are focused on delivering outcomes for patients that is my concern as health minister the previous government s narrow targets are not something that i am going to commit us to because i actually believe it s more important to have better health outcomes for new zealanders than to have avastin injections and skin lesion removals done in more expensive settings just because it pumps up the statistics that s what the previous government did question no 8 agriculture 8 hon nathan guy national ōtaki to the minister of agriculture does he stand by all his statements hon damien o connor minister of agriculture yes hon nathan guy does he stand by his statements in the house yesterday that were a capital gains to be brought in it may mean that farms are more affordable for young new zealanders if so what makes him think that a young farmer wants to purchase land with significant environmental taxes and a potential capital gains tax down the track hon damien o connor i guess the member s referring to the independent report on taxation that has been put out by michael cullen and a group of people the issue of affordability is something that has been referred to there have been many many comments out around the country on that report and we welcome them most of them are sensible are considered except those from the national party can i say that i don t only rely on my own wisdom i can refer to perhaps independent commentators who have referred to this particular issue dominick stephens from westpac in fact said the current uneven tax system encourages investment heavily focused on capital gain rather than income generation such as residential property and farms and in effect turns people away from investing in more income focused investments that s just one of many many comments referring to the issue of affordability of farms hon nathan guy does he stand by his statement in relation to proposed taxes on farmers on rnz this morning and i m going to quote we haven t been through the figures if so why hasn t he worked out the cost of these proposed figures on farmers and rural communities hon damien o connor because no decisions have been made on them hon nathan guy what does the minister say to reassure farmers like federated farmers otago president simon davies who says after he s worked hard hon shane jones scaremongering making it up making it up hon nathan guy and made short term sacrifices and i ll quote it would be very disappointing to find the government then takes a third when i sell it speaker before the member answers i m just going to indicate the national party has an additional five supplementary questions as a result of the interjection from mr jones hon damien o connor if that person was one of the 10 people that turned up to that member s meeting down in otago all i d suggest to him is that he does not listen to the figures put to him by nathan guy i could refer to stephen bell who wrote in the farmers weekly young farmers still say finding affordable land particularly for dairy is the biggest obstacle to farm ownership they attribute that to previous generations paying too much for land and banking on capital gains farming needs to put its focus on operating profit rather than long term land value gains hon nathan guy why is he refuting our figures on this side of the house when he hasn t even done the figures himself or asked his officials to do any work on these proposals and what does he say to federated farmers today who are out there saying that the national party figures indeed may be a bit light hon damien o connor because i m not prepared to stand up and lie to farmers like that member is hon nathan guy i raise a point of order mr speaker i ve taken offence to that comment and i wish that that minister should withdraw and apologise speaker yeah i do want to think about it i want to think about it it s certainly an offence to indicate that a member has lied in the house i m going to get a little bit of advice traditionally it s not been an offence to i muted my own mic traditionally it s not been an offence to indicate that people have told untruths deliberately outside the house but that was a pretty aggressive reflection on a member i think i ve worked myself to the point now where it was such a yeah no i ve had some advice which i don t like very much i have worked myself to the point where i think it is a comment which could be characterised as being offensive and for that reason i will require the member to withdraw it and to apologise hon damien o connor i withdraw and apologise i raise a point of order mr speaker speaker now i want to warn the member that he s not to reflect on the ruling and the apology he s just had we ve had a member very nearly get into big trouble hon damien o connor i appreciate that mr speaker it s a clarity of whether i have the opportunity to answer the question that s all i m asking speaker well i think if the member had more that he wanted to say he should ve said it before he was offensive right further supplementary hon nathan guy too right when he said the biggest challenge in agriculture yesterday was succession does he not realise the biggest challenge facing agriculture right now is more taxes imposed by this government and potentially a capital gains tax hon damien o connor i absolutely reject that assertion if he sat down and listened to farmers across this country he wouldn t talk such rubbish question no 9 social development 9 priyanca radhakrishnan labour to the minister for social development what evidence if any has she received that demonstrates a positive impact of the service delivery changes in work and income offices hon carmel sepuloni minister for social development recently i received an update on the work that the ministry of social development is undertaking to strengthen service culture including an update on the pilot of a client experience survey called heartbeat so far the pilot survey has had nearly 1 200 responses which rate the client experience at work and income as 8 2 out of 10 it s also great to see the high engagement of māori clients who make up 35 percent of survey respondents and who are a key group we want to work better with priyanca radhakrishnan what other evidence has the minister received hon carmel sepuloni between april 2018 to january 2019 and the equivalent period the year before there has been a 3 percent decrease in the average number of trespass orders issued each month over the same period the number of reviews of decisions being sought by clients on average each month decreased by 11 percent meaning that less people are needing to dispute their entitlements and more people are speaker fewer hon carmel sepuloni receiving accurate assessments of entitlement also the number of complaints for the december 2018 quarter has decreased by 11 1 percent when compared to the december 2017 quarter priyanca radhakrishnan why is this important hon carmel sepuloni good question most new zealanders will need the support of the ministry of social development or work and income at some stage during their life for a range of reasons support while unemployed while studying due to disability or illness or when accessing superannuation all of these people deserve to be treated with respect have their dignity upheld and be provided with effective support these survey results and other feedback are valuable for informing continual improvement to the welfare system sixteen months in this is a good start but there is much more to do and i am confident that under this new government things will only get better for both clients and staff at work and income hon paula bennett is it because of the service delivery changes where sanctions and expectations on beneficiaries that the jobseeker benefit has gone up by over 11 000 people in the last 12 months hon carmel sepuloni that member knows that the proportion of new zealanders on benefit is currently 9 9 percent this time last year it was 9 8 percent the increase in numbers is due to population growth i think that member needs to reflect on her time as the minister for social development when following the reforms nearly 50 percent of those who left benefit were back on it within 18 months question no 10 education 10 dr shane reti national whangarei to the minister of education does he stand by all his policies and actions around the review of vocational education and his work in the portfolio hon chris hipkins minister of education yes dr shane reti when asked in invercargill on friday if you make a mistake here will you resign did he reply yes hon chris hipkins yes dr shane reti how is it fair to have six weeks consultation on a proposal which could rip the heart out of communities speaker order order hon chris hipkins i m happy to respond to that mr speaker i absolutely reject the assertion in the member s question with regard to the time frame for consultation there s actually a drive from people within the sector to have the consultation period in a very intense and truncated period because of the uncertainty that the sector currently faces even without this consultation and the potential damage that prolonged uncertainty could do to their ability to recruit students particularly international students dr shane reti when he said in the house yesterday that the government has not predetermined an outcome on the reforms why then has the tertiary education commission tec issued a hui invitation in whangarei on friday to hunt out people for the proposed regional leadership groups hon chris hipkins i m not familiar with the tec proposing to do that i ll certainly take the member at his word that they might have done that i have given the tec an instruction that they need to be working up the proposals they need to be continuing to work on the proposals but we haven t made decisions on them dr shane reti what is his response to skills active ito chair mr sam napia who says that the consultation process is a sham the outcomes are predetermined and a six week consultation period and three day hui invitation are completely inconsistent with treaty of waitangi and māori consultation protocols hon chris hipkins i absolutely reject the notion that the consultation is a sham dr shane reti i seek leave to table an email from ito chair mr sam napia detailing those statements speaker is there any objection to that document being tabled it s only been sent to the member has it dr shane reti yes it has speaker is there any objection to that being tabled there appears to be none document by leave laid on the table of the house hon grant robertson what factors does the minister believe led to the parlous financial state that the vocational education sector has found itself in hon chris hipkins there has been a significant underinvestment in vocational education and training including a decision made in the early 2010s to cut significant amounts of funding from the polytech sector which is one of the reasons we had to put 100 million into them this year alone in order to keep the lights on question no 11 statistics 11 dr jian yang national to the minister of statistics what recent reports has he seen on census 2018 hon chris hipkins minister of education on behalf of the minister of statistics i receive regular updates from officials insofar as it is appropriate within the bounds of statistics new zealand s statutory independence dr jian yang what advice has he received in relation to reports that māori risk losing an electorate seat if issues with census 2018 cannot be resolved hon chris hipkins i believe that the minister has not received any advice on that thus far dr jian yang what advice has he received in relation to reports that health boards and schools in regions such as northland east coast and manukau risk underfunding if issues with census 2018 cannot be resolved hon chris hipkins i repeat my answer to the previous question i understand the minister has not received advice on those things as yet dr jian yang why did he two months after the census reject concerns from the opposition and state that census 2018 would be more successful than previous censuses hon chris hipkins the census has clearly

the term green new deal has been used to describe policies that address climate change policies and investment in renewable energy the united nations un announced a global green new deal in 2008 former president obama added one to his platform when he ran for election in 2008 and green party candidates such as jill stein and howie hawkins did the same in 2019 a green new deal was a congressional resolution introduced by representative alexandria ocasio cortez of new york and senator edward j markey of massachusetts key takeaways the term green new deal has been used to describe policies that aim to make systemic change the term was first used by pulitzer prize winner thomas friedman in january 2007 and made popular by the proposal of rep alexandria ocasio cortez and sen ed markey in congress in 2019 the deal emphasizes environmental and social justice while calling for new job creation history of the green new deal the term green new deal was first used by pulitzer prize winner thomas friedman in january 2007 friedman recognized a solution to climate change that would require money effort and upsetting the fossil fuel industry transitioning away from fossil fuels he argued in a new york times column would require the government to raise prices introduce higher energy standards and undertake a massive industrial project to scale up green technology the right rallying call is for a green new deal he wrote referencing former president franklin d roosevelt s domestic programs to rescue the country from the great depression if you have put a windmill in your yard or some solar panels on your roof bless your heart but we will only green the world when we change the very nature of the electricity grid moving it away from dirty coal or oil to clean coal and renewables proposals 2019 2024 in 2019 representative alexandria ocasio cortez and sen ed markey introduced a 14 page nonbinding resolution in congress calling for the federal government to create a green new deal the resolution had over 100 co sponsors in congress and attracted several democratic presidential candidates according to the proposal the u s and its historical contribution proved disproportionate greenhouse gas emissions on march 26 2019 lawmakers in the senate voted 57 0 against advancing the resolution with 43 out of 47 democrats voting present to avoid a formal position the green new deal proposed to tackle the climate crisis with a 10 year mobilization and address an issue that 60 of americans said already affected their local community the deal promised to tackle economic inequality by creating high quality union jobs and called for the protection of workers rights community ownership universal healthcare and a job guarantee in april 2023 senator markey and congresswoman ocasio cortez reintroduced the green new deal resolution but the resolution has not yet passed as of 2024 however since the green new deal was first introduced supporters saw some federal investment to fight climate change included in the 2022 inflation reduction act in 2024 five years after the green new deal s introduction polling from data for progress shows 49 of voters view climate change more seriously than in the past goals of the green new deal the main goal of the plan is to bring u s greenhouse gas emissions down to net zero and meet 100 of power demand in the country through clean renewable and zero emission energy sources by 2030 the proposal calls for job creation along with access to nature clean air and water healthy food a sustainable environment and community resiliency by providing investments and leveraging funding to help communities affected by climate change repairing and upgrading existing infrastructure to withstand extreme weather and ensuring all bills related to infrastructure in congress address climate change investing in renewable power sources investing in manufacturing and industry to spur growth in the use of clean energy building or upgrading to energy efficient distributed and smart power grids that provide affordable electricity upgrading all existing buildings and building new ones so that they achieve maximum energy efficiency water efficiency safety affordability comfort and durability supporting family farming investing in sustainable farming and building a more sustainable and equitable food system investing in transportation systems namely zero emission vehicle infrastructure and manufacturing public transit and high speed rail restoring ecosystems through land preservation afforestation and science based projects cleaning up existing hazardous waste and abandoned sites identifying unknown sources of pollution and emissions working with the international community on solutions and helping them achieve green new deals climate change a common rebuttal to opponents from supporters of the green new deal is that although it will be expensive to implement not doing so will be more expensive in the long run to stop temperatures from rising beyond 1 5 degrees celsius the target aimed for in the 2015 paris agreement global emissions need to go to zero by 2050 the federal government spent 450 billion due to extreme weather and fire events between 2005 and 2018 according to a 2018 report by the u s government accounting office in 2022 the u s experienced eighteen weather and climate disasters costing at least 1 billion climate change will cause more than 500 billion in economic loss in the united states alone each year by 2090 according to a 2019 study independent research shows that about 10 of the value of the global economy could be wiped out by 2050 if temperatures continue to rise by 3 2 degrees celsius and the world doesn t meet the net zero targets outlined by the paris agreement supporters advocates of the green new deal who promote a heterodox macroeconomic framework called modern monetary theory mmt believe the government should not be concerned about the cost the federal government can spend money on public priorities without raising revenue and it won t wreck the nation s economy to do so a group of prominent mmt supporters wrote in an op ed for the huffington post the green party whose plan also calls for america to move to 100 clean energy by 2030 and a job guarantee says it will result in healthcare savings and military savings the party s deal also advocates for a robust carbon fee program healthcare and other savings were also touted in a 2015 study by a group of scientists from stanford university and the university of california berkeley that said the u s can replace 80 to 85 of the existing energy systems with ones powered entirely by wind water and sunlight by 2030 and 100 by 2050 critics critics call the green new deal socialist extreme or impractical some have warned that environmentalists want to take away your hamburgers the kind of overhaul the deal calls for would be expensive and require significant government intervention the center right american action forum pegs the maximum cost at 93 trillion while tax policy center senior fellow howard gleckman said the plan may slow the economy by adding to the debt and even drive jobs overseas instead of the green new deal the federal government could adopt a revenue neutral carbon tax to decrease emissions without exacerbating the fiscal imbalance said jeffrey miron director of economic studies at the right wing cato institute edward b barbier the american economics professor who wrote the report that formed the basis of the un s green new deal said that instead of deficit funding the government should use revenues from dismantled subsidies and environmental taxes how will the green new deal affect investors investment opportunities may arise with the passage of a green new deal according to ubs there is a long term trend towards more sustainable and green ways of producing and consuming with investments in environmentally oriented sustainable industries while a green new deal doesn t explicitly call for eliminating fossil fuel usage it may hit the industry hard including nuclear energy stocks who wrote the green new deal the idea of a green new deal was first introduced by thomas friedman who recognized there was no easy solution to climate change in 2019 rep alexandria ocasio cortez d ny and sen ed markey d mass introduced a proposal for a green new deal in congress though it failed to pass in the senate the proposal was reintroduced in 2023 how would the green new deal create jobs the green new deal promises to create millions of jobs by shifting money from the fossil fuel industry to green technology the bottom line the term green new deal is synonymous with policies that tackle climate change and boost investment in sustainable energy the term was first used by pulitzer prize winner thomas friedman in january 2007 and gained momentum in 2019 with a proposal from rep alexandria ocasio cortez and sen ed markey in congress
the u s goods trade deficit surged to a record high in 2018 as strong domestic demand fueled by lower taxes pulled in imports despite the trump administration s america first policies including tariffs aimed at shrinking the trade gap president donald trump is pursuing a protectionist trade agenda to shield u s manufacturing from what he says is unfair foreign competition trump who has dubbed himself the tariff man pledged on both the campaign trail and as president to reduce the deficit by shutting out more unfairly traded imports and renegotiating free trade agreements the commerce department said on wednesday that a 12 4 per cent jump in the goods deficit in december had contributed to the record 891 3 billion goods trade shortfall last year the overall trade deficit surged 12 5 per cent to 621 0 billion in 2018 the largest since 2008 a container ship is unloaded at the port of oakland in this file photo on wednesday the commerce department reported on the u s trade gap for december this chart shows the monthly trade deficit from december 2016 to december 2018 the trade deficit exploded last year despite the trump administration efforts to make america great again and the trend is unlikely to get any better in 2019 said chris rupkey chief economist at mufg in new york the white house has argued that reducing the trade deficit would boost annual economic growth to its goal of 3 percent on a sustainable basis the government also sought to stimulate the economy with a 1 5 trillion tax cut package which jolted both consumer and business spending helping to lift imported goods to a record 2 6 trillion in 2018 the united states last year imposed tariffs on 250 billion worth of goods imported from china with beijing hitting back with duties on 110 billion worth of american products including soybeans and other commodities trump has delayed tariffs on 200 billion worth of chinese imports as negotiations to resolve the eight month trade war continue businesses likely stocked up on imports in anticipation of further duties on chinese goods which ironically contributed to the deterioration in the trade deficit last year the goods trade deficit with china increased 11 6 percent to an all time high of 419 2 billion in 2018 the united states which also slapped duties on imported steel aluminum solar panels and washing machines had record imports from 60 countries in 2018 led by china mexico and germany perhaps donald trump will now discover that tweets and bluster alone won t dramatically shrink the trade deficit said scott paul president of the alliance for american manufacturing in washington the administration s fiscal policies have helped to boost the trade deficit while goods exports hit a record 1 7 trillion in 2018 they declined in the last three months of the year weighed by the u s china trade dispute slowing global demand and a strong dollar which is making american made goods less competitive on the international market the dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies while u s treasury prices rose stocks on wall street were trading lower as investors awaited fresh developments on the trade negotiations economists expect exports to remain weak even if washington and beijing strike a trade deal that will take time and if the chinese growth is as soft as most economists believe it is hard to see how they can ramp up demand for u s products very much this year said joel naroff chief economist at naroff economic advisors in holland pennsylvania a 1 9 percent drop in exports of goods and services drove the trade deficit in december to 59 8 billion the largest since october 2008 imports of goods and services increased 2 1 percent to 264 9 billion in december when adjusted for inflation the goods trade deficit surged 10 0 billion to a record 91 6 billion in december the jump in the so called real goods trade deficit suggests that the drag from trade on fourth quarter gross domestic product growth was probably bigger than the 0 22 percentage point estimated by the government last week economists expect the government will revise down fourth quarter gdp growth to a 2 3 percent annualized rate from the 2 6 percent it reported last thursday the cape kortia container ship left heads into the port of tacoma in this file photo the u s trade deficit jumped nearly 19 percent in december pushing the trade imbalance for all of 2018 to widen to a decade long high of 621 billion other data on wednesday suggested some slowing in the labor market though the pace of job gains remains more than enough to drive the unemployment rate down the adp national employment report showed private payrolls increased by 183 000 in february after surging 300 000 in january economists polled by reuters had forecast private payrolls advancing 189 000 in february the adp report which is jointly developed with moody s analytics was published ahead of the government s more comprehensive employment report for february scheduled for release on friday the adp report is not considered a reliable predictor of the private payrolls portion of the government s employment report because of differences in methodology february s report was however in line with other labor market data including weekly applications for unemployment benefits and manufacturing and services sector surveys that have suggested some moderation in job growth following hefty gains in january it looks broadly consistent with our view that job growth remained solid in february despite cooling from the boomy figures reported for the prior several months said daniel silver an economist at jpmorgan in new york according to a reuters survey of economists nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 180 000 jobs in february after jumping 304 000 in january the unemployment rate is forecast falling to 3 9 percent in february from 4 0 percent in january

when felice robinson was hired at general motors lordstown plant in 1995 she thought the rest of her life was taken care of robinson who was then in h when felice robinson was hired at general motors lordstown plant in 1995 she thought the rest of her life was taken care of robinson who was then in her mid 20s had been bouncing around a series of low paid retail jobs when she learned the giant factory down the road was hiring the assembly line position came with generous health care benefits an hourly wage more than twice what she had been making at a menswear store and the promise of a secure retirement if she could hold on to the job for 30 years it was a whole different world robinson who s now 50 told cnn business in late february i couldn t believe how lucky i was to be making that kind of money without a college degree that world has been evaporating for decades now on wednesday when the lordstown plant will make its last chevy cruze and close its doors it will get even smaller for gm the move is part of an overall strategy to shift away from sedans and toward higher margin trucks and light suvs in an era of low gas prices gm is also pouring money into electric and autonomous cars which are still primarily in the research and development phase and with gm s investment in a ridesharing platform called maven the company is looking forward to a future in which fewer people own vehicles at all for workers the transition means uncertainty dislocation and immersion in a labor market with far fewer opportunities for those without training beyond a high school degree as recently as the early 2000s a job in an auto plant could be a launchpad to the middle class but those jobs are increasingly rare during the lordstown plant s heyday in the 1970s gm was one of the biggest private sector employers in the united states with more than 618 000 employees that number is now down to about 103 000 and the jobs that remain are not all what they once were since 1990 wages for us auto workers have declined 18 adjusted for inflation retirement benefits have declined as well as of 2017 only 8 of factories offered pensions those trends are especially pronounced in the youngstown ohio region an area about halfway between cleveland and pittsburgh in which lordstown sits thirty years ago about 1 out of 4 local workers were employed by the manufacturing industry now less than half that many are since the beginning of the great recession real hourly earnings have dropped by 8 in the area while rising 11 in the rest of the country all that has made gm jobs stick out full time production workers make between 61 000 and 88 000 a year after only a couple years on the job according to their united auto workers union contract not including additional overtime pay and bonuses that s well above the average wage in the youngstown area which was around 38 000 in 2017 unlike during the great recession gm is cutting these jobs along with about 1 400 more hourly positions at us plants elsewhere at a time when it s profitable and the national economy is strong that s an indication that gm sees its future as one with fewer factory floor workers not more of them and for the youngstown area losing the last major supplier of the type of jobs that made it a manufacturing powerhouse decades ago is a particularly symbolic blow about 400 of the 1 400 people who ll no longer go to work at gm s sprawling lordstown complex after this week have accepted transfers to other plants and will keep their healthcare and pensions other former workers at the plant which used to run 24 hours a day were not as fortunate as demand for the cruze weakened over the past two years its second and third shifts were cut and 3 000 people were laid off many of them won t be offered the same transfer opportunities this latest group will gm says that 350 lordstown workers are eligible for retirement those who transfer will get 30 000 in relocation assistance and that it s working to find new employment for anyone who wants it we understand that the decision that was made is very difficult for this community because it impacts people and families gm spokesman daniel flores told cnn business unfortunately customers are not buying the product at a volume that would justify continued production in the end we made this decision at a point in time where we have the ability to offer opportunities to people who want to keep working for gm robinson thinks she probably has enough seniority to get a placement at one of gm s other facilities like the metal fabrication plant in cleveland or the transmission factory in toledo she dreads transferring she ll have to leave her 68 year old aunt who needs support as well as the rest of her family and friends and the town she s always called home but she has little choice despite the strongest us labor market in a generation the economy is not generating the types of jobs that gm offered her as a young woman at least not in youngstown they have me by a chokehold there s nothing i can do robinson said i make 32 an hour i m not going to go get a 12 an hour job i couldn t survive on that at all i m going to get up and go ride it out try to get the best gig i can get and be done with them the good old days the loss of general motors won t be the first time the youngstown area took a shock to the heart it s been reeling ever since the sudden collapse of the local steel industry in the late 1970s when competition from cheap imports and the failure of american steel mills to compete led to the disappearance of nearly 50 000 jobs over five years through that time the auto industry became something of a lifeline the lordstown plant which opened in 1966 hired thousands of workers and thousands more worked in smaller independent machine shops that supplied auto parts to gm the gm plant floated the local government providing some 2 million a year in tax revenue said terry armstrong superintendent of the lordstown school district the lordstown school campus with its spacious lecture halls and a planetarium was built without debt the unionized jobs paid far above market topping out in the 30 an hour range for reasonably humane tasks like installing seatbelt harnesses securing engine brakes or driving forklifts former gm worker tom albright who retired in 2015 remembers being able to do his work faster than the rest of the line and then relax i could get ahead of the job for three hours and at that point i could go goof off for three hours said albright whose son still works in the plant those were the good old days it ain t like that anymore they get every nickel that they can out of that individual working that job on the floor but then cracks started to show in the us auto industry starting with competition from japanese automakers in the 1980s and continuing with nafta in 1994 employment slid as work was outsourced to lower paying suppliers including plants in mexico the lordstown plant wasn t immune to the changes that have been affecting the workforce more broadly in 2007 as the automakers were bleeding cash the union accepted the creation of a lower wage tier for entry level workers meaning that they made 45 less per hour and got a 401 k plan instead of a guaranteed pension after gm s bankruptcy in 2009 workers told cnn business the job became harder with management pressing for less downtime slowly but surely they became less and less thoughtful about the people who worked for them said robinson it s just not the same company that i used to work for it s so much more cutthroat and it s meaner i know that the old gm is gone but many in the community still recognize that those jobs feed families donate to local charities and buy cars they also generate other jobs since manufacturing brings in capital from outside the area rather than just recirculating it each factory position is estimated to get three or four more people working in fields like healthcare food service retail and education that s why last fall the united auto workers local 1112 and the region s chamber of commerce started the drive it home campaign a community effort to post signs send letters and work with politicians to convince gm to build another product at the lordstown plant it was meant to mimic another push two decades ago when lordstown was in competition with other cities to win another car model to replace the chevy cavalier that one worked with the help of officials at the plant who joined the effort the one difference is that this time plant management was not interested in participating said james dignan president of the youngstown warren regional chamber the plant management used to be very engaged locally but they re losing some of that tie and that feel from the company to the community dignan said they re working to get another user for the plant if gm decides to give it up permanently but to the local union workers getting another gm product is far preferable to getting another company these are their jobs and they ll likely still have more protections and higher wages than any other employer we don t want elon musk coming in we don t want amazon building a distribution center said david green who s been president of uaw local 1112 since last may he led another local within the plant in 2007 when the company asked to pay new workers lower wages i supported that because the promise was product and job security green said do what we had to do to keep working keep our communities and our families alive and thriving it feels like they betrayed us a little bit so far the company hasn t shown its cards and the uncertainty is what gets to people why take a transfer if it seems likely that lordstown will get a new car within the next year and you could come back for that matter what new employer would take a chance on someone who would bail as soon as lordstown re opened plenty of people remember how gm re opened its plant in spring hill tennessee in 2011 after having shuttered it two years earlier that s why for those who have the option the choice of whether to go or stay is so agonizing even though the job had its fair share of hardships tammy vennitti 55 was laid off with the second shift back in june last year she had signed up for a training course in order to keep her supplemental unemployment benefits and then put those plans on hold in january when gm called back those who d been laid off to fill in for the people who were being moved out to other plants vennitti applied for a transfer to a plant in toledo and she doesn t know if she ll get it or whether she d take it if she did given that she lives with her 27 year old daughter and 18 month old granddaughter but she needs the healthcare benefits to pay for the blood pressure pills her doctor put her on during the stress of being laid off for months not to mention care for a body that took a beating over 24 years of lifting 30 to 40 pounds 400 times a day gm s gold plated insurance paid for a shoulder replacement carpal tunnel surgery and cortizone shots for a knee that had no more cartilage to cushion her bones for 24 years i ve done nothing for this company and this union but bend over vennitti said this is all i ve ever done i never thought it would come to this the jobs of the future what s next for employment in youngstown the local chamber of commerce said there are 13 000 job openings in the area team neo an economic development non profit focused on northeast ohio said there will be strong demand in the coming years for workers in information technology healthcare and manufacturing but unlike the manufacturing jobs of the past which usually did not require education beyond high school 65 of those jobs will require a post secondary credential by 2021 the group estimates there are plenty of training opportunities since gm workers get assistance both from the state and the us department of commerce through trade adjustment assistance so far there s been strong interest in truck driving certificates an ohio state official said since those take only a few weeks to get and pay relatively well some workers saw the end coming early and took steps to prepare trish amato 43 was hired too late to get a traditional pension lessening the need to hang on to a gm job she used gm s tuition benefits to finish her bachelor s degree and get a master s degree in special education when she was laid off in 2018 amato thought about going to the plant at spring hill tennessee but she and her partner whose truck driving job also depends on lordstown being open didn t think they could afford the rent in the booming area south of nashville so instead they re thinking of trading in his big rig for a motorhome and traveling the country while she teaches online courses from the road a future that wouldn t have been possible without gm s help in going to school and that she wouldn t have embraced without gm shuttering the lordstown plant gm is hard to walk away from because the insurance benefits are awesome amato said gm gave us a good life am i disappointed in what they re doing for other people yes for me no if something like this didn t happen i wouldn t be able to follow a dream for the next generation the question is what kind of wages the new working class jobs will pay the local high school has started a training program for the logistics industry helping prepare kids for jobs in the many distribution centers that are popping up in the area that s our way of giving kids a little bit of a leg up said armstrong superintendent of the lordstown school district where about 15 of students have parents who worked in the plant but he said i don t see them paying what the gm jobs paid tj maxx for example is building a facility that will employ 1 000 people in the area job listings for entry level warehouse workers at its other locations range between 10 and 13 50 an hour the gm plant had also been a regular stop for politicians on the stump from john mccain to barack obama giving kids a sense that their town mattered on tuesday the school held a group photo to support the drive it home campaign students and staff alike wore blue and brought their gm cars but after this latest blow will lordstown students have confidence in a future in manufacturing
america s trade deficit with the rest of the world rose to its highest level in history last year as the united states imported more goods than ever including a record amount from china ballooning the deficit to 891 3 billion and delivering a setback to president trump s goal of narrowing that gap the increase was driven by some factors outside mr trump s control like a global economic slowdown and the relative strength of the united states dollar both of which weakened overseas demand for american goods but the widening gap was also exacerbated by mr trump s 1 5 trillion tax cut which

promoting economic growth through trade and investment that a fiscal space will emerge to meet the upcoming demographic challenges while moving up the global value chains that is the promise of the

duties that have been set at a rate of more than 25 per cent to discourage importation the process of reviewing the cet is coming to an end with the points of disagreements becoming fewer said richard kamajugo trademark east africa senior director for trade environment the last time the cet was reviewed was in 2010 when the three band structure was maintained archie matheson for want of warm bodies a trading kingdom is being lost the east african and within the secretariat there is a department that puts this responsibility into practice an office small in size but large in mandate the directorate of trade and customs given the role of comesa on the continental stage it is perhaps the most important office related to african trade active in three main areas the directorate helps to resolve trade disputes relating to both rules of origin and non tariff barriers covering both trade in goods and trade in services it is called upon to give official opinion share recommendations arrange dialogue between disputing parties lead on the spot verifications and if necessary refer cases to the council of ministers in january 2019 alone three full interventions were needed and successfully completed it develops ideas and policies that are then presented to the council for approval seeking greater harmonisation and introducing trade facilitation measures for an office with such far reaching responsibilities it would be reasonable to expect an array of specialists sufficient in number to cover the rules of origin ntbs and small scale trade issues that arise under trade in goods or the challenges posed within the 12 separate sectors that sit under trade in services experts to drive improvement in trade facilitation and negotiation specialists for the multitude of international trade agreements yet staggeringly the directorate has only four full time staff a director senior trade officer senior customs officer and a senior research fellow they are assisted by no more than a handful of shorter term contract staff although through its trade facilitation regional programme the eu will shortly fund two new project staff to deal with small scale trade total numbers are chronically insufficient the consequences for comesa members importers and exporters are costly not through a lack of will or ability but a lack of funding and corresponding capacity kenya

business daily currently more than 50 of ordinary revenue goes into salaries of civil servants 30 to recurrent expenditure and only 20 to development the president said tuesday the summit whose date he did not state would discuss how national and county governments would review their expenditure we shall invite all stakeholders to the summit so we find ways of rectifying this wrong so that most of the money will be going to citizens and not to pockets of a few individuals he said during the sixth devolution conference in kirinyaga mr kenyatta said it makes no sense that a county with revenue of sh9 billion to spend sh6 billions on salaries and a paltry sh3 billion on its people nigeria no more forex for textiles garments import cbn the tide textiles and garments imports have joined the forex restriction list of the central bank of nigeria the governor mr godwin emefiele announced in abuja yesterday emefiele made the announcement during a meeting with textile industry stakeholders and added that the policy would take effect immediately nigeria spends an estimated 4billion on imported textiles yearly emefiele said that the restriction would rejuvenate the textile industry in nigeria and ensure that the needed growth was actualised george wachira who will be first to export oil kenya or uganda business daily my assessment is that in terms of alignment of various participating parties legal institutional capacity development and status of project design studies uganda is definitely way ahead of kenya the only hitch which was encountered recently is a serious disagreement on commercial terms tariffs in respect of the uganda tanzania pipeline between the investors and the two governments uganda joins lobby to enhance transparency in oil deals uganda has joined the extractive industries transparency initiative in order to subject its oil industry to scrutiny and promote accountable management of revenues after years of prodding by legislators civil society groups international and donor agencies uganda has signed up to eiti to dispel concerns of secrecy in the management of anticipated petrodollars uganda s minister for finance matia kasaija said joining eiti will strengthen the government s efforts of ensuring overall transparency in the sector strengthen tax collection improve the investment climate build trust and create a lasting value of petroleum resources uganda s decision to join eiti now shifts the focus to kenya which has refused to join the initiative despite promises dating back to 2012 president uhuru kenyatta has even promised to make public agreements and contracts signed between the government and oil companies like tullow oil but this has never materialised
lordstown ohio cnn business when felice robinson was hired at general motors lordstown plant in 1995 she thought the rest of her life was taken care of robinson who was then in her mid 20s had been bouncing around a series of low paid retail jobs when she learned the giant factory down the road was hiring the assembly line position came with generous health care benefits an hourly wage more than twice what she had been making at a menswear store and the promise of a secure retirement if she could hold on to the job for 30 years it was a whole different world robinson who s now 50 told cnn business in late february i couldn t believe how lucky i was to be making that kind of money without a college degree that world has been evaporating for decades now on wednesday when the lordstown plant will make its last chevy cruze and close its doors it will get even smaller felice robinson stands in her home in warren ohio after getting off of the night shift at work at the lordstown gm plant maddie mcgarvey for cnn for gm the move is part of an overall strategy to shift away from sedans and toward higher margin trucks and light suvs in an era of low gas prices gm is also pouring money into electric and autonomous cars which are still primarily in the research and development phase and with gm s investment in a ridesharing platform called maven the company is looking forward to a future in which fewer people own vehicles at all for workers the transition means uncertainty dislocation and immersion in a labor market with far fewer opportunities for those without training beyond a high school degree as recently as the early 2000s a job in an auto plant could be a launchpad to the middle class but those jobs are increasingly rare during the lordstown plant s heyday in the 1970s gm was one of the biggest private sector employers in the united states with more than 618 000 employees that number is now down to about 103 000 and the jobs that remain are not all what they once were since 1990 wages for us auto workers have declined 18 adjusted for inflation retirement benefits have declined as well as of 2017 only 8 of factories offered pensions those trends are especially pronounced in the youngstown ohio region an area about halfway between cleveland and pittsburgh in which lordstown sits thirty years ago about 1 out of 4 local workers were employed by the manufacturing industry now less than half that many are since the beginning of the great recession real hourly earnings have dropped by 8 in the area while rising 11 in the rest of the country flags lined up outside of the lordstown gm plant maddie mcgarvey for cnn all that has made gm jobs stick out full time production workers make between 61 000 and 88 000 a year after only a couple years on the job according to their united auto workers union contract not including additional overtime pay and bonuses that s well above the average wage in the youngstown area which was around 38 000 in 2017 unlike during the great recession gm is cutting these jobs along with about 1 400 more hourly positions at us plants elsewhere at a time when it s profitable and the national economy is strong that s an indication that gm sees its future as one with fewer factory floor workers not more of them and for the youngstown area losing the last major supplier of the type of jobs that made it a manufacturing powerhouse decades ago is a particularly symbolic blow about 400 of the 1 400 people who ll no longer go to work at gm s sprawling lordstown complex after this week have accepted transfers to other plants and will keep their healthcare and pensions other former workers at the plant which used to run 24 hours a day were not as fortunate as demand for the cruze weakened over the past two years its second and third shifts were cut and 3 000 people were laid off many of them won t be offered the same transfer opportunities this latest group will gm says that 350 lordstown workers are eligible for retirement those who transfer will get 30 000 in relocation assistance and that it s working to find new employment for anyone who wants it we understand that the decision that was made is very difficult for this community because it impacts people and families gm spokesman daniel flores told cnn business unfortunately customers are not buying the product at a volume that would justify continued production in the end we made this decision at a point in time where we have the ability to offer opportunities to people who want to keep working for gm robinson thinks she probably has enough seniority to get a placement at one of gm s other facilities like the metal fabrication plant in cleveland or the transmission factory in toledo she dreads transferring she ll have to leave her 68 year old aunt who needs support as well as the rest of her family and friends and the town she s always called home but she has little choice despite the strongest us labor market in a generation the economy is not generating the types of jobs that gm offered her as a young woman at least not in youngstown they have me by a chokehold there s nothing i can do robinson said i make 32 an hour i m not going to go get a 12 an hour job i couldn t survive on that at all i m going to get up and go ride it out try to get the best gig i can get and be done with them the good old days the loss of general motors won t be the first time the youngstown area took a shock to the heart it s been reeling ever since the sudden collapse of the local steel industry in the late 1970s when competition from cheap imports and the failure of american steel mills to compete led to the disappearance of nearly 50 000 jobs over five years the first woman member of the uaw local 1112 works on the vega production line in 1970 walter p reuther library through that time the auto industry became something of a lifeline the lordstown plant which opened in 1966 hired thousands of workers and thousands more worked in smaller independent machine shops that supplied auto parts to gm the gm plant floated the local government providing some 2 million a year in tax revenue said terry armstrong superintendent of the lordstown school district the lordstown school campus with its spacious lecture halls and a planetarium was built without debt the unionized jobs paid far above market topping out in the 30 an hour range for reasonably humane tasks like installing seatbelt harnesses securing engine brakes or driving forklifts former gm worker tom albright who retired in 2015 remembers being able to do his work faster than the rest of the line and then relax it s just not the same company that i used to work for it s so much more cutthroat and it s meaner i know that the old gm is gone felice robinson a gm employee for 24 years i could get ahead of the job for three hours and at that point i could go goof off for three hours said albright whose son still works in the plant those were the good old days it ain t like that anymore they get every nickel that they can out of that individual working that job on the floor but then cracks started to show in the us auto industry starting with competition from japanese automakers in the 1980s and continuing with nafta in 1994 employment slid as work was outsourced to lower paying suppliers including plants in mexico the lordstown plant wasn t immune to the changes that have been affecting the workforce more broadly in 2007 as the automakers were bleeding cash the union accepted the creation of a lower wage tier for entry level workers meaning that they made 45 less per hour and got a 401 k plan instead of a guaranteed pension after gm s bankruptcy in 2009 workers told cnn business the job became harder with management pressing for less downtime slowly but surely they became less and less thoughtful about the people who worked for them said robinson it s just not the same company that i used to work for it s so much more cutthroat and it s meaner i know that the old gm is gone but many in the community still recognize that those jobs feed families donate to local charities and buy cars they also generate other jobs since manufacturing brings in capital from outside the area rather than just recirculating it each factory position is estimated to get three or four more people working in fields like healthcare food service retail and education that s why last fall the united auto workers local 1112 and the region s chamber of commerce started the drive it home campaign a community effort to post signs send letters and work with politicians to convince gm to build another product at the lordstown plant it was meant to mimic another push two decades ago when lordstown was in competition with other cities to win another car model to replace the chevy cavalier that one worked with the help of officials at the plant who joined the effort letters from elementary school kids hang inside the uaw local 1112 hall in warren ohio maddie mcgarvey for cnn the one difference is that this time plant management was not interested in participating said james dignan president of the youngstown warren regional chamber the plant management used to be very engaged locally but they re losing some of that tie and that feel from the company to the community dignan said they re working to get another user for the plant if gm decides to give it up permanently but to the local union workers getting another gm product is far preferable to getting another company these are their jobs and they ll likely still have more protections and higher wages than any other employer we don t want elon musk coming in we don t want amazon building a distribution center said david green who s been president of uaw local 1112 since last may he led another local within the plant in 2007 when the company asked to pay new workers lower wages for 24 years i ve done nothing for this company and this union but bend over this is all i ve ever done i never thought it would come to this tammy vennitti a gm worker who was laid off in 2018 i supported that because the promise was product and job security green said do what we had to do to keep working keep our communities and our families alive and thriving it feels like they betrayed us a little bit the lordstown school district set up a community pantry to distribute food clothes and supplies to families affected by the gm layoffs maddie mcgarvey for cnn so far the company hasn t shown its cards and the uncertainty is what gets to people why take a transfer if it seems likely that lordstown will get a new car within the next year and you could come back for that matter what new employer would take a chance on someone who would bail as soon as lordstown re opened plenty of people remember how gm re opened its plant in spring hill tennessee in 2011 after having shuttered it two years earlier that s why for those who have the option the choice of whether to go or stay is so agonizing even though the job had its fair share of hardships tammy vennitti 55 was laid off with the second shift back in june last year she had signed up for a training course in order to keep her supplemental unemployment benefits and then put those plans on hold in january when gm called back those who d been laid off to fill in for the people who were being moved out to other plants vennitti applied for a transfer to a plant in toledo and she doesn t know if she ll get it or whether she d take it if she did given that she lives with her 27 year old daughter and 18 month old granddaughter but she needs the healthcare benefits to pay for the blood pressure pills her doctor put her on during the stress of being laid off for months not to mention care for a body that took a beating over 24 years of lifting 30 to 40 pounds 400 times a day gm s gold plated insurance paid for a shoulder replacement carpal tunnel surgery and cortizone shots for a knee that had no more cartilage to cushion her bones for 24 years i ve done nothing for this company and this union but bend over vennitti said this is all i ve ever done i never thought it would come to this tammy vennitti sits in her friend s home in newton falls ohio she was laid off and takes medicine to help with the stress of losing her job maddie mcgarvey for cnn the jobs of the future what s next for employment in youngstown the local chamber of commerce said there are 13 000 job openings in the area team neo an economic development non profit focused on northeast ohio said there will be strong demand in the coming years for workers in information technology healthcare and manufacturing but unlike the manufacturing jobs of the past which usually did not require education beyond high school 65 of those jobs will require a post secondary credential by 2021 the group estimates there are plenty of training opportunities since gm workers get assistance both from the state and the us department of commerce through trade adjustment assistance so far there s been strong interest in truck driving certificates an ohio state official said since those take only a few weeks to get and pay relatively well some workers saw the end coming early and took steps to prepare trish amato 43 was hired too late to get a traditional pension lessening the need to hang on to a gm job she used gm s tuition benefits to finish her bachelor s degree and get a master s degree in special education when she was laid off in 2018 amato thought about going to the plant at spring hill tennessee but she and her partner whose truck driving job also depends on lordstown being open didn t think they could afford the rent in the booming area south of nashville trish amato a laid off gm worker herself works at the uaw s transition center helping people access benefits and training opportunities maddie mcgarvey for cnn so instead they re thinking of trading in his big rig for a motorhome and traveling the country while she teaches online courses from the road a future that wouldn t have been possible without gm s help in going to school and that she wouldn t have embraced without gm shuttering the lordstown plant gm is hard to walk away from because the insurance benefits are awesome amato said gm gave us a good life am i disappointed in what they re doing for other people yes for me no if something like this didn t happen i wouldn t be able to follow a dream for the next generation the question is what kind of wages the new working class jobs will pay we don t want elon musk coming in we don t want amazon building a distribution center dave green uaw local 1112 president the local high school has started a training program for the logistics industry helping prepare kids for jobs in the many distribution centers that are popping up in the area that s our way of giving kids a little bit of a leg up said armstrong superintendent of the lordstown school district where about 15 of students have parents who worked in the plant but he said i don t see them paying what the gm jobs paid tj maxx for example is building a facility that will employ 1 000 people in the area job listings for entry level warehouse workers at its other locations range between 10 and 13 50 an hour terry armstrong is the superintendent of the lordstown school district which has already been losing students as parents have moved out of town to keep their jobs with gm maddie mcgarvey for cnn the gm plant had also been a regular stop for politicians on the stump from john mccain to barack obama giving kids a sense that their town mattered on tuesday the school held a group photo to support the drive it home campaign students and staff alike wore blue and brought their gm cars but after this latest blow will lordstown students have confidence in a future in manufacturing it would be really hard to convince many of them of that right now with the plant closing armstrong said they re able to make the cars of the future we just have to make that chance available

decades ago when lordstown was in competition with other cities to win another car model to replace the chevy cavalier that one worked with the help of officials at the plant who joined the effort the one difference is that this time plant management was not interested in participating said james dignan president of the youngstown warren regional chamber the plant management used to be very engaged locally but they re losing some of that tie and that feel from the company to the community dignan said they re working to get another user for the plant if gm decides to give it up permanently but to the local union workers getting another gm product is far preferable to getting another company these are their jobs and they ll likely still have more protections and higher wages than any other employer we don t want elon musk coming in we don t want amazon building a distribution center said david green who s been president of uaw local 1112 since last may he led another local within the plant in 2007 when the company asked to pay new workers lower wages i supported that because the promise was product and job security green said do what we had to do to keep working keep our communities and our families alive and thriving it feels like they betrayed us a little bit so far the company hasn t shown its cards and the uncertainty is what gets to people why take a transfer if it seems likely that lordstown will get a new car within the next year and you could come back for that matter what new employer would take a chance on someone who would bail as soon as lordstown re opened plenty of people remember how gm re opened its plant in spring hill tennessee in 2011 after having shuttered it two years earlier that s why for those who have the option the choice of whether to go or stay is so agonizing even though the job had its fair share of hardships tammy vennitti 55 was laid off with the second shift back in june last year she had signed up for a training course in order to keep her supplemental unemployment benefits and then put those plans on hold in january when gm called back those who d been laid off to fill in for the people who were being moved out to other plants vennitti applied for a transfer to a plant in toledo and she doesn t know if she ll get it or whether she d take it if she did given that she lives with her 27 year old daughter and 18 month old granddaughter but she needs the healthcare benefits to pay for the blood pressure pills her doctor put her on during the stress of being laid off for months not to mention care for a body that took a beating over 24 years of lifting 30 to 40 pounds 400 times a day gm s gold plated insurance paid for a shoulder replacement carpal tunnel surgery and cortizone shots for a knee that had no more cartilage to cushion her bones for 24 years i ve done nothing for this company and this union but bend over vennitti said this is all i ve ever done i never thought it would come to this the jobs of the future what s next for employment in youngstown the local chamber of commerce said there are 13 000 job openings in the area team neo an economic development non profit focused on northeast ohio said there will be strong demand in the coming years for workers in information technology healthcare and manufacturing but unlike the manufacturing jobs of the past which usually did not require education beyond high school 65 of those jobs will require a post secondary credential by 2021 the group estimates there are plenty of training opportunities since gm workers get assistance both from the state and the us department of commerce through trade adjustment assistance so far there s been strong interest in truck driving certificates an ohio state official said since those take only a few weeks to get and pay relatively well some workers saw the end coming early and took steps to prepare trish amato 43 was hired too late to get a traditional pension lessening the need to hang on to a gm job she used gm s tuition benefits to finish her bachelor s degree and get a master s degree in special education when she was laid off in 2018 amato thought about going to the plant at spring hill tennessee but she and her partner whose truck driving job also depends on lordstown being open didn t think they could afford the rent in the booming area south of nashville so instead they re thinking of trading in his big rig for a motorhome and traveling the country while she teaches online courses from the road a future that wouldn t have been possible without gm s help in going to school and that she wouldn t have embraced without gm shuttering the lordstown plant gm is hard to walk away from because the insurance benefits are awesome amato said gm gave us a good life am i disappointed in what they re doing for other people yes for me no if something like this didn t happen i wouldn t be able to follow a dream for the next generation the question is what kind of wages the new working class jobs will pay the local high school has started a training program for the logistics industry helping prepare kids for jobs in the many distribution centers that are popping up in the area that s our way of giving kids a little bit of a leg up said armstrong superintendent of the lordstown school district where about 15 of students have parents who worked in the plant but he said i don t see them paying what the gm jobs paid tj maxx for example is building a facility that will employ 1 000 people in the area job listings for entry level warehouse workers at its other locations range between 10 and 13 50 an hour the gm plant had also been a regular stop for politicians on the stump from john mccain to barack obama giving kids a sense that their town mattered on tuesday the school held a group photo to support the drive it home campaign students and staff alike wore blue and brought their gm cars but after this latest blow will lordstown students have confidence in a future in manufacturing it would be really hard to convince many of them of that right now with the plant closing armstrong said they re able to make the cars of the future we just have to make that chance available

lucia mutikani washington reuters the u s goods trade deficit surged to a record high in 2018 as strong domestic demand fueled by lower taxes pulled in imports despite the trump administration s america first policies including tariffs aimed at shrinking the trade gap president donald trump is pursuing a protectionist trade agenda to shield u s manufacturing from what he says is unfair foreign competition trump who has dubbed himself the tariff man pledged on both the campaign trail and as president to reduce the deficit by shutting out more unfairly traded imports and renegotiating free trade agreements advertisement advertisement the commerce department said on wednesday that a 12 4 percent jump in the goods deficit in december had contributed to the record 891 3 billion goods trade shortfall last year the overall trade deficit surged 12 5 percent to 621 0 billion in 2018 the largest since 2008 the trade deficit exploded last year despite the trump administration efforts to make america great again and the trend is unlikely to get any better in 2019 said chris rupkeychief economist at mufg in new york the white house has argued that reducing the trade deficit would boost annual economic growth to its goal of 3 percent on a sustainable basis the government also sought to stimulate the economy with a 1 5 trillion tax cut package which jolted both consumer and business spending helping to lift imported goods to a record 2 6 trillion in 2018 the united states last year imposed tariffs on 250 billion worth of goods imported from china with beijing hitting back with duties on 110 billion worth of american products including soybeans and other commodities trump has delayed tariffs on 200 billion worth of chinese imports as negotiations to resolve the eight month trade war continue advertisement advertisement businesses likely stocked up on imports in anticipation of further duties on chinese goods which ironically contributed to the deterioration in the trade deficit last year the goods trade deficit with china increased 11 6 percent to an all time high of 419 2 billion in 2018 the united states which also slapped duties on imported steel aluminum solar panels and washing machines had record imports from 60 countries in 2018 led by china mexico and germany perhaps donald trump will now discover that tweets and bluster alone won t dramatically shrink the trade deficit said scott paul president of the alliance for american manufacturing in washington the administration s fiscal policies have helped to boost the trade deficit while goods exports hit a record 1 7 trillion in 2018 they declined in the last three months of the year weighed by the u s china trade dispute slowing global demand and a strong dollar which is making american made goods less competitive on the international market advertisement advertisement the dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies while u s treasury prices rose stocks on wall street were trading lower as investors awaited fresh developments on the trade negotiations labor market slowing economists expect exports to remain weak even if washington and beijing strike a trade deal that will take time and if the chinese growth is as soft as most economists believe it is hard to see how they can ramp up demand for u s products very much this year said joel naroff chief economist at naroff economic advisors in holland pennsylvania a 1 9 percent drop in exports of goods and services drove the trade deficit in december to 59 8 billion the largest since october 2008 imports of goods and services increased 2 1 percent to 264 9 billion in december advertisement advertisement when adjusted for inflation the goods trade deficit surged 10 0 billion to a record 91 6 billion in december the jump in the so called real goods trade deficit suggests that the drag from trade on fourth quarter gross domestic product growth was probably bigger than the 0 22 percentage point estimated by the government last week economists expect the government will revise down fourth quarter gdp growth to a 2 3 percent annualized rate from the 2 6 percent it reported last thursday other data on wednesday suggested some slowing in the labor market though the pace of job gains remains more than enough to drive the unemployment rate down the adp national employment report showed private payrolls increased by 183 000 in february after surging 300 000 in january economists polled by reuters had forecast private payrolls advancing 189 000 in february the adp report which is jointly developed with moody s analytics was published ahead of the government s more comprehensive employment report for february scheduled for release on friday advertisement advertisement the adp report is not considered a reliable predictor of the private payrolls portion of the government s employment report because of differences in methodology february s report was however in line with other labor market data including weekly applications for unemployment benefits and manufacturing and services sector surveys that have suggested some moderation in job growth following hefty gains in january it looks broadly consistent with our view that job growth remained solid in february despite cooling from the boomy figures reported for the prior several months said daniel silver an economist at jpmorgan in new york according to a reuters survey of economists nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 180 000 jobs in february after jumping 304 000 in january the unemployment rate is forecast falling to 3 9 percent in february from 4 0 percent in january reporting by lucia mutikani editing by andrea ricci

toronto march 6 2019 cnw brookfield real estate services inc dba bridgemarq real estate services bridgemarq or the company tsx bre a leading provider of services to residential real estate brokers and their realtors 1 today announced its 2018 annual financial results and the approval of a monthly dividend to holders of the company s restricted voting shares highlights the company generated net

per share in 2017 the company s network of realtors the network increased to 19 220 on january 3 2019 up 6 0 from 18 135 at december 31 2017 up 6 0 from 18 135 at the board of directors of the company approved a dividend to shareholders of 0 1125 per restricted voting share payable april 30 2019 to shareholders of record march 29 2019 representing a target annual dividend of 1 35 per restricted voting share consistent with 2018 operating results royalty revenues for the year ended december 31 2018 were 42 0 million compared to 44 2 million in 2017 the decrease in royalty revenues was primarily as a result of a decrease in the premium franchise fees due to the expiry of those agreements during the year for the fourth quarter royalty revenues amounted to 8 9 million down from 9 5 million in 2017 due to lower premium fees partly offset by increases in variable and fixed fees net earnings in 2018 were 17 4 million or 1 30 per share as compared to 12 4 million or 1 31 per share in 2017 the higher net earnings were due in part to a gain of 6 5 million on the determination of the fair value of the exchangeable units issued by the company diluted earnings per share were unchanged despite the higher earnings as a result of the dilutive impact of that gain for the year ended december 31 2018 cffo was 30 5 million or 2 38 per share as compared to 2 55 per share in 2017 the decrease in cffo was mainly driven by the decrease in premium fees and higher administrative expenses due to one time costs associated with the review and negotiation of amendments to the management services agreement for the fourth quarter of 2018 cffo was 6 2 million or 0 48 per share compared to 7 0 million or 0 55 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017 reflective of the lower

both in absolute and per capita terms nigeria s gdp has been in sharp decline for the best part of four years and in the past year it has again fallen behind south africa as the continent s largest economy only now is it beginning to pull out of this long recession meanwhile its currency the nigerian naira has suffered a catastrophic collapse devaluing by nearly 70pc against the us dollar over the past 10 years it is with good reason that some pundits call nigeria the next venezuela in the making this might seem an unduly harsh verdict but the similarities between the two are striking nigeria is a relatively oil rich economy with a newly re elected left wing populist muhammadu buhari at its helm whose chief of staff is an avowed admirer of jeremy corbyn himself a devotee of venezuela s late hugo chavez both economies nigeria and venezuela have recklessly alienated international capital and utterly failed to harness their oil wealth even ghana less than a seventh the size of nigeria in terms of gdp receives more foreign direct investment these days than its near neighbour global investors and companies have lost faith in the country and are leaving in droves so too has its middle class nigeria is estimated to have lost about a tenth of its wealthier citizens to emigration in recent years its brightest and best have been voting with the feet in ruinous numbers doctors nurses engineers accountants entrepreneurs lawyers and so on success and wealth are routinely demonised by the buhari regime the grubby process of populist vote buying has triumphed over sound economics and pragmatic policy nigeria s newly re elected president muhammadu buhari during his campaign he glorified poverty and vilified success according to the nigerian political blogger david hundeyin buhari s recent election campaign was characterised not by any serious acknowledgement of nigeria s extreme investment deficit in education healthcare power generation and transport infrastructure but by attacks on the usual populist scapegoats corrupt people treasury looters and arrogant elites poverty was glorified success was vilified what has all this got to do with the west nigeria may be a country of nearly 200m but at less than 1pc of global gdp it is neither here nor there like venezuela it might be a cautionary tale in the politics of left wing populism yet its wider significance seems at most marginal well perhaps but the fact is that even as western populations age and decline nigeria s like much of the rest of africa is on an explosive growth path on the present trajectory nigeria s population is expected to more than double over the next 30 years reaching a scarcely credible 750m by 2100 according to projections by the census bureau of the united states that s plainly not going to be sustainable and therefore quite unlikely to occur in practice but even if only half right it creates in the absence of extremely rapid per capita economic growth myriad problems for the west the challenge of mass migration from sub saharan africa we see today threatens to turn into an exodus of positively biblical proportions however vigorous conventional border controls would struggle to prevent it it is therefore very much in the west s interests that africa follows asia into rapid economic advancement but here s the paradox experience suggests that migration from the developing world peaks when national income reaches the 6 000 to 7 000 per capita range much below that and only the middle classes and the enterprising have the wherewithal to make the break once income reaches that level however it provides the means for mass migration as things stand nigerian gdp per head is only 2 450 it could therefore be argued that the west perversely has an incentive to keep africa in relative poverty with an anti business politician such as buhari in charge we perhaps don t have to worry too much about an african invasion we can cynically take our pick of its most educated while leaving the rest to cope as best they can building on analysis by the american economist mary jean bowman charles robertson chief economist at renaissance capital has developed a neat little system for determining whether a country is capable of the sort of industrialisation necessary to achieve middle income status or better bowman established that one prerequisite was a minimum literacy rate of 70pc india achieved that level in 2015 some 20 years after china nigeria is still some way off riven by ethnic and religious division it is struggling to make progress robertson adds another two pre conditions that a country needs a minimum investment rate of 25pc of gdp and that electricity consumption must reach an average of 300 kilowatt hours per person enough to power a tv and three low energy lightbulbs again nigeria is well short of these thresholds particularly on investment which is only half that level robertson is more optimistic than most about nigeria s prospects of eventually getting there he also points out that buhari s government is not the totally unreconstructed hard left populist cabinet it might seem it contains some notable reformers whose anti corruption crusade can only be applauded even so nigeria for now remains an economy linked inextricably to the fortunes of the oil price and like russia apparently incapable of decent levels of growth when the price is low for nigeria abundant oil has proved as much a curse as a blessing again the problem is population production per capita is too low to make a material difference to average incomes but just high enough to remove the incentives for other sources of income growth the next venezuela it s all too possible the definition of an emerging market according to the old investment joke is one from which it is impossible to emerge with your money intact few seem to prove this truism better than what was once africa s largest economy nigeria indeed if the dictionary definition of an emerging market is that of an economy with low income but high growth prospects nigeria fails the test it is most certainly low income but in recent years it has also been low growth both in absolute and per capita terms nigeria s gdp has been in sharp decline for the best part of four years and in the past year it has again fallen behind south africa as the continent s largest economy only now is it beginning to pull out of this long recession meanwhile its currency the nigerian naira has suffered a catastrophic collapse devaluing by nearly 70pc against the us dollar over the past 10 years it is with good reason that some pundits call nigeria the next venezuela in the making this might seem an unduly harsh verdict but the similarities between the two are striking nigeria is a relatively oil rich economy with a newly re elected left wing populist muhammadu buhari at its helm whose chief of staff is an avowed admirer of jeremy corbyn himself a devotee of venezuela s late hugo chavez both economies nigeria and venezuela have recklessly alienated international capital and utterly failed to harness their oil wealth even ghana less than a seventh the size of nigeria in terms of gdp receives more foreign direct investment these days than its near neighbour global investors and companies have lost faith in the country and are leaving in droves so too has its middle class nigeria is estimated to have lost about a tenth of its wealthier citizens to emigration in recent years its brightest and best have been voting with the feet in ruinous numbers doctors nurses engineers accountants entrepreneurs lawyers and so on success and wealth are routinely demonised by the buhari regime the grubby process of populist vote buying has triumphed over sound economics and pragmatic policy nigeria s newly re elected president muhammadu buhari during his campaign he glorified poverty and vilified successaccording to the nigerian political blogger david hundeyin buhari s recent election campaign was characterised not by any serious acknowledgement of nigeria s extreme investment deficit in education healthcare power generation and transport infrastructure but by attacks on the usual populist scapegoats corrupt people treasury looters and arrogant elites poverty was glorified success was vilified what has all this got to do with the west nigeria may be a country of nearly 200m but at less than 1pc of global gdp it is neither here nor there like venezuela it might be a cautionary tale in the politics of left wing populism yet its wider significance seems at most marginal well perhaps but the fact is that even as western populations age and decline nigeria s like much of the rest of africa is on an explosive growth path on the present trajectory nigeria s population is expected to more than double over the next 30 years reaching a scarcely credible 750m by 2100 according to projections by the census bureau of the united states that s plainly not going to be sustainable and therefore quite unlikely to occur in practice but even if only half right it creates in the absence of extremely rapid per capita economic growth myriad problems for the west the challenge of mass migration from sub saharan africa we see today threatens to turn into an exodus of positively biblical proportions however vigorous conventional border controls would struggle to prevent it it is therefore very much in the west s interests that africa follows asia into rapid economic advancement but here s the paradox experience suggests that migration from the developing world peaks when national income reaches the 6 000 to 7 000 per capita range much below that and only the middle classes and the enterprising have the wherewithal to make the break once income reaches that level however it provides the means for mass migration as things stand nigerian gdp per head is only 2 450 it could therefore be argued that the west perversely has an incentive to keep africa in relative poverty with an anti business politician such as buhari in charge we perhaps don t have to worry too much about an african invasion we can cynically take our pick of its most educated while leaving the rest to cope as best they can building on analysis by the american economist mary jean bowman charles robertson chief economist at renaissance capital has developed a neat little system for determining whether a country is capable of the sort of industrialisation necessary to achieve middle income status or better bowman established that one prerequisite was a minimum literacy rate of 70pc india achieved that level in 2015 some 20 years after china nigeria is still some way off riven by ethnic and religious division

president donald trump the self proclaimed tariff man is set to become the us100 billion man if the trends of the past year and economists expectations hold true trade data to be released on wednesday will show the us s deficit in goods and services with the world topped us600 billion 847 billion in 2018 that means trump s presidency will have seen the us trade shortfall the main metric by which he judges countries to be winning or losing grow by more than us100 billion by his own measure of success tariff man donald trump has failed credit bloomberg put another way by trump s own benchmark the us is 20 per cent worse off than it was at the end of 2016 just before he took office
two points about today s political economy and then a prediction involving illinois point one what s coming is poetic justice for the aristocracy the wave of populism socialism proto fascism that s sweeping the us and europe is a direct result of the breathtaking hubris of a ruling class that didn t know when to quit stealing while it is possible for societies dominated by a small group of rich connected people to endure and even thrive they can do so only if the 99 enjoys a rising standard of living and a certain amount of upward mobility in other words people will accept the existence of an entrenched elite as long as everyone else does a little better each year today that s not the case the current crop of aristocrats google davos world economic forum images for faces to go with the concept are now simply harvesting the wealth of their subjects without much thought for their own vulnerability for an easy to grasp example of how this works look at interest rates over the past couple of decades the world s central banks have been pushing rates lower in each cycle impoverishing small savers and retirees who depend on income from bonds and bank accounts while enriching the already rich by raising the prices of stocks and real estate the following two charts from charles hugh smith s recent who killed the middle class illustrate the widening gap between the pay and assets of the haves and the used to haves to put this in economist speak capital is gobbling up labor so the coming political tsunami is bit of french revolution style poetic justice since most of the resulting policy changes will be aimed either explicitly or accidentally at the 1 point two politics is now just entertainment in america and much of europe the vast majority of voters think they ll be okay if their side wins the next election and fear hell on earth if the other side wins they re wrong pretty much the same thing is coming either way in today s us for instance the small government republicans are in charge and running trillion dollar deficits to cover endless wars and massive corporate tax cuts while fretting correctly that if the democrats win they ll implement vast new social programs without considering how to pay for them see the problem whoever is in charge will borrow us which is to say the dollar into oblivion the specifics are different but the numbers are devastating either way so the best way to approach the political chaos of the next few years is to treat it as a form of guilty pleasure entertainment a reality show of epic scope and multitudinous cast what you absolutely should not do is fall in love with any current politician or ideology because they ll break your heart along with your bank account a prediction as in the original ghostbusters we re being asked to choose the form of our destruction and our stay puft marshmallow man appears to be something called democratic socialism for an example of what this benign sounding term involves let s visit that state of the art laboratory of fiscal madness illinois before we start please note that illinois and its biggest city chicago are already functionally bankrupt public sector pensions have devoured their host and are now trying to animate the corpse just enough to fool the rating agencies into another year of investment grade bond issuance in other words the state and its cities are toast regardless of what happens next but what happens next is instructive because it s going to happen everywhere else in short order here s an excerpt from a wirepoints s mark glennon article titled radicals positioning to destroy illinois if its fiscal crisis doesn t consider a few of the new left s plans for illinois and how far they have gotten with illinois democrats progressive real estate transfer tax it s best seen as an exit tax on wealthier homeowners fleeing it s supported by both chicago mayoral candidates who won a place in the runoff election toni preckwinkle and lori lightfoot the heavily democratic city of evanston is already implementing it rent control illinois politicians should be setting the rent we re told a bill authorizing rent control is pending in the general assembly and governor pritzker has indicated approval in concept preckwinkle supports rent control lightfoot hasn t indicated her position universal basic income in chicago just give at least 500 to every family in chicago no strings attached mayor rahm emanuel evidently saw enough force behind the idea that he authorized a task force to look into a pilot program it s leading proponent alderman ameya pawar may well become chicago s new treasurer having just won his way into the runoff election its cost to the city if fully implemented would be about 12 6 billion annually chicago s annual budget for fiscal 2018 was 8 6 billion statewide 15 per hour minimum wage governor pritzker made this a top priority and already signed the new law raising the minimum to 15 by 2025 statewide that might seem reasonable around chicago but opposition came largely from lower income communities across the state the rockford park district for example gives hundreds of teenagers and young adults get their first jobs at a lower wage and the new law will open a 2 million per year hole in its budget regarding primary cause pensions the pritzker administration and both chicago mayoral candidates are firm no pension reform not one dime s worth pritzker outlined the rest of his fiscal approach in his recent budget address more borrowing to fund pension debt a can kick delaying the schedule for pension contributions and gifting public assets to pensions illinois new left seems fine with all of that that all this new taxing and spending is occuring in an already flat broke state illustrates a crucial point about revolutions which is that they re focused on crushing the old order i e restoring justice without regard for the cost of implementing the new that s why revolutions are frequently followed by hyperinflations and war and the fact that the main victims will be the 1 is pretty much the only good thing that will come of this one
global stocks were mixed today as traders continued to worry about trade and about us and eu relations today a report by the financial times said that italy was becoming the first eu country to formally endorse china s belt and road initiative the country will formally endorse the project this month when china s xi jinping will visit italy the move has alarmed brussels while us has condemned it the bri is a chinese strategy to provide funding to countries in asia africa and europe for the construction of strategic infrastructure the loans have been criticized by the united states which believes that they impose massive debts on economies for little return the australian dollar declined sharply today after data showed that the economy grew at a slower pace than earlier expected in the fourth quarter the economy expanded by 2 3 which was lower than the expected 2 5 on a qoq basis the economy grew by 0 2 which was lower than the expected 0 5 the slowdown in the economy is attributed to a number of factors like the sluggish growth in the chinese economy the ongoing drought and low capital spending by companies slow economic growth has turned out to be the new normal yesterday china announced that it was lowering the economic forecast for the year last month imf boe rba and ecb all lowered the forecast for the year today the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd cut the global growth and forecasted that things could turn worse this was the second time the organization was lowering the guidance since the last quarter of 2018 however there are signs that the economy is stabilizing the global pmi increased in february which was the first increase in three months talks between us and china are also at an advanced level in the united states adp released the non farm payrolls for february the numbers showed that the economy added more than 183k jobs in the month this was slightly lower than the 189k that traders were expecting this number was released two days before the bls is expected to release official numbers in the past these numbers have differed by a large margin on trade the trade deficit increased to 59 8 billion in february this was caused by an increase in imports and a decrease in exports imports increased to 264 billion while exports decreased to 205 billion this is a blow to trump who has placed tariffs with the goal of narrowing the deficit the canadian dollar declined against the us dollar ahead of the bank of canada boc statement later today the central bank is expected to leave rates unchanged at 1 75 as the country prepares for an election this year before the decision is released the country released trade data that missed the consensus estimates in december exports reduced from c 48 2 billion to c 46 8 billion while imports increased slightly from c 50 1 billion to c 50 90 billion usd cad the usd cad pair continued to gain today as traders waited for the decision by the boc the pair reached a high of 1 3390 which is the highest level since the first week of january the pair has been gaining since the beginning of this month on the hourly chart the pair s price is currently above the 21 day and 42 day emas while the rsi rose sharply to the overbought level of 74 while the pair could continue moving up there is a likelihood that the pair will fall after the boc decision if it does it will fall to the 38 2 fibonacci retracement level of 1 3290 eur usd the eur usd pair was searching for direction after weak trade numbers from the us and ahead of tomorrow s ecb interest rates decision the pair touched an intraday low of 1 1285 and then moved back to the day s open on the chart below the pair has been consolidating as evidenced by the narrow bollinger bands the rsi has moved slightly up to the current level of 50 the pair will likely remain along these levels ahead of the ecb s decision aud usd the australian dollar declined sharply against the usd after weak economic data the pair reached a low of 0 7020 which is the lowest level since the first week of january this price has broken past the important support of 0 7050 on the four hour chart below the price is also below the 21 day and 42 day emas and is slightly below the 61 8 fibonacci retracement level there is a likelihood that the pair will continue moving lower to the 0 7000 level which is also the 50 fibonacci level
for years president trump has been obsessed with trade deficits incorrectly viewing them as a good measure of which countries are winning and which are losing the united states has run a trade deficit for decades thereby designating us a perennial loser in trump s worldview he promised to turn things around by picking a few easy to win trade wars instead by trump s own measure we re bigger losers than ever before the trade deficit just jumped to its largest size in a decade even worse our deficit in goods which trump for some reason emphasizes most just hit its largest level ever there are a few takeaways from this news including that trade was probably a bigger drag on growth last year than previously forecast the new release plus some other disappointing data reports from the past few days suggests gross domestic product growth last quarter may get revised down from the initial estimate of a 2 6 percent annual rate worried about a continued drag from trade some economists are also revising downward their forecasts for economic growth for the first quarter of 2019 macroeconomic advisers for instance just lowered its q1 forecast to 1 2 percent annualized advertisement but the bigger question is this why exactly is the trade deficit expanding when trump promised it would shrink the answer largely though not exclusively has to do with trump s own economic policies follow this author catherine rampell s opinions follow to be clear trade deficits whether bilateral or otherwise are not necessarily bad nor are they a sign that we re being somehow cheated by other countries they reflect broader trends in the economy including savings and investment rates small or shrinking trade deficits are also not necessarily a measure of a healthy economy in fact as bloomberg news s shawn donnan points out the year the u s trade deficit shrank the most was 2009 which was not exactly a blockbuster year for the economy we were at the tail end of the great recession then and because the economy was bad americans bought less stuff from abroad advertisement today the u s economy is healthy with economic growth relatively robust this is partly because of the fiscal stimulus trump has been pumping into the economy through both his tax cuts and federal spending hikes consumers have more money to spend which means they demand more stuff and companies have ramped up their imports to satisfy that demand simultaneously other countries including china and members of the european union have not been doing so hot with the u s economy doing well while other economies are faltering and the federal reserve raising rates the dollar has strengthened making foreign products look cheaper and making our exports more expensive i e less competitive in other countries that too leads to higher trade deficits and it s one of many reasons team trump might want to cool it with the schadenfreude about other countries economic woes so in some ways then trump s preferred metric of winning is a victim of his own fiscally driven economic success but it s also a victim of his trade policy failures advertisement he has picked trade wars the world over with friends and foes alike he has also threatened even more tariffs including an additional hike in tariffs on chinese goods a new national security driven duty on auto imports etc these actions and threats have led to some predictable consequences one is that u s companies have stocked up on some imported goods to beat the tariffs which increases imports in the short run higher imports bigger trade deficit another is that other countries have levied their own retaliatory tariffs on our own products most famously red state goods such as soybeans and bourbon so there has been less demand for u s exports lower exports also bigger trade deficit trump has pledged that once his brilliantly negotiated deals go through the new north american free trade agreement gets ratified by congress china fully capitulates to all his wildest demands the european union and japan suddenly decide to buy more of our cars etc our balance of trade will turn around there s reason to be skeptical however and not only because some of these objectives seem like fantasies advertisement even the ones that look more plausible such as the implementation of the new nafta seem unlikely to move the needle after all the new nafta looks an awful lot like the old nafta plus some language cribbed from the pacific trade pact trump pulled us out of in fact the most significant change in the new nafta deal involves new content rules for autos which are intended to lead to more manufacturing and manufacturing jobs in the united states but as trade experts have pointed out these new rules may be so costly to comply with that they could have the opposite of their intended effect leading manufacturers to source less rather than more content from north america which could mean a boost to auto and auto parts imports which would contribute to you guessed it a wider trade deficit
here s our weekly currencies outlook and review with hifx s senior dealer dan bell which includes a look at the currency wars sweeping the globe and what to expect from the reserve bank of new zealand s rbnz official cash rate ocr review next thursday the rbnz will review the ocr against a backdrop of renewed quantitative easing qe or money printing overseas with its country s economy struggling it was revealed this week japan s trade deficit last year tripled to a record 6 927 trillion about nz 91 billion the central bank is acting the bank of japan has adopted a 2 inflation target compared with its previous goal of 1 inflation it also says it ll continue asset purchases on an open ended basis to further expand monetary stimulus the move pushed the yen down against all major currencies no doubt to cheers from japan s struggling exporters against the new zealand dollar it the yen has depreciated by about 15 since the start of december last year says bell so in two months you ve seen the new zealand dollar go up from the mid 60s to over 75 against the yen and that s the highest we ve been since 2007 08 weakening currencies to bolster exports bell notes that in the current environment of weak global economic growth every country wants a weak currency to this end most developed countries have their interest rates near zero and many including japan the united states eurozone and britain have also been undertaking additional economic stimulus such as qe to try and boost their economies and part of that is also trying to weaken their currencies to make their exporters more competitive says bell everywhere really if you talk about the bank of canada this week talking about the high currency and the impact that s having on their economy norway and sweden were talking about the impact of the currency the bank of england s talking about the currency this week obviously the bank of japan is doing something actually out there printing money and even some of the leading commentators in australia are talking about the high currency and the fact that the reserve bank of australia rba is going to be more likely to cut interest rates this year to help bring the currency lower so it s a big topic at the moment and it s going to be a big issue for new zealand this year bell adds pointing out that on a trade weighted index twi basis the new zealand dollar s still sitting around five year highs with the twi today at 75 5 against the australian dollar we have been trending up we re over the a80 cents mark against the euro we re still sitting around multi decade highs and against the pound sterling close to all time post float highs so it s going to be very interesting to see what the rbnz has to say on thursday says bell just jawboning expected from wheeler but should he do more bell expects a steady as she goes approach from rbnz governor graeme wheeler with no unconventional efforts to weaken the kiwi to be revealed on thursday but some rhetoric about wanting a weaker dollar likely although one way of weakening the new zealand dollar would be cutting the ocr this is also not expected in a situation where global central banks are cutting interest rates still or they are printing money our exporters are feeling the pinch of our high currency says bell and at the end of the day it s going to be a challenge for new zealand to grow in a sustainable way through exports if our currency continues to go up so the challenge for the rbnz next week is despite having a stronger auckland property market and the christchurch rebuild flowing through to house prices and to inflation overall it seems that the new zealand economy still has some major challenges and the currency s going to be one of those challenges this year at the end of the day they the rbnz have got a tough job we don t have the deep pockets to go out there and start intervening we don t have the appetite to do things like the federal reserve or the bank of japan or the european central bank for that matter adds bell in a perfect world the market should determine the value of your currency but the challenge is we ve got these other central banks that are undertaking very interventionalist type policies which has a real impact on trade flows and the real economy so unfortunately it s not a perfect world new zealand is just a small economy that is being exposed to a lot of these other policies that we ve got absolutely no control over the challenge from the rba meanwhile the rba also poses a challenge to its new zealand counterpart this year the australian cash rate is currently 3 but is expected to be cut bell says some analysts are picking it ll be dropped to as low as 2 by year s end so if that was to happen and we remain at 2 5 that has the kiwi aussie cross rate in my opinion up at a85c and that could easily unfold this year a85c is around the 10 year average for the kiwi aussie cross rate and that s going to have a big impact on our export sector because australia is still our largest market says bell so the challenge also is with the rba if they start cutting interest rates i think it s going to be very difficult for us to even talk about raising interest rates anytime in the next 12 or 18 months he says the market has the chances of an australian interest rate cut on february 5 the rba s first cash rate review of the year at about 40 to 50 but looking out further we are seeing the market price in a 100 chance of a rate cut from the rba also see dan bell s five key issues for 2013 here to subscribe to our free

mellon on the markets arabian nights by jim mellon 06 march 2019 5 mins to read there has been quite a recovery in markets since the december lows this has probably been induced by the substantial easing that is happening in monetary policy by five of the six key central banks globally i saw some scary stats showing that in the last three months broad money supply worldwide has been running at 27 this is clearly aberrant and unsustainable if it carried on for any meaningful period of time most of the world would look like venezuela or zimbabwe but it s instructive central banks have been spooked and particularly the ecb and the chinese central bank by indicators of slowing economic performance in their respective countries blocs so where there was tightening there is now hesitancy or renewed pump priming first seen in master investor magazine never miss an issue of master investor magazine sign up now for free read the latest master investor magazine this has immediately fed through to stock markets see the chinese market up sharply for evidence and a general collective sigh of optimism after the dire falls in late 2018 bond yields on a steady downward path have now backed up a bit reflecting the loosened conditions gavekal a really good forecasting outfit is now recommending selling bonds aggressively and i can see why until literally the end of february gold and silver were on a rampage and they will resume that upward trajectory soon commodities have broadly risen and real wages have been on a tear almost everywhere that s a sign of capacity constraints running into excess demand and that in turn means inflation this inflation not yet reflected in the headline figures but lurking menacingly under the surface is occurring at a time when economies are softening with the eurozone in outright recession in some pockets china sputtering and the uk slowing although doing better than the eurozone despite the daily press gloom about brexit japan remains japan always printing money always accumulating government debt and every desperate measure in the playbook being employed to try to kickstart a low growth economy exhibiting seemingly perennial deflationary tendencies the japanese are going to get what they wished for one day in spades and that is a lot of inflation but they are not alone in this inflation should be the top theme of the strategists who write eloquently but without conviction pace victor hill of this parish and steen jacobsen of saxo bank because the inflation genie has been let out and it s coming home to roost that s why i am bullish on gold and silver and it s also why i m bearish on bonds arabian nights but speaking of genies i spent the last week in the gulf and i m going back in a couple of weeks after a quick trip to new york next week i may be accumulating dna damage in spades but just think of the airmiles i did some business in dubai and abu dhabi and then we went to oman for a few days holiday i was gob smacked by the progress of the region since i last spent serious time there most of the time i am transiting in dubai airport and please roll on the new terminal it is incredible to observe what has happened over the last couple of decades yes there is clearly an oversupply of real estate in dubai but that will sort itself out in due course literally everyone i met is forward looking optimistic and smart as well as being well educated dubai has moved on from being a tourist destination for russians and london cab drivers to being a sophisticated enclave on a par with hong kong or singapore with better roads better buildings and a rapidly improving cultural life abu dhabi has the economic heft and it too is showing signs of sophisticated prosperity blossoming all around oman is uniquely beautiful and again amazing roads a great port a wonderful opera house and a spanking new airport in the capital muscat are we asleep in the west with our crumbling infrastructure petty rules and regulations based on oversensitive political correctness or are we just rolling over and letting the countries of the near middle and far east surpass us in every way in just a couple of generations wake up europe you are sleepwalking to self destruction an example i was lucky to meet the minister of artificial intelligence of the uae where is britain s where is germany s enough said rise up put on your gilets jaunes but protest not at the unfairness of life but at the lamentable turgidness of our political institutions look at a photograph of dubai 40 years ago as i did and weep

themes please come and listen at the master investor conference on april 6th in london for my take on these until then i am bullish on sterling against the euro and the dollar brexit is gong to either be half baked or not even go in the oven if we stay in we run some danger with italy whose situation is literally dire i hear from friends all the usual arguments that italy s debt is largely held domestically no longer as true by the way that there is a huge black economy etc but that won t make any difference when the chickens come home and they are signore salvini is in my opinion determined to lead italy out of the eurozone and hang the consequences and as the lyrics of the old song go the revolution won t be broadcast there will be no warning other than missives such as this i think it prudent to keep some powder dry for this forthcoming spectacle it will represent the biggest single financial turmoil since the second world war and the single biggest opportunity for us since the

during his campaign he glorified poverty and vilified success according to the nigerian political blogger david hundeyin buhari s recent election campaign was characterised not by any serious

next 30 years reaching a scarcely credible 750m by 2100 according to projections by the census bureau of the united states that s plainly not going to be sustainable and therefore quite unlikely to

migration as things stand nigerian gdp per head is only 2 450 it could therefore be argued that the west perversely has an incentive to keep africa in relative poverty with an anti business politician

u s rep alexandria ocasio cortez d ny and sen ed markey d mass are calling for a green new deal pdf that would involve massive government spending to shift the u s economy away from its reliance on carbon their congressional resolution goes into great detail about the harms of climate change and what the u s government should do about it left unanswered however is how america would pay for it some commentators have been calling a green new deal unaffordable with some estimates putting the bill for complete decarbonization at as high as 12 3 trillion as the author of the united nations environment program s global green new deal a plan to lift the world economy out of the 2008 2009 great recession i disagree i believe there are two straightforward ways to cover the cost and help accelerate the green revolution while lowering the overall price tag what a green new deal may cost before we talk about how to pay for it first we need a rough idea of how much it might actually cost for starters it s important to be realistic rather than putting a price tag on going 100 percent renewable which would take decades i believe we should figure out how much to spend over the next five years to build a greener economy ambitious efforts to foster green energy during the great recession are a good place to start in total the world s largest 20 economies and a few others spent 3 3 trillion to stimulate economic growth of that more than 520 billion was devoted to green investments automatic download such as pollution cleanup recycling and low carbon energy the u s share of that was about 120 billion or about 1 percent of its gross domestic product around half of this went toward energy conservation and other short term energy efficiency investments to quickly shore up the then nascent recovery and generate employment the stimulus may have spurred some growth in renewable energy but didn t do much on its own to reduce carbon emissions permanently another country that made fairly big green investments during the great recession was south korea which promoted low carbon green growth as its new long term development vision it allocated 60 billion or 5 percent of its 2007 gdp to a five year plan but in the end south korea may have spent only 26 billion on low carbon energy and failed to adopt pricing reforms and other incentives to foster renewables such as phasing out fossil fuel subsidies pricing carbon and improving regulatory frameworks the result was only a modest improvement in energy efficiency and carbon emissions have continued to rise in other words the price tag of a green new deal that would make a difference would have to be much higher than what governments such as the u s and korea actually spent during the great recession the original south korea five year plan however to spend 5 percent of gdp to me seems about right as the best guess of the public investment needed to decarbonize a major economy through a green growth strategy so if we use korea as a starting point that means the united states would need to spend around 970 billion over the next five years or 194 billion annually artic_photo shutterstock com how to pay for the green new deal as for paying for it the first thing to bear in mind is that in my view a green new deal should be covered by current rather than future revenue a common way for congress to pay for the cost of a new program or stimulus is by deficit spending so the united states borrows the money from investors and then eventually has to pay it back through taxes down the road with the federal deficit projected to reach 1 trillion in 2019 increasing it by several hundred billion more even if for a good cause is not a great idea ballooning deficits add to the national debt which is already 21 trillion and counting saddling future generations of americans with unsustainable levels of national debt is just as dangerous as burdening them with an economy that is environmentally unsustainable deficit spending is warranted to boost overall demand for goods and services when unemployment rises consumers do not spend and private investment is down when that is not the case i believe efforts to grow green sectors should pay for themselves so the united states would have to find new revenue sources to finance additional government support for clean energy research and development greening infrastructure smart transmission grids public transport and other programs under any green new deal two of the main ways to do that would be by raising new revenues or finding savings elsewhere in the budget on the revenue side i believe passing a carbon tax is one of the best ways to go a 20 tax per metric ton of carbon that climbs over time at a pace slightly higher than inflation would raise around 96 billion in revenue each year covering just under half the estimated cost at the same time it would reduce carbon emissions by 11 1 billion metric tons through 2030 in other words not only does it help raise money to pay for a transition to a green economy a carbon tax also helps spur that very change in terms of savings the removal of fossil fuel subsidies is a particularly appropriate target consumer subsidies for fossil fuels and producer subsidies for coal cost u s taxpayers nearly 9 billion a year these subsidies could be shifted instead to cover some expenditures under a green new deal and again doing this would accelerate the transition to cleaner energy so where might the other 89 billion come from one option is to simply impose a higher carbon tax a 20 tax would put the united states roughly in the middle among countries that impose carbon taxes but doubling it to 40 per ton would raise an additional 76 billion annually or 172 billion in total as well as reduce 17 5 billion metric tons of carbon by 2030 another idea is to raise taxes on the highest earning americans for example imposing a 70 percent tax on earnings of 10 million or more would bring in an additional 72 billion a year kenny tong shutterstock com cost savings but it s also possible that the cost of decarbonizing the economy may fall over time for example the drop in emissions accompanying the carbon tax should lower the price tag in a way that s hard to estimate today the right policies and reforms also would help lower the costs in a sort of chicken and egg effect as economists ken gillingham and james stock have shown green innovations spur demand which leads to more innovation all of which ultimately reduce costs a good illustration is purchases of electric vehicles which will stimulate demand for charging stations once installed the stations will reduce the costs of running electric vehicles and further boost demand the green new deal as proposed by ocasio cortez and markey would be expensive but what policies are adopted and how we choose to pay for it ultimately could determine the plan s success and whether we can afford it

the united states is reportedly pushing china to agree to keep the value of the yuan stable as part of a deal to end the trade war between the world s two largest economies it is a demand that china as its leaders discuss economic policy at the national people s congress must think twice about before accepting the yuan was undoubtedly undervalued for many years including through a peg to the u s dollar that was established in 1998 an undervalued yuan was an important contributing factor to the trade surplus that china has run consistently since 1993 when its annual per capita income stood at just 400 in other words even when china was still a very poor country it was exporting capital to the rest of the world especially the u s

republican committee governor ivey has asked the 2019 alabama legislature to pass a 10 cent per gallon gasoline tax click to watch alabama governor kay ivey state of state speech text of governor ivey s speech president marsh speaker mccutcheon members of the alabama legislature chief justice stuart justices of the alabama supreme court distinguished guests and my fellow alabamians as we begin the 2018 legislative session we recognize alabama has experienced a significant transformation in government since the first day of the 2017 legislative session on this occasion last year i sat where my friend president del marsh sits tonight and now due to a successful transition in state government i humbly stand before you as the 54th governor of alabama i ve been called upon to report on the state of the state when i became governor on april 10th the ship of state government was adrift we needed thoughtful and straightforward leadership over the past nine months together we have proven alabamians seek progress not stagnation mr president mr speaker it is my pleasure to report we have successfully steadied the ship of state i declare that the state of the state is strong and our future is as bright as the sun over the gulf tonight let s take a brief journey to consider where we ve been where we are and where we are going most governors have three months to prepare i had three hours yet after being sworn in as governor on april 10 2017 in the old senate chamber just across the hall from where we are gathered this evening i promised the people of alabama there would be no disruption in the ongoing functions of the state that s a promise kept i promised the people of alabama even though challenges lay ahead we would seize the opportunity to make alabama even better and our government more effective that s a promise kept my immediate pledge was to steady the ship of state navigate alabama through the storm we found ourselves in and seek a calmer path for this state we dearly love and proudly call home that too is a promise kept when i was sworn in there were many decisions to be made i was focused committed and prepared my first full day was the 16th legislative day in the 2017 legislative session exactly half way through a session that i began as president of the senate as governor last session working closely with the legislature i signed 333 bills and resolutions into law together we ve made significant progress with our budgets we avoided proration and practiced fiscal responsibility we renewed the alabama jobs act ensuring economic development continues and we provided the tools and flexibility needed to attract new investments creating more jobs for alabama families many bills i signed as governor also bore my signature from my time as president of the senate the smooth transition of government brought me full circle from the legislative to the executive and i am better able to lead and govern because of it i support having a lieutenant governor who presides over the senate our current order of succession serves the state well i know this firsthand having experienced it i strongly support our current order of succession my first major effort in leading the state was to evaluate the cabinet and staff of the new administration with this evaluation i made changes resulting in nearly half of the 22 cabinet members being replaced my cabinet and staff are capable honest and dedicated they take their charge to serve the people of alabama seriously they provide the people of alabama with the open honest and transparent government that they deserve my administration includes public servants who are subject matter experts and who work tirelessly to make alabama a great place to live work and raise a family my second major effort was to connect with and hear directly from alabamians so that together we would restore confidence in state government an effective leader does four things listen learn help and lead to help and lead the people of alabama it was essential that i first listen to and learn from the people of alabama throughout july august and september i embarked on my listen learn help and lead tour where i visited communities across the state i spent an entire day in these communities meeting with local leaders and visiting their businesses and schools i wanted to learn about their successes and their challenges i wanted to hear from everyday people not just from the politicians and lobbyists in montgomery these meetings were beneficial and well received people were excited about reconnecting with their governor i wanted to restore our state s image to do this government must be efficient and transparent with executive orders we ve streamlined state government dissolved unneeded task forces and banned lobbyists from appointments by the executive branch ensuring more citizens have an opportunity to serve and contribute i also established the opioid overdose addiction council to address the urgent opioid epidemic that is impacting alabama families administratively i ve appointed more than 350 qualified and diverse individuals to boards and other groups which affect the day to day lives of alabamians one of the most important duties of government is providing safety and protection i have worked closely with the alabama emergency management agency and local officials across our state during six weather related states of emergency through coordinated efforts we have improved our communication and our response to natural disasters the people of alabama desire leadership that is willing to get things done as a result of our team approach i am proud to report alabama s economy is performing well revenues are up unemployment is down economic development is on the rise and improved educational opportunities abound since i became governor over 3 5 billion dollars in new direct investments have been committed in the state these investments will create nearly 8 000 new jobs for alabama workers the unemployment rate has fallen every month since i became governor our most recent unemployment numbers put the unemployment rate at 3 5 percent the lowest rate ever recorded in alabama my friends alabama s economy is supporting more jobs than ever before news of our economic successes seem to be a daily occurrence in fact i am proud to announce this evening that kimber firearms will build a 38 million dollar production facility in troy bringing with it 366 new jobs these are good high paying jobs and will enable more of our citizens to provide for their families while taking part in the rich history of the second amendment we are proud and honored to welcome kimber to alabama this announcement and countless others like it make one thing clear what we are doing is working and as a result the people of alabama are working and providing for their families when i meet with global ceos of companies considering alabama or who already have companies here they tell me their alabama facility operates at a level that cannot be rivaled my fellow alabamians that is because of you the hard working people of alabama companies choose alabama because of your dedication and our skilled workforce when a company invests in alabama it is investing not just in our state but in you our people we should do everything we can to help every alabamian find work one of the most meaningful experiences i have had as governor was to participate in the first ever governor s disability job fair with secretary of labor fitzgerald washington commissioner of mental health lynn beshear dr graham sisson executive director of the governor s office on disability and commissioner jane elizabeth burdeshaw of the department of rehabilitation services the fair consisted of more than 95 employers looking to fill over 3 100 positions 1 100 people attended the disability job fair one of those job seekers is with us tonight caryn mcdade caryn walked into the governor s disability job fair on oct 30th looking for an opportunity as a teenager caryn s learning disabilities plagued her until she saw no alternative other than dropping out of school she took ged classes at the birmingham career center and was referred to the alabama department of rehabilitation services to work on resumé writing job development interviewing and placement rehabilitation services paired her with harold reynolds an employment specialist with easter seals of birmingham to prepare her for job interviews at the job fair during the fair caryn met and interviewed with staff from southern hospitality home health care of fultondale within 48 hours she had completed a second follow up interview by the end of the week she was employed full time as a home health care aide caryn thank you for being with us tonight you are a perfect example of the intrinsic value we all have and a reminder that what we do as public officials affects the lives of real alabamians for alabamians to have career opportunities they must be prepared when the right job comes along my education initiative strong start strong finish does just that under strong start strong finish we will coordinate our efforts and bring all stakeholders to the table in order to improve education all the way from prek to the workforce i instituted strong start strong finish because we must prepare our people for the jobs of today and for the jobs of tomorrow by 2020 62 percent of all jobs available in alabama will require some form of postsecondary education however today only 37 percent of our workforce has achieved such an education we must ensure that our students graduate high school and then earn a postsecondary certificate or degree effective education requires a strong foundation in a child s early years in 2017 under the leadership of secretary jeana ross alabama s first class pre k program increased the number of classrooms to 938 statewide research shows us that students who participate in alabama s first class pre k program are more likely than other students to be proficient in reading and math at every grade level for the 11th year in a row our first class pre k program was recognized for being the highest quality pre k in the nation in fact harvard university is currently developing a full length documentary on alabama s pre k program to share across the country with those interested in following our lead our first class pre k is certainly a bright spot for alabama i m proud to have quickly become known as a governor focused on education over the past nine months i have devoted a great deal of my time to my role as president of the state board of education in less than two years alabama has had four different k 12 superintendents that is nothing to be proud of the members of the state board of education must ensure continuity to see progress board members must set goals and adopt strategies to achieve student learning at high standards our central focus must be on our students not on personal agendas or political maneuvering tomorrow marks nine full months since i unexpectedly became governor a lot has happened since then we have lifted the dark cloud wounds have started healing and the people s faith in a government for and by the people is being restored though it is important to reflect on where we ve been and where we are we must place most of our focus on where we are going let me share with you a quote you ve probably heard that is relevant to where we are as a state what lies ahead of us or what lies behind us is of little importance when compared to what lies within us in that spirit i say to you instead of dwelling on what adversity we have previously faced or what mountains we may soon climb we must focus on being who we are a resilient people a people dedicated to doing what s right and to making a difference in the world like always our budgets are at the forefront of state government however this year we find ourselves in an unfamiliar position related to our budgets we are clearly in the midst of our recovery from the great recession unemployment is at an all time low housing prices have increased for the third consecutive year and alabama is rated 12th nationwide for financial health when i came into office the relationship between the executive and legislative branches was strained but that too has been corrected i have worked closely with legislative leadership and the senate and house budget chairs to draft fiscally responsible budgets we ve righted the ship of state now my proposed budgets will move alabama in the right direction just as alabama families work on their budgets around their kitchen tables to get them just right we too must get the state s budgets right i am proposing strong manageable budgets that responsibly fund state government without raising taxes on the people of alabama our improved economy allows us to not just fund state programs but to expand the ones making a positive difference it is tempting when times aren t as tight as before to spend generously we must resist that temptation as a lifelong conservative i believe in being fiscally responsible and in being good stewards of taxpayer dollars not a single appropriated dollar belongs to government rather it belongs to the hard working men and women of alabama who have earned it in that vein my general fund budget restores fiscal responsibility by paying down alabama s debt earlier than required we will fund government appropriately but with prudence and care as a positive sign of progress there are fewer people eligible for medicaid today than one year ago good news on the jobs front means more alabamians are working and less dependent on government services accordingly medicaid will require less general fund appropriations than expected we are proving conservative government creates economic growth lessens government overreach and moves people toward self sufficiency our strong economy with ample employment opportunities positions us not just to cover the basics as we have in past years but to ensure we fulfill our duty to the citizens of alabama we will pursue efficient government which makes good use of our resources while appropriately funding state services government is called on to serve and protect the people my general fund budget does just that we will put more state troopers on our roads and add more corrections officers all in an effort to serve and protect alabama families perhaps our state s biggest challenge is found in our prison system for far too long we have run our state s prison system in a way that risks a takeover by the federal courts now one federal court has found that our prisons are overcrowded and understaffed due at least in part to facilities that are worn and old correctional professionals work diligently to provide security medical mental health and rehabilitative services in a challenging environment they deserve our attention and support we must also work diligently to provide appropriate care to those placed in the custody of the department of corrections immediately after taking office i instructed commissioner jeff dunn and his staff working closely with my staff to develop a viable plan to address correctional staffing which will improve the delivery of inmate healthcare and make capital investments in our infrastructure we have commissioned comprehensive reviews to determine the compensation levels necessary to recruit and retain corrections staff we have entered contract negotiations with a new healthcare provider to expand and improve inmate healthcare at a reasonable cost i have instructed the commissioner to hire a project management team to help us develop a master plan so we will be able to make smart cost effective decisions when addressing our outdated prison infrastructure we will no longer guess about possible fixes instead i will present to the people a workable solution to this generational problem i am committed to meeting this challenge head on together with the support of the legislature we will solve this problem for generations to come this is an alabama problem that must have an alabama solution now is the time to act as many of you know i am from camden in rural wilcox county rural communities like camden have a very special place in my heart i understand the challenges rural areas face and it is my intention to do all i can to help make a difference in the lives of people in rural areas supporting rural alabama is central to my legislative agenda though we are almost two decades into the 21st century many of our rural communities do not have adequate access to broadband adequate broadband enhances educational opportunities increases economic development prospects and develops critical communication systems i strongly support legislation to encourage new broadband investments and i ask the legislature to join me in assessing our state s broadband needs to ensure resources are placed where they are most needed i am also proposing funding for loan repayment programs for dentists and physician s assistants who agree to work in underserved areas of alabama many of alabama s citizens live in rural areas and we must be attentive to their needs and ensure they have the same access to quality healthcare as those in urban areas just as we address the needs of our rural citizens we must also take care of those who have taken care of us our veterans my father served in world war ii thus i understand the sacrifices our military men and women make and i am proud that more than 1 in 10 alabamians have worn our nation s uniform sometimes when veterans finish their service they struggle to find work that is why i support extending tax credits to small businesses that hire veterans for those veterans who own their own businesses they need our support as well i am proposing legislation that will give preference to veteran owned businesses that bid on state contracts our veterans have given much to protect our state and nation as a state we must step up and repay them for their sacrifice tonight i am proposing a pay raise for all teachers and state employees every day we depend on state employees whether it s a state trooper patrolling our highways a teacher staying late to help a struggling student or a social worker rescuing an abused child quality state employees are essential to good government it is long past time for us to honor their service with better pay like the general fund budget my education budget is conservative practical and wisely funds state services while guaranteeing every alabamian an opportunity to achieve a strong start and a strong finish to their educational journey education is the key to a better life for all i am focused on ensuring all alabama children get a good start and have the resources they need to complete school be prepared for the workplace and ultimately succeed i am very proud that the education budget i am submitting to the legislature is the largest investment in education in a decade in addition to raises for all teachers and support personnel my proposed budget fully funds the k 12 request of 144 million dollars and provides an additional 50 million dollars for higher education we will continue to implement strong start strong finish by increasing funding for our first class pre k program by an additional 23 million dollars i am also proposing funding for our pre through 3 initiative the jobs for alabama s graduates program and for education scholarships for math and science teachers these additional dollars are investments in our children and young people and thus are investments in our future education is especially effective when there is a concentration on particular subjects or skills the alabama school of fine arts in birmingham and the alabama school of mathematics and science in mobile are special focus schools which effectively prepare their students for rewarding careers as workforce needs evolve we must create educational opportunities that prepare our people to meet those needs tonight i am announcing the formation of the alabama school of cyber technology and engineering which will be based in huntsville this school will prepare some of our state s highest achieving students to enter the growing fields of cyber technology and engineering just as huntsville has always been on the leading edge of the rocket and aerospace industries the alabama school of cyber technology and engineering will ensure that alabama students are at the forefront of today s emerging technologies with this budget we will improve educational opportunities for all alabamians we are now in year two of a three year celebration culminating in alabama s bicentennial in 2019 our 200th anniversary as a state gives us an opportunity to reflect on who we are as a people our legislature has adopted an official state creed which i would like to share with you i believe in alabama a state dedicated to a faith in god and the enlightenment of mankind to a democracy that safeguards the liberties of each citizen and to the conservation of her youth her ideals and her soil i believe it is my duty to obey her laws to respect her flag and to be alert to her needs and generous in my efforts to foster her advancement within the statehood of the world as we ponder this past year and indeed the past 200 years and as we contemplate where we are going we should embrace this creed we should look to it as a guiding light for action in hopes that it may one day be a testament to the courageous leadership which brought this state from some of its toughest times into some of its greatest despite our differences despite our varying viewpoints despite party labels i sincerely believe we all have one common goal to each play our part in making alabama a better place to live raise and educate our children own a home and create jobs and business opportunities as i look across this historic chamber filled with men and women who have made a commitment to public service i propose a question to each of you why do we serve why have we chosen this path of public service these questions are not new ones in fact they have been around for centuries johann sebastian bach is one of the world s greatest composers you probably already know this and likely agree however something you may not know about bach is that he also had 20 children can you imagine to say the least bach was a very busy man he was once asked why do you write music he could have said because he had a large family to provide for or because music came naturally he could have said these things but he didn t he simply replied that he wrote music for the glory of god and the good of mankind consider his response it was concise honest and revealed the character of his heart and the driving force behind his actions he wasn t driven by himself or even his family his motivation was much deeper much more significant how would you respond when asked the same question why do you serve why did you swear an oath to support this nation and our great state at all costs you may have been motivated by certain issues causes philosophies or individuals to seek office and those are good reasons to serve but when our efforts actions and accomplishments are evaluated will we leave a legacy like bach are we motivated by pride power or greed or are we moved by an innate desire to make a difference in our state and world i say we can make our state better if our purpose is the same to serve for the glory of god and the good of mankind i challenge you to reflect on bach s response as you enter the legislative chamber each day from the moment our country declared its independence we embraced the truth that to be an american is to seek the impossible to dare to dream despite opposition together let us dream of a brighter alabama that in keeping with bach s example brings glory to god and brings about a greater good in the lives of our people the ship of state has been steadied together let s move it in a new direction toward progress and sustainability i am honored to be at the helm of this magnificent ship we call alabama which benefits from a strong and committed crew the good people of alabama may god bless each of you and the great state of alabama textrickeystokes
president donald trump the self proclaimed tariff man is set to become the 100 billion man the immediate drivers of the surge in the trade deficit under us president donald trump have been the fiscal expansion resulting from the tax cuts he pushed through congress and the stronger dollar afp if the trends of the past year and economists expectations hold true trade data to be released wednesday will show the us s deficit in goods and services with the world topped 600 billion in 2018 that means trump s presidency will have seen the us trade shortfall the main metric by which his judges countries to be winning or losing grow by more than 100 billion unlock exclusive access to the story of india s general elections only on the ht app download now put another way by trump s own benchmark the us is 20 percent worse off than it was at the end of 2016 just before he took office economists don t like to dwell too much on the us trade balance it is by and large an accounting measure that often moves in directions inverse to the health of the economy the us trade deficit s biggest contraction on record came in 2009 when it shrank by more than 300 billion in a single year as a result of the recession then under way and the resulting collapse in us demand for imported goods as a result largely of that slump the us s goods and services deficit with the world contracted by more than 200 billion over president barack obama s eight years in office this is a major reason why economists say you really don t want this as your scorecard said phil levy a former senior economist for trade with president george w bush s council of economic advisers it s not an accident when things are booming we consume more imports despite the name trade deficits tend to have less to do with trade policy than broader macroeconomic policy the main long term driver of persistent trade deficits since 1975 has been the gap between the us s low savings rate and its attractiveness as an investment destination fueled partly by the dollar s role as the world s reserve currency that in turn leads to a stronger dollar which in itself helps increase the trade deficit by lowering the real cost of imports and increasing the local currency cost of american goods in overseas markets in the first 11 months of 2018 the us deficit in goods and services with the world increased 52 billion or about 10 percent from the same period in 2017 if that pattern holds in the december data released wednesday and economists surveyed by bloomberg predict it will the deficit will have widened to about 610 billion in 2018 in 2016 it was 502 billion the immediate drivers of the surge in the trade deficit under trump have been the fiscal expansion resulting from the tax cuts he pushed through congress and the stronger dollar that resulted partly from the juiced economy that expansion helped create trump s supporters insist he s tackling that via his trade negotiations with china and other us trading partners they also point to his renegotiation of nafta as something that will help reduce the us trade deficit in the long run but trump s trade policy also contributed materially to the growth of the trade deficit in 2018 the tariffs he threatened and then imposed on chinese imports caused a rush by importers to get ahead of the new duties that fueled an increase in incoming traffic at west coast ports last year the retaliatory tariffs trump provoked from china also hit major us agricultural exports such as soybeans moreover his attacks and threats to impose tariffs on trading partners from china to the european union has also contributed to the slowdown in those economies and therefore their demand for american goods trump and his supporters have cast the blame in part on the federal reserve arguing that its decisions to hike rates last year contributed to the strengthening of the dollar trump has complained that a stronger dollar has weakened his hand in his trade wars and put a damper on us growth but advocates of a stronger us currency policy argue that trump himself carries plenty of blame robert scott senior economist at the left leaning economic policy institute said trump s failure to tackle what he sees as a global misalignment in currencies that requires a depreciation of the dollar has been the main cause of a rising trade deficit even trump s attempts to deal with currency issues in trade negotiations with china or his public complaints about a strong dollar seem unlikely to change anything the strong dollar matters because it has led to near record deficits in manufactured goods and non oil goods that are being masked by increases in exports of oil and services scott said to his mind that means the us s trade balance is worse than even the official data reflects there s a lot going on below the surface here he said
rise of the zombies precious metals supply and demand last week the prices of gold and silver fell 35 and â 70 respectively but what does that mean other than woe unto anyone who owned silver futures with leverage the s p 500 index and the euro was up a bit though the yuan was flat and copper was down most notably the spread between treasury and junk yields fell if the central banks can lower the risk of default premium they can make everything unicorns and rainbows again extend the aging boom a while longer non zombie vs zombie enterprises via bis and oecd the zombies won t be able to withstand rising interest rates which will unmask the misallocation of capital in the economy fostered by the extremely loose central bank policies of recent years the bank for international settlements defines a zombie corporation as one that s been around for at least 10 years and which has an interest coverage ratio less than one for three years in a row in other words mature firms with profits interest expense as of 2016 zombies were over 12 of all public non financial firms the central planners think to get gdp to go up well zombie firms certainly consume so keeping them alive would seem to support this goal plus they employ people wall street certainly does not object partisans of whichever party has sent its leader to the white house also want rising gdp so the fed finds ways to keep zombies alive since zombies exist only by the grace of ever lower interest rates and ever more promiscuous credit conditions the central bank must find a way to lower rates and push investors out on the risk curve the survival probabilities for zombie firms have increased as a result of central bank intervention these companies are like a millstone around the global economy s neck as they continue to be able to compete for scarce resources with a dwindling number of genuine wealth creators they succeeded this week short term interest rates were down rates on junk bonds fell also but treasury yields and aaa corporate bond yields were up oh well you can t have it all actually the absolute level is not the only thing that matters the spread between junk and aaa or treasuries also matters this is a measure of stress at the margin and also the penalty that junk firms must pay compared to competing firms one of the perennial criticisms of the austrian school is that we don t offer a precise prediction of timing and a number of folks have tried to predict timing and have been wrong we think this criticism misses the point if a process is destructive of firms there is value in identifying it clearly of shining a spotlight on it of bellowing from the rooftops sure it would be good to be able to say june 4 at 11 22am is when it will begin but absent that kind of precise timing we can still be sure that a destructive process is ongoing and the response but rising gdp is no response to this allegation we also think that the fed is in a pickle to keep the zombies adequately fed with the blood of the savers it can never be said too often it has to lower rates however what conventional theory can justify this we have heard some noise faint so far that there s no inflation so therefore they have more latitude etc and we are not even talking about the so called modern monetary theory now being pushed from the left of course there are scant signs of rising prices other than where tax and regulation force up retail prices lower rates mean hamburger chains can borrow more to open up more hamburger restaurants manufacturers of kitchen equipment can borrow more to expand production of hamburger grills the result is a greater supply of burgers soft prices and falling profit margins not inflation we saw a discussion among austrian economists recently about whether or not one should own gold yes gold is not an investment so why own it if the fed has driven the risk yield of all investments down where is your line where do you choose not to be invested we have said many times that the fed cares not about the price of gold its officials would have no reason to incur career risk or prison time to manipulate the price even if they had the means but here is one area where they care about not the price of gold per se but the attractiveness of investment if investors expect flat to negative returns then they must turn to gold as the only alternative if you cannot get a return on capital then you at least want return of capital this is not what the fed wants what wall street wants what warren buffett wants or what most investors want it s a scenario where few firms make money many lose money and increasing numbers at the margin go under and few investors stay even it will be a scenario like 2008 when it comes we have a tool to help predict it the gold basis is it a good thing or a bad thing that our indicator is not flashing a red alert at the moment fundamental developments let s look at the only true picture of the supply and demand fundamentals of gold and silver but first here is the chart of the prices of gold and silver gold and silver priced in usd next this is a graph of the gold price measured in silver otherwise known as the gold to silver ratio see here for an explanation of bid and offer prices for the ratio it was up a point and a half this week gold silver ratio here is the gold graph showing gold basis co basis and the price of the dollar in terms of the gold price gold basis co basis and the usd priced in milligrams of gold well we broke a month long streak of rising gold prices this week actually starting midweek last week the price of gold began falling along with this we see a big rise in the scarcity of the metal i e the co basis at least in the april contract the continuous gold basis is up only slightly this shows a selloff of both metal and futures the monetary metals gold fundamental price is up marginally to 1 421 now let s look at silver silver basis co basis and the usd priced in grams of silver the price of silver dropped by a much greater percentage we can see the dollar rose from 1 93g silver to 2 01 grams and we see a big rise in the co basis along with the price move but as with gold the continuous silver basis shows no real move still the monetary metals silver fundamental price is down â 29 to 16 16 charts by bis monetary metals chart and image

a no deal brexit would plunge the uk economy into recession and annual growth will slip below 1 this year for this first time since the financial crisis even if a deal is secured the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd has warned the thinktank which advises 34 of the world s richest countries said that even with a smooth brexit the uk economy would slump to 0 8 growth in 2019 from 1 4 in 2018 as brexit uncertainty and donald trump s trade war with china harmed the uk s economic prospects in november it was forecasting 1 4 growth for the uk this year the last time annual growth in the uk was below 1 was in the depths of the financial crisis when the economy contracted by 4 2 the oecd said a steep fall in investment over the past year by uk based firms had left the economy in a weak position to boost its poor productivity rates and increase wages growth the economic health check comes as a string of major manufacturing firms have made clear that their future in the uk is in doubt should the government fail to secure a transition arrangement that allows them to trade freely inside a customs union with the eu toyota s european boss johan van zyl said he could not promise british employees jobs were safe until the outcome of brexit was decided meanwhile the bmw board member peter schwarzenbauer who oversees the mini and rolls royce brands said the firm might be forced to stop making the mini at its cowley plant near oxford the oecd chief economist laurence boone said the uk had missed out on 0 7 of growth compared with the oecd s previous projections and 1 7 of growth compared with the us france and germany there is no better trade agreement for the uk than the eu single market every step back from this arrangement makes it more difficult for the private sector she said in 2017 the oecd boss angel gurría clashed with the uk chancellor philip hammond when he suggested that a second referendum on eu membership would significantly benefit the economy like most international agencies the oecd has warned that leaving the eu will harm foreign investment into the uk and lower potential growth the failure to secure a deal and transition period would probably plunge the economy into recession that could be stronger still if a lack of adequate border infrastructure and a loss of access to eu trade arrangements with third countries were to cause serious bottlenecks in integrated cross border supply chains it said the costs would also be magnified if this also induced a further decline in business and financial market confidence and disruptions in financial markets in such a scenario the likely near term recession in the united kingdom would generate sizeable negative spillovers on growth in other countries the report added john mcdonnell mp the shadow chancellor accused philip hammond of standing idle while the economy got weaker and weaker he said these downgraded growth forecasts from the oecd leaving predicted uk growth at under 1 in 2019 and 2020 highlight the impact of a botched brexit and sustained austerity boone a french national who gained a phd at the london business school before going on to advise a string of investment banks and latterly the former french president françois hollande said the global expansion lost momentum last year and would continue to slow in 2019 easing to 3 3 from the previous forecast of 3 5 the biggest reductions in growth were seen in the euro area and across asia she said the foundations of the global economy are shakier than a year ago and any further shocks will only make the situation worse mario draghi the president of the european central bank is expected to downgrade economic growth forecasts for the eurozone after officials meet on thursday in december the ecb was forecasting growth of 1 7 in 2019 20 and 1 5 in 2021 analysts said these predictions were optimistic and likely to be brought closer into line with european commission forecasts of 1 3 and 1 6 in 2019 and 2020 respectively the oecd said the eurozone would grow at just 1 this year compared with the previous forecast of 1 8 one of the main drags on global growth over the past year has been a series of increases by trump in tariffs on chinese exports to the us the white house has also threatened the eu with tariffs on european made cars exported to the us and accused india of dumping subsidised goods on american markets global trade slipped last year and would again if protectionist barriers were raised the report said the trade restrictions introduced last year are a drag on growth investment and living standards particularly for low income households it said sign up to the daily business today email or follow guardian business on twitter at businessdesk boone said the world s richest countries risked another decade of stagnant wages unless they coordinated investment and trade policies oecd figures show that coordinated efforts to invest in infrastructure bring higher rewards than when countries act alone she said the eu was the ideal platform for policymakers to combine their efforts especially when it means that for every 5 spent on infrastructure governments gained 10 in additional economic activity this is leaning against the prevailing wind for sure but it is necessary to point out that cooperation helps development and improves the living standards of the poorest last year the oecd said it was anxious that growth across the globe remained dependent on cheap borrowing and government spending boone said she was still concerned by high levels of debt in china europe the us and in many emerging market economies which weakened the spending capacity of governments should there be another financial crash

chief executive officer and director thank you and welcome to everyone joining us this morning last night we issued our fourth quarter 2018 results our revenue for the fourth quarter increased 9 7 compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 to 127 1 million driven mainly by 15 growth in our environmental services segment mark will discuss our financial results in more detail in a moment advertisement advertisement i would like to talk specifically about our environmental services segment from a revenue standpoint i m excited by the fact that we again delivered strong double digit growth in the segment for the third straight quarter and recorded record es revenue of 85 9 million this result is especially gratifying considering our fourth quarter results did not include any large field services projects which boosted our revenues during the second and third quarter of this year this performance is a direct result of the approach used by our sales and service team to discover the true needs of our customers and then work hard to meet those requirements all of our service lines in this segment experienced growth on a year over year basis our revenue growth in 2018 was aided by the five new branches we added during 2017 as well as a sales and service resources we added throughout 2017 the cost incurred during 2018 associated with the new branches and resources added during 2017 was approximately 13 5 million from which we generated approximately 15 4 million in revenue during 2018 we implemented a less aggressive approach to adding new resources compared to 2017 in fiscal 2018 we incurred approximately 1 7 million in operating costs while generating approximately 1 7 million in revenue for the resources added during this year continued revenue growth and an increasing focus on cost containment during the last three quarters allowed us to improve operating margin percentage during the fourth quarter of 2018 to 27 3 during our third quarter earnings call we indicated that we expected to the reach this level on a seasonally adjusted basis by the first quarter of fiscal 2019 increasing operating margins to this level ahead of schedule was a nice achievement for us advertisement advertisement moving onto our oil business oil business revenue during the quarter was flat at 41 2 million compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 our base oil netback increased by 0 17 per gallon during the fourth quarter compared to last year but was down 0 19 per gallon compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2018 the decline in base oil netback was primarily driven by marketwide oversupply of light grade group ii base oil was developed in the second half of the fourth quarter as well as decline in crude oil price the price for bunker and related fuels followed crude downward during the second half of the fourth quarter the falling commodity prices allowed us to decrease our net pay for oil directly from generators by 0 03 per gallon and our cost of used oil feedstock purchase from third parties by 0 09 per gallon during the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter we may have been able to decrease our feedstock cost even more but for the fact that beginning in mid october high sulfur fuel oil began trading at a premium to wti crude high sulfur fuel oil continue to be priced at a premium to wti crude through the remainder of 2018 and this premium has increased further during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 this pricing relationship negatively impacts rerefiners relative to those who sell used oil into the rfo market so the price for rfo was often tied to the price for high sulfur bunker fuel in used oil collection we were able to partially offset the negative impact of lower base oil netbacks by increasing our oil collection route efficiency on a year over year basis for the third quarter in a row during the fourth quarter we increased our route efficiency by 4 6 compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 advertisement advertisement as we explained during our third quarter earnings conference call we incurred an 18 day construction shutdown of our rerefinery near the beginning of the fourth quarter as a result we incurred higher maintenance cost and lower rerefinery production which led to sub standard absorption of our fixed costs during the fourth quarter on the positive side we completed several equipment upgrades during this downtime which we expect will allow us to operate the rerefinery on a more consistent basis now and in the future overall 2018 was a year of great achievements in our environmental services business and a year in which we laid the foundation for a better future in our oil business segment as we look forward to 2019 we expect to face challenges in the near term and opportunities later in the year in the oil business segment and we see continued momentum in the environmental services segment in the oil business light grade group ii base oil is still in an oversupplied situation due to seasonality and the impact of lighter than normal refinery refinery turnaround activity during 2018 historically demand increases as the winter season nears its end assuming the same trend continues we would expect to see upward pricing pressure for base oil unfortunately this has not yet occurred and our current base oil netback is approximately 0 35 per gallon lower than our average from the fourth quarter of 2018 from a feedstock standpoint we re already back into a net charge for oil position and we continue to try to push our street price higher and that improvement from our average pay for oil during the fourth quarter to our current street price is over 0 20 per gallon advertisement advertisement we have discussed the expected impacts of imo 2020 regulation with our investors and analysts in the past and we continue to believe this initiative will improve both the feedstock and finished product portions of our spread while we anticipate seeing the effects from imo 2020 prior to the year end of 2019 we are not as not certain as the exact timing and magnitude of these impacts for now we will continue to work hard to operate the rerefinery efficiently and manage our spreads effectively from an environmental service segment perspective we continue to see momentum which we believe will support higher single digit organic growth during 2019 and we look to add to that by closing an additional acquisition opportunities from a profitability standpoint we expect to improve upon our performance in 2018 while we expect to see seasonal pressure on our operating margin during the first quarter of this year we anticipate full year operating margin for 2019 will improve upon the 25 6 operating margin we produced during fiscal 2018 mark will now walk us through our fourth quarter financial results in more detail mark devita chief financial officer advertisement advertisement thanks brian for the fourth quarter we recorded net income attributable to common shareholders of 2 5 million compared to 11 7 million in fourth quarter of 2017 for the year net income was 14 7 million compared to 28 1 million in fiscal 2017 on an adjusted basis net income for both fiscal 2018 and 17 was 16 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 we recorded diluted earnings per share of 0 11 compared to diluted earnings of 0 51 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017 our 2017 fourth quarter earnings included a one time adjustment of 0 27 per share as a result of the tax cuts and jobs act signed until late 2017 on adjusted basis fourth quarter 2018 diluted earnings per share was 0 12 compared to 0 26 a diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2017 on an annual basis 2018 adjusted diluted earnings per share was 0 68 compared to 0 70 a diluted share for fiscal 2017 please refer to our reconciliation of gaap to non gaap supporting schedules in our press release in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 environmental services revenues increased 11 2 million or 15 from 74 7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 to 85 9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 higher revenue was due to increased activity in all the segment s businesses most of the increase was due to higher volume in our antifreeze vacuum and field services businesses along with increases in volume and price in our containerized waste business and favorable pricing and mix in our parts cleaning business revenue growth during the quarter was due in part to acquisitions made earlier in the year if you remove the revenue attributable to those acquisitions our revenue growth rate would have been 11 6 for the fourth quarter compared to the year earlier quarter same branch sales growth was 13 2 in the fourth quarter compared to the fourth quarter a year ago if we remove acquisition related revenue which was integrated into existing branches during the year same branch sales growth would have been 10 7 advertisement advertisement in the fourth quarter of 2018 oil business revenues were flat at 41 2 million compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 mainly due to a planned extended shutdown at our rerefinery and the resulting negative impact on production partially offset by higher base oil netbacks oil business segment operating margin fell sharply to negative 7 1 in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 7 9 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 we sold 12 7 million gallons of base oil compared to 13 6 million gallons in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 we sold approximately 3 1 million gallons of rfo during the fourth quarter which was down 18 or 0 7 million gallon compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 turning now to income before corporate sg a expense oil business income before corporate sg a expense decreased 6 2 million in the fourth quarter from 3 3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 to negative 2 9 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 the decrease in income before corporate sg a was mainly due to higher maintenance and transportation expenses caused by the long shutdown an increase in the cost of used oil feedstock was only partially offset by higher selling prices for our oil business products compared to the year ago quarter which also negatively impacted our operating margin profit before corporate sg a expense in the environmental services segment was a record high at 23 4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 2018 excuse me which resulted in operating margin percentage of 27 3 which was relatively flat compared to the operating margin of 27 2 in the fourth quarter of 2017 even though our operating margin percentage was relatively flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 profit dollars before corporate sg a expense increased 3 1 million over the same period a year ago advertisement advertisement our overall corporate sg a expense as a percentage of revenue was 12 2 for the fourth quarter slightly lower than 12 7 of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017 mainly due to higher revenue and lower salaries and incentive compensation partially offset by the absence of a reduction in tax reserves which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2017 the company s effective income tax rate for 2018 was 26 6 compared to 17 3 in fiscal 2017 the difference in the effective tax rate is principally attributable to the impact on our deferred taxes as of december 30 2017 due to the reduction in the us federal corporate tax rate to 21 fourth quarter ebitda was 9 4 million compared to 14 2 million in the year ago quarter turning to the balance sheet cash on hand at the end of the quarter stood at 43 6 million compared to 41 9 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017 and total debt stood at 29 million compared to 28 7 million one year ago our cash flow from operation for fiscal 2018 was 30 million compared to 45 3 million in fiscal 2017 which included one time gains and awards of 11 8 million our continued goal is to use our excess cash to execute our growth strategy seeking additional acquisition opportunities as well as to pursue capital projects to help drive revenue growth and improve operational efficiency early in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 we closed on two tuck in acquisitions in the environmental services segment total annual revenue generated from these transactions is expected to be approximately 6 million ph we continue to look for acquisition targets to augment our organic growth initiatives finally i would like to take a moment to discuss the new leasing accounting standard asc 842 which we are required to implement beginning this year we are on less fee ph for approximately 1 400 items consisting primarily of buildings railcars trucks and trailers as of year end 2018 which means the implementation of this standard will have a material effect on our balance sheet based on the work we have performed to this point we believe the implementation of this new standard will result in new right of use assets and corresponding liabilities of between 59 million and 68 million being added to our balance sheet as of the first quarter of fiscal 2019 we believe the impact on our income statement from this implementation of the new accounting standard will be immaterial i want to thank everyone for their interest in heritage crystal clean now i will turn control the call over to our operator to begin the q a portion of the call questions and answers operator thank you sir operator instructions and our first question will come from luke junk with baird your line is now open luke junk baird analyst good morning guys brian recatto president chief executive officer and director good morning luke mark devita chief financial officer morning luke junk baird analyst so my first question is on the oil business and managing spreads and what i m wondering is how do you balance the two objectives of on one hand achieving a higher average charge for oil per gallon versus obviously the longer term drive toward getting more volumes onto your own trucks and improving your route efficiency brian recatto president chief executive officer and director yeah that s like the benefit that we re seeing right now in the marketplace is that overall the used motor oil market lengthened up in the back half of q4 so we re seeing pretty strong demand from third parties that want access to our rerefinery so what we re going to do luke is is try to focus on controlling our logistics costs we re going to expand our rfo program and in 2019 look for more local outlets for oil focus on our the lanes around our rerefinery to be aggressive and pursue direct volume in our plant and then augment that with third parties so if we re seeing reduced debt ph sitting in our routes we could park some trucks in 2019 to make sure that we achieve efficiency that s the most important thing for us to be efficient with the trucks we don t think we re going to have any trouble filling out the plant given the used motor oil in general is longer does that answer the question luke junk baird analyst yeah that s helpful and then just a follow up to that regarding the plant operations specifically in the upgrades that you made during the fourth quarter you mentioned in your prepared remarks we should expect more consistent operations could you just expand on that and maybe comment on some of the specific changes that we made brian recatto president chief executive officer and director yes we made quite a few changes obviously it was a pretty long 18 day shutdown we essentially if you guys remember we had issues with our i think i mentioned on one of the calls we had problems with our air cooler in the first quarter of 2018 we replaced that in 2019 and actually we had freezing problems within 2018 that performed extremely well in 2019 we just went through the probably the coldest weather obviously in the city we didn t have any issues with that piece of equipment then we also rebuilt the lower half of our vacuum tower we ve had historically some weak metallurgy in that vacuum tower we lined the bottom half of the vessel with a better metallurgy we also replaced some piping and valving in critical areas that we ve had issues with from a rotating equipment and metallurgical standpoint so we think those things will help tremendously and lastly we upgraded our if you remember we had made some technological advances in our vacuum tower to reduce the resin carryover into our catalyst guard beds we improved upon that system during q4 which will give us more extended life in our catalyst performance and our guard beds which will lower our overall cost structure in 2019 so all in all it was a great turnaround for us a lot of hard work went into and our guys did a great job with the construction project we had no incidents during the construction and so far in 2019 the plant s been running well luke junk baird analyst okay and if i could just sneak in a really question with that end mark do you by chance have just the cost impact of the shutdown in terms of the profit before corporate items in the oil business is there a dire ph amount that you could splice up for the maintenance costs and higher transportation cost specifically relating to the shutdown mark devita chief financial officer well i ll let you do the math i ll give you a kind of the if we compare our margin year over year for q4 we printed the negative 7 1 in year earlier almost 8 and the shutdown maintenance was the and related costs were attributable or can be kind of blamed for about 5 6 that decrease in margin and transportation a little more than 4 see you basically have 11 of that 14 15 change with those two items we do have on the it was more expensive to get feedstock but our selling prices went up they didn t completely cancel each other out as brian and i alluded to in our prepared remarks but that it was much bigger issue for the shutdown costs the maintenance costs and the transportation costs then bad leverage from labor and benefit standpoint was another 2 5 and that s pretty much due to the shutdown as well as extended shutdown so that s lion share of your 14 15 decrease in margin on a year over year basis for q4 brian recatto president chief executive officer and director and then luke going forward assuming a normal shutdown duration we lost 1 2 million gallons of production because of the extra time we spent completing the construction side of the turnaround and i think we re well set up for a more consistent turnaround schedule i mean i think we mentioned on a previous call we re shooting for 26 days a year to be shutdown to do maintenance activities on the refinery luke junk baird analyst and this is a super helpful detail i ll leave it there thank you guys mark devita chief financial officer thanks operator thank you and our next question will come from line of michael hoffman with stifel your line is now open michael hoffman stifel analyst hi brian and mark thank you i missed you said the number i missed it mark how many gallons of base oil did you say you sold in the quarter mark devita chief financial officer we sold 12 7 million michael hoffman stifel analyst 12 7 million okay and then it was rfo was 3 1 did i get i heard that right mark devita chief financial officer you did michael hoffman stifel analyst okay perfect and then all of the work that was done does it change the targeted production number of 46 8 million gallons of base oil mark devita chief financial officer i still think we re in that range michael hoffman stifel analyst okay and we re still looking at approximately somewhere around 50 million gallons a year of rfo mark devita chief financial officer i am not quite sure about that it s we ve been doing less rfo if you adjust for a quirky ph quarter in q4 that was lower than what we did in rfo in q2 and q3 now again we did we wanted to avoid the problem of limited feedstock which in part attributed to some of our problems last year so part of that was just different management we re obviously collecting more based on our route efficiency and just from a pure volume standpoint you can tell that but we look to leverage our collection versus trying to attract third parties so depending on where you are getting those gallons we don t want to get deeper into the rfo market brian i don t know if you have any more color brian recatto president chief executive officer and director yes i think michael what will happen this year is we ll probably do more swaps versus expanding our rfo sales given the fact that we think we know hsfo is going to go down in price as we look at the strip i mean at the end of the year it s a 10 price differentials from wti so logically we ll work with our other refinery partners that swap oil where it makes sense to drive our logistics cost down so i think you ll see more swapping from us probably not more rfo activity and then in terms of rerefinery production we produced 43 million gallons this year with more expected uptime we certainly think we re going to get more into that 47 million range for production for the year barring on any unforeseen issues at the plant that made our projections right now so we re going to do that michael hoffman stifel analyst so if you think about it just to frame this given the spread pressures in the first half but maybe a 10 volume benefit and using the balancing act on the rfo to manage the spread without any benefit of imo 2020 a flat year over year margin dollars of margin is not an unreasonable way to think at the moment until we see what happens with how imo 2020 drives it just go back down and all that mark devita chief financial officer i mean i ll let brian comment but i would hope and we don t know where imo 2020 is going to be but i would hope we can beat flat over the last year it really to me is just how much better is the business is going to be and brian recatto president chief executive officer and director yeah i would agree with that i mean we re going to be disappointed if we don t perform better than we did in 2018 michael and that s given that we do get the benefit of what we think is going to happen relative to imo 2020 we re already seeing as i said earlier we re seeing a lengthening of used motor oil in the market we moved really quickly at the end of q4 and the beginning of this year to change our used motor oil pricing we made a 0 20 move we re going to keep pushing the envelope there yes we re feeling i mean you know the base oil market you can read the same things that we re reading the base oil market is weak right now we expect that to change you re going to see demand for lighter sweeter crudes go up you re going to see feedstock costs go up going into virgin refiners that s going to have to it s going to have to move base oil pricing up we re already seeing improved demand as we look out in the february and march for base oil which is a great thing for us you ve had some shipping problems the early part of this year in terms of exporting base oil because of even fog ph conditions in houston affected shipping lanes we think this thing is going to get cleaned up yes there s going to be pressure in q1 but we re optimistic that with what s happening on the macro front that we ll have a good back half of the year you can outperform relative to 2018 mark devita chief financial officer if you take even the imo 2020 impact out of it and you look at and we don t know the impact of this either but how likely is it that the turnaround season is late in 19 as it was in 18 how likely is it that the storm season is as light in 19 as it was in 18 i mean there were a lot of things that stacked up and had base oil production pretty high relative to what we ve seen in some of the past year so and that s without any capacity changes so there is reason to think that we should without much problem beat what we did in 18 it s just a matter of how much brian recatto president chief executive officer and director as you know there will be a strong demand for diesel i mean refineries are going to have to do michael hoffman stifel analyst multiple speakers i mean imo 2020 could be really interesting i m just i was trying to frame it against without that could you have an up year over year and what you re saying is yes that 4 or 10 volume growth despite the margin the spread compression you should produce year over year profit growth brian recatto president chief executive officer and director we are going to have work our rear ends off on used motor oil pricing on the street we re doing that that s going to be the real key there michael hoffman stifel analyst okay so the years of i ll flip this question around a different way you have a great environmental services business i mean you ve demonstrated that by reinvesting in growth in 16 17 you turnaround didn t start showing the operating leverage of it 18 it s great topline growth there is lots of acquisitions the best case may be used oils could be 15 of total ebitda why are you staying in the plant side of it you mean i get see in the collection cycles it fits the es business but why are you staying in the plant side brian recatto president chief executive officer and director well i think more than ever we want to be on the plant side until we see where imo 2020 flushes out michael i mean at this point we ve got a home for the used motor oil we collect it s very important for us to be in that business on the street every single customer that we do business with generates used motor oil generates only water we ve got four wastewater treatment plants it s the major component of what we re doing on the street i like having the ability to process it ourselves i mean obviously if we don t see anything happening with imo 2020 to change the dynamics and have a more consistent spread maybe we d think about that but at this point we re convinced that we re going to see some upside with the rerefinery we ve done a lot of elements work on improving the operations of the plant we re going to keep doing that we re just about done with capital we ve got one more major environmental project which doesn t involve shutting the plant down so we feel pretty good about the two years of hard work that we put into optimizing the plant so that s why we re not going to go to exit the business right now michael hoffman stifel analyst okay fair enough thank you brian recatto president chief executive officer and director and but just one more point to that is we absolutely are going to focus our growth capital on the environmental services business and we ve indicated that on other calls our money is going to be invested in growing that business and i d love in our vision two to three years out is for this going to be 80 es and 20 oil or as low as we can make it but have the ability to market out in the field the way we do michael hoffman stifel analyst yes i get it it s a great business and you ve produced terrific results brian recatto president chief executive officer and director thank you mark devita chief financial officer thank you operator thank you operator instructions our next question will come from line of ryan merkel with william blair your line is now open ryan merkel william blair analyst hey guys good morning brian recatto president chief executive officer and director hi ryan mark devita chief financial officer hi ryan ryan merkel william blair analyst so i wanted to ask about the es business obviously seeing great momentum there brian i think you talked about high single digit growth was the outlook for 2019 brian recatto president chief executive officer and director yes ryan merkel william blair analyst can you just break that into pieces for us market growth price i think you mentioned acquisitions and then i expect you opened some new branches can you just walk through the pieces there mark devita chief financial officer yes let s go with the price first we had about in q4 again we implemented our price increase running if i remember a couple of our four week periods earlier than we typically do so we have a little more clarity now that i mean it wasn t the full quarter so it s still not fully in effect in the results that we printed but we ve got a little more of a glimpse and we ve had about 3 price overall in what we printed that is that usually is the mix the more mature businesses tend to have more price and that s exactly what happened this quarter and the less mature ones inaudible we re still trying to grow and take advantage of efficiencies integrate the businesses and there s cost to achieve synergies all sort of things so those have very little impact or basically almost on volume but if we look forward and we say well we re not fully baked in and we re going to do some work on some of those businesses i just mentioned that are still at early stage at least relatively for us we think we can get about five so the lion s share of the rest of that is probably 80 of the rest of that because the high single digit is going to be just a regular organic growth strategy and the remainder will be the new branches or new resources that we re going to have we look to add about five branches during the year and probably total headcounts and field base mostly sales resources is probably around 20 and those will be at various points in the year so just like it was in 2017 but it s a more aggressive plan than what we had in 2018 based on what brian already went through so hopefully that gives you a feel as to the pieces brian recatto president chief executive officer and director and the reason we feel like we could do five branches this year is we think that the job market is loosening up a little bit that s really why we slowed down the openings of branches in 2018 and we had trouble staffing our existing branches but we are seeing noticeable improvement and we ve certainly ramped up our recruiting department and as mark said we re looking at five branches most of those being in the western half of the us which is where we lag density we ll also open up another hub in the western half of the us to help reduce our logistics cost mark devita chief financial officer yes i would tell you that i ll echo brian s comment if there was any risk we didn t add as many head as we wanted to last year and that was the reason so we have reacted made some changes and we do have some tailwinds probably the last quarter maybe quarter and a half brian recatto president chief executive officer and director yeah i agree mark devita chief financial officer to get a little better and our number of openings decreased so we think we have momentum in that area but that s why we feel confident if we weren t able to add as much it would be because we couldn t find the right people ryan merkel william blair analyst okay that s really helpful and then moving to es margins again 2018 was great year you expect improvement can you just give us a range or how much expansion you re thinking just to help calibrate our models mark devita chief financial officer i think we re probably looking to add another year full number our full year number that brian gave probably in the range of another 150 basis points for year over year and you know better than anyone ryan you ve been covering us forever the q1 is we have a headwind 200 basis points to 300 basis points if you look at q1 versus the other quarter if you go back three four five years you see other than 17 when it was only a couple hundred you see the trend is pretty solid so well we wouldn t expect that increase versus the q4 print ph than q1 we should be able to at least do and probably improve upon what q1 was last year brian recatto president chief executive officer and director yes i agree ryan merkel william blair analyst okay perfect i m passing on thanks operator thank you there are no further questions in the queue at this time ladies and gentlemen thank you for your

chinese president xi jinping third from left walks with russian president vladimir putin third from right and other leaders as they arrive for a group photo during the belt and road forum outside beijing china may 15 2017 china has one of the biggest global development footprints in the world the only country with bigger official international finance flows is the united states still washington spent over four times more than beijing on official development assistance the lion s share of china s official money flows falls under other official finance and is mostly spent on loans for projects in infrastructure energy and communications these projects are part of the belt and road initiative bri china s main vehicle for spurring development both at home and abroad through infrastructure investments beijing aims to better connect china to other parts in the world and to increase trade along the road five years after president xi jinping announced his plans for the bri china has spent about 25 billion on related infrastructure projects but to what extent do recipient countries profit from these chinese investments at least eight countries are at particular risk of debt distress because of project lending associated with china s bri the center for global development cgd reported in march 2018 critics fear that china is using the loans to create dependency and gain political influence china s debt trap diplomacy some believe china engages in debt trap diplomacy through the bri ensnaring developing countries with debt dependence and then translating that dependence into geopolitical influence says paul haenle former u s government adviser and director at the carnegie tsinghua center summarizing much of the critique particular concerns around china s actions in sri lanka pakistan and malaysia are central in the debt trap debates china acquired 99 years of operating rights for the hambantota port in southern sri lanka after costs for the project spiraled out of control forcing colombo to give up control of the port in return for a chinese bailout haenle explains finding alternatives to payment when countries cannot afford to pay back their loans is not a new practice for china back in 2011 china reportedly wrote off tajikistan s debt in exchange for 1 158 square kilometers of disputed territory the cdg report says but last year the debt trap argument gained further credence after malaysian prime minister mahathir mohamed cancelled 23 billion in bri projects and warned china against falling prey to a new version of colonialism according to haenle some western nations were quick to play into this sentiment rex tillerson the u s secretary of state at the time warned against the chinese development approach in a speech at george mason university in virginia according to tillerson china s strategy encourages dependency using opaque contracts predatory loan practices and corrupt deals that mire nations in debt and undercut their sovereignty denying them long term self sustainable growth frans paul van der putten has been following china for 12 years now at clingendael a dutch international relations think tank he considers it unlikely that creating debt among its belt and road partners is a deliberate and thought through chinese strategy with the intention to swap debt for resources or diplomatic support later but beijing isn t doing much to prevent this from happening either this fits china s usual pragmatic approach according to van der putten it doesn t really matter whether those countries can pay back later because if they can t we ll find another way to benefit china is not afraid to use the debts as leverage and it deals with its debtors in an ad hoc and case by case manner china always wins with its idea of win win cooperation beijing always has something to gain from its funding as well if political leverage is merely a useful side effect what does china have to gain from the billions of dollars it spends on infrastructure abroad china s model of development is based on trade better infrastructure is meant to increase trade which spurs development the bri aims to connect and develop china s western regions but it also aims to develop other markets to its own advantage the west has reached its growth potential and is not going to buy more from china but africa with its large young and growing population is the continent with the real growth potential by spurring development in african countries china wants to develop and open up a new market on the continent moreover infrastructure development projects are an investment in a better relationship between the chinese government and the government of the recipient country van der putten explains by handing out the loan there is a diplomatic gain already because it tightens the ties with that particular country that is a gain for china that cannot be expressed in money what can be expressed in money is the work that china provides for its own construction companies through bri projects often chinese policy banks make money available for a particular project in a recipient country on the condition that chinese companies execute the project so for a large part the money flows from chinese policy banks to chinese construction companies van der putten explains the railroad is being built the highway is being built maybe it will never be used but those construction companies reached their goal filling the infrastructure gap still just because china benefits doesn t automatically mean the recipient country doesn t chinese infrastructure projects are filling a serious need the asian development bank estimates that asia alone needs about 26 trillion of investment in infrastructure until 2030 in order to sustain current growth rates according to the international monetary fund a lack of adequate infrastructure is one of the single biggest hurdles for growth and development in africa and latin america so according to haenle the bri s focus on developing infrastructure could bring about a clear win win situation there is nothing inherently wrong about infrastructure investment or promoting global connectivity in the developing world haenle argues there is a huge gap in the money that is needed for development and the money that is out there particularly in the infrastructure marina rudyak says rudyak has worked in development for years and is now finishing her ph d on chinese development cooperation at heidelberg university in germany multilateral institutions and current donors cannot fund all necessary development projects so there is still plenty of space for china besides the traditional donors it is not the question of american or chinese money eu or chinese money africa needs all of that van der putten explains that international development banks like the african development bank and the world bank have limited funds available this is not enough to finance all necessary infrastructure development western commercial banks cannot provide risky loans anymore since the economic crisis china s role is crucial here van der putten says not only is it an alternative source of financing it is also a really big one china s development banks such as the china development bank and the china exim bank make project financing available against normal tariffs this is not development aid van der putten emphasizes but it has some of its characteristics these are risky loans to developing countries meant to improve their infrastructure the china model of lending chinese money fills a gap in international infrastructure funding so why is it causing debt and debate for one thing most bri funding is based on state to state structures this can create challenges for sovereign debt with possible implications for bilateral ties usually loans are guided by standards determined by multilateral institutions like the world bank the international monetary fund or multilateral mechanisms like the paris club but china is not a member of the paris club so it doesn t need to inform members on its credit activities and it doesn t have to follow any standards without a guiding multilateral or other framework to define china s approach to debt sustainability problems we only have anecdotal evidence of ad hoc actions taken by china as the basis for characterizing the country s policy approach the cdg report concludes instead of universal standards china generally follows local laws when it lends for development projects scott morris explains morris is one of the authors of the cdg report on debt among bri countries this can mean high standards when local laws are strong and very low standards when laws are weak the difference with loans from institutions like the world bank is that these institutions assess local laws and will impose their own protections if local laws are too weak china leaves this responsibility with partner governments and follows whatever local laws say morris says china is also not as sensitive to debt sustainability issues such as that lending terms are not strictly aligned with the country s debt risks he adds to what extend recipient countries benefit from beijing s loans therefore strongly depends on their own standards price for beijing the debt problems among the bri countries also come at a price for china between 2000 and 2014 beijing spent 13 billion on actions relating to debt with debt rescheduling it mitigates risks by extending the terms on loans china also carries significant risk itself when lenders default on their loans according to morris although debt is essential for infrastructure investment morris says large amounts of debt carry significant risks and need to be carefully managed by lenders and borrowers most importantly the international critique is also creating a huge problem in china rudyak says the chinese general public is highly critical of chinese aid and chinese loans china is not getting its money back and the country is being criticized by the international community so why an increasing number of chinese ask doesn t beijing spend this money on the poor at home china and multilateral lending in a multilateral context china does work according to world bank standards the asian infrastructure investment bank aiib totally fits the rules set in the bretton woods system rudyak says if you look at the real work they are doing other than that it was founded or proposed by the chinese and that it sits in beijing next to all other chinese policy banks it s a normal boring multilateral bank the aiib channels a lot less money than china s other policy banks such as the china development bank or the china exim bank some critics argue that china wants to build a separate system next to the current dominant order or bretton woods institutions such as the world bank and the imf with its own policy banks beijing can circumvent the current order and the standards and regulations that go hand in hand with it van der putten doesn t think china wants to replace the world bank when it comes to development funding and infrastructure funding china just uses all means available he says but beijing can use its growing lending clout to gain more influence in the world bank it is inevitable that china will also seek to have its global stature and influence commensurate to its relative power haenle says in institutions like the world bank beijing still doesn t have the level of influence it would like to have beijing is taking on greater leadership in the bretton woods institutions and united nations but also forging its own institutions that it believes are better adapted to the realities of today this view is shared more and more by other world leaders as well in calling for efforts to modernize institutions in order to reflect the current balance of power rather than create new ones german chancellor angela merkel indirectly spoke to china from our part of the world influenced by western values we should be ready to look at established institutions and see the balance of power realistically reflected with them she said at the world economic forum in january 2019 we have to accept new realities and reforms and a new approach that will address those who harbor doubts about the international system by setting up new institutions china does not want to upend the international order it wants to revitalize it haenle believes i have had one chinese friend compare beijing s view of the international system to that of temples they d like to build new temples repair old temples but they don t want to knock any temples down it wouldn t be logical for china to overturn the international system either as china has been one of the greatest beneficiaries of the global order over the past four decades intentions and politics the bretton woods institutions are a mirror of post 1945 and the world has changed rudyak says but now of course the problem with the reform is that many of the countries that want to have a bigger say are not liberal democracies morris and his co authors argue that beijing should multilateralize the bri in order to streamline china s increasing efforts in international development funding and minimize debt problems china has valued its engagement with the multilateral institutions and as a result it s an influential relationship i think these institutions stand the greatest chance of convincing and helping china to improve its project and lending standards according to morris china s recent step to open a joint capacity development center with the imf to train experts on policy and economics so countries can better decide whether to take up loans is therefore an encouraging move the fact is that china has a lot of development knowledge to share from going to poverty to being where china is now is something none of us in the west did in the same way and on the same time scale rudyak argues criticism of china is often based on its political system this is not to say that there is nothing there to criticize about the political system but inside this system there are many people who are genuinely passionate about what they do and who really want to share their knowledge with the world instead of blanket criticisms of debt trap diplomacy we should better deconstruct what specific projects are going wrong or right and why the reason is not that simple because the party wants it rudyak says when we only talk about the party we are

published wednesday 6 march 2019 print disqus the 22 trillion official national debt is a much discussed problem even as politicians exhibit zero motivation to do anything about it but as big an economic overhang as it is government debt isn t likely to trigger the next financial crisis yes servicing the growing federal debt bubble will depress gdp growth cause the value of the dollar to drop and raise inflation risks but the bubble itself won t necessarily burst not anytime soon as long as politicians face no political consequences for deficit spending and as long as the federal reserve keeps the treasury bond market propped up then many more trillions can be added to the national debt meanwhile more fragile debt bubbles exist in the private sector unlike government debt which carries the implicit backing of the fed s unlimited printing press debts incurred by corporations investors consumers and students can default globally there exists 250 trillion in debt against economic assets of around 100 trillion the notional value of all derivatives now approaches a quadrillion dollars it s been called the everything bubble and it could soon lead to the everything bust u s household debt rose to a record 13 5 trillion in the fourth quarter of 2018 mortgages student loans car loans and credit cards represent enormous burdens even during a good economy these burdens will prove unbearable for millions of americans in the years ahead for many the financial crisis is already here pending home sales have fallen on a year over year basis for 13 consecutive months farm loan delinquencies recently hit their highest level in 9 years more than 7 million americans are delinquent on their auto loan payments an all time record some 5 1 million people are in default on their student loans student loans now rank as the second largest biggest category of american consumer debt just behind mortgages the cruel reality is that many of these gender studies and art history type degrees will never be worth as much in the job market as they cost to obtain the main consequence of the government subsidized student loan bubble is to enable college tuitions and fees to rise at a much higher rate than salaries it s not that universities have had to raise costs to pay for top notch professors instead the biggest growth in university hiring has been for administrators and diversity indoctrinators who get fancy titles and plush salaries while providing little to no useful instruction it s just one example of how easy money and distorted government incentives lead to malinvestment another example of course is the stock market investors in search of returns have bid up stocks to bubble heights following years of artificially depressed interest rates big corporations have tried to manipulate their own share prices higher by engaging in leveraged stock buybacks even at lofty recent valuations warren buffett defended stock buybacks of berkshire hathaway in his latest letter to shareholders while noting such practices can be destructive if done regardless of value assuming that we buy at a discount to berkshire s intrinsic value which certainly will be our intention repurchases will benefit both those shareholders leaving the company and those who stay obviously repurchases should be price sensitive blindly buying an overpriced stock is value destructive a fact lost on many promotional or ever optimistic ceos a composite of equity leverage including margin accounts and leveraged exchange traded products shows total leverage at an all time

to bloomberg that represents an increase of more than 3 trillion over the last 10 years even more alarming around half of these investment grade bonds are just one tier away from being rated as junk

grade debt maturing billions source wells fargo securities bloomberg another potential bubble unwinding to come is in stock market index funds passively managed index funds have grown from 4 5 of total u s stock market assets in 2002 to 17 in 2018 the late john bogle founder of vanguard and index investing pioneer turned skeptical on the outsized growth of index funds prior to his death perhaps these vehicles had become too successful for its own good he said the fundamental problem is that index funds assume an underlying efficient market where securities analysis and market discovery takes place when the largest shareholders of all the blue chip stocks are index funds valuations can get distorted the share prices of bad companies can get artificially propped up during bull markets and during bear markets when scared investors are selling index funds solid companies can be unfairly marked down high frequency program trading has come to dominate stock picking and when the algorithms turn bearish on market trends they can all follow each other in triggering cascading sell orders the next stock market crash could initially bring down all markets including commodities but any threat of deflation will trigger a massive inflationary response from the federal reserve inflationary assets such as precious metals stand to benefit gold in particular will also

by jan mazza a research assistant at bruegel originally published at bruegel trade is war so reads the title of a book by yash tandon one need not endorse such a pessimistic view to acknowledge the far reaching strategic implications of trade relations between the us and china the two countries are currently negotiating on a wide set of issues without agreement the us threatens to raise tariffs on imports from china initially planned for march 1st and then indefinitely postponed by president trump in light of the substantial progress achieved the financial times reports that the final deal in the absence of last minute surprises should touch upon the most important issues affecting the sino american relationship first the enormous bilateral chinese trade surplus will be partially countervailed by beijing commitment to importing a number of us products in particular agricultural ones such as soybeans corn and wheat second chinese authorities would pledge greater protection of intellectual property rights so far one of the most acute points of contention between the two countries given the allegedly china led theft of us trade secrets and the well known transfer of technology necessary for american firms to operate in the chinese market third and relatedly china is expected to loosen regulatory requirements for foreign companies and to ease authorisations to international investments fourth the us demanded commitment from beijing to ensure renminbi s stability in order to prevent competitive currency devaluations that would further worsen us trade deficit vis a vis china in exchange tariffs on chinese exports would not be increased as planned and the charges against huawei and its chief financial officer meng wanzhou might be dropped as an unofficial part of the deal the importance of the agreement is underlined by the extent and variety of reactions which largely differ in identifying winners and key issues of the deal is trump about to fix a long lasting asymmetry in international trade or is the deal a pyrrhic victory that only allows the president to claim success on a couple of campaign promises without addressing the roots of american structural imbalances is the deal asymbolic triumph of the chinese way of managing political and economic developments or slowing growth prospects are legitimately worrying the chinese communist establishment threatened by mounting discontent michael schuman on bloomberg argues that the overall outcome is favorable to chinese interests while it undermines long term us credibility in fact chinese concessions are limited and in line with beijing s plans such as reducing the deficit or improving the protection of intellectual property rights in exchange the united states counteracts its own interests in three related ways first by incentivising state led solutions instead of pushing for greater space for market forces second by affecting the reputation of its judicial system whose decisions should not be informed by political and economic considerations third by jeopardising its credibility in future negotiations which will soon be needed given the fragility of the expected agreement the contrast between trump s short term political gain and durable geopolitical risks arising from the deal is also at the centre of paul krugman s opinion piece which warns about the consequences on the trade conflict with the eu the latter in contrast with china is not able to force its resident private companies to pursue political goals this implies that autocracies have a relative advantage when dealing with president trump compared to countries respecting the rule of law the outsized relevance of the president s personality and desire for tweetable deliveries in the context of trade negotiations therefore has a troubling impact on us foreign policy many commentators focus on the relative importance of the part of the deal devoted to currency issues colby smith on ft alphaville highlights the importance of deciphering what a stable renminbi as demanded in the deal actually means stability indeed could be in real or nominal terms against the dollar or a basket of currencies with very different implications in fact the bank of china already keeps the chinese currency within a fairly restricted band and even more tightly since september however stable might also mean strong and the deal could accordingly require china to keep the yuan below 7 0 per dollar it is unclear though why china should willingly let the us set its exchange rate in particular when the economy is slowing and appropriate monetary policy would probably weaken the value of its currency according to brad setser a commitment to a stronger renminbi is an essential part of any deal aimed at reducing us trade deficit with china further depreciation cannot be an option on the table of chinese authorities for the agreement to be credible as a weaker yuan would further reinforce the existing dynamic which makes us imports from china relatively cheaper and us exports to china relatively pricier mark sobel endorses a similar viewpoint a chapter on currency stability is a key part of a trade deal however such a chapter must solve several critical issues first a deal can be advisory or binding the us administration also in light of the record of past non binding commitments from the chinese authorities should require more than agreement on mere guidelines accordingly china and the us have to agree on ways to enforce such agreement second as mentioned above the policy translation of currency stability has to be clarified along with the admissible range of fluctuation for the renminbi dollar rate there should also be specific provisions in case a depreciating renminbi were the sole result of american monetary or fiscal policy decisions what about the relative bargaining position of the two economic superpowers views on the distribution of strengths and weaknesses between america and china also differ according to stephen s roach the american negotiating team has underestimated china s resilience true growth is slower than in the past but i this is not due to american actions on trade and ii beijing still has ample political and economic space at its disposal to pursue its long term development strategy differently from washington while exports to the us fell by 3 on an annual basis in december and january exports to the rest of the world continued to expand lower reserve requirements for chinese banks will also foster credit growth and investment which is already much higher than in the us 44 versus 21 of gdp despite the fact that american capital stock is older and in greater need of replacement furthermore current us growth rates are mostly driven by short term factors such as tax cuts whose positive effect will shortly fade away exposing the structural weaknesses of the american economy and its trade deficit vis a vis more than 100 countries beside china this last point is also highlighted by martin feldstein the american trade deficit is not limited to transactions with china although it represented two thirds of the total in 2017 and even if china wisely agreed to reduce its current bilateral surplus by increasing its purchases of us products this would merely shift the distribution of an overall unchanged us trade deficit on top of that the critical issue between the two countries is not their trade imbalance but the forced technology transfer from american to chinese companies in spite of xi jinping s reassurances to former us president barack obama in 2015 addressing this long lasting breach of wto rules should represent the top priority for the american administration some reports however convey a substantially different picture of china s strength and stability president xi jinping recently summoned hundreds of communist officials to warn them about the risks faced by the people s republic of china and to demand their engagement in preventing the unfolding of social unrest economic concerns are not limited to the consequences of the trade war as they include rising local debt and the pursuit of incompatible goals such as ensuring high and stable employment while deleveraging and tackling inefficient businesses as a consequence security and policing have become a prominent feature of chinese policy directives this fear is also due to 2019 s peculiar density in the chinese symbolic calendar a century ago patriotic student protests took place on may 4th thirty years ago the iconic demonstrations in tiananmen square started at the beginning of june representing the biggest challenge ever to the communist regime mao zedong is believed to have once said there is great chaos under heaven the situation is excellent seventy years after founding the people s republic of china no doubt he would appreciate the efforts of presidents trump and xi to celebrate the solemn anniversary according to his taste

home world business tariff man trump to preside over 100 billion jump in trade gap march 6th 2019 09 02 am 333 views united states of america president donald trump the self proclaimed tariff man is set to become the 100 billion man if the trends of the past year and economists expectations hold true trade data to be released wednesday will show the u s s deficit in goods and services with the world topped 600 billion in 2018 that means trump s presidency will have seen the u s trade shortfall the main metric by which he judges countries to be winning or losing grow by more than 100 billion put another way by trump s own benchmark the u s is 20 percent worse off than it was at the end of 2016 just before he took office economists don t like to dwell too much on the u s trade balance it is by and large an accounting measure that often moves in directions inverse to the health of the economy the u s trade deficit s biggest contraction on record came in 2009 when it shrank by more than 300 billion in a single year as a result of the recession then under way and the resulting collapse in u s demand for imported goods as a result largely of that slump the u s s goods and services deficit with the world contracted by more than 200 billion over president barack obama s eight years in office this is a major reason why economists say you really don t want this as your scorecard said phil levy a former senior economist for trade with president george w bush s council of economic advisers it s not an accident when things are booming we consume more imports despite the name trade deficits tend to have less to do with trade policy than broader macroeconomic policy the main long term driver of persistent trade deficits since 1975 has been the gap between the u s s low savings rate and its attractiveness as an investment destination fueled partly by the dollar s role as the world s reserve currency that in turn leads to a stronger dollar which in itself helps increase the trade deficit by lowering the real cost of imports and increasing the local currency cost of american goods in overseas markets in the first 11 months of 2018 the u s deficit in goods and services with the world increased 52 billion or about 10 percent from the same period in 2017 if that pattern holds in the december data released wednesday and economists surveyed by bloomberg predict it will the deficit will have widened to about 610 billion in 2018 in 2016 it was 502 billion the immediate drivers of the surge in the trade deficit under trump have been the fiscal expansion resulting from the tax cuts he pushed through congress and the stronger dollar that resulted partly from the juiced economy that expansion helped create trump s supporters insist he s tackling that via his trade negotiations with china and other u s trading partners they also point to his renegotiation of nafta as something that will help reduce the u s trade deficit in the long run but trump s trade policy also contributed materially to the growth of the trade deficit in 2018 the tariffs he threatened and then imposed on chinese imports caused a rush by importers to get ahead of the new duties that fueled an increase in incoming traffic at west coast ports last year the retaliatory tariffs trump provoked from china also hit major u s agricultural exports such as soybeans moreover his attacks and threats to impose tariffs on trading partners from china to the european union has also contributed to the slowdown in those economies and therefore their demand for american goods trump and his supporters have cast the blame in part on the federal reserve arguing that its decisions to hike rates last year contributed to the strengthening of the dollar trump has complained that a stronger dollar has weakened his hand in his trade wars and put a damper on u s growth but advocates of a stronger u s currency policy argue that trump himself carries plenty of blame robert scott senior economist at the left leaning economic policy institute said trump s failure to tackle what he sees as a global misalignment in currencies that requires a depreciation of the dollar has been the main cause of a rising trade deficit even trump s attempts to deal with currency issues in trade negotiations with china or his public complaints about a strong dollar seem unlikely to change anything the strong dollar matters because it has led to near record deficits in manufactured goods and non oil goods that are being masked by increases in exports of oil and services scott said to his mind that means the u s s trade balance is worse than even the official data reflects there s a lot going on below the surface here he said source courtesy of bloomberg by shawn donnan if you have any stories or news that you would like to share with the global online community please feel free to share it with us by contacting us directly at

counterweight to falling house price rba governor philip lowe said in a speech that nationwide housing prices have fallen by 9 since peaking in 2017 bringing them back to level in mid 2016 he noted that declines of this magnitude are unusual but they are no unprecedented movement in house prices would influence consumer spending building activity access to finance by small businesses and profitability of financial institutions though labor market is expected to continue to tighten with gradual increase in wage growth and faster income growth that should provide a counterweight to the effect on spending of lower housing prices and overall lowe said the adjustment in our housing market is manageable for the overall economy it is unlikely to derail our economic expansion it will also have some positive side effects by making housing more affordable for many people on monetary policy lowe also noted that a strong labour market is the central ingredient in the expected pick up in inflation wag growth would boost household income and spending and provide a counterweight to the fall in housing price and a lot depends upon the labour market rba will continue to assess the shifts in the global economy trends in household spending and how the tension between the labour market and output indicators resolves itself lowe also reiterated that the probabilities for the next move to go up or down are reasonably evenly balanced boj harada should strengthen monetary easing without delay if economy deteriorates boj board member yutaka harada warned that the economy is facing increasing risks including slowdown in china trade tensions and weak private consumptions also subdued inflation could reinforce the public view of low inflation which would delay the achievement of the 2 target he urged that if the economy deteriorates to the extent that achieving the inflation target in the long term becomes difficult it s necessary to strengthen monetary easing without delay for now harada said boj should commit to loose monetary policy unless prices show stronger movements than currently anticipated and the conduct of monetary policy should be data dependent not calendar based he also warned that past episodes of premature monetary tightening worsened the economy driven down prices and output and led to declines in interest rates in the longer term oecd lowers global

note this is an update to a post i wrote in 2015 it was almost 9 years ago that we started discussing the turnaround for apartments then in january 2011 i attended the nmhc apartment strategies conference in palm springs and the atmosphere was very positive the drivers in 2011 were 1 very low new supply for apartments and 2 strong demand both favorable demographics and people moving from owning to renting the move from owning to renting is over and demographics for apartments are much less favorable than 8 years ago also much more supply has come online slowing demand and more supply for apartments is why multi family starts have slowed recently multi family starts probably peaked in 2015 multi family starts by year year 5 units 000s 2005 311 4 2006 292 8 2007 277 3 2008 266 0 2009 97 3 2010 104 3 2011 167 3 2012 233 9 2013 293 7 2014 341 7 2015 385 8 2016 380 8 2017 342 7 2018 359 7 click on graph for larger image on demographics a large cohort had been moving into the 20 to 29 year old age group a key age group for renters going forward a large cohort is moving into the 30 to 39 age group a key for ownership note household formation would be a better measure than population but reliable data for households is released with a long lag note this graph is updated using the vintage 2017 estimates this graph shows the longer term trend for three key age groups 20 to 29 25 to 34 and 30 to 39 the groups overlap this graph is from 1990 to 2060 all data from bls current to 2060 is projected we can see the surge in the 20 to 29 age group red once this group exceeded the peak in earlier periods there was an increase in apartment construction this age group peaked in 2018 2019 until the 2030s and the 25 to 34 age group orange dashed will peak around 2023 this suggests demand for apartments will soften somewhat for buying the 30 to 39 age group blue is important note see demographics and behavior for some reasons for changing behavior the population in this age group is increasing and will increase significantly over the next decade this demographics is now positive for home buying and this is a key reason i expect single family housing starts to continue to increase

northjersey lieutenant governor oliver senate president sweeney speaker coughlin majority leaders weinberg and greenwald minority leaders kean and bramnick and members of the 218th legislature former governors chief justice rabner judge grant members of the cabinet faith leaders honored guests friends and fellow new jerseyans our license plates say new jersey the garden state but even more than that new jersey is the middle class state we are all in this together and coming together is how we succeed so today i am presenting a budget that is a blueprint for how we continue to build a more secure and inclusive middle class in new jersey this budget is how we make real the promise of a stronger and fairer state that works for every family and it builds on the progress we have already made together we are paving the way for countless families like the family i grew up in who want nothing more than to move into the middle class and we are smoothing the path for those already there together just a month ago we put our state on a path to a 15 an hour minimum wage this path is the on ramp that more than one million new jerseyans will use to ultimately move into the middle class the economic activity they will power will make those already in the middle class more secure watch live phil murphy unveils nj budget nj tax increase coming phil murphy plans second push to raise rates on millionaires it s here best of bergen 2019 results announced but it s about more than just economics the new york times said it best the 15 minimum wage doesn t just improve lives it saves them it goes further a living wage is an antidepressant it is a sleep aid a diet a stress reliever it is a contraceptive preventing teenage pregnancy it prevents premature death it shields children from neglect if anyone in this chamber ever questions whether what we do matters simply think of the families striving to join the middle class those whose paths have been blocked because of a yawning racial wealth gap and the alice families working hard but falling behind and then look to this achievement or to this one two weeks ago we expanded paid family leave to make an even greater difference for families who need time off from work to welcome a new baby or care for a sick loved one and one week ago today workers who had never before had the ability to take a paid sick day finally began to enjoy this basic benefit so many of us take for granted together we are beginning to properly fund our public schools strengthening a public education engine that is the foundation for the middle class and at the same time providing much needed property tax relief together we are fundamentally redefining public education with greater access to pre k and by beginning to make community college tuition free these are landmark achievements in strengthening the middle class and making new jersey a national leader together we are making health insurance more affordable and finally funding planned parenthood steps that take some of the edge off the high costs of health care together we are rebuilding nj transit directly benefiting everyone who commutes to work and school and making our state more competitive together we are making real differences in the everyday lives of millions of people together we are making new jersey stronger and fairer for all of this i thank you but we must be clear where this journey started this administration and this legislature inherited a state hollowed out by eight years of wrong headed and short sighted decisions it was eight years of shutting out middle class new jersey families and shutting the door on those struggling to get there new jersey lagged the nation in economic growth and in creating jobs eleven credit downgrades drove up costs and pushed down our reputation critical infrastructure projects were abandoned nj transit was gutted and commuters were literally left behind public schools and pensions were underfunded year after year again and again new jersey s middle class paid the price of course we heard the word affordability a lot over those eight years but as with so many things over those years the rhetoric and the reality didn t connect affordability was only defined in narrow partisan terms for eight long years the politics of division failed new jersey just as the politics of division are today failing our nation today in new jersey we are climbing our way out of a deep hole but in new jersey we don t give up we just work harder so together let s get to work in this budget affordability is about the smart and honest investment of our resources where they will do the most good where they can create broad opportunity for many as opposed to just rewarding a privileged few where they can rebuild our middle class rather than milk it and affordability is about being good stewards of every taxpayer dollar and working together to find savings that no one had thought possible that is why this budget is rooted in over 1 1 billion in real and sustainable savings including nearly 800 million in public employee health benefit cost savings and another 200 million plus in departmental savings you heard that number right over 1 1 billion in real and sustainable savings much of these significant savings were achieved through cooperation with our public employees rather than through confrontation these savings were achieved through the power of working together these savings will allow us to take the steps we need to move new jersey forward growing up in our family the only way we could spend money is if we saved money i know a lot of new jerseyans understand that of course no one especially not me questions that taxes are a big piece in new jersey s affordability puzzle that is why slowing the growth of property taxes to a record low matters that is why our expansion of the earned income tax credit matters that is why restoring the homestead property tax benefit matters that is why tax fairness for middle class families seniors and small and medium sized businesses matters this budget continues us down this path but growing our economy and investing in the things that will make life better for our middle class and those who aspire to join it are equally important each of us came here to make things better to meet our responsibilities and to serve our constituents this is a chamber filled with good people with good intentions yet here we are paying the price for past years of pushing problems down a broken road that is why this blueprint for the middle class matters this budget is built upon four elements one doing the hard work to realize over 1 1 billion in sustainable savings two stabilizing new jersey s credit worthiness through responsible fiscal stewardship three maintaining and growing our investments in education infrastructure in particular nj transit and an innovation driven economy that reaches deep into every neighborhood four ensuring tax fairness for our middle class we must remember that each number we write into the budget is a face the face of one of millions of new jerseyans looking to us to put aside our differences to overcome our challenges several of these faces are here with us today guests of the lieutenant governor and the first lady they are committed to being part of a better future and they are the people this budget invests in among them are tawana watkins of east orange who is part of the new class of nj transit engineers and who will play a big part in once again making nj transit the envy of the nation lindenwold s aurelio sotelo is a finance student at rutgers camden thanks in part to the educational opportunity fund because of the eof aurelio is well on his way to achieving his dream of owning his own clothing company and stacey barrio lothrop and jans heinsohn of carbon22 an innovative medical device manufacturer which is taking root at the kearny point incubator space carbon22 is also the very first company to take advantage of the investment we are making in our startup culture through nj ignite the eda s collaborative workspace rent initiative in our work to reclaim our dominance in the innovation economy people like stacey and jans and companies like carbon22 will lead the charge their faces those of the other special guests with us today and the millions of others like them across our state are why the most important investment in this budget is in the middle class and in those who dream to join its ranks we are as committed to them as we are to our principles but as i have said before we can compromise on policy without compromising either our principles or our commitment to our people i understand the budget i am proposing today will not be identical to the one i will ultimately sign we will talk we will negotiate and we will compromise that is as it should be that is how our system works best we will have to make hard choices but that is different from false choices we need to be stronger and fairer we can t have economic progress without social progress and we can t have social progress without economic progress because when we remember that success and fairness are not mutually exclusive we can do big things last year our administration worked with our public employees to strike an agreement that is saving state and local taxpayers 500 million across two years while protecting the health care of the men and women of state and local government our educators and our police fire and ems first responders but that was not an end it was just a beginning and our conversations never stopped we continued to present new ideas to hear theirs and to talk as partners instead of as adversaries negotiations and progress flow from mutual trust they go nowhere when there is only mutual suspicion that s the old way that s the failed way and those days are over in total our budget contains roughly 800 million in real and lasting savings in the delivery of public employee health care in the coming fiscal year a 16 percent year over year decrease from the current budget importantly the reforms we have agreed upon and those we continue to work toward in good faith will allow our taxpayers to keep hundreds of millions of dollars in their pockets their impact on local and school budgets is also expected to deliver more than 400 million in property tax relief and it will save money for those who serve our state our communities and our schools while maintaining the high quality health care they deserve it will make new jersey more affordable across the board half of these savings we will be able to implement administratively while others will be realized through collective bargaining and the work of the plan design committees that craft the policies available to our public workforce our public workers are not the enemy they are our neighbors they are also taxpayers they are the heart of our middle class it is not pandering to stand with them it is doing our jobs we accomplished this with the same mindset in which we worked to save residents an average of more than nine percent on individual health care policies by protecting the affordable care act the aim isn t to offer lesser care it s to provide high quality care at a lower cost and we are doing that we are doing it without yelling threatening or calling people names and i will continue to work in partnership and in good faith with our partners in the public workforce on ways we can collectively ensure greater progress and greater relief for our taxpayers as i mentioned we have also identified another 200 million plus in departmental savings opportunities throughout the budget which we will apply this year i thank treasurer liz muoio and her team for their hard work work that has added up to over 1 1 billion in savings by anybody s standard over 1 1 billion in sustainable savings is real and substantial i also thank human services commissioner carole johnson for her knowledgeable leadership in finding an additional quarter of a billion dollars in recoverable medicaid funds plus millions more in other efficiencies that will allow us to maximize our federal dollars while protecting beneficiaries we are building a stronger fiscal house for new jersey we are replacing gimmicks with stability for example the projected surplus of the budget i signed last year was 765 million a vast improvement over prior budgets but through careful management and keeping an eye on every dollar we have grown our surplus by one third over the year and are now set to close fiscal 2019 with a surplus of over 1 billion this budget will grow our surplus even more in fiscal 2020 to nearly 1 2 billion i ask you to find the last time we had consecutive years of billion dollar plus surpluses last year i proposed a budget that significantly cut back on the use of one shots and this budget once again maintains that example one shot revenues are down to only 1 7 percent a decrease of one third over the current budget and half the average yearly amount across the prior administration and in this budget we are significantly curtailing fund diversions we are eliminating entirely the diversion from the affordable housing trust fund so lieutenant governor oliver and her team at dca can do more to ensure the accessibility of safe and affordable housing and through the clean energy fund we will put more than 70 million back to work to make critical investments in our clean energy economy this shows how far we have already come in fixing the structural problems that years of past fiscal decisions had created and we know there s still work to do especially with our surplus we must remain vigilant to safeguard these funds and not to view them as just extra cash laying around to be raided for any number of programs or projects no matter how well intentioned reducing our reliance on one shots and diversions means greater year over year fiscal predictability and reliability but the real value is that they allow us to make the investments we need to make new jersey a stronger and fairer state for every family and reaching these fiscal mileposts will not go unnoticed by the rating agencies with whom i will visit later this week and whose decisions greatly impact our future sustainability because with a more sustainable fiscal future we can make more sustainable investments in our future last year we began the process of finally fulfilling our obligations to our public schools increasing our investment in k through 12 classrooms by more than 350 million let there be no doubt this investment is one reason why 2018 saw the lowest increase in the average statewide property tax bill not just in the last nine years but on record and the work to modernize our formula to meet the on the ground needs of districts today led by senate president sweeney is ensuring that school funding dollars are more efficiently and effectively following our children we also increased investment in high quality pre k programs today in 64 additional school districts more than 4 400 three and four year olds now have access to pre k they lacked just one year ago this budget maintains this commitment to our kids and our public schools starting with an additional 206 million to ramp up to the full k through 12 formula funding there is 68 million more to not only maintain but to expand pre k these commitments mean we can continue to be a national leader in the delivery of high quality public education and our budget continues our computer science for all initiative this gives more high school students especially minority students access to an advanced computer science course so they can earn college credits and industry credentials and go on to increase the diversity of our innovation economy our budget includes 5 million more for tuition aid grants and an additional 2 25 million to support the educational opportunity fund this is the 50th year in which accomplished students like aurelio are benefitting from eof it is the greatest legislative legacy of former governor tom kean who sponsored the original bill let s ensure it continues to write new chapters for our students last year we inaugurated a grant program that in concert with eof and tag and other available aid is helping 13 000 qualified students to pursue an associate s degree tuition free at one of 13 community colleges this budget will grow our investment in community college opportunity grants to reach a total of 18 000 students in the 2019 2020 academic year at every community college and more of them will be pursuing a degree full time and our budget looks to a new way to help our four year public colleges and universities we propose 20 million in new formula driven aid based on what is needed to ensure the best outcomes for all students and reflect the diversity of our state this is a first step in funding higher education through fairness and not politics it is part of the broader state plan which higher education secretary zakiya smith ellis will be releasing in the near future last year we enhanced and refocused our investment in workforce development and apprenticeship programs we awarded grants expanding opportunities for thousands more to learn and master the skills that will lead them into good paying family supporting careers this budget continues this commitment our blueprint for the middle class through its investments in education and workforce development will continue to make a more competitive and more affordable new jersey in our current budget we restored direct property tax relief to thousands of middle class families who were cut off by the prior administration i thank speaker coughlin for leading the fight to restore this relief and this budget maintains our commitment with 283 million in direct property tax relief for our middle class families and seniors in a state with an unmatched location and a regional economy built on moving people and goods there is no higher priority than fixing nj transit we owe our commuters a transportation system that makes their lives smoother rather than harder they deserve a system that is safer more reliable and customer oriented our current budget began the long process of turning around an agency that had been hollowed out by years of disinvestment and mismanagement leaving customers as second class citizens and hurting our economic well being last year commuters were spared a fare hike and if we pass this budget s investment there won t be one this year either through our current investment nj transit has moved ahead with procurement of new rail cars and buses to build capacity and relieve overcrowding we are rebuilding the gutted ranks of rail engineers and bus operators needed to keep the lines running and i cannot wait to welcome our first class of new train engineers later this spring because of our investment nj transit was able to push forward to meet the federal government s december 31 2018 deadline on positive train control a feat almost no one outside our administration and i mean almost no one thought possible on friday i signed legislation that expands a commuter tax cut allowing more commuters to directly benefit from pre tax savings accounts to pay for their rail or bus fares this can keep hundreds of extra dollars a year in their pockets nj transit has also reached agreement with amtrak on millions of dollars worth of back payments they are now working together on joint investments in infrastructure and renovations at new york penn station that will improve the customer experience this budget maintains all of this progress it will provide 407 million in general fund support to nj transit this 100 million increase will replace 75 million in fund diversions in addition to providing 25 million in new direct funding this keeps nj transit on the path to being the turnaround story of the nation it keeps rebuilding the ranks of professionals needed to keep our system running and most importantly it keeps improving service to our commuters it s this simple an investment in nj transit is a direct investment in our economy our business environment and our commuters it s an investment in hard working people like tawana and in the people she will take to and from work every day and we will responsibly invest in meeting our pension obligation and continuing the progress to bringing the pension funds back to health with a second straight record setting payment this year s totaling 3 8 billion our pension obligation like many of our challenges nj transit and school funding among others did not spring up overnight it grew because decisions made by both parties allowed it to grow i know this particular challenge well perhaps better than many i studied it in depth more than a decade ago when governor codey asked me to chair the first pension and benefits task force but the message our task force put forward nearly a decade and a half ago is just as true today we cannot look for quick outs or easy fixes because they simply don t exist it took us years to get to this point and it will take years of good faith efforts efforts that must include our public employees our educators and our first responders to successfully get past it and that is why we are making this record 3 8 billion pension contribution to keep our promises and to meet our fiscal challenges head on we must ensure that our commitment to affordable high quality health care and evidence based policymaking remains as strong as ever our current budget restored funding for planned parenthood and women s health care as a result of that investment over 10 000 more patients both women and men were served in 2018 compared to 2017 at the national level president trump and his administration are continuing their assault on title x putting the health of millions of women across the country at risk for starkly partisan and political reasons in new jersey we re showing the better way forward last year four clinics were added where residents could receive family planning services and an entirely new health clinic opened at rutgers newark patients gained access to 8 000 additional hours to receive vital services including potentially life saving cancer screenings more than 40 critical staffing roles were filled more than 80 000 std tests were provided free of charge and today more women have access to long acting birth control this budget maintains our commitment so we can continue to build upon this progress over the past year the first lady has taken on the growing racial disparity in maternal health alongside twelve of our commissioners leaders in our health care and faith communities legislators and many others i want to give a special shout out to health commissioner dr shereef elnahal children and families commissioner christine norbut beyer and human services commissioner carole johnson the facts are jarring new jersey ranks 45th in the nation yes 45th in maternal death rate nearly double the national average even worse 60 percent of new mothers who die because of complications from childbirth are women of color a black baby in new jersey is three times more likely to die in his or her first year of life than a white baby the widest racial disparity in the nation to combat this the first lady and our administration inaugurated the nurturenj campaign to raise awareness of our maternal and child mortality crisis and to develop a comprehensive interagency plan this budget will support these efforts to bring together more experts and residents in the search for lasting solutions and our budget will provide 1 million through our medicaid program for doulas who play a critical role in reversing these statistics medicaid covers 40 percent of all childbirths in new jersey and these babies deserve a chance as much as any other these babies are far from the only vulnerable new jerseyans this budget seeks to help while we will maintain our commitment to emergency aid for homeless residents this budget also recognizes that money alone is not an answer to this vexing problem we ll take a broader approach through the creation of an office of homelessness initiatives in the department of community affairs to act as a hub for more strategic and coordinated efforts where we use data and analytics to create and implement solutions to address people s housing needs especially among our veterans from prevention to emergencies to permanency and our budget will provide critical resources to allow individuals with both developmental disabilities and mental health challenges to thrive in their communities in addition we will do more to alleviate the costs pushed onto our medicaid system by large employers who leave workers to rely on medicaid instead of offering a health care plan this budget will ask employers with 50 or more employees on medicaid to pay a small corporate responsibility fee of 150 for each one of these employees they should share in the burden of paying for their employees care rather than leaving it to the rest of us and our budget will maintain our commitment to working families in other ways including continuing the child and dependent care tax credit we passed together last year which is benefitting more than 74 000 new jersey families we are continuing to support smart compassionate and just prisoner reentry efforts i commend governor mcgreevey and our faith based communities for all their great work on the front lines our budget this year will increase investments in programs proven to decrease rates of recidivism and will support the ability of incarcerated individuals to continue their education so they can find second chances when they come back to our communities in every respect we commit to reforming our criminal justice system for the better in our current budget we set aside 100 million to directly combat our opioid epidemic through carefully designed programs and thoughtful data driven analysis to put resources where they are most needed we are ever mindful that the opioid epidemic was ravaging our cities long before it made headlines this budget maintains our commitment and proposes increasing fees on opioid drug distributors and manufacturers to help support our fight against the opioid epidemic other states red and blue alike are taking similar steps let s join them let s send a clear message that we should be working together to end our national addiction to opioids not to continue feeding it as we look to building the new jersey of the future we must be mindful of our ability to continue these investments well into our future in my budget address one year ago i called for us to enact a new way in which we provide the tax incentives that help us attract and retain businesses i spoke directly to it in october when i released my economic master plan and i reiterated this call in my state of the state address seven weeks ago there are many opinions on our current system of open ended corporate tax breaks but here is a simple fact the potential impact of past corporate tax breaks on corporate business tax collection in the coming fiscal year surpasses 1 billion and it will remain over 1 billion annually for at least the next three fiscal years the simple fact is that we are currently obligated i repeat obligated to corporate tax breaks totaling 11 billion through at least fiscal year 2031 and lest we forget for all of these incentives before this administration took office new jersey was 42nd in job growth and 49th in wage growth while key investments in education and infrastructure like a tunnel under the hudson river never happened even under a capped program yes we would see some loss in corporate business tax revenues but it would be predictable and sustainable we can provide strategic incentives without hurting our ability to reinvest in the things that bolster our economy and help our businesses like education and property tax relief workforce development and nj transit that tunnel to new york would be nice too tax incentives transparent and accountable smartly devised and strategically deployed have a vital role to play in a focused economic growth plan they are a needed step in undertaking structural fiscal reform and restoring middle class affordability i am a pro growth progressive i want the world s biggest and best technology clean energy and life sciences companies to come and expand here but i am even more committed to the next generation being born and growing here reforming how we jumpstart job creation needs to be about both creating jobs and more wisely investing taxpayer money the companies dreaming of making it big in new jersey like carbon22 deserve our support we must be smart and strategic about how we encourage new startups and entrepreneurs about how we nurture more businesses owned by women by persons of color and by veterans and about how we lead the world in clean energy solutions like offshore wind we can reclaim and dominate all aspects of the innovation economy that s why we need innovative incentive programs to be pro business in the 21st century you need to be agile and creative just like the businesses we want to grow our current programs expire june 30 along with the current budget i ask you to join me now with renewed purpose in creating the new suite of smart focused and capped incentive programs we need to boost our people and our economy without compromising our ability to invest in our people and our economy we can do this on a parallel track as we work on our final budget and we can enact them together in fact we must because together we enacted a responsibly balanced budget that invests in our people and our infrastructure and which stands for fairness for our middle class new jersey s priorities stand proudly in contrast with those of president trump and his administration right now across the state countless middle class families are doing their taxes and wondering where the tax cuts they were promised by president trump and his enablers went many barely felt the impact in their take home pay and now they re getting less back in their refunds many others because of their now limited state and local tax deduction are actually paying more our new congressional delegation along with those from our neighboring states democrats and republicans alike announced legislation to restore the full middle class salt deduction by in part simply asking the wealthiest to go back to paying what they paid in 2017 i commend their efforts and give them my full support and ten days ago i joined with governors from other states adversely impacted by the salt cap to announce our concerted efforts to have it reversed but while those efforts are ongoing and while our middle class is trying to figure out where their tax relief went those at the very top are shouldering less and less of their fair share of the tax burden that s the opposite of tax fairness let s work together to apply the millionaire s tax to every millionaire by doing so we can do more to relieve the burden on middle class taxpayers and senior citizens who are taking it on the chin from the trump administration s tax scam let s be absolutely clear this is not a tax that will be paid by anyone in the middle class period full stop but it is revenue that is necessary to strengthen and expand the middle class as i have underscored we have done a great deal of work to save money 1 1 billion in this budget in order to address our fiscal challenges and we must have the same commitment to support the middle class and those aspiring to get there our taxpayers overwhelmingly support this across party lines and across the state we should listen to them and do this together and we know they also support our work to legalize and regulate adult use marijuana i thank senate president sweeney speaker coughlin and senator scutari for their partnership i know we re not across the finish line yet but we are closer than ever before most importantly this is the right step for eliminating decades old and persistent racial and social inequities but it is also our chance to create an entirely new state based industry with the potential to create thousands of good paying jobs expand opportunities for minority business owners and jumpstart billions of dollars in new economic activity i will only sign this if it expunges the records of those who have been put through our criminal justice system for prior marijuana offenses this is an unfinished item from last year s to do list let s commit to completing this effort together and i renew my call for us to increase the fees for gun licenses and handgun permits it was long past time we did this last year when we took so many steps to restore our standing as a national leader in gun safety and it s even more past time today our gun fees were set in 1966 when governor richard hughes worked in this building it s now 2019 it is actually cheaper to get a permit to purchase a handgun 2 than it is to get a dog license in many of our communities this is what s needed to support the efforts of attorney general gurbir grewal our state troopers and county and local law enforcement to fight crime and track gun violence and to combat the trafficking of illegal guns into our state in 2018 roughly 80 percent of guns used in the commission of a crime came from out of state as with our other efforts i know the people of new jersey will support us this budget isn t about getting us through the next year it s about putting ourselves on a trajectory to be that new jersey we want to be in ten years we all must be part of this no one should be pointing from the sidelines and leaving the hard work of governing to others we must all find ourselves with some dirt on our uniforms it was one of our greatest presidents teddy roosevelt who told us the credit goes to those actually in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood i am proud of everyone who over the course of this past year has joined me in rolling up their sleeves and jumping into the arena to help with the hard work of restoring new jersey senate president sweeney and assembly speaker coughlin many of you seated here in this chamber our cabinet and team led by lieutenant governor oliver elected officials all across our state mayors council members boards of education county officials faith leaders the men and women of organized labor first responders our active duty military and our veterans our lgbtq community business leaders educators communities of color countless advocates and the thousands of everyday new jerseyans i have met all across our state this really is about achieving big things by working together and i thank you this budget continues our work to invest in the single most consequential asset in new jersey our people this budget doubles down on the middle class and all those dreaming to get there just as my family was when i was growing up this budget is the blueprint for building this new jersey it is about value for our middle class it is about our middle class values we are the middle class state and when we listen to both the dreams and the concerns of our middle class families we can find the answers that help all of new jersey move forward because when people prosper new jersey prospers when families can move forward new jersey moves forward when seniors are more secure new jersey is more secure when we foster a better future for young people young people will build their future here when we open our doors to innovative new businesses those businesses will power our economy my vision for new jersey has never wavered we need to continue to build an economy that works from the middle class out and from the bottom up we need an economy that embraces the future but stays true to the values of rewarding hard work creating opportunity and providing the tools people need to succeed thank you may god continue to bless the great people and state of new jersey and the united states of america

the coalition has just doubled all government debt accumulated since federation in under six years alan austin reports australia s gross debt updated friday morning has just clicked over the magic number of 543 409 430 000 this is exactly double all debt accumulated by every government between federation and the 2013 election that s right the coalition has added more debt in five and a half years than all governments over the preceding 118 years the coalition has added more debt in five and a half years than all governments over the preceding 118 years there are three stories here the first relates to profound fiscal mismanagement the second concerns political hypocrisy and the third is about the performance of the mainstream media the latter is probably the lesson which most urgently needs to be learned and never forgotten a brief history australia had accumulated substantial public debt through the colonial period well before federation by 1901 this exceeded 194 million it kept increasing from there the well known chart illustrating federal government debt based on the excellent work of alan barnard shows soaring rises during world wars one and two and dramatic falls after the wars and after the intervening depression but in fact gross debt kept expanding gradually in pound value or dollar value after 1965 but decreased as a percentage of gross domestic product gdp so every government since federation except one has left more gross debt than it inherited this was not a problem while the quantum was below 25 per cent of gdp which it was from around 1960 onwards and provided interest rates were low debt became a pressing issue during the fraser years when gross debt doubled to almost 40 billion and interest payments soared from 893 million a year to more than 3 000 million following the hawke keating government s restructure of australia s economy debt was reduced each year from 1987 to 1991 from 67 2 billion to 48 4 billion soon after the early 1990s global recession required further borrowing which saw the debt increase again but when that recession eased the economy was set for further reductions which peter costello supervised through most of the howard period thus the howard government is the only one to have left less gross debt than they inherited bequeathing just 58 5 billion to kevin rudd in 2007 wayne swan continued to repay the debt in his first year as labor treasurer and got it down to a 17 year low of 52 4 billion by august 2008 shortly thereafter the devastating global financial crisis gfc whacked the world this forced all developed countries except norway to borrow heavily for stimulus spending to save their economies australia succeeded remarkably in averting recession widespread job losses and mass suicides and did so with relatively little debt whereas canada the uk germany the usa italy singapore spain and france all increased their gross debt above 80 per cent of gdp australia s ratio was just 16 8 per cent at the gfc s end in 2013 government failure in julia gillard s last full financial year 2012 13 total debt taken on was just 23 4 billion this was set to fall steadily thereafter before the 2013 election the heads of treasury and finance projected the budget to be in surplus in 2015 16 with debt to peak that year before declining the coalition then changed labor s settings on both revenue and expenditure and blew out the debt further and further in its first year the coalition added a thumping 62 1 billion that was followed in 2014 15 by 49 3 billion another 51 7 billion was borrowed in 2015 16 surpassed by a staggering 80 6 billion in 2016 17 by april 2017 the turnbull government had doubled the debt labor took under six years to accumulate through the worst global recession in 80 years 213 2 billion the coalition did this in just three years and seven months during a period of robust global recovery no pressing need for economic stimulus and no infrastructure investment or other benefits to show for it there was no excuse for this revenue plummeted since 2013 as the government allowed tax evasion to escalate the total of the debt accumulated is close to estimates of the total corporate tax uncollected global comparisons from 2013 onwards most well managed economies have been steadily repaying their debt germany s was reduced from 81 per cent to 63 9 per cent by 2017 the netherlands reduced theirs from 68 per cent to 58 7 per cent ireland s debt is down from 120 per cent to 68 per cent and iceland s has gone from 94 7 per cent to 42 3 per cent other countries now in surplus or balance and repaying the debt include new zealand sweden norway switzerland russia denmark greece czech republic malta hong kong luxembourg and singapore euro public debt 2010 17 in contrast since 2013 australia has expanded its debt from 16 8 per cent of gdp to 28 8 per cent that is the highest increase of all 36 wealthy member countries of the organisation for economic cooperation and development coalition hypocrisy the loudest and most oft repeated promises before the 2013 election were that the coalition would return the budget to surplus and reduce borrowings in his 2013 budget reply speech tony abbott was scathing about labor s skyrocketing debt he said it s a spiral deeper and deeper into debt which is now surging towards 400 billion even on the government s own figures abbott s promises were clear and specific the coalition had identified 50 billion of savings for an 11 billion improvement in the budget bottom line and a reduction of 30 billion in net debt so how do they get away with this this brings us to the third story line the craven mainstream media throughout the gillard years and the second brief rudd administration daily newspapers and tv news continually shrieked debt spiralling out of control and the budget in freefall and labor s debt time bomb the daily telegraph shouted in 2013 that julia gillard s gift to australia is massive and growing debt the fury continued day in day out in the courier mail the australian financial review the abc the herald sun online outlets and elsewhere the abc claimed the economy was the key issue in the 2013 election campaign and that the coalition s main line of attack on the economy is based on the mantra of debt and deficit that was when labor had added 23 4 billion in one year now in contrast after the coalition has added an average of 54 4 billion over its last three years not a peep from australia s spineless and mendacious mass media the conclusion seems inescapable economics reporters and their editors in the mainstream media are paid to conceal what is actually happening in the economy this is to maintain the myth that the coalition manages the economy better than labor and thereby maintain the tax regime so beneficial for the big corporations alan austin is a freelance journalist with interests in news media religious affairs and economic and social issues this article was published by michael west on the 2nd of march 2019

united states non gaap terms the company discloses several financial measures non gaap measures herein that do not have any standardized meaning prescribed under international financial reporting standards ifrs these financial measures include operating netback per boe funds flow from operations funds flow from operations per boe and free funds flow management uses these non gaap measures for its own performance measurement and to provide shareholders and investors with additional measurements of the company s efficiency and its ability to fund a portion of its future capital expenditures the company considers operating netbacks per boe to be a key measure as it demonstrates parex profitability relative to current commodity prices the following is a description of each component of the company s operating netback per boe and how it is determined oil and natural gas sales per boe is determined by sales revenue excluding risk management contracts less non cash oil revenue from overlifted ocensa pipeline volumes divided by total equivalent sales volume including purchased oil volumes royalties per boe is determined by dividing royalty expense by the total equivalent sales volume and excludes purchased oil volumes production expense per boe is determined by dividing production expense by total equivalent sales volume and excludes purchased oil volumes and transportation expense per boe is determined by dividing transportation expense by the total equivalent sales volumes including purchased oil volumes funds flow from operations per boe or funds flow netback per boe is a non gaap measure that includes all cash generated from operating activities and is calculated before changes in non cash working capital divided by produced oil and natural gas sales volumes free funds flow is determined by funds flow provided by operations less capital expenditures shareholders and investors should be cautioned that these measures should not be construed as an alternative to net income or other measures of financial performance as determined in accordance with ifrs parex method of calculating these measures may differ from other companies and accordingly they may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies please see the company s most recent management s discussion and analysis which is available at www sedar com for additional information about these financial measures oil gas matters advisory the reserves information summarized in this press release is from reports prepared by our independent reserves evaluator glj petroleum consultants ltd

there is no guarantee that the estimated reserves will be recovered actual crude oil reserves may eventually prove to be greater than or less than the estimates provided herein proved reserves are those reserves that can be estimated with a high degree of certainty to be recoverable it is likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the estimated proved reserves probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves it is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the sum of the estimated proved plus probable reserves the term boe means a barrel of oil equivalent on the basis of 6 mcf of natural gas to 1 barrel of oil bbl boe s may be misleading particularly if used in isolation a boe conversation ratio of 6 mcf 1 bbl is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead given the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6 mcf 1bbl utilizing a conversion ratio at 6 mcf 1 bbl may be misleading as an indication of value this press release contains a number of oil and gas metrics including finding development and acquisition costs fd a reserves replacement reserves additions and operating netbacks these oil and gas metrics have prepared by management and do not have standardized meanings or standard methods of calculation and therefore such measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies and should not be used to make comparisons such metrics have been included herein to provide readers with additional measures to evaluate the company s performance however such measures are not reliable indicators of the future performance of the company and future performance may not compare to the performance in previous periods and therefore such metric should not be unduly relied upon management uses these oil and gas metrics for its own performance measurements and to provide security holders with measures to compare the

chief executive officer mr brian recatto and the chief financial officer mr mark devita at this time i would like to turn the call over to brian recatto please go ahead sir brian recatto president chief executive officer and director thank you and welcome to everyone joining us this morning last night we issued our fourth quarter 2018 results our revenue for the fourth quarter increased 9 7 compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 to 127 1 million driven mainly by 15 growth in our environmental services segment mark will discuss our financial results in more detail in a moment i would like to talk specifically about our environmental services segment from a revenue standpoint i m excited by the fact that we again delivered strong double digit growth in the segment for the third straight quarter and recorded record es revenue of 85 9 million this result is especially gratifying considering our fourth quarter results did not include any large field services projects which boosted our revenues during the second and third quarter of this year this performance is a direct result of the approach used by our sales and service team to discover the true needs of our customers and then work hard to meet those requirements all of our service lines in this segment experienced growth on a year over year basis our revenue growth in 2018 was aided by the five new branches we added during 2017 as well as a sales and service resources we added throughout 2017 the cost incurred during 2018 associated with the new branches and resources added during 2017 was approximately 13 5 million from which we generated approximately 15 4 million in revenue during 2018 we implemented a less aggressive approach to adding new resources compared to 2017 in fiscal 2018 we incurred approximately 1 7 million in operating costs while generating approximately 1 7 million in revenue for the resources added during this year continued revenue growth and an increasing focus on cost containment during the last three quarters allowed us to improve operating margin percentage during the fourth quarter of 2018 to 27 3 during our third quarter earnings call we indicated that we expected to the reach this level on a seasonally adjusted basis by the first quarter of fiscal 2019 increasing operating margins to this level ahead of schedule was a nice achievement for us moving onto our oil business oil business revenue during the quarter was flat at 41 2 million compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 our base oil netback increased by 0 17 per gallon during the fourth quarter compared to last year but was down 0 19 per gallon compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2018 the decline in base oil netback was primarily driven by marketwide oversupply of light grade group ii base oil was developed in the second half of the fourth quarter as well as decline in crude oil price the price for bunker and related fuels followed crude downward during the second half of the fourth quarter the falling commodity prices allowed us to decrease our net pay for oil directly from generators by 0 03 per gallon and our cost of used oil feedstock purchase from third parties by 0 09 per gallon during the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter we may have been able to decrease our feedstock cost even more but for the fact that beginning in mid october high sulfur fuel oil began trading at a premium to wti crude high sulfur fuel oil continue to be priced at a premium to wti crude through the remainder of 2018 and this premium has increased further during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 this pricing relationship negatively impacts rerefiners relative to those who sell used oil into the rfo market so the price for rfo was often tied to the price for high sulfur bunker fuel in used oil collection we were able to partially offset the negative impact of lower base oil netbacks by increasing our oil collection route efficiency on a year over year basis for the third quarter in a row during the fourth quarter we increased our route efficiency by 4 6 compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 as we explained during our third quarter earnings conference call we incurred an 18 day construction shutdown of our rerefinery near the beginning of the fourth quarter as a result we incurred higher maintenance cost and lower rerefinery production which led to sub standard absorption of our fixed costs during the fourth quarter on the positive side we completed several equipment upgrades during this downtime which we expect will allow us to operate the rerefinery on a more consistent basis now and in the future overall 2018 was a year of great achievements in our environmental services business and a year in which we laid the foundation for a better future in our oil business segment as we look forward to 2019 we expect to face challenges in the near term and opportunities later in the year in the oil business segment and we see continued momentum in the environmental services segment in the oil business light grade group ii base oil is still in an oversupplied situation due to seasonality and the impact of lighter than normal refinery refinery turnaround activity during 2018 historically demand increases as the winter season nears its end assuming the same trend continues we would expect to see upward pricing pressure for base oil unfortunately this has not yet occurred and our current base oil netback is approximately 0 35 per gallon lower than our average from the fourth quarter of 2018 from a feedstock standpoint we re already back into a net charge for oil position and we continue to try to push our street price higher and that improvement from our average pay for oil during the fourth quarter to our current street price is over 0 20 per gallon we have discussed the expected impacts of imo 2020 regulation with our investors and analysts in the past and we continue to believe this initiative will improve both the feedstock and finished product portions of our spread while we anticipate seeing the effects from imo 2020 prior to the year end of 2019 we are not as not certain as the exact timing and magnitude of these impacts for now we will continue to work hard to operate the rerefinery efficiently and manage our spreads effectively from an environmental service segment perspective we continue to see momentum which we believe will support higher single digit organic growth during 2019 and we look to add to that by closing an additional acquisition opportunities from a profitability standpoint we expect to improve upon our performance in 2018 while we expect to see seasonal pressure on our operating margin during the first quarter of this year we anticipate full year operating margin for 2019 will improve upon the 25 6 operating margin we produced during fiscal 2018 mark will now walk us through our fourth quarter financial results in more detail mark devita chief financial officer thanks brian for the fourth quarter we recorded net income attributable to common shareholders of 2 5 million compared to 11 7 million in fourth quarter of 2017 for the year net income was 14 7 million compared to 28 1 million in fiscal 2017 on an adjusted basis net income for both fiscal 2018 and 17 was 16 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 we recorded diluted earnings per share of 0 11 compared to diluted earnings of 0 51 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017 our 2017 fourth quarter earnings included a one time adjustment of 0 27 per share as a result of the tax cuts and jobs act signed until late 2017 on adjusted basis fourth quarter 2018 diluted earnings per share was 0 12 compared to 0 26 a diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2017 on an annual basis 2018 adjusted diluted earnings per share was 0 68 compared to 0 70 a diluted share for fiscal 2017 please refer to our reconciliation of gaap to non gaap supporting schedules in our press release in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 environmental services revenues increased 11 2 million or 15 from 74 7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 to 85 9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 higher revenue was due to increased activity in all the segment s businesses most of the increase was due to higher volume in our antifreeze vacuum and field services businesses along with increases in volume and price in our containerized waste business and favorable pricing and mix in our parts cleaning business revenue growth during the quarter was due in part to acquisitions made earlier in the year if you remove the revenue attributable to those acquisitions our revenue growth rate would have been 11 6 for the fourth quarter compared to the year earlier quarter same branch sales growth was 13 2 in the fourth quarter compared to the fourth quarter a year ago if we remove acquisition related revenue which was integrated into existing branches during the year same branch sales growth would have been 10 7 in the fourth quarter of 2018 oil business revenues were flat at 41 2 million compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 mainly due to a planned extended shutdown at our rerefinery and the resulting negative impact on production partially offset by higher base oil netbacks oil business segment operating margin fell sharply to negative 7 1 in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 7 9 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 we sold 12 7 million gallons of base oil compared to 13 6 million gallons in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 we sold approximately 3 1 million gallons of rfo during the fourth quarter which was down 18 or 0 7 million gallon compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 turning now to income before corporate sg a expense oil business income before corporate sg a expense decreased 6 2 million in the fourth quarter from 3 3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 to negative 2 9 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 the decrease in income before corporate sg a was mainly due to higher maintenance and transportation expenses caused by the long shutdown an increase in the cost of used oil feedstock was only partially offset by higher selling prices for our oil business products compared to the year ago quarter which also negatively impacted our operating margin profit before corporate sg a expense in the environmental services segment was a record high at 23 4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 2018 excuse me which resulted in operating margin percentage of 27 3 which was relatively flat compared to the operating margin of 27 2 in the fourth quarter of 2017 even though our operating margin percentage was relatively flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 profit dollars before corporate sg a expense increased 3 1 million over the same period a year ago our overall corporate sg a expense as a percentage of revenue was 12 2 for the fourth quarter slightly lower than 12 7 of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017 mainly due to higher revenue and lower salaries and incentive compensation partially offset by the absence of a reduction in tax reserves which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2017 the company s effective income tax rate for 2018 was 26 6 compared to 17 3 in fiscal 2017 the difference in the effective tax rate is principally attributable to the impact on our deferred taxes as of december 30 2017 due to the reduction in the us federal corporate tax rate to 21 fourth quarter ebitda was 9 4 million compared to 14 2 million in the year ago quarter turning to the balance sheet cash on hand at the end of the quarter stood at 43 6 million compared to 41 9 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017 and total debt stood at 29 million compared to 28 7 million one year ago our cash flow from operation for fiscal 2018 was 30 million compared to 45 3 million in fiscal 2017 which included one time gains and awards of 11 8 million our continued goal is to use our excess cash to execute our growth strategy seeking additional acquisition opportunities as well as to pursue capital projects to help drive revenue growth and improve operational efficiency early in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 we closed on two tuck in acquisitions in the environmental services segment total annual revenue generated from these transactions is expected to be approximately 6 million ph we continue to look for acquisition targets to augment our organic growth initiatives finally i would like to take a moment to discuss the new leasing accounting standard asc 842 which we are required to implement beginning this year we are on less fee ph for approximately 1 400 items consisting primarily of buildings railcars trucks and trailers as of year end 2018 which means the implementation of this standard will have a material effect on our balance sheet based on the work we have performed to this point we believe the implementation of this new standard will result in new right of use assets and corresponding liabilities of between 59 million and 68 million being added to our balance sheet as of the first quarter of fiscal 2019 we believe the impact on our income statement from this implementation of the new accounting standard will be immaterial i want to thank everyone for their interest in heritage crystal clean now i will turn control the call over to our operator to begin the q a portion of the call questions and answers operator thank you sir operator instructions and our first question will come from luke junk with baird your line is now open luke junk baird analyst good morning guys brian recatto president chief executive officer and director good morning luke mark devita chief financial officer morning luke junk baird analyst so my first question is on the oil business and managing spreads and what i m wondering is how do you balance the two objectives of on one hand achieving a higher average charge for oil per gallon versus obviously the longer term drive toward getting more volumes onto your own trucks and improving your route efficiency brian recatto president chief executive officer and director yeah that s like the benefit that we re seeing right now in the marketplace is that overall the used motor oil market lengthened up in the back half of q4 so we re seeing pretty strong demand from third parties that want access to our rerefinery so what we re going to do luke is is try to focus on controlling our logistics costs we re going to expand our rfo program and in 2019 look for more local outlets for oil focus on our the lanes around our rerefinery to be aggressive and pursue direct volume in our plant and then augment that with third parties so if we re seeing reduced debt ph sitting in our routes we could park some trucks in 2019 to make sure that we achieve efficiency that s the most important thing for us to be efficient with the trucks we don t think we re going to have any trouble filling out the plant given the used motor oil in general is longer does that answer the question luke junk baird analyst yeah that s helpful and then just a follow up to that regarding the plant operations specifically in the upgrades that you made during the fourth quarter you mentioned in your prepared remarks we should expect more consistent operations could you just expand on that and maybe comment on some of the specific changes that we made brian recatto president chief executive officer and director yes we made quite a few changes obviously it was a pretty long 18 day shutdown we essentially if you guys remember we had issues with our i think i mentioned on one of the calls we had problems with our air cooler in the first quarter of 2018 we replaced that in 2019 and actually we had freezing problems within 2018 that performed extremely well in 2019 we just went through the probably the coldest weather obviously in the city we didn t have any issues with that piece of equipment then we also rebuilt the lower half of our vacuum tower we ve had historically some weak metallurgy in that vacuum tower we lined the bottom half of the vessel with a better metallurgy we also replaced some piping and valving in critical areas that we ve had issues with from a rotating equipment and metallurgical standpoint so we think those things will help tremendously and lastly we upgraded our if you remember we had made some technological advances in our vacuum tower to reduce the resin carryover into our catalyst guard beds we improved upon that system during q4 which will give us more extended life in our catalyst performance and our guard beds which will lower our overall cost structure in 2019 so all in all it was a great turnaround for us a lot of hard work went into and our guys did a great job with the construction project we had no incidents during the construction and so far in 2019 the plant s been running well luke junk baird analyst okay and if i could just sneak in a really question with that end mark do you by chance have just the cost impact of the shutdown in terms of the profit before corporate items in the oil business is there a dire ph amount that you could splice up for the maintenance costs and higher transportation cost specifically relating to the shutdown mark devita chief financial officer well i ll let you do the math i ll give you a kind of the if we compare our margin year over year for q4 we printed the negative 7 1 in year earlier almost 8 and the shutdown maintenance was the and related costs were attributable or can be kind of blamed for about 5 6 that decrease in margin and transportation a little more than 4 see you basically have 11 of that 14 15 change with those two items we do have on the it was more expensive to get feedstock but our selling prices went up they didn t completely cancel each other out as brian and i alluded to in our prepared remarks but that it was much bigger issue for the shutdown costs the maintenance costs and the transportation costs then bad leverage from labor and benefit standpoint was another 2 5 and that s pretty much due to the shutdown as well as extended shutdown so that s lion share of your 14 15 decrease in margin on a year over year basis for q4 brian recatto president chief executive officer and director and then luke going forward assuming a normal shutdown duration we lost 1 2 million gallons of production because of the extra time we spent completing the construction side of the turnaround and i think we re well set up for a more consistent turnaround schedule i mean i think we mentioned on a previous call we re shooting for 26 days a year to be shutdown to do maintenance activities on the refinery luke junk baird analyst and this is a super helpful detail i ll leave it there thank you guys mark devita chief financial officer thanks operator thank you and our next question will come from line of michael hoffman with stifel your line is now open michael hoffman stifel analyst hi brian and mark thank you i missed you said the number i missed it mark how many gallons of base oil did you say you sold in the quarter mark devita chief financial officer we sold 12 7 million michael hoffman stifel analyst 12 7 million okay and then it was rfo was 3 1 did i get i heard that right mark devita chief financial officer you did michael hoffman stifel analyst okay perfect and then all of the work that was done does it change the targeted production number of 46 8 million gallons of base oil mark devita chief financial officer i still think we re in that range michael hoffman stifel analyst okay and we re still looking at approximately somewhere around 50 million gallons a year of rfo mark devita chief financial officer i am not quite sure about that it s we ve been doing less rfo if you adjust for a quirky ph quarter in q4 that was lower than what we did in rfo in q2 and q3 now again we did we wanted to avoid the problem of limited feedstock which in part attributed to some of our problems last year so part of that was just different management we re obviously collecting more based on our route efficiency and just from a pure volume standpoint you can tell that but we look to leverage our collection versus trying to attract third parties so depending on where you are getting those gallons we don t want to get deeper into the rfo market brian i don t know if you have any more color brian recatto president chief executive officer and director yes i think michael what will happen this year is we ll probably do more swaps versus expanding our rfo sales given the fact that we think we know hsfo is going to go down in price as we look at the strip i mean at the end of the year it s a 10 price differentials from wti so logically we ll work with our other refinery partners that swap oil where it makes sense to drive our logistics cost down so i think you ll see more swapping from us probably not more rfo activity and then in terms of rerefinery production we produced 43 million gallons this year with more expected uptime we certainly think we re going to get more into that 47 million range for production for the year barring on any unforeseen issues at the plant that made our projections right now so we re going to do that michael hoffman stifel analyst so if you think about it just to frame this given the spread pressures in the first half but maybe a 10 volume benefit and using the balancing act on the rfo to manage the spread without any benefit of imo 2020 a flat year over year margin dollars of margin is not an unreasonable way to think at the moment until we see what happens with how imo 2020 drives it just go back down and all that mark devita chief financial officer i mean i ll let brian comment but i would hope and we don t know where imo 2020 is going to be but i would hope we can beat flat over the last year it really to me is just how much better is the business is going to be and brian recatto president chief executive officer and director yeah i would agree with that i mean we re going to be disappointed if we don t perform better than we did in 2018 michael and that s given that we do get the benefit of what we think is going to happen relative to imo 2020 we re already seeing as i said earlier we re seeing a lengthening of used motor oil in the market we moved really quickly at the end of q4 and the beginning of this year to change our used motor oil pricing we made a 0 20 move we re going to keep pushing the envelope there yes we re feeling i mean you know the base oil market you can read the same things that we re reading the base oil market is weak right now we expect that to change you re going to see demand for lighter sweeter crudes go up you re going to see feedstock costs go up going into virgin refiners that s going to have to it s going to have to move base oil pricing up we re already seeing improved demand as we look out in the february and march for base oil which is a great thing for us you ve had some shipping problems the early part of this year in terms of exporting base oil because of even fog ph conditions in houston affected shipping lanes we think this thing is going to get cleaned up yes there s going to be pressure in q1 but we re optimistic that with what s happening on the macro front that we ll have a good back half of the year you can outperform relative to 2018 mark devita chief financial officer if you take even the imo 2020 impact out of it and you look at and we don t know the impact of this either but how likely is it that the turnaround season is late in 19 as it was in 18 how likely is it that the storm season is as light in 19 as it was in 18 i mean there were a lot of things that stacked up and had base oil production pretty high relative to what we ve seen in some of the past year so and that s without any capacity changes so there is reason to think that we should without much problem beat what we did in 18 it s just a matter of how much brian recatto president chief executive officer and director as you know there will be a strong demand for diesel i mean refineries are going to have to do michael hoffman stifel analyst multiple speakers i mean imo 2020 could be really interesting i m just i was trying to frame it against without that could you have an up year over year and what you re saying is yes that 4 or 10 volume growth despite the margin the spread compression you should produce year over year profit growth brian recatto president chief executive officer and director we are going to have work our rear ends off on used motor oil pricing on the street we re doing that that s going to be the real key there michael hoffman stifel analyst okay so the years of i ll flip this question around a different way you have a great environmental services business i mean you ve demonstrated that by reinvesting in growth in 16 17 you turnaround didn t start showing the operating leverage of it 18 it s great topline growth there is lots of acquisitions the best case may be used oils could be 15 of total ebitda why are you staying in the plant side of it you mean i get see in the collection cycles it fits the es business but why are you staying in the plant side brian recatto president chief executive officer and director well i think more than ever we want to be on the plant side until we see where imo 2020 flushes out michael i mean at this point we ve got a home for the used motor oil we collect it s very important for us to be in that business on the street every single customer that we do business with generates used motor oil generates only water we ve got four wastewater treatment plants it s the major component of what we re doing on the street i like having the ability to process it ourselves i mean obviously if we don t see anything happening with imo 2020 to change the dynamics and have a more consistent spread maybe we d think about that but at this point we re convinced that we re going to see some upside with the rerefinery we ve done a lot of elements work on improving the operations of the plant we re going to keep doing that we re just about done with capital we ve got one more major environmental project which doesn t involve shutting the plant down so we feel pretty good about the two years of hard work that we put into optimizing the plant so that s why we re not going to go to exit the business right now michael hoffman stifel analyst okay fair enough thank you brian recatto president chief executive officer and director and but just one more point to that is we absolutely are going to focus our growth capital on the environmental services business and we ve indicated that on other calls our money is going to be invested in growing that business and i d love in our vision two to three years out is for this going to be 80 es and 20 oil or as low as we can make it but have the ability to market out in the field the way we do michael hoffman stifel analyst yes i get it it s a great business and you ve produced terrific results brian recatto president chief executive officer and director thank you mark devita chief financial officer thank you operator thank you operator instructions our next question will come from line of ryan merkel with william blair your line is now open ryan merkel william blair analyst hey guys good morning brian recatto president chief executive officer and director hi ryan mark devita chief financial officer hi ryan ryan merkel william blair analyst so i wanted to ask about the es business obviously seeing great momentum there brian i think you talked about high single digit growth was the outlook for 2019 brian recatto president chief executive officer and director yes ryan merkel william blair analyst can you just break that into pieces for us market growth price i think you mentioned acquisitions and then i expect you opened some new branches can you just walk through the pieces there mark devita chief financial officer yes let s go with the price first we had about in q4 again we implemented our price increase running if i remember a couple of our four week periods earlier than we typically do so we have a little more clarity now that i mean it wasn t the full quarter so it s still not fully in effect in the results that we printed but we ve got a little more of a glimpse and we ve had about 3 price overall in what we printed that is that usually is the mix the more mature businesses tend to have more price and that s exactly what happened this quarter and the less mature ones inaudible we re still trying to grow and take advantage of efficiencies integrate the businesses and there s cost to achieve synergies all sort of things so those have very little impact or basically almost on volume but if we look forward and we say well we re not fully baked in and we re going to do some work on some of those businesses i just mentioned that are still at early stage at least relatively for us we think we can get about five so the lion s share of the rest of that is probably 80 of the rest of that because the high single digit is going to be just a regular organic growth strategy and the remainder will be the new branches or new resources that we re going to have we look to add about five branches during the year and probably total headcounts and field base mostly sales resources is probably around 20 and those will be at various points in the year so just like it was in 2017 but it s a more aggressive plan than what we had in 2018 based on what brian already went through so hopefully that gives you a feel as to the pieces brian recatto president chief executive officer and director and the reason we feel like we could do five branches this year is we think that the job market is loosening up a little bit that s really why we slowed down the openings of branches in 2018 and we had trouble staffing our existing branches but we are seeing noticeable improvement and we ve certainly ramped up our recruiting department and as mark said we re looking at five branches most of those being in the western half of the us which is where we lag density we ll also open up another hub in the western half of the us to help reduce our logistics cost mark devita chief financial officer yes i would tell you that i ll echo brian s comment if there was any risk we didn t add as many head as we wanted to last year and that was the reason so we have reacted made some changes and we do have some tailwinds probably the last quarter maybe quarter and a half brian recatto president chief executive officer and director yeah i agree mark devita chief financial officer to get a little better and our number of openings decreased so we think we have momentum in that area but that s why we feel confident if we weren t able to add as much it would be because we couldn t find the right people ryan merkel william blair analyst okay that s really helpful and then moving to es margins again 2018 was great year you expect improvement can you just give us a range or how much expansion you re thinking just to help calibrate our models mark devita chief financial officer i think we re probably looking to add another year full number our full year number that brian gave probably in the range of another 150 basis points for year over year and you know better than anyone ryan you ve been covering us forever the q1 is we have a headwind 200 basis points to 300 basis points if you look at q1 versus the other quarter if you go back three four five years you see other than 17 when it was only a couple hundred you see the trend is pretty solid so well we wouldn t expect that increase versus the q4 print ph than q1 we should be able to at least do and probably improve upon what q1 was last year brian recatto president chief executive officer and director yes i agree ryan merkel william blair analyst okay perfect i m passing on thanks operator thank you there are no further questions in the queue at this time ladies and gentlemen thank you for your participation on today s conference this does conclude our program and we

quarter and full year 2018 results it has been quite a year for us at our investor day in april we laid out an ambitious agenda and our team has delivered successfully completing the first full year of our transforming while growing phase as a result we grew top line we comp the comps posting our sixth consecutive quarter and second consecutive full year of positive comparable sales we achieved over 1 billion in annual digital sales we drove gross profit rate expansion in a highly competitive environment we delivered operating expense leverage and we had a 100 basis points of adjusted ebit margin expansion and a 77 improvement in adjusted net income most importantly we remain on track to deliver our previously disclosed fiscal 2020 target including doubling our 2017 adjusted ebit margin we delivered these results while making important progress on the transformation initiatives that we outlined on our investor day optimizing our store network enhancing our digital and omnichannel capabilities increasing the speed and efficiency throughout our concept to customer product lifecycle and improving our customer engagement through our loyalty programs and marketing optimization throughout the year we were laser focused on our playbook and aligning product voice and experience across all touch points our customer is our driving force and always is the center of everything we do our goal is to be there for them whenever wherever and however they choose to engage with us we provide them a product and branded experiences that are relevant to their everyday life and the customer is responding turning to our fourth quarter accomplishments at hollister we delivered a 6 comp on top of an 11 comp in 2017 representing our ninth consecutive quarter of positive comps our product continues to resonate and we are leveraging our increased speed to market and closest to our customer to ensure that we are meeting their needs brandwide our strongest fourth quarter performance was in bottoms including jeans and pants we had record outerwear sales across gender with both guys and girls loving anything cozy lined including teddy sherpa and fleece and even though with cold outside swim continued to grow swim is an exciting opportunity for us and so is gilly hicks customers responded well to the revamped spot offerings at gilly and we ve been pleased with the performance with great product as our foundation our marketing voice has grown louder and more effective throughout the year and hollister s integrated approach continues to deliver we have been able to quickly respond to the evolving trends preferences and issues that our customers care about the most our brand cog marketing campaign are near and dear to my heart and continue to be centered around causes we and our core customers care deeply about like anti bullying and inclusivity our club cali royalty program nearly doubled this year to over 18 million member accounts our awesomenesstv series generated more than 21 million youtube views and our swim collected accounted for hollister s top three most viewed instagram videos in brand s history moving on to abercrombie comps were negative 2 in the fourth quarter driven primarily by weakness in women tops and dresses which more than offset areas of strength in women bottoms was our strongest category led by jeans pants and skirts in men s knits and fleece outperformed and both genders experienced strength in outerwear before moving on i want to talk about the abercrombie women dresses and tops challenges we quickly isolated the product missteps and have made good progress in clearing inventory while simultaneously adjusting our go forward assortments as we continue to flex our increasingly agile supply chain as you all know kristin scott was recently promoted to the new role of president global brands over the past couple of years kristin has done an amazing job at hollister since taking on her new role in late november she has begun applying the learnings from hollister and the team is energized we are very excited about the future of a f our loyalty program is robust and growing with almost 10 million member accounts at year end up from five million last year and this speaks to the power of the abercrombie brand while abercrombie product continues to evolve our integrated marketing activities are growing in sophistication and scale fueled by recent hires the recent relaunch of our iconic fierce fragrance is the first integrated campaign from the new team while the popular fragrances remain the same the updated packaging and messaging more authentically speaks to today s consumer we have combined in store digital and experiential activations to create a truly diverse campaign that includes athletes lgbtq activists mental health advocates and a group of volunteer california firefighters while still early days reactions both in sentiment and sales tell us that we hit the mark fierce has had over 250 million media impressions since its relaunch and almost half of all fierce purchases have been from customers that are new to the brand you can see certain aspects of our campaign on slide 28 turning to kids we are encouraged by recent results customers are responding to our unique products and updated store prototype both of which are differentiated relative to our adult stores and to our competition flower and pattern have been big successes and our gender neutral everybody collection continues to perform the bottom line is that kids like wearing our product and parents feel good putting them in it while we made significant progress in 2018 it was just the first full year of our transforming while growing phase as we move into year two there is still a lot of work to be done to stay on track with our previously disclosed fiscal 2020 target we will increasingly rely on and leverage our four key transformation initiatives in 2019 our first initiative is the optimization of our store network we ve continued to evolve our model to reflect the shopping habits of our core customers and we remain highly focused on delivering an exciting store experience across brands we delivered 67 new experiences this year encompassing new stores right sizes and remodels with every new prototype we re running and evolving making our physical spaces more compelling engaging and omnichannel integrated over the past eight years we ve gone from a peak of roughly 1 100 stores to 861 at year end including roughly 475 domestic store closures leaving our current fleet well positioned in predominantly a and b malls in 2018 we closed 29 stores contributing to a total square footage reduction of approximately 2 meanwhile productivity per square foot improved by low single digits from 2017 s levels this resulted in a 140 basis point store occupancy leverage looking ahead over the next two years roughly 50 of our u s base is up for renewal giving us a lot of flexibility we are carefully evaluating our entire store base and will close stores when appropriate including up to 40 in 2019 in conjunction with closing stores we will continue to invest in our store experiences and plan delivering approximately 85 new experiences including remodels in 2019 please refer to slide 22 in the presentation for additional details turning to our brands i hope most of you have been in our updated hollister prototype which we introduced in 2015 today roughly 45 of the store base is in the new format and that should be closer to 55 by the end of 2019 the return on our remodel investments has remained consistent over the years and we continue to see high single digit improvement in the top line versus control stores abercrombie has more recently embarked on its prototype journey launching the updated adult and kids prototypes in 2017 although less than 10 of the combined fleet is in these new formats in general these stores are proving highly productive we are applying learnings both domestically and internationally and by year end 2019 approximately 20 of the combined abercrombie and kids fleet should reflect the new prototype on the international front we continue to pivot away from large tourist dependent flagships to smaller format and mall based locations enabling us to cultivate a more local customer base and drive incremental digital sales unlike the u s the european mall base is not overdeveloped leaving many powerful shopping center where we do not currently have a presence in 2018 we opened our first two european a f mall based prototypes at the trafford centre in manchester and the myzeil shopping center in frankfurt to be clear we believe in stores and they play a key role in delivering the fast omnichannel experience for our customer we are one of the specialty retailers still committed to investing in physical space our landlord partners are excited about our direction and are helping to support our acceleration we re highly focused on store optimizations which remains a key part of our formula to achieving our fiscal 2020 ebit margin goal turning to our second initiative enhancing our digital and omnichannel capability we ve been focused on this for a while and have made significant investments to proactively anticipate our customer shopping needs on a global basis for the year we experienced broad based digital momentum across brands and geographies and passed a major milestone 1 billion in digital sales within the digital platform our customer is mobile first with mobile accounting for the overwhelming majority of our digital traffic and sales and our highly rated apps representing our fastest growing platform from both a dollar and traffic perspective our digital and in store shopping experiences are becoming increasingly integrated we see strong engagement with purchase online pick up in store which we referred to as popins and order in store capabilities sales are up double digits for both and the popins customers make incremental purchases while in store we are rolling these capabilities out globally and they are now available across brands in 10 countries as a reminder we have a highly developed global infrastructure we currently operate 20 websites around the world and ship to over 120 countries in addition we ve had success on tmall china where we saw a strong performance on singles day while i am proud of these omnichannel and digital accomplishments including 30 digital penetration in 2018 we cannot sit still innovation in the states is faster than ever and we will continue to drive further investment in tools and functionality to support the growth of our brands across shopping platforms in 2019 and beyond our third initiative is focused on increasing our efficiency and speed to market capabilities through our concept to customer product lifecycle including how we plan buy allocate and sell across channels and geographies from the plan and buy perspective we have successfully invested in capabilities for greater speed agility and flexibility and have cultivated a robust and diverse supplier base across 18 countries the result is that we have shortened our product calendar by several weeks in 2019 we expect these efforts to help support product improvements aur growth and gross profit rate expansion another key focus within this initiative is to better leverage data and analytics throughout the product lifecycle we spent 2018 implementing two key analytics tools to support our buy allocate and sell efforts markdown and size optimization we ll begin to realize the benefits of these critical tools across brands in 2019 these tools along their ship and store capabilities will further benefit our inventory management and support our outlook for gross profit rate expansion before turning to our fourth transformation initiative i want to quickly touch on china tariff we have a highly experienced team that is actively working on diversification into other countries and regions scott will go into more detail in his remarks but we currently see the ability to migrate up to half of production out of china and will continue to closely monitor the situation and now on to our final transformation initiative customer engagement we continue to focus on improving our customer engagements through our growing loyalty programs and our marketing optimization initiative momentum in our loyalty programs continued with membership over the past year almost doubling to over 28 million member accounts as we released new benefits we view our loyalty program as a big asset and an even bigger opportunity and we re just scratching the surface on leveraging this data to further personalize our communications and strengthen customer engagement with our brands on the marketing front over the past year we further developed our test and learn capabilities and ran multiple pilots across our platforms the outcome is that we are better able to read the return on investments and improve the allocation of our spend to the most effective channel we had a step up in our marketing spending in 2018 and we ll continue to increase the spend in 2019 although at a more moderate pace in 2018 our efforts across loyalty and marketing delivered positive cross channel traffic comp and improving the brand health across all brands we expect that trend to continue as we build on these efforts in summary i am proud of our 2018 performance we delivered another year of positive comp sales while expanding our gross profit rate and materially improving profitability now i will turn the call over to scott to discuss the details of our fourth quarter and full year results and outlook scott lipesky senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks fran and good morning everyone i m excited to walk you through our strong end to the year and our outlook for 2019 starting with the fourth quarter total net sales of 1 2 billion declined 3 from last year as a reminder we had a combined adverse impact of approximately 60 million from a calendar shift and the loss of fiscal 2017 s 53rd week and an additional 15 million adverse impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates comp sales came in at plus 3 representing our sixth consecutive quarter of positive comps against our most difficult comparison of the year our marketing and loyalty investments continue to deliver positive cross channel traffic which was the key driver of our comp growth our largest brand hollister achieved a 6 comp while abercrombie was negative 2 reflecting previously disclosed women s tops and dresses challenges kristin and team are aggressively working through the underperforming classifications and these ongoing efforts are reflected in our sales and margin outlook by geography we had positive comp sales of 5 in the u s international comps were negative 2 representing a sequential improvement from q3 in europe we saw a sequential improvement in hollister offset by continued weakness in our abercrombie flagship locations in china demand was strong across brands as we continue to focus on driving the digital business on tmall and our owned sites as fran mentioned we surpassed the 1 billion mark in annual sales for the digital channel for the quarter digital sales grew to approximately 36 of total sales compared to 34 of total sales in q4 last year with gains across brands and regions gross profit rate rose to 59 1 up 70 basis points from last year on a constant currency basis net of hedging gross profit rate was up 20 basis points driven by slightly lower auc and essentially flat aur with higher aur in hollister offset by lower aur in abercrombie i ll now recap the rest of our results for the quarter compared to last year on an adjusted non gaap basis excluding from our fourth quarter 2017 adjusted operating results were approximately 4 million of pre tax charges related to certain legal matters and approximately 4 million in store asset impairment as a reminder there were no excluded pre tax items in q4 this year adjusted operating expense excluding other operating income was down 1 to last year primarily due to an additional week of expense last year the impact from changes in foreign currency rates store occupancy reductions and a reduction in depreciation on it assets this was partially offset by volume related expenses from higher digital net sales and increased marketing and compensation expenses adjusted operating income was 130 million compared to 148 million last year and included a 4 million adverse impact from changes in foreign currency as well as an adverse impact from the calendar shift and loss of 2017 s additional week estimated at 20 million the adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 27 which excluded tax benefits of 6 million related to the tax cuts and jobs act adjusted net income per diluted share was 1 35 compared to 1 38 last year and included the adverse impact from changes in foreign currency of approximately 0 04 as well as the adverse impact of the calendar shift and loss of 2017 s additional week estimated at approximately 0 19 turning to our full year 2018 results as fran mentioned we experienced sales growth gross profit rate expansion and operating expense leverage resulting in 100 basis points of adjusted ebit margin expansion i ll now discuss the rest of our full year results compared to last year on an adjusted non gaap basis excluded from our 2018 operating results were approximately 11 million of pre tax charges related to certain legal matters and asset impairment this compares to approximately 29 million of excluded charges last year related to certain legal matters and asset impairment net sales were 3 6 billion up 3 from last year while comp sales were positive 3 gross profit rate was 60 2 up 50 basis points from last year on a constant currency basis net of hedging gross profit rate was up 20 basis points lower auc was partially offset by slightly lower aur this was driven by lower aur at abercrombie which was partially offset by higher aur at hollister adjusted operating expense excluding other operating income grows 1 from last year resulting in 80 basis points of expense leverage while still supporting investments in marketing and our transformation initiatives other operating income contributed 30 basis points of deleverage reflecting the reclass of gift card breakage into revenue beginning in fiscal 2018 adjusted operating income was 139 million compared to 101 million last year including a benefit from foreign currency of approximately 6 million partially offset by the adverse impact of the loss of the additional week in fiscal 17 estimated at approximately 5 million the adjusted effective tax rate for the year was 34 which excludes discrete net tax benefits of 3 5 million related to the tax cuts and jobs act the rate includes 9 6 million of discrete noncash tax charges related to the expiration of certain share based compensation awards we do not expect the expiration of share based compensation awards to materially impact our tax provision in 2019 adjusted net income per diluted share was 1 15 compared to 0 65 last year foreign currency benefited net income per diluted share by approximately 0 06 this was partially offset by the adverse impact of the loss of the additional week in fiscal 17 estimated at approximately 0 05 turning to the balance sheet we ended the year with 723 million in cash compared to 676 million last year gross borrowings outstanding at the end of the year were 253 million for both 2018 and 2017 total inventories were up 3 compared to last year in line with our expectations coming into the quarter we expect to end the first quarter with inventory at low single digits while there are still select abercrombie women s tops and dresses carryover that teams are clearing this season our overall inventory position entering the first quarter was well balanced across brands with strategic investments in our must win and must grow categories looking ahead we remain on track to deliver our fiscal 2020 ebit margin target the formula that we outlined at our investor day remains consistent for 2019 for the year we expect to once again deliver net sales growth gross profit rate expansion and operating expense leverage leading to ebit margin expansion specifically we expect net sales to be up in the range of 2 to 4 driven by positive comparable sales and net new store contribution partially offset by adverse impact of changes in foreign currency rates of approximately 15 million comp sales to be up in the low single digits gross profit rate for the year to be up slightly to the 2018 rate of 60 2 with higher average unit retail net of adverse foreign currency impacts to be partially offset by higher average unit cost our outlook excludes the impact of any potential future china tariffs on apparel while we wait to understand the path forward we are continuing to reduce the amount of china sourced goods flowing into the u s we expect our china percentage to move from approximately 25 in 2018 to under 20 in 2019 we expect operating expense excluding other operating income to be up approximately 2 while still driving further expense leverage and we expect an effective tax rate in the mid to upper 20s shifting gears to capital allocation as discussed throughout 2018 we see tremendous opportunity to transform and grow our business and we plan to increase our capital investments to approximately 200 million from 152 million in 2018 to support our growth plan our capital investments will include approximately 120 million for stores and approximately 80 million for digital and technology investments with our remaining excess liquidity we will prioritize our spend as follows accelerating investments in the business aggressively pursuing real estate rationalization including flagships and driving shareholder returns through dividends opportunistic share repurchases and or debt repayments for share repurchases at a minimum we plan to offset the effect of dilution of share based compensation awards i ll now finish up with our expectations for the first quarter of 2019 we expect net sale to be flat to last year including the adverse impact of approximately 15 million from foreign currency comp sales to be flat to up 2 gross profit rate to be flat to up slightly to last year s 50 5 rate operating expense excluding other operating income to be approximately flat to 2018 adjusted operating expense of 482 million finally we expect an effective tax rate in the mid 20s with that i ll turn the call back over to fran fran horowitz chief executive officer thank you scott 2018 marks the first full year of over transforming while growing phase we put a plan in place and successfully executed to it with that as a foundation we are building on recent momentum and we ll continue to strategically invest on transformation initiatives enabling us to drive growth for each of our global brands we are so excited about the future and i would personally like to express my gratitude to all our associates around the globe for their passion and commitment as we continue along with our journey thank you pam quintiliano vice president investor relations thanks fran that concludes our prepared comments we will now be happy to take your questions questions and answers operator and your first question comes from paul lejuez with citi research paul lejuez citi research analyst question about gilly hicks anyway you can size that business up for us maybe remind us how many stores had the gilly product in f 18 what sort of comp lift did it provide and curious how big of an online business that is as well and what your plans are for gilly in f 19 fran horowitz chief executive officer paul it s fran i ll kick off that question so we currently actually carry gilly in all of our stores globally around the world we did actually revamp the product for back to school this year and has really nice product acceptance and an accelerated growth in the back half but we are so very much in the test and lean phase with gilly we re trying different concepts so for example we opened up 36 carveouts in 18 and we opened up three side by sides which we re seeing nice success with it s a very synergistic customer to our hollister customer and we re going to continue to test them on as we head through 19 scott lipesky senior vice president and chief financial officer yes just an add on to the in there paul we will open additional carveouts in 2019 and about are 10 scheduled and then 10 to 15 additional side by sides and those side by sides are the stores where we have kind of a separate entrance and a little more marketing around the gilly brand so it s a nice way to get to the customer operator our next question comes from kate fitzsimons with rbc capital markets kate fitzsimons rbc capital markets analyst congratulations on the improvement in the quarter i guess my question would be on the q1 outlook of flat to up low single digits for q1 can you just compare that to what you re seeing here in february we ve heard some chappier comments out of some of your peers any color by brand or region would be helpful and then if you could just speak to what leverage do you see taking place through 2019 to get you to that low single digit guidance for the year scott lipesky senior vice president and chief financial officer all right kate i ll kick off with q1 as you know we don t comment on the current quarter business for the quarter as we laid out the outlook is for comp sale to be flat to up 2 and we are focused on delivering that that outlook as we re sitting here on march 7 that reflects our quarter to date trends and our assessment of any potential impacts we know the easter shift is coming the weather is cold the macro situation is bouncing around in europe and tourism is up in the u s so we try to reflect all of those things into our outlook for q1 i ll kick it to fran for the levers fran horowitz chief executive officer well we re definitely prepared to comp the comp our customer remains very solid in the united states we are pleased with where our inventory is we mentioned the near term dresses and tops challenges that s obviously also baked into our guidance we ve seen some nice selling from our spring categories so far we re very excited about our marketing and our integrated campaigns we recently as you know relaunched fierce we ve had a very strong acceptance to that we re heading into 19 with strong loyalty across brands we doubled those numbers in 18 and we have lots of customer that are engaged and excited about our business and then lastly we re continuing to invest in our stores and our omnibusiness and we see all of that as very positive as we head into 19 operator we ll next go to omar saad with evercore isi shayne arcilla evercore isi analsyt this is shayne arcilla for omar saad i d like to know i was wondering if you could provide more color on the performance of the a f kids and how trends have evolved and also could you provide more color on your brand ambassador programs especially how trends have evolved for the abercrombie brand ambassador that you started last summer fran horowitz chief executive officer this is fran i ll start with kids so we are pleased with our performance we had a solid year in kids we re excited that our customer both our kid and our parents are really responding to our product and our experience the kids seems to love wearing it and the parents seem to love putting them into it we believe that our kids business has opportunity there s market share out there to be had obviously based on some recent news that s out there we ve opened up some very productive prototypes and we are continuing to test and learn as things move forward with this business but overall pleased with the performance we have a successful hollister program the brand ambassador program which is the first ever high school ambassador program we recently have actually transitioned our brand ambassador program with a f and we created what we re calling a sounding board of directors of our consumer to understanding get closer to our customer but with that said we re still using lots of influencer our current relaunch of our fierce fragrance has been successful through a very exciting influencer program that we launched operator we ll next go to simeon siegel with nomura instinet dan stroller nomura instenet analyst yes this is dan stroller on for simeon could you give any color on what the comp cadence for the quarter and then any traffic trends and then also how is the tourism performing overseas scott lipesky senior vice president and chief financial officer i ll grab this one this is scott we don t get the monthly breakdown for the comp cadence in q4 we were pleased with the results in q4 delivering the plus three on our hardest comp from last year the plus three so comping the comp was a good show of momentum for us as we think about the tourist business i d say it s been difficult in the u s we ve talked about this the last couple of quarters along the east coast and down into florida we ve seen challenging tourism from europe asia as well as south america obviously the geopolitical environment is pretty tough out there currencies are weak compared to the us dollar so i think that s all contributing to the tourist pattern operator we ll next go to susan anderson with b riley fbr susan anderson b riley fbr inc analyst sorry if i missed this i hopped on a bit later was wondering can you just talk about just kind of the breakout between the international comps and the u s by brand and i guess specifically for abercrombie if you saw better performance in the u s and the product issues that you had in the u s and when you guys kind of expect that to be fixed fran horowitz chief executive officer i ll kick off actually with the second question with our a f business yes we did perform better in the u s than we did international for a f specifically although a f for the year did positive comp and we are excited to see the brand really stabilized we believe that we have isolated those issues specifically to tops and dresses in the women s business we are super excited sure you ve heard that we have kristin scott at the helm now she s our global brand president she s been at the job for about 90days and has really dug in with the team and applying a lot of her learnings in the hollister playbook and helping us to evolve the product in abercrombie we expect that each delivery we will see improvement and we ll really see her handwriting in the back half of the year scott lipesky senior vice president and chief financial officer yes i ll grab the comps on the u s on the u s piece the comps continue to be very happy with the performance we ve seen in the u s across brands in total we haven t given the level down to the brand at this point but in total we delivered a plus five in q4 of 2018 and that was on the plus 11 from q4 of 17 so in light of some of that u s tourism difficulty that i talked about a minute ago we re still delivering strong comps in the u s and as fran mentioned continue to see that customer remain solid in u s fran horowitz chief executive officer go ahead joanne crevoiserat chief operating officer i was going to jump on the international as scott mentioned earlier this is joanne as scott mentioned earlier the flag business was a bit softer was softer internationally but our hollister business did improve internationally and our goal is to cultivate a more local omnichannel customer in these markets for the a f brand the hollister business in our international markets is mostly a mall based business and the improvement there gives us encouragement that moving into a mall based strategy in a more local cultivated more local customer for abercrombie is the right move we did open two mall based locations in europe in myzeil shopping center and in trafford and that is the start of we ll continue to pursue opportunities for accelerated exits of those flagship locations and pursuing moving into the more mall based locations in europe for abercrombie susan anderson b riley fbr inc analyst and if i could just add one follow up on the i guess hollister business what do you think that drove that is it product or just allocations that you think you did better this quarter because obviously the macro issue continue to be pretty pressured over there scott lipesky senior vice president and chief financial officer you are talking about europe or international business susan anderson b riley fbr inc analyst in hollister yes correct yes scott lipesky senior vice president and chief financial officer yes we talked throughout the year of some of our transitional and product issues throughout the first three quarters of the year into q3 into q4 as that weather became more seasonal and the adjustments we ve made they started to stick a little bit so we ve seen that business in light of all the macro uncertainty across many european countries we ve seen that business improve a little bit so we re on a good track here and we have much more opportunity in the future to better localize our voice and our products across europe and that ll be a good place for us to focus in 2019 operator we ll next go to kimberly greenberger with morgan stanley kimberly greenberger morgan stanley analyst great i wanted to ask a real estate question what percentage of your fleet now is profitable and if you could wave a magic wand and sort of downsize your fleet to the ideal size how many of your current stores would you close joanne crevoiserat chief operating officer kimberly this is joanne i ll pick that up now the vast majority of our store fleet is profitable as you know we ve been on this path for many many years optimizing and improving the health of our fleet it is important to note the majority of our fleet is in a and b malls and over the past eight years we ve closed roughly 475 stores but we believe that stores still matter and closure is one of the many tools we use to improve our fleet and that customer experience including remodels rightsizes and relocations and i would say in 2018 we improved the evidence of improved store performance we improved store performance we reduced square footage and we drove higher productivity and better economics in the box and that s evidenced by the leverage of a 140 basis points in our store occupancy we continue to have a lot of flexibility with 50 of our leases expiring over the next couple of years to continue to review our fleet in a rigorous and methodical way but we re very committed to improving that physical touch point for our customers embedding omnichannel capabilities reducing our square footage and driving higher productivity across the board operator we ll next go to janet kloppenburg with jjk research janet kloppenburg jjk research analyst joanne or fran you talked about localization efforts in europe in terms of where more wear now products and recognizing the seasonality differences between the u s and europe i was wondering when we might expect to see that transition in the assortments and with respect to the a f flagship closings joanne how many can we expect this year and what do you think the cadence of that and i m talking about europe the european flagship closing will look like for the a f brand fran horowitz chief executive officer janet this is fran i ll kick off with the first part of the question so as we mentioned we saw some nice improvement in hollister across our mall based business in europe from the third quarter to the fourth quarter as scott mentioned the product was a little bit more sticky and we were more seasonally appropriate what we are working on here is we have a playbook domestically aligning product voice and experience which drives traffic and conversion for us and we are currently exporting that playbook overseas we re also working on creating a global operating model to have more merchants in europe and closer to the consumer all of those efforts are rolling out through 2019 joanne crevoiserat chief operating officer and janet as it relates to the flagship closures as we mentioned our goal is to cultivate a more local omnichannel customer in these markets so store openings and mall locations and locations that attract more local customers is a complement to our flagship strategy i definitely want to mention that and that will also help build our digital business across europe but each flagship has its own set of facts and circumstances lease terms locations and tourist exposure we re continuing to pursue opportunities for accelerated exits in those flagship s but we have closed the copenhagen store this year that closed in march so we continue to pursue closure but we have nothing more than that to report at this time janet kloppenburg jjk research analyst but there should be a gradual slowdown every year i mean gradual closing joanne as we go through the next five years or so joanne crevoiserat chief operating officer well as i mentioned each of these flagship locations has its own set of facts and circumstances and has a different landlords so we re working with our landlords to manage the process as evidenced by the moves that we made in hong kong and copenhagen and we re complementing that as i mentioned with openings in more localized markets to help bolster our business and attract more local customer in europe operator we ll next go to david buckley with bank of america david buckley bank of america analyst just interested in hearing your outlook for freight and wage expenses for 2019 and then can you discuss the drivers of operating expense growth beyond first quarter scott lipesky senior vice president and chief financial officer i ll start with freight and wage for 2019 so a consistent theme we ve been talking about this throughout 2018 from a wage perspective we ve seen inflation mainly from a minimum wage perspective in our stores and then also in our distribution centers as we re in a very competitive market here in columbus so we ll continue to see that as we go into 2019 from a freight perspective a couple of different angles here from inflation perspective we have ocean and the freights into the u s it s been an interesting market in q4 as a lot of people have tried to beat that deadline that january 1 deadline for the i guess the previous tariff deadline so it was pretty congested out there as we move into 2019 it s an unknown we expect to see continued inflation there and that s baked into our outlook also from the freight side we ve seen some shipping and handling expense inflation we ve been able to manage through that as best we can we actually leveraged our shipping and handling expense as part of our dtc business in 2018 so we re pleased with that moving on to the full year so the outlook for the full year was up to from an opex basis and so beyond 2019 or q1 of 2019 is a similar theme we ll absorb some inflation we ll also invest in our business we re investing in marketing we re investing in our transformational initiatives because we like what both of those things are delivering our marketing as fran mentioned we re getting better and better at delivering our marketing and we are getting smarter and smarter about how we allocate the resources so we ll continue to increase our investments in 2019 it ll be a little bit more of a moderated pace than 2018 but again we like the results we re seeing from both marketing and transformation and one big thing to finish is we still expect to see leverage from opex in 2019 with all these investments also operator we ll next go to mark altschwager with baird drew north robert w baird and company analyst this is drew north on for mark altschwager can you discuss some of the actions you ve taken to improve the abercrombie women s tops and dresses assortment how are you feeling about the spring assortment and inventory position in these categories relative to the fourth quarter and then more directly does your outlook embed positive comps at abercrombie as you course correct there fran horowitz chief executive officer drew it s fran so as we mentioned earlier we put kristin at the helm of abercrombie as our global brand president she came into the brand that has been stabilized we actually had a plus one comp for the year of 2018 so we re excited about her applying the playbook of hollister more aggressively to a f brand as far as what they ve been doing relative to the spring position is that we have a very agile supply chain we produce in 18 countries around the world and we can affect our own order as we move forward the expectation is to see an improvement in those categories with each delivery as move through the year and relative to your question on positive comps in a f everything is reflected in our q1 outlook operator we ll next go to marni shapiro with the retail tracker marni shapiro the retail tracker analyst stores in particularly hollister s look really fantastic can you just give us an update on the loyalty programs across the two brands and will you do a separate loyalty or something for gilly and then just anything behind some of the initiatives behind payment that you ve talked about on and off joanne crevoiserat chief operating officer marni it s is joanne i ll jump on that our loyalty programs have been very successful at engaging our customers with growth to over 28 million member accounts this year and we view the loyalty programs as a key asset and a big opportunity going forward to better understand and engage with our customers we re really just scratching the surface in engaging our customers on a personalized level and we intend to invest more in technology to better leverage that data and better personalize our communications and engage our customers at this point we don t have a plan for a separate gilly hicks loyalty program those customers are engaging with us through the hollister program and as you mentioned our payment capabilities fran mentioned in her prepared remarks we can never sit still we re continually looking out there for what s new and next and importantly what s important to our customers so we spent a lot of time getting close to our customers and understanding those payment capabilities that they value and we have a tremendous array of capabilities across the globe and what s important to customers in the u s may not be important to customers in germany and it s different than what s important to customers in china and we vary those capabilities around the world and we continue to look for and stay close to our customers for those capability that we need to continue to offer and on the loyalty we have also recently rolled out loyalty programs across europe and we ll be rolling out china this year as well so we re in early stages of our international loyalty programs as well marni shapiro the retail tracker analyst that s exciting and could i just ask one more pay question there some of the other retailers who target younger shoppers the your neighbors at the street or someone in california have said that they do have still a decent amount of their business done in cash which might shock people but i m just curious if you see that same trend joanne crevoiserat chief operating officer we do have a decent base i would say a base of cash business we have a younger customer base so we do have a fairly decent cash business but also in terms of noncredit businesses that s where the venmo option comes into play as we ve added that to our apps is becoming more appealing to our customers particularly our younger customers and our abercrombie customers operator and our last question comes from tiffany kanaga with deutsche bank tiffany kanaga deutsche bank analyst your gross margin guidance for a slightly higher rate in the first quarter stands in contrast to significant declines expected at some of your peers despite your inventory being up 3 and what still looks like a promotional environment out there so can you help walk us through some of the puts and takes behind how you re anticipating driving a relatively better margin trend at the mall especially if abercrombie is still seeing lower aur scott lipesky senior vice president and chief financial officer sure tiffany i can t comment on our competitors but i can comment on us which i will so as we look to q1 yes we are still clearing through some of that a f women s tops and dresses that ll leak into q1 and that s reflected in our outlook we continue to see opportunities from a cost perspective in q1 and we ll make sure that we balance the aur i mean we re going to remain competitive we feel like our promotional calendar is competitive in q1 and we ll lever some of that outperformance we ve seen in hollister to reinvest in abercrombie so again we feel confident with our outlook as we sit here today for that flat to up slightly in q1 joanne crevoiserat chief operating officer and tiffany i think you can use q4 as a fact data point to support our ability to manage through a highly competitive environment and still grow gross margins we did leverage gross margin in the fourth quarter which is arguably the most competitive quarter of the year and we saw higher aur in hollister and we offset that with some investments in abercrombie to make sure we were positioned well coming into the first quarter and our inventories are at up 3 are in line with our outlook at the beginning of the quarter so we feel good about how our inventories are positioned and about our ability to manage the margin line through the first quarter pam quintiliano vice president investor relations that ll end our questions for today fran horowitz chief executive officer thank you we are pleased with our 2018 performance and have a playbook in place to deliver top line growth gross profit rate expansion and operating expense leverage in 2019 i look forward to updating you on our as the year progresses and thank you for your continued interest and support operator duration 62 minutes call

orange county commissioners court is divided on what economic development should do right as chevron phillips has announced the county is a finalist for a new 5 billion chemical plant county judge dean crooks sent a six page single spaced typed statement on his beliefs on economic development incentives the statement includes i believe that investments are made only after the bills have been paid unfortunately orange county has many bills that we must address in the near future he specifically mentioned improving the faltering drainage system rebuilding roads building an emergency fund and improving salaries and benefits for orange county employees two business owners went to the commissioners court meeting tuesday afternoon to speak in favor of economic development incentives to build the community they spoke during the citizens comments part of the meeting though the subject was not posted on the agenda members of the court then began talking about their positions in favor of economic development deals chad havens owner of bridgefield electric and other businesses spoke to rebutt crooks he described the judge s writing as almost a propoaganda piece to sway public opinion for people who are not informed he pointed out plants like dupont chevron and firestone have provided jobs for people who build houses and buy goods to provide property and sales taxes havens said he understands people can argue both sides of economic development incentives but sometimes investments need to be made he has used his house as collateral for loans to build his business from eight employees to more than 150 sam watters a small business owner and former plant manager said people he speaks to in the community support economic development incentives he said an investment in incentives for the proposed chevron phillips plant will not only bring in that new facility but other businesses with employees who will support the plant more people in the county mean more people paying sales and property taxes he said chevron phillips officials made their quest to build the new plant in orange public in january with a request to the west orange cove school board the undeveloped property being sought as a plant site is 50 50 split between the wo c and bridge city school districts both school boards have approved school tax break plans under the texas comptroller s office orange county economic development director jessica hill in january said chevron phillips has been working on the possible orange site for two and a half years she said the agreements for tax incentives are part of the final phases chevron phillips officials said 3 500 construction jobs would be created the company has not released how many permanent jobs would be needed for plant operations a company official said a request will be made to the city of orange to dis annex some of the land and then negotiate an industrial district contract for the company to pay in lieu of taxes payments the company will also ask the county for tax abatements on tuesday county judge crooks said a company wants to get the best deal possible but commissioners court needs to make sure the people get a good deal i do want people to know orange county is open for business he said but we re not open for exploitation he said he s studied tax abatements for the past 20 years and the county does not always get returns for the abatements because the appraised values of industrial plants decrease margaret toal kogt county judge dean crooks wrote the following and submitted it to kogt recent discussions involving how we move forward in orange county with regards to economic development have certainly had their share of misinformation in them when i ran for the position of county judge i stated that i did not believe that we were getting the best deals through our system of using the economic development corporation i believed then as i believe now that the contributions made by the county taxpayer as seen in the 2017 2018 edc contributions list are out of proportion compared to the other members of the ocedc i agree that as the county entity our contribution should be greater than other members but to be responsible for over 90 of the total funds the edc takes in not including money the ocedc receives from the pilot payments for county tax abatements seems excessive particularly for county residents that have seen no personal return on their tax investment further using property tax money to pay the 375 000 two years in a row while having to take out a tax anticipation loan to pay our bills without dipping into the restricted funds seems like an unwise financial move i ran on a promise to be financially responsible and i believed that my offer of 129 000 for the 2018 2019 budget was more than fair given what we had to that end i do believe in investments but i also believe that investments are made only after the bills have been paid unfortunately orange county has many bills that we must address in the very near future we have to address our faltering drainage system so that people will not flood and roads will not become impassable during a thunderstorm we cannot continue to simply patch this problem and we cannot simply rely on federal and state program to fix everything for us we must rebuild our roads that have been patched too many times and devastated by storms and in some cases by overweight vehicles we have aging buildings damaged and patched through numerous storms an aging vehicle fleet over 12 years old per vehicle on average we currently have no emergency fund and that is unacceptable particularly in our area we should have anywhere between 4 and 8 million dollars available to deal with disasters if necessary but we currently do not have the funding for that most importantly we have almost 400 county employees who have seen their benefits cut over the past several years without regular raises to compensate for those cuts this has resulted in many problems including losing some very valuable employees and potential employees to the private sector with better pay and benefit packages i am here today to tell you that we can improve our drainage system we can rebuild our roads we can rebuild and repair our buildings like our courthouse and we can buy newer vehicles that are more reliable safe and less costly on maintenance we can create an emergency fund and we can fairly compensate our employees so that we may retain and recruit a quality work force however like all governments and businesses these things do cost money and most of what is needed costs money we do not have so what do we do some would say this is precisely why we should invest so much in the orange county economic development corporation they say that by giving large incentives to businesses we will attract them here and have economic growth further by hyper funding the ocedc through county taxpayer dollars they will have more tools at their disposal to attract businesses these things will give us the tools to grow orange county and address the problems stated above i have thought about this a great deal and i would like to share some of my concerns while i was running for this office in the fall of 2017 many people asked me what my plan for economic development was and i would tell them that businesses and consumers grow the economy not governments in fact president ronald reagan famously said in a speech involving the economy that government wasn t the answer to the problem government was the problem while president barack obama later told business owners across america that they didn t build their business the government did clearly these two very opposite opinions shaped my thinking of what i would do to foster growth in orange county if i had the honor of being elected county judge i told them as i still believe today that the best way to foster growth in out community is to provide a place where people want to live and business want to build this is done by all those admittedly boring things listed above fixing our drainage and roads repairing the county infrastructure like buildings and vehicles and promoting a professional and dedicated county workforce to serve the citizens that live and work here these things aren t glamorous nor do they get instant recognition in the media and no public official will every been seen as a hero for doing them since this is our job however if we do our job well we can get our county in a place that people feel safe to live in own a home or business in feel protected from storms in drive down the road without destroying their car in and be served by some of the best people in texas my vision for the role of government in economic growth in orange county is simply to do those things we are traditionally tasked to do but do them better than any other county in texas however these things as mentioned before cost money tax money it does not mean that there isn t a place for incentives i believe that there is a place and need for incentives and abatements if they are used with the best interests of orange county in mind this is not a slight against businesses that want to negotiate for incentives it simply means that they have people looking out for their interests as they should and will look to get the best deal for them your elected government should be looking for the best interests of the people they serve as they should further this means all of them not just the corporate citizens that may be looking to move or expand and the businesses that will assist in that 2 also while i was running for office in the fall of 2017 many people said that orange county was dying or going in the wrong direction and that we weren t being open for business in fact i still hear that today and it sparks yet another reason to give large incentives to promote growth i said then as i say now orange county is not dying but i do believe that it may be headed in the wrong direction financially however that is not due to the lack of business incentives at the time of the primary election in 2018 we had 20 different abatement deals over the past 20 years involving 15 different businesses and more that 675 million dollars these deals reflect far more that the majority of our county neighbors although i think some of these deals were overly and unnecessarily generous to the businesses the central point is this we have been extending incentives and abatements rather generously for 20 years before people started thinking we were headed in the wrong direction or dying that being the case maybe we need to start working harder on making better deals for the county not just making more deals for the county 3 funding anything that will later give money back to you is by definition an investment with that in mind if we are going to give incentives and abatements we must be able to afford them if we make an agreement today to abate taxes for a business coming in for 10 years can we afford to wait that long before seeing any revenue from that deal can we afford to go without the improvements to the drainage and roads that long can we go 10 years without an emergency fund or raises for our employees and just hope nothing bad will happen can we go that long while giving 375 000 a year to the ocedc even if there is a benefit a decade from now will it be enough to compensate for debt or higher taxes we will incur during that time many say that without these incentives businesses won t come here or they say that we aren t receiving taxes for that now anyway so we really aren t losing anything if so why not abate every new business and even the new homes that come in wouldn t we grow fast without losing anything of course that would be financial suicide for our community because the additional infrastructure expenses would bankrupt the county while those already paying taxes would be taxed out of their businesses and homes again this doesn t mean that there is no place for incentives and abatements it just means that like most things they must be done objectively in moderation and mostly with our primary concern being the benefit to the county and its citizens these benefits must be clear and measurable not just nebulous terms like growth and open for business we must have a plan when these deals are struck as to how the deal will finance these issues of drainage roads emergency funds buildings employee retiree costs and very importantly will they lower the overall tax rate for everyone i am not alone in this belief as growing concerns across the country shows according to the texas public policy foundation tppf a non profit conservative free market research institute based in austin tx tax abatements are seen as safe incentives with little down side but impose significant costs on taxpayers by shifting the burden of service costs from a new property onto existing taxpayers tax abatements result in a subsidy from some taxpayers to others fostering a system in which local governments can pick winners and losers the most effective means by which the economy may be grown is by fostering a businessfriendly environment in which the government largely stays out of the way high local taxes the overall tax rate for everyone along with costs imposed by permitting delays and regulatory processes are barriers to economic growth that no level of economic development incentives can truly fix finally i would like to address the fear that if we don t fund our ocedc with a large amount of taxpayer dollars each year that we cannot truly afford and if we don t offer really spectacular deal to companies look to expand here we will not grow this is the fear that has been put out by some to make people believe as president obama did that we the government build the businesses i believe that if we create a policy based in fear no matter what we do we will fail orange county has a great deal to offer any business that wants to open its doors here we must strive to strike deals with those businesses based on that to truly be partners however we must be willing to step away from a deal that is not good for our county and our people we must not be afraid to say no when the situation calls for it we must be willing to get up from the table when we are simply too far apart on a deal if we aren t willing to do so we aren t negotiating at all we are merely waiting to hear the other side s terms none of this this would be necessary to say if i didn t believe in making deals when appropriate it simply means we must make appropriate deals i am not alone in this belief either according to maxfield real estate group citing a study done by wilder vcu most studies indicate that site selection criteria do not show financial incentives to be the major factors in business retention or expansion only 7 of firms considered incentives as a critical location factor their site considerations were primarily determined by real estate costs site characteristics and access i know his has been a very long document to read and it doesn t begin to cover everything the topic of economic growth is not particularly complicated but it does have many moving parts don t be fooled by slogans ask question don t sell orange county short we have a lot to offer too much to simply use one tool of bribing businesses to come here we can use incentives when necessary but we can also sit down with the folks that run these businesses and talk like adults i recently met with several business owners and managers they are willing to take the time and listen to what our community needs to be prosperous and they without exception have indicated that they want to be part of a prosperous community it s better for them and it d better for us sometimes when we delegate too much to folks goals and ideals get lost in the instructions many of these larger corporations have staff that handle most of the negotiating and they are tasked with simply getting the best deal for their company if we don t drive a hard bargain and give away too much they will certainly accept however i believe that we can negotiate better if we have limits on what we are willing to give up explain our community s needs and how meeting them helps both parties we should make it clear that we must make a good deal for orange county or we won t make a deal at all these companies wouldn t be successful if they didn t understand the need to make a good deal many are also successful because they take advantage of opportunities that present themselves with that in mind we must guard against offering too much just like making an offer on a home or a car we don t want to give away the farm when we don t have to most importantly we must stop injecting politics into this economic equation and stop trying to make these deals about who gets credit for making it happen there is no credit to be had particularly from government officials and people that work for the government because the government doesn t build companies if a company decides to build here it is because they see it as their best economic advantage in being here i am not against having an economic development corporation i simply believe like any other investment we should not put into it more than we can afford and the dues paid by the members should be proportional further members of commissioner s court that are also members of the ocedc board should recuse themselves from votes regarding the funding of the ocedc if a portion of one s political future rests with another organization s success like the ocedc that gets much of its funding from the county there seems to be a moral conflict of interest in a vote to grant them taxpayer money it should be more financially transparent as long as it receives tax dollars every dollar should be accountable by simply pulling it off the website by any citizen it should have clear and specific goals that are reviewed and reported on regularly to the general public the edc can facilitate a negotiation between the county and a business but should not conduct those negotiations themselves the elected county officials that directly answer to the citizens of orange county should negotiate any deal involving the county from start to end no public official employee business owner or citizen should be offended by any reasonable question asked by anyone to the ocedc nor should anyone ever be discouraged from asking such questions public debate and dialog should be encouraged and labeling it offensive to stifle such debate is arrogant and insulting i am not against incentives and or abatements for businesses or deals if the deal is clearly and contractually going to benefit orange county and its residents merely building a structure and hiring people in itself is not enough every business that builds or expands a facility is going to spend money to do so and businesses hire people to do work so they can operate not to simply enhance a county s economy in addition if we gave deals to companies just because they are building or hiring we would abate and incentivize every new business in orange county we can do better than that at the negotiating table the deal must be reasonable in time as well as money who knows what the economy will be in 15 or 20 years even if we can legally claw back our incentives if a business is unable to maintain its structure or expansion and thus maintain its agreement with us who is to say we will actually get anything we may have a judgement owing us millions but if the business is bankrupt all we will really have is a piece of paper and land we will have difficulty selling it is not likely that this will occur in 5 or 10 years but in 15 or 20 years or more even the most brilliant economist cannot say and we shouldn t act like it can t happen particularly when it is someone else s money we are gambling with the deal must reflect the actual money more accurately the agreements i ve seen and in the minutes i ve read the citizens are told how much the company will invest that is fine but the people that represent the citizens should point out that what is invested does not usually reflect the taxable value of the structure particularly for industry what is invested is considerably more than what we are able to tax if there was no abatement further the taxable value once complete almost always goes down depreciates over time particularly in a long abatement say 10 years or more the value that we eventually see paying a property tax is significantly lower that the amount stated as the investment value in the agreement in short the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow is much smaller than it appears at the beginning and the longer the rainbow the smaller it is it doesn t mean we can t make the deal but we should be much more transparent at the beginning as to what it really means to the taxpayer the deal must be actively enforced and enforceable we must make sure that people representing the people of orange county and their interests inspect regularly to make sure the agreement is being adhered to correctly we cannot rely simply on the business reporting on themselves further we must write the agreements with both the ability and willingness to enforce them if necessary without being swayed by accusations of being unfriendly to business these are contracts not social clubs and both sides should adhere to what is written and agreed upon this isn t being unfriendly this is business i would also fully expect any business that has been abated to rightfully refuse to pay a tax bill sent to them if those taxes had been properly abated that is not being unfriendly to local government that is following the deal

beijing ap china announced a robust annual economic growth target and a 7 5 percent rise in military spending tuesday as it convened an annual legislative session overshadowed by a tariff war with washington seeking to defuse u s and european complaints the chinese system is rigged against foreign companies premier li keqiang promised in a speech to the national people s congress that they will be treated as equals with their chinese competitors li the country s top economic official set this year s growth target at 6 to 6 5 percent reflecting determination to shore up a cooling state dominated economy and prevent politically dangerous job losses such a growth rate if achieved would be among the world s strongest yet it would be slightly below last year s 6 6 percent growth in china and would mark a new three decade low the slowdown in china the world s second largest economy after the united states is likely to hold back international growth china is still a very large locomotive pulling the global economy said sung won sohn chief economist at ss economics in los angeles as the chinese economy slows this will have an impact around the world we are already seeing that impact still eswar prasad an economist at cornell university suggested that a more manageable pace of growth in china could benefit the global economy in the long run slower but more balanced growth in china especially if it was driven by domestic consumption demand and involved fewer financial system risks could be a net positive for the world economy prasad said at the legislative session in beijing li promised to promote china u s trade negotiations but gave no details of talks aimed at ending the fight with president donald trump over beijing s technology ambitions and complaints it steals or pressures companies to hand over technology li no 2 in the ruling communist party behind president xi jinping pledged higher spending on development of technologies including artificial intelligence electric cars biotechnology and new materials that china s leaders see as a path to prosperity and global influence he also promised more money for education social programs and public works construction china s emergence as a competitor in smartphones telecom equipment solar power and other technologies has increased the range of products available to consumers and helped to drive down prices but it rattles washington and other governments that worry chinese competition is a threat to their industries and employment li warned that the second largest economy faces a graver and more complicated environment and risks that are greater in number and size the two week gathering of the congress s 3 000 plus delegates in the cavernous great hall of the people is china s biggest event of the year it does little lawmaking but serves as a platform to highlight the government s plans for the year xi s government is expected to use this year s session to announce tax cuts and more support for entrepreneurs who generate much of china s new jobs and wealth legislators also are due to endorse a law that aims to ease tensions with washington and europe by discouraging officials from pressuring foreign companies to hand over technology higher government spending will push the budget deficit from 2 6 percent of total economic output to 2 8 percent li said the plans reflect emphatic pro growth efforts to offset external headwinds vishnu varathan of mizuho bank said in a report proposed tax cuts of up to 2 trillion yuan 300 billion would put significant spending power in the hands of consumers and companies helping to buoy sagging demand for autos household appliances and other goods varathan said spending on the communist party s military wing the people s liberation army will rise to 1 2 trillion yuan 178 billion according to a separate report issued by the finance ministry china s total military outlay the second largest behind the united states is estimated by independent experts to exceed 220 billion a year when off budget expenses are added in the spending will pay to expand china s navy and acquire advanced aircraft and other weapons to help beijing enforce its territorial claims in the south china sea the slower rise in military spending down from double digit increases in previous years reflects changing priorities said yue gang a military expert and retired chinese army colonel it is more urgent for china to prepare for a trade war with the u s instead of a physical war yue said military reforms are nearly complete and china needs the money to be used for more urgent matters he said the tariff fight with trump over beijing s technology ambitions has rattled chinese consumers and investors prompting some to put off spending which could add to downward pressure on economic growth news reports say washington and beijing might be close to an agreement to end the battle but the chief u s envoy trade representative robert lighthizer said earlier the two sides still had much work to do no agreements have been announced on the core of the dispute u s pressure on beijing to roll back its plans for state led creation of global competitors in robotics and other technology washington europe and other trading partners say those violate china s market opening obligations some american officials worry they might erode u s industrial leadership it s unclear if trump would be mollified by the technology measure part of a law on foreign investment that state media say the congress is due to endorse it would bar officials from using administrative measures to pressure companies to hand over technology foreign business groups welcomed the proposal but said they need to see enforcement rules to know whether it will improve conditions li tried to reassure investors by promising foreign companies will be treated as equals with chinese enterprises in a fair and impartial market environment foreign business groups and governments complain beijing routinely violates its commitments under the world trade organization to ensure such equality or national treatment they say rules on investment technology licensing and other facets of business discriminate against foreign companies or shield chinese enterprises from competition xi and other chinese leaders have announced changes over the past year including tariff cuts on imported consumer goods and plans to allow full foreign ownership in auto manufacturing but business groups say those have little impact on operating conditions beijing faces a wto challenge filed in july by the european union against technology licensing rules the 28 nation trade bloc said improperly hamper the ability of foreign companies to protect and profit from their technology li promised competitive neutrality or equal treatment of state owned and private companies by regulators but he gave no details of how far that might extend for foreign competitors enterprises under all forms of ownership will be treated on an equal footing the premier said ___ ap writers yanan wang and christopher bodeen and researcher yu bing in beijing and ap economics writer martin crutsinger in washington contributed to this report

getty just a few days ago i mentioned on twitter that i have no patience for getting involved in the current public debate over modern monetary theory mmt so much of it ends up as ad hominem straw man or people talking past each other that it seemed like an utter waste of time well i changed my mind paul krugman had already been in the fight against mmt for some years and now eminent mainstream economists lawrence summers and kenneth rogoff have thrown their hats into the ring i know i m not going to settle anything by adding my two cents but i just have to get this off my chest long story short krugman summers rogoff are wrong before i get into details i want to make it clear where i stand i don t agree with everything in mmt however those aspects with which i disagree have never been part of the public debate and they make no difference whatsoever to the policy recommendations to the general public they would be minutia although they might be worth a couple of journal articles i mention this simply to assure the reader that i m actually critical of some aspects of mmt and am not simply toeing the party line here having said that however in the context of the current debate the mmters are right to illustrate this we first need a review of what mmt or what i just think of as macroeconomics done properly looks like this will obviously have to be brief i m focusing in particular on the federal job guarantee the core problem to be solved 1 there is no reason to expect the private sector to provide a job for everyone who is willing to work indeed for the private sector labor is a cost that needs to be minimized this isn t a criticism it s just the incentive structure to inherent that part of our economy 2 we have the ability to produce goods and services on a level never before seen by human society there is no logical reason anyone e g the unemployed should have to go without it is immoral the essential macroeconomic facts 3 just as the president s daughter said days ago people like to work quite right 4 money is not scarce both the private and public sector create it with a keystroke the mechanism by which each works is different of course 5 in the public sector because for all intents and purposes the treasury and central bank act together the government finances itself through money creation this happens every day and is nothing new 6 unlike money resources are scarce and the only true limit on our ability to produce goods and services in both the private and public sector we cannot for example do something that would require us to double the number of americans working there simply are not that many people in the workforce we could finance it so to speak but we couldn t really do it it s unrealistic there are things we cannot do 7 the us government can never default on debt denominated in its own currency which it can issue this is not a theory it s the law i don t have space to go in that here but you can see this blog post for background 8 the public sector s deficit is the private sector s surplus this is not a theory it s basic accounting if the government spends more than it taxes then the private sector earns more than it pays on april 15 this is why private sector debt skyrocketed during the clinton surpluses again here is a blog post for background the solution 9 if we have idle resources there is absolutely nothing preventing the us government from activating them by using newly created money we are of course talking about labor here it s not a big social economic problem if there are idle lumps of coal or potatoes lying about it is however if we have 15 million unemployed workers as we did at the height of the recession following the financial crisis 10 it is immoral for the government not to act when a we have the ability to produce goods and services for these people and b they want to work if the private sector cannot make a profit by hiring those unemployed workers then fair enough it should not be expected to do so 11 instead they should be hired into the public sector so long as we have social problems that are not profitable national defense police and fire protection infrastructure repair public education cleaning and protecting the environment caring for the elderly and infirm etc then plenty of employment opportunities will exist the day we run out of social problems we can worry about what to do incidentally we should leave the social problems that are profitable to the private sector 12 we are doing or have done much of this already the government already creates money to finance the budget deficit it already tries to put into motion forces to get the unemployed hired and it already manages our very high debt gdp ratio with no problem whatsoever i keep seeing mmt described as some sort of radical policy which feels more like a scare tactic than an honest appraisal rather it s a refocusing a reorientation and a reorganization of what we already do a big one no doubt but nothing we are not doing now or have not done in the past 13 such policies are inflationary only if we are already at full employment and trying to push demand beyond our ability to supply however since the goal of the policy is to get to full employment there is no point in continuing it beyond that it s a bit like saying that if you continue to pump air into a tire it will eventually explode yeah that s kind of why you stop you only wanted to be able to drive on it again evaluating the mainstream criticisms i opened with the fact that i could no longer sit quietly and listen to the baseless criticisms for my own peace of mind i had to say something with the summary of mmt aka macroeconomics done properly complete i ll now review the comments of drs krugman summers and rogoff the reason for numbering items above was to allow easy reference below this may get a bit long as i feel obliged to quote them entirely in their critical statements here goes paul krugman running on mmt wonkish that s the title and i m going to admit that it s clever pet peeve wonkish always annoys me as it implies i m clever and so you might not understand what i m about to say just say it but no harm done and touché suppose that the fed or its equivalent in another country can set interest rates and that a lower interest rate leads other things equal to higher aggregate demand i maybe should have picked a different krugman piece as this one is going to be quick and easy in the real world demand it notoriously insensitive to changes in interest rates this isn t mmt but the result of study after study even in orthodoxy here s one by the federal reserve and so from the get go if we do not buy into this assumption the rest of the article is meaningless since it builds on it as an aside krugman uses a model that is so oversimplified is lm that even it s inventor wasn t keen on anyone using it outside of maybe an undergraduate econ class lawrence summers and altered economic conditions have led to the development of new economic ideas that reflect a significant break with previous orthodoxy the break with economic orthodoxy took place decades and decades ago mmt and company is not a result of current economic conditions and now these new ideas are being oversimplified and exaggerated by fringe economists who hold them out as offering the proverbial free lunch the ability of the government to spend more without imposing any burden on anyone fringe economists no comment however yes there is such a thing as a free lunch as dr summers own school of thought states in economic orthodoxy if you are operating inside the production possibility frontier i e at less than full capacity then you can produce more without giving up anything however economic orthodoxy simply assumes that the economy will rush to full employment and this will not become an issue see 1 modern monetary theory sometimes shortened to mmt is the supply side economics of our time a valid idea that traditional fiscal policy taboos need to be rethought in an era of low real interest rates mmt has nothing to do with an era of low real interest rates if the current prime rate were 25 and inflation were 0 absolutely nothing under points 1 through 13 would be affected continuing that quote a valid idea that traditional fiscal policy taboos need to be rethought in an era of low real interest rates has been stretched by fringe economists into ludicrous claims that massive spending on job guarantees can be financed by central banks without any burden on the economy fringe economists see above this goes back to the free lunch thing why would there be a burden from employing the unemployed the great depression was a burden the great recession was a burden full employment is not a burden first it holds out the prospect that somehow by printing money the government can finance its deficits at zero cost regardless of it s veracity it s irrelevant when the any cost could be met see 7 second contrary to the claims of modern monetary theorists it is not true that governments can simply create new money to pay all liabilities coming due and avoid default as the experience of any number of emerging markets demonstrates past a certain point this approach leads to hyperinflation two points 1 it is only inflationary when it is continued beyond full employment see 13 and 2 printing money cannot cause inflation spending money can but printing it cannot and don t forget that the private sector can create money too third modern monetary theorists typically reason in terms of a closed economy but a policy of relying on central bank finance of government deficits as suggested by modern monetary theorists would likely result in a collapsing exchange rate possibly if we had inflation referenced above but see 13 again this is not just theory numerous emerging markets have found contrary to modern monetary theory that they could not print money to cover even their domestic currency liabilities the same is true of industrial economies the mitterrand government in france in 1981 and the schröder government in germany in 1998 began with mmt type approaches to policy and were forced to reverse course the british and italians both had to call in the international monetary fund during the mid 1970s because of excessive reliance on inflationary finance yes it is just theory and flawed theory at that this just goes back to the whole inflation argument all over again but for neither the right nor the left is there any such thing as a free lunch yes there is even according to your own school of thought at less than full employment kenneth rogoff a number of leading us progressives who may well be in power after the 2020 elections advocate using the fed s balance sheet as a cash cow to fund expansive new social programs especially in view of current low inflation and interest rates this demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding the desire to use the government s ability to fund social programs has absolutely nothing to do with inflation and interest rates being low see 5 and 13 if investors become more reluctant to hold a country s debt they probably will not be too thrilled about holding its currency either not really since the fed could still ultimately buy it but okay i ll play why would they be reluctant to hold the debt of a country at full employment see 5 and 9 if that country tries to dump a lot of it on the market inflation will result there are a number of debatable issues here but i ll just go to this one why would a country divest itself of debt issued by a nation running at full employment see 9 even moving to a centrally planned economy perhaps the goal for some mmt supporters would not solve this problem this was a thinly veiled attack he clearly knows that no one has suggested this hence his perhaps actually kenneth rogoff is a very nice man i served on a panel with him last spring at the us naval war college to be honest it just makes me kind of sad that he would say something like that rather than sticking to the premises and structure of the arguments true debt cannot rise faster than gdp forever but it may do so for quite a while this is drawn from a longer paragraph but it never said any more than this so i hope professor rogoff agrees that this sentence is key true why dr rogoff continues this same line of attack for the next several paragraphs clearly operating on the assumption that the us must borrow to finance spending this is a fundamental misunderstanding of government budgeting see 4 5 and 7 i am reminded of drs reinhard and rogoff s paper on the dangers of debt which was later shown to have serious and suspiciously hypothesis confirming spreadsheet errors when those errors were corrected the correlation between debt and slow growth disappeared there are more scholarly discussions of this but the colbert report coverage is the most entertaining the last paragraph of this piece continues the name calling and guilt by association that began with the central planning comment conclusions am i glad i spent the last four five six hours writing this actually i am i don t think i ll ever do it again but i learned something john maynard keynes wrote in the preface to the general theory incidentally keynes and keynesian are not the same thing long story the composition of this book has been for the author a long struggle of escape and so must the reading of it be for most readers if the author s assault upon them is to be successful a struggle of escape from habitual modes of thought and expression the ideas which are here expressed so laboriously are extremely simple and should be obvious the difficulty lies not in the new ideas but in escaping from the old ones which ramify for those brought up as most of us have been into every corner of our minds as i read through the criticisms by krugman summers and rogoff i kept thinking of keynes words those prominent economists aren t even so much rejecting mmt as holding tight to their own orthodox views this is not necessarily on purpose but it s extremely difficult for anyone to make a paradigm shift mmt aka macroeconomics done properly is as keynes says extremely simple and should be obvious the problem we have here is the difficulty in escaping from antiquated notions of macro modeling krugman inflation summers and debt financing rogoff this will make for a nice lesson in my contending perspectives in economics class

was 3 8 million compared with 26 1 million in 2017 cash flow before financing activities at hamilton beach brands decreased to 11 3 million from 22 6 million in 2017 primarily due to higher inventory

million and operating profit of 26 5 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 despite being well positioned for the fall holiday selling season with strong placements and solid promotional support at many retailers revenue declined from a year ago primarily as a result of lower sales volume in the u s consumer market the reduced volume was due to lower than anticipated reorders in the u s e commerce channel as well as decreased sales by a number of retailers at brick and mortar stores the decrease in operating profit in the fourth quarter of 2018 was primarily attributable to the lower revenue and to a lesser extent higher consumer advertising transportation and warehousing expenses higher product costs were mitigated by higher selling prices that were implemented throughout the year hamilton beach brands business is seasonal and a majority of revenue and operating profit typically occurs in the second half of the year due to the fall holiday selling season during this peak season in 2018 hamilton beach brands continued to experience solid momentum from its strategic initiatives to drive growth in new areas the company s only the best products which are sold under the wolf gourmet weston hamilton beach professional and chi brand names delivered double digit revenue growth international and commercial revenues also showed strong increases in the second half of 2018

s small kitchen appliance industry for units sold and unit share in the total market and the e commerce channel for the 2018 full year hamilton beach brands revenue increased 3 to 633 8 million

and global commercial markets operating profit in 2018 decreased to 39 6 million compared with 41 5 million in 2017 primarily due to higher operating warehousing and transportation expenses hamilton beach brands segment outlook changing consumer buying patterns including an increasing percentage of consumers who are purchasing housewares online create both opportunities and uncertainty for the growth prospects within the small appliance category and for individual retailers and industry participants in 2019 the u s industry market for small kitchen appliances is expected to grow modestly

expected to be approximately 4 5 million in 2019 the tariffs enacted by the united states in july and september of 2018 on imports from china impact a small number of hamilton beach brands products representing approximately 10 of total product purchases virtually all of which has been mitigated through pricing adjustments hamilton beach brands continues to closely monitor potential future

collection operated 189 stores compared with 210 stores at december 31 2017 the decrease in revenue and operating profit was primarily due to lower comparable store sales from reduced customer traffic which resulted in a decline in the number of store transactions the average sales transaction value increased modestly as a result of product and promotional offerings for the fall holiday selling season while the closure of 22 underperforming stores since december 31 2017 contributed to the revenue decline the closures had a modestly positive effect on operating profit as a result of store
