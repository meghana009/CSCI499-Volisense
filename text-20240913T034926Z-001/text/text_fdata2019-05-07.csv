mainly as a result of lower operating earnings partially offset by a decrease in income tax expense capital expenditures capital expenditures was 264 8 million for q1 2019 compared with 246 9 million for the same period last year mainly due to increased spending at our u s projects offset by lower spending at tasiast operating results mine by mine summaries for 2019 first quarter operating results may be found on pages eight and 12 of this news release highlights include the following americas paracatu continued its strong performance achieving record quarterly production and the lowest cost of sales per ounce sold since q4 2010 recoveries remained strong during the quarter while improvements in grade control higher mill efficiencies and increased mill throughput contributed to the record production cost of sales per ounce sold decreased year over year due to lower operating waste mined favourable foreign exchange movements and lower power costs cost of sales per ounce sold decreased quarter over quarter mainly due to lower maintenance costs reduced contractor and tire costs and lower power costs at round mountain production was lower compared with q4 2018 mainly due to lower mill throughput as the site mined harder ore during the quarter and fewer ounces produced from the heap leach pads lower mill grades also contributed to the lower production compared with q1 2018 cost of sales per ounce sold was lower compared with both periods mainly due to a decrease in operating waste mined at bald mountain production was largely in line compared with the previous quarter and was lower compared with q1 2018 mainly due to the timing of ounces recovered from the heap leach pads cost of sales per ounce sold was lower quarter over quarter mainly due to lower operating waste mined and higher year over year as a result of a decrease in gold produced from the heap leach partially offset by lower operating waste mined at fort knox production decreased as anticipated with q1 2019 performance reflecting the mining and reduced milling strategy at the mine the lower production versus the previous quarter and year was due to the combined effects of lower mill tonnages the timing of heap leach recoveries the continued effects of the pit wall slide in q1 2018 and geotechnical instability as a result of higher than average rainfall in the second half of 2018 the lower production contributed to the higher cost of sales per ounce sold quarter over quarter and year over year at maricunga gold production was better than expected as rinsing of heap materials placed on the pads prior to the suspension of mining activities continued during the quarter cost of sales per ounce sold was lower compared with q4 2018 and q1 2018 mainly due to lower processing costs russia at kupol and dvoinoye production increased quarter over quarter and year over year mainly due to higher grades at kupol cost of sales per ounce sold increased compared with q4 2018 largely due to higher operating waste mined and higher operating costs at dvoinoye increased fuel costs also contributed to higher cost of sales versus q1 2018 which was partially offset by lower labour costs and favourable foreign exchange movements development at the dvoinoye zone 1 deposit is proceeding on schedule and production is expected to commence in mid 2019 west africa tasiast achieved another record production quarter and decreased cost of sales per ounce as the site continues to benefit from the phase one expansion excellent mill throughput rates which exceeded expectations and higher mill grades and recoveries contributed to the increased production and lower cost per ounce decreases in contractor expense and maintenance supplies also contributed to the lower cost per ounce which were at their lowest level since q1 2011 chirano continued to perform well with production mainly in line with q4 2018 production was lower versus q1 2018 mainly due to an expected decrease in grades cost of sales per ounce sold was higher quarter over quarter and year over year mainly due to higher operating waste mined as the site re started open pit mining during the quarter organic development projects and opportunities tasiast phased expansion tasiast continued its strong performance since the completion of the phase one expansion the mine achieved record quarterly production and decreased cost of sales per ounce as the new sag mill continued to outperform with throughput during q1 2019 averaging approximately 15 000 tonnes per day tpd excluding the planned mill shutdown days for relining and inspection while the phase two expansion remains a viable option kinross is targeting the second half of 2019 to complete an evaluation of lower cost alternative approaches to increase throughput and preserve and potentially enhance the overall value proposition this includes taking into account the strong phase one performance and increasing throughput to 30 000 tpd the evaluation also includes opportunities for an initial incremental step to increase throughput to above 20 000 tpd at a significantly lower capital cost through de bottlenecking continuous improvement and further optimization of the current processing circuit the company is advancing the project financing for tasiast as due diligence activities and discussions regarding commercial terms continue to progress well kinross is seeking to obtain a total of 300 million in financing from export development canada the international financial corporation and two commercial banks and is targeting completion of the financing in the second half of 2019 round mountain phase w the round mountain phase w project is near completion and continues to be on schedule and on budget construction of the new heap leach pad is now complete with phase w ore currently being placed on the pads commissioning of the processing circuit has commenced ahead of schedule with initial solution being applied to the pads to prepare for completion of the vertical carbon in column vcic plant which is approximately 80 complete construction of mine infrastructure including the truck shop warehouse wash bay and fuel island is now 60 complete click here for video highlighting phase w development bald mountain vantage complex the bald mountain vantage complex project is well advanced as the vcic plant is approximately 70 complete and the heap leach pad is approximately 90 complete with ore being placed on completed portions of the pad while unusually severe winter weather has challenged the project budget and schedule commissioning of the processing circuit commenced as scheduled at the end of q1 2019 with solution now being applied on the heap to build solution grade the project cost forecast is now expected to be approximately 130 million mainly due to weather challenges higher than anticipated construction contract rates and issues with the supply of some of the fabricated components construction of support infrastructure including the truck shop warehouse and wash bay is 60 complete an operations readiness task force has been established to ensure a smooth transition of the project to operations fort knox gilmore the fort knox gilmore project is progressing on schedule and on budget with initial ore expected in early 2020 procurement and contracting for 2019 heap construction activities are proceeding well with the majority of contracts issued and awarded and contractors mobilizing to site stripping is on schedule to commence in q3 2019 with expansion of the dewatering system continuing

case of kupol a build up of inventory due to transportation logistics the company uses adjusted operating cash flow internally as a measure of the underlying operating cash flow performance and future

consolidated production cost of sales per equivalent ounce sold 683 659 attributable production cost of sales per equivalent ounce sold 682 658 attributable production cost of sales per ounce sold on a by product basis is a non gaap measure which calculates the company s non gold production as a credit against its per ounce production costs rather than converting its non gold production into gold equivalent ounces and crediting it to total production as is the case in co product accounting management believes that this measure provides investors with the ability to better evaluate kinross

with leases after a company s adoption of ifrs 16 leases should be treated although the wgc is not a mining industry regulatory organization it worked closely with its member companies to develop these non gaap measures adoption of the all in sustaining cost and all in cost metrics is voluntary and not necessarily standard and therefore these measures presented by the company may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers the company believes that the all in sustaining cost and all in cost measures complement existing measures reported by kinross all in sustaining cost includes both operating and capital costs required to sustain gold production on an ongoing basis the value of silver sold is deducted from the total production cost of sales as it is considered residual production sustaining operating costs represent expenditures incurred at current operations that are considered necessary to maintain current production sustaining capital

mainly as a result of lower operating earnings partially offset by a decrease in income tax expense capital expenditures capital expenditures was 264 8 million for q1 2019 compared with 246 9 million for the same period last year mainly due to increased spending at our u s projects offset by lower spending at tasiast operating results mine by mine summaries for 2019 first quarter operating results may be found on pages eight and 12 of this news release highlights include the following americas paracatu continued its strong performance achieving record quarterly production and the lowest cost of sales per ounce sold since q4 2010 recoveries remained strong during the quarter while improvements in grade control higher mill efficiencies and increased mill throughput contributed to the record production cost of sales per ounce sold decreased year over year due to lower operating waste mined favourable foreign exchange movements and lower power costs cost of sales per ounce sold decreased quarter over quarter mainly due to lower maintenance costs reduced contractor and tire costs and lower power costs at round mountain production was lower compared with q4 2018 mainly due to lower mill throughput as the site mined harder ore during the quarter and fewer ounces produced from the heap leach pads lower mill grades also contributed to the lower production compared with q1 2018 cost of sales per ounce sold was lower compared with both periods mainly due to a decrease in operating waste mined at bald mountain production was largely in line compared with the previous quarter and was lower compared with q1 2018 mainly due to the timing of ounces recovered from the heap leach pads cost of sales per ounce sold was lower quarter over quarter mainly due to lower operating waste mined and higher year over year as a result of a decrease in gold produced from the heap leach partially offset by lower operating waste mined at fort knox production decreased as anticipated with q1 2019 performance reflecting the mining and reduced milling strategy at the mine the lower production versus the previous quarter and year was due to the combined effects of lower mill tonnages the timing of heap leach recoveries the continued effects of the pit wall slide in q1 2018 and geotechnical instability as a result of higher than average rainfall in the second half of 2018 the lower production contributed to the higher cost of sales per ounce sold quarter over quarter and year over year at maricunga gold production was better than expected as rinsing of heap materials placed on the pads prior to the suspension of mining activities continued during the quarter cost of sales per ounce sold was lower compared with q4 2018 and q1 2018 mainly due to lower processing costs russia at kupol and dvoinoye production increased quarter over quarter and year over year mainly due to higher grades at kupol cost of sales per ounce sold increased compared with q4 2018 largely due to higher operating waste mined and higher operating costs at dvoinoye increased fuel costs also contributed to higher cost of sales versus q1 2018 which was partially offset by lower labour costs and favourable foreign exchange movements development at the dvoinoye zone 1 deposit is proceeding on schedule and production is expected to commence in mid 2019 west africa tasiast achieved another record production quarter and decreased cost of sales per ounce as the site continues to benefit from the phase one expansion excellent mill throughput rates which exceeded expectations and higher mill grades and recoveries contributed to the increased production and lower cost per ounce decreases in contractor expense and maintenance supplies also contributed to the lower cost per ounce which were at their lowest level since q1 2011 chirano continued to perform well with production mainly in line with q4 2018 production was lower versus q1 2018 mainly due to an expected decrease in grades cost of sales per ounce sold was higher quarter over quarter and year over year mainly due to higher operating waste mined as the site re started open pit mining during the quarter organic development projects and opportunities tasiast phased expansion tasiast continued its strong performance since the completion of the phase one expansion the mine achieved record quarterly production and decreased cost of sales per ounce as the new sag mill continued to outperform with throughput during q1 2019 averaging approximately 15 000 tonnes per day tpd excluding the planned mill shutdown days for relining and inspection while the phase two expansion remains a viable option kinross is targeting the second half of 2019 to complete an evaluation of lower cost alternative approaches to increase throughput and preserve and potentially enhance the overall value proposition this includes taking into account the strong phase one performance and increasing throughput to 30 000 tpd the evaluation also includes opportunities for an initial incremental step to increase throughput to above 20 000 tpd at a significantly lower capital cost through de bottlenecking continuous improvement and further optimization of the current processing circuit the company is advancing the project financing for tasiast as due diligence activities and discussions regarding commercial terms continue to progress well kinross is seeking to obtain a total of 300 million in financing from export development canada the international financial corporation and two commercial banks and is targeting completion of the financing in the second half of 2019 round mountain phase w the round mountain phase w project is near completion and continues to be on schedule and on budget construction of the new heap leach pad is now complete with phase w ore currently being placed on the pads commissioning of the processing circuit has commenced ahead of schedule with initial solution being applied to the pads to prepare for completion of the vertical carbon in column vcic plant which is approximately 80 complete construction of mine infrastructure including the truck shop warehouse wash bay and fuel island is now 60 complete click here for video highlighting phase w development bald mountain vantage complex the bald mountain vantage complex project is well advanced as the vcic plant is approximately 70 complete and the heap leach pad is approximately 90 complete with ore being placed on completed portions of the pad while unusually severe winter weather has challenged the project budget and schedule commissioning of the processing circuit commenced as scheduled at the end of q1 2019 with solution now being applied on the heap to build solution grade the project cost forecast is now expected to be approximately 130 million mainly due to weather challenges higher than anticipated construction contract rates and issues with the supply of some of the fabricated components construction of support infrastructure including the truck shop warehouse and wash bay is 60 complete an operations readiness task force has been established to ensure a smooth transition of the project to operations fort knox gilmore the fort knox gilmore project is progressing on schedule and on budget with initial ore expected in early 2020 procurement and contracting for 2019 heap construction activities are

measures together with measures determined in accordance with ifrs provide investors with an improved ability to evaluate the underlying performance of the company the inclusion of these measures is meant to provide additional information and should not be used as a substitute for performance measures prepared in accordance with ifrs these measures are not necessarily standard and therefore may

and other transactions and non hedge derivative gains and losses although some of the items are recurring the company believes that they are not reflective of the underlying operating performance of its current business and are not necessarily indicative of future operating results management believes that these measures which are used internally to assess performance and in planning and forecasting future operating results provide investors with the ability to better evaluate underlying performance particularly since the excluded items are typically not included in public guidance

operations excluding certain impacts which the company believes are not reflective of the company s regular operating cash flow and excluding changes in working capital working capital can be volatile due to numerous factors including the timing of tax payments and in the case of kupol a build up of inventory due to transportation logistics the company uses adjusted operating cash flow internally

sold 682 658 attributable production cost of sales per ounce sold on a by product basis is a non gaap measure which calculates the company s non gold production as a credit against its per ounce production costs rather than converting its non gold production into gold equivalent ounces and crediting it to total production as is the case in co product accounting management believes that this measure provides investors with the ability to better evaluate kinross production cost of sales per ounce on a comparable basis with other major gold producers who routinely calculate their cost of sales per ounce using by product accounting rather than co product accounting the following table provides a reconciliation of attributable production cost of sales per ounce sold on a by product

sustaining costs and all in costs to address how the costs associated with leases after a company s adoption of ifrs 16 leases should be treated although the wgc is not a mining industry regulatory organization it worked closely with its member companies to develop these non gaap measures adoption of the all in sustaining cost and all in cost metrics is voluntary and not necessarily standard and therefore these measures presented by the company may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers the company believes that the all in sustaining cost and all in cost measures complement existing measures reported by kinross all in sustaining cost includes both operating and capital costs required to sustain gold production on an ongoing basis the value of silver sold is deducted from the total production cost of sales as it is considered residual production sustaining operating costs represent expenditures incurred at current operations that are considered necessary to maintain current production sustaining capital represents capital expenditures at existing operations comprising mine development costs and ongoing replacement of mine equipment and other capital facilities and does not include capital expenditures for major growth projects or enhancement capital for significant infrastructure improvements at existing operations all in cost is comprised of all in sustaining cost as well as operating expenditures incurred at locations with no current operation or costs related to other non sustaining activities and capital expenditures for major growth

overview news that the us tariff escalation did not scupper trade talks with china has helped the global capital markets stabilize today china s vice premier liu he is still leading a delegation to the us most asian equities recouped part of yesterday s losses including china hong kong taiwan australia and singapore japanese and korean markets were closed on monday and bore some selling pressure today european markets are mixed leaving the dow jones stoxx 600 little changed through the european morning the s p 500 which trended higher after gapping lower at the open is trading around 0 3 weaker today european bonds yields are two three basis points lower today and the german 10 year yield is back below zero after disappointing factory orders australian yields backed up and the australian dollar firmed after the central bank left the cash rate steady at 1 5 the yen and scandis are trading firmer but the other majors are mostly little changed but softer among emerging markets the turkish lira remains under pressures follow a judicial ruling to re hold istanbul elections the south african rand is steady ahead of tomorrow s elections asia pacific chinese officials hesitated at first and waivered about how to proceed in the wake of the end of the tariff truce signaled by trump s weekend tweets on the surface china appeared to absorb the body blow and proceed with the trade talks later this week the us claims that in the negotiations china seemed to go back issues that the us team thought were already resolved the us team pushed back and then saw new language in a draft which confirmed what it saw as backsliding according to the americans the issue revolved around china s commitment to change its laws ostensibly with implications for its forced technology transfers and corporate espionage japan returned from a long holiday it has a new emperor there was favorable economic news april s manufacturing pmi showed a small increase in the preliminary report to 49 5 from 49 2 in march this played on fears that after recovering in q4 18 from a q3 18 contraction the world s third largest economy is struggling to find traction first quarter gdp will not be released until may 19 but many expect that the economy shrank the good news was the upward revision in april s pmi to 50 2 a three month high a bloomberg poll showed 14 of 26 surveyed expected the reserve bank of australia to cut rates today but governor lowe led a standpat meeting the decision was justified by inflation forecasts and the rba sees cpi at 1 75 this year and 2 0 next the monetary policy statement at the end of the week may help investors and economists re set expectations the market has not given up on a rate cut this year and judging from the ois appears to have it nearly priced by the end of q3 investors will likely take their cues going forward from the labor market and price developments separately australia reported a slightly smaller march trade surplus a 4 95 bln after a 5 1 bln in february and a little better retail sales reported than expected 0 3 vs 0 2 expected after a 0 6 gain in february excluding inflation volume terms australian retail sales in q1 fell 0 1 economists had expected a 0 3 gain after q4 18 was revised to flat from 0 1 the australian dollar is the strongest of the majors it has recouped yesterday s 0 4 decline in full where at its worst yesterday it slipped below 0 6965 its lowest level in four months today it reached almost 0 7050 in the initial reaction to the rba s decision the gains have been pared a move back below 0 7000 would embolden the bears the dollar had not traded below jpy111 since april 11 and yesterday gapped below there the gap remains open and we expect the market will now try to fill it the dollar has been confined to a little more than a third of a yen above jpy110 55 it almost reached jpy110 25 yesterday after a sharp drop yesterday the chinese yuan recovered today though implied volatility remains firm last week s high for the dollar was near cny6 75 today s low was a little below cny6 76 chinese reserves were reported little changed after the domestic markets closed but will not be a market factor europe german factory orders disappointed the march increase the first in three months of 0 6 was less than half of what economists expected after a stunning 4 2 fall in february the idea that the strength of the service sector both ifo and pmi have it several months highs shows the resilience of the domestic economy while the weakness in manufacturing reflects trade disruptions china slowing and turkey economic woes is questioned by today s data domestic orders fell 4 2 foreign orders rose by the same amount tomorrow germany will report industrial output figures first quarter gdp will be published on may 15 the cross party talks between the uk government and labour resume today reports suggest may is offering the first substantial concessions to labour hope is predicated on the desperation of may and corbyn after the local election drubbing and the success of the pro eu lib dems and greens the cross party talks are seen as the last opportunity to avoid a more dire situation the progress of these talks will likely be a key determinant of sterling in the coming days the swedish krona slumped to its lowest level against the euro in a decade yesterday and is recovering a little today the riksbank had to turn a bit more dovish in the face of the soft inflation reports the manufacturing pmi softened in april and it is vulnerable to global trade disruptions and the risk off mood after the presidential tweets today s macro news is not better in fact it is worse than expected private sector output in mach fell by 0 5 the impact was partly blunted by the february series revision to 0 4 from zero on the other hand march industrial orders imploded falling 4 9 month over month it was the third consecutive decline leaving orders some 8 1 lower than a year ago technically the euro looks stretched and a break below sek10 67 may indicate a high is in place the euro reached almost 1 1220 before sellers reemerged support is seen ahead of 1 1180 the broad range may be indicated by the two sets of options expiring today there are 1 1 bln euros struck at 1 1150 and about 565 mln euros at 1 1265 the firmer tone sterling enjoyed in asia has been reversed in the european morning pushing it back to yesterday s lows near 1 3085 here too the expiring options may give a sense of the broad range there are roughly gbp515 mln struck at 1 3025 and gbp270 mln at 1 3130 the dollar reached almost try6 20 today after closing last week a little below try5 97 america the us china negotiations are the main talking points today as businesses investors and policymakers digest the latest developments officials have indicated the tariffs announced in the tweets on sunday will go into effect 12 01 am on may 10 the us china trade talks are to resume may 9 and carry over the next day there was some push back that industry needs more warning but the administration argued that the president has long warned that the 10 tariffs on 200 bln of chinese imports could go up to 25 the tariffs on the other 350 bln of chinese goods that trump threatened with a 25 levy will need to have public hearings and comment period which means that they are not imminent the federal reserve stepped up its warnings over leveraged loans covenants and lender protections have deteriorated over the past six months there have been many media and analysts reports on this sector yet default rates remain low and some attribute it to the still accommodative monetary policy canada s ivey pmi will draw attention today after the markit version showed a slump to 49 7 from 50 5 in march the markit measure increased only once since last july the ivey version has not been below 50 boom bust since july 2016 it has risen four times since last july including in march when it rose to

this article was first published 4 years ago on gold buying occasions such as akshaya tritiya chiraj mehta points out investors are often confronted with the question should i make just a token purchase or should i buy more towards building my allocation in the yellow metal photograph leonhard foeger reuters one of gold s most admirable qualities is its unchanging nature not only does it retain its shape and characteristics more importantly it also preserves its value over the long term as financial commentator peter a burshre once commented regardless of the dollar price involved one ounce of gold would purchase a good quality man s suit at the conclusion of the revolutionary war the civil war the presidency of franklin roosevelt and today no wonder this imperishable and non diminishing asset is synonymous with akshaya tritiya a day meant to mark prosperity and wealth in indian culture but while we indians love gold it s time we evolved from amateur consumers of gold to intelligent investors in the yellow metal one should adopt a staggered approach to purchasing gold in order to enjoy the benefit of lower average costs a 10 allocation to it at all times also makes an investor s portfolio well diversified however on gold buying occasions such as akshaya tritiya investors are often confronted with the question should i make just a token purchase or should i buy more towards building my allocation in the yellow metal macro economic backdrop is favourable this akshaya tritiya seems like a good time to load up on the yellow metal as the risk reward dynamics favour the yellow metal while the downside appears limited the year 2018 was the first time central banks tried to remove some liquidity from the markets after a decade of providing stimulus they have tried to get out of this low interest rate trap but they aren t able to the market has become addicted to cheap liquidity it doesn t look like that is going to change anytime soon the world continues to remain in a state of great disequilibrium both with respect to the global economy and geopolitics such a scenario should be constructive for gold in the medium to long term strength of dollar acting as impediment despite a rosier outlook gold s gains have so far been impeded by the dollar s strength and rising risk appetite which is diverting flows towards equities the us economic momentum fuelled earlier by stimulus tax cuts and cheap liquidity is clearly facing headwinds the us economy isn t doing very well but that has not prevented the dollar from gaining value the market s appetite for us dollars is driven by a few factors mainly the relative performance of its economy equity markets and bond yields but most importantly by growth abroad while us interest rates are falling the real yield differential moved in favour of the dollar because the economic outlook for the rest of the world is even worse buoyant us equity markets have been attracting significant flows thereby further supporting the dollar but with rate hikes off the table the slowdown in earnings growth may soon start reflecting in the equity markets reducing another support for the dollar the price of gold and the strength of the dollar have a clear inverse relationship there has been a constant deterioration in the quality of the dollar as a reserve currency due to historic debt levels and the fed s unorthodox monetary policies in a scenario where other major currencies like the euro and yen are plagued with problems of their own no currency is in a state to dethrone the dollar immediately but many countries want to put an end to the dominance of the us and have hence entered into non dollar bilateral agreements thus a reduction in dollar s share in international payments looks imminent recognising that the rules of the international monetary system are changing the relevance of gold is rising fed s policy turn could provide a boost if the fed takes a u turn in policy as a response to slowing growth lower inflation or falling asset prices by beginning to cut rates or if it adopts further unconventional measures like quantitative easing qe it will be perceived by the markets as central banks being caught in a trap due to which they will not be able to normalise monetary policy this will provide a big boost to gold us eu trade war brewing if one goes by the comments of the leaders of the two nations a us china trade deal seems a given and has been priced in by the markets to a large extent however that doesn t mark the end to trump s trade wars while one seems to be drawing to a close another is brewing the european union has said it s preparing retaliatory tariffs against the us over subsidies to boeing this has significantly escalated transatlantic trade tensions the threat of new european retaliatory tariffs comes hours after washington vowed to hit the eu with duties over its support for the airbus trump is threatening tariffs on various eu products including car and car part imports an intensification of the eu us trade war could soon impact global markets these developments could undermine confidence and investments in risky assets thus pushing up demand for gold slowing global growth world leaders the international monetary fund and central bank chiefs across the globe are all speaking of slower growth just the end of qe globally has pushed the financial world over a cliff increase in interest rates lower liquidity and trade wars are leading to economic adjustments that the world is nowhere prepared for use and abuse of unconventional monetary tools by central banks has led to extreme economic conditions becoming the new normal this ill conceived and unsustainable policy making will provide a big boost to gold prices in the medium to long term gold has traditionally been a major beneficiary of crumbling faith in the monetary authority due to its inverse relationship with paper assets like stocks and currencies something that is unlikely to change given this macroeconomic picture gold will be a useful portfolio diversification tool that can reduce overall portfolio risk move beyond physical gold to make the move from consumer to investor it is imperative now for us to move beyond our obsession with physical gold this inefficient preference for holding physical gold has prevented investors from optimising their gold investments not only do you end up paying a high price for this obsession it is also prone to a number of risks the most important one being that related to purity at the retail level gold is primarily bought for two reasons adornment and investment both are very distinct needs and consumers will benefit if they realise that they are best met by different forms of gold physical gold like jewellery coins and bars are best suited for adornment and gifting that is self consumption while financial forms are a preferable avenue for investment so this akshaya tritiya pick your gold

menafn colombo gazette former us ambassador to sri lanka robert o blake jr said that sri lanka can learn from mistakes america made after 9 11 speaking in colombo robert o blake jr said that experts believe the us over reacted by expanding government surveillance without appropriate constitutional checks by extended detentions at guantánamo bay that circumscribed the legal rights of detainees and by extraordinary renditions and interrogations all of which gave rise to questions of what the limits of government power should be in times of crisis our system of checks and balances ultimately righted most of these wrongs and the press had a powerful role to play in exposing excesses and wrong doing he said delivering a speech at the pathfinder foundation joint apparel association forum of sri lanka held at the bmich in colombo full speech setting the table the importance of the indo pacific i return to sri lanka with mixed emotions it is wonderful to be back in sri lanka and to see the many positive changes that have taken place in the ten years since i departed sri lanka and i appreciate the hospitality and leadership of my old friend milinda and the dynamic role of the pathfinder foundation but i and sri lanka s many friends in the us were also deeply saddened by the horrific easter sunday attacks that took the lives of so many and threatened to open new cleavages in sri lanka more on that later in my speech milinda asked me to talk about sri lanka s place in the administration s indo pacific vision as we look ahead how china is viewed in the us and the implications of all this for the future of us sl relations if there is any one thing that has changed dramatically in the last 10 years it is the growing predominance of china in asia on many fronts and the hostile and increasingly bipartisan reaction to these developments in washington everyone seems to focus on the trade frictions between the us and china but that is just one facet of a much larger and increasingly hostile competition between the us and china washington s list of concerns includes but is not limited to the following the influence of china s belt and road initiative and the debt labor and other impacts it has had on recipient countries china s militarization of disputed islands in the south china sea china s growing surveillance state powered by artificial intelligence and propagated by companies such as huawei chinese theft of us company intellectual property chinese cyber attacks and cyber theft china s suppression of its uighur population the growing role of the chinese communist party and soes the widening gap between what chinese citizens and companies can do in the west as against what westerners are permitted in china underlying many of these concerns is a growing understanding that the us may have made a misguided strategic bet about china when then president clinton made the case that the us should support china s entry into the wto even though china was not yet a market economy he and most americans myself included believed that as china prospered as its middle class grew as more and more chinese traveled and studied abroad china would over time become more of a market economy and become more democratic today most americans see that this strategic calculation was wrong under xi jinping we have seen a strengthening of the role of the communist party a doubling down on the role of the state and soes in china s economy and the strengthening of china s surveillance state not only is china not a more liberal market economy it is often seeking to promote its illiberal governance model overseas most asian countries acknowledge and even share many of these concerns but they also do not want to be asked to make a choice between the united states and china they particularly want to benefit from the massive resources china is extending under its ambitious belt and road initiative china s ambassador to the us published an oped in forbes two weeks ago in which he summarized the vast scope of bri according to the ambassador 126 countries and 29 international organizations having signed bri cooperation documents with china total trade between china and other belt and road countries has exceeded 6 trillion and china s investment in these countries hassurpassed 80 billion to put these figures into context china committed 113 b in bri financing in 2017 which substantially exceeded the commitments of the world bank and adb combined but increasingly we find pushback from bri recipients debt diplomacy the case of sri lanka s own port of hanbantota has become a watchword for the rest of the world that countries must make sure they choose projects that have solid internal rates of return that will enable them to service the debt owed to china or they will face chinese pressures to convert that debt to equity labor issues every recipient country also grapples with chinese pressure to use chinese labor on these bri projects when almost every country has surplus labor of their own for whom they want to provide opportunities for work lack of transparency most bri projects also face criticism for the lack of transparency about the financial terms of the loans the extent of chinese labor and other such sensitive issues environmental concerns wri published a recent analysis of bri lending from 2014 17 found that chinese energy and transport projects in bri countries did not align with the low carbon priorities recipient countries outlined in their paris pledges what are recipient countries to do first the countries involved in bri must be more forceful and clearer in negotiating with the chinese this is already happening the wsj recently reported that last year myanmar renegotiated terms for a 7 3 billion chinese funded deep water port and industrial zone shrinking the scope of the project and slashing the country s future debt burden to its economic powerhouse neighbor pakistan malaysia myanmar bangladesh and sierra leone also have backed away from bri projects likewise the maldives has announced its own review of bri contracts undertaken by the previous government to ensure it is servicing only the debt for the true value of the projects undertaken not for the inflated cost of what the new government alleges were large corrupt kickbacks on both sides in indonesia where i served as ambassador from 2013 16 the signature bri program is jakarta bandung high speed rail many questioned the need for a 6 billion rail line given so many other infrastructure needs indonesian ministers have criticized the high speed rail project for being opaque and non transparent complaining that even cabinet members are having trouble getting data and information the good news is that china is beginning to respond to these concerns in a speech on april 26 to mark the latest bri conference president xi jinping told the conference that everything should be done in a transparent way and we should have zero tolerance for corruption and we also need to ensure the commercial and fiscal sustainability of all projects so that they will achieve the intended goals as planned in another sign of greater transparency xi said china would welcome the participation of multilateral and international financial institutions in belt and road investment and financing the chinese also pledged to defuse tensions with belt and road recipients expressing willingness in principle to renegotiate debts beijing decided to forgive ethiopia s interest payments owed through the end of 2018 there are other signs china is sensitive to the criticism it has received china itself and unep have formed international coalition for green development on the belt and road to make bri greener and more sustainable the coalition includes all the major environmental groups bri countries and key chinese businesses who are major bri contractors batang toru example part of a coalition with global wildlife conservation wwf and others letter by cong henry waxman and others boc said in march by announcing it would review its loan so china is listening the test will come whether we see concrete changes implemented so how has the us sought to advance its interests in the asia pacific and respond to china s growing influence in some ways the trump administration has responded well to china s increased diplomatic and infrastructure promotion efforts first recognizing that it is not enough to simply criticize bri from the sidelines the administration and congress understood that the us and other partners must provide alternatives so partner countries have choices last october the build act was signed into law it created a new u s international development finance corporation which will incorporate the opic and make available financing totaling 60 billion more than double what opic had provided in the past this in turn will unlock over 30 billion in additional funding to facilitate private sector investments in the region the idfc will offer loans loan guarantees and risk insurance to support new investments they will also make equity investments and fund feasibility studies or potential investments making it even easier to collaborate with partner finance institutions now of course the idfc s 60 billion does not come close to the trillion dollars in bri financing but itdoes provide countries alternatives and in that way will oblige china to be more transparent and responsive to the needs of recipient countries the us also has signaled its readiness to cooperate with partners such as japan and india in co financing projects further expanding the scope and scale of alternatives investment these resources complement the significant us private sector investment in the asia pacific the value of u s foreign direct investment in the region is nearly 1 trillion far outstripping what china or any other country has invested moreover it is not widely known that our investment in asia has more than doubled over the last decade and made the us the largest source of the region s foreign investment i also want to credit the administration s security commitment to the region one of then secretary of defense mattis first acts was to rename our pacific command to be the new indo pacific command showing our understanding that we must have one vision for the indian and pacific oceans and recognizing india s growing power and influence across the asia pacific and the importance the us attaches to our partnership with india the administration also has sustained our high level military to military engagement in the region in most countries in asia where we have military partnerships the us is the largest military exercise partner and the largest provider of military training and the administration has shown a steadfast commitment to continuing our longstanding commitment to ensuring freedom of navigation throughout the indo pacific but particularly in sensitive areas such as the south china sea this security commitment has underpinned asia s extraordinary economic rise for the last 50 years but in important other ways the current administration has damaged us interests in the asia pacific let me mention two the first is on the trade front fulfilling a misguided campaign promise one of president trump s first acts was to withdraw the united states from the trans pacific partnership which the obama administration had played such a pivotal role in helping to negotiate since sri lanka is not a tpp member i will not belabor this point except to say that almost every american business person working in asia regrets this act of unilateral disarmament particularly since the trump administration has not moved to negotiate bilateral or multilateral agreements to fill the gap second there is a general perception across most of the asia pacific that the us places less of a priority on asia than under president obama unlike obama trump has attended only one of the east asia and apec summits one of the few leaders to do so the president s absence is magnified by the trump administration s painfully slow progress in filling sub cabinet and ambassadorial positions just to take two examples of relevance to all of you more than two and a half years into trump s four year term we still do not have assistant secretaries of state for either east asia or south and central asia these are the point persons who are responsible for developing and executing our policy in these regions and who supervise the work of our ambassadors and their interagency teams in these regions you all recall i was a s for sca under obama obama took office in january congress approved my nomination in june of the same year us sri lanka relations let me now turn to us sri lankan relations as the us china and other influential countries like india japan and australia all jockey for influence in asia sri lanka is in an excellent position to benefit from and even play off these countries against each other your strategic location on the busiest shipping lanes your democratic character and your economic openness make sri lanka an attractive partner but of course there are also caveats let me first give a brief assessment of us sri lankan relations and then offer some advice about how sri lanka can best capitalize on and benefit from the growing strategic stakes of the world in the indo pacific the current government s embrace of the need for reconciliation and healing after sri lanka s 26 year conflict has enabled steady progress in us sri lankan relations over the last several years the us and sri lanka now have regular constructive high level diplomatic contacts until the us withdrew from the unhrc we worked together to co sponsor unhrc resolutions on sri lanka and other matters turning an area of friction into opportunities for collaboration i am pleased that our military to military relations have progressed substantially from the days when i was ambassador in the last years of the war in 2008 and 2009 human rights concern almost completely circumscribed our military exercises training and assistance with the sri lankan army and air force i had to fight hard to maintain even small areas of navy to navy cooperation in part by arguing that it was in our interest to help sri lanka interdict ltte arms shipments today i am happy those restrictions are behind us our two militaries train together in areas ranging from maritime security to humanitarian assistance and disaster relief the us has announced plans for new security assistance of 39 million to sri lanka to support maritime security freedom of navigation and maritime domain awareness in 2018 the u s transferred a u s coast guard cutter to the sri lankan navy and we have regular joint training and exercises with all the services all these are signs of a healthy and growing military partnership likewise our law enforcement cooperation has strengthened there is no better sign of that than the quick and substantial fbi response to sri lanka s request for assistance in its investigation of the easter sunday bombings our economic relations likewise have seen welcome progress over the past ten years our two way trade has increased by 40 percent to 3 2 billion and the united states remains sri lanka s largest export market u s companies have invested more than 300 million in sri lanka generating high quality jobs for sri lanka s people another welcome sign of progress is that talks are proceeding well on a new millennium challenge corporation compact with sri lanka on april 25 the mcc board approved a new compact agreement for sri lanka that isdesigned to expand economic opportunities and reduce poverty here this is a strong signal of confidence four days after the easter bombings here these decisions are made only after careful study of underlying governance trends i had the dubious pleasure when i was ambassador of canceling a planned compact in 2008 because of declining governance indicators this new compact is therefore a concrete signal of u s confidence but also one that will depend on sri lanka s adroit handling of the post easter crisis aftermath easter bombings let me now turn to some thoughts about how sri lanka can sustain progress in its relations with the us particularly given the new challenges posed by the terrible easter sunday bombings my old boss deputy secretary of state bill burns who is probably the most respected american diplomat of this generation used to joke that us diplomats are never shy about giving advice often when it is unwelcome the easter attacks were not just personal tragedies for the families of those killed and wounded they opened old wounds still fresh from sri lanka s 26 year civil conflict and they raised new questions in the minds of potential business partners about the wisdom of doing business in sri lanka what steps should sri lanka take to successfully manage these new challenges and sustain its progress of the last ten years job one of course must be to pursue with vigor the investigation into who was responsible what links they had to outside terrorist groups how the bombers were able to mount such a sophisticated and well coordinated series of attacks in multiple cities without detection from your intelligence and security services and what networks may remain so the sri lankan people can be sure the threat has abated one priority during this phase of investigating and hopefully wrapping up any remaining terrorist elements must be for the government and security services to conduct investigations in a professional and impartial manner that respects the rights of all sri lankans and does not inadvertently add to the problem the government should also make every effort to limit scope and duration of emergency regulations sri lanka can learn from mistakes america made after 9 11 most civil liberties experts believe the us over reactedby expanding government surveillance without appropriate constitutional checks by extended detentionsat guantánamo bay that circumscribed the legal rights of detainees by extraordinary renditions and interrogations all of which gave rise to questions of what the limits of government power should be in times of crisis our system of checks and balances ultimately righted most of these wrongs and the press had a powerful role to play in exposing excesses and wrong doing sri lanka can also benefit from another us lesson learned after 9 11 one of our mistakes was that there was poor communication and intelligence sharing between the cia fbi and other agencies to improve interagency communication and cooperation the bush white house established a working group of senior technocrats from all the intelligence and law enforcement agencies this group met regularly to evaluate all intelligence from all sources and agree on responsibility for follow up on specific threats the group was headed by dnsa john brennan who reported directly to the president sri lanka could benefit from a similar high level group sri lanka must also be careful not to allow isis or other extreme islamic groups to take root although the precise role of isis in the attacks remains to be investigated one must ask why sri lanka proved a tempting target of opportunity first they may have calculated that since muslim christian relations have historically been good and extreme islamic thought has never gained wide favor on the island they and ntj could organize with undue scrutiny secondly they probably calculated that the security forces have relaxed their efforts since 2009 and to the extent they were still concerned that concern was more likely on preventing a revival of the ltte having suffered the loss of their self proclaimed caliphate and territory in iraq and syria isis must show its followers it is still relevant and strong without a central caliphate isis is metastasizing into smaller units wherever opportunities present themselves one is in the southern philippines where they are seeking a beach head in se asia but they also looking to use bombings such as those in sri lanka to sow discord between muslim christian and other communities that they can then exploit for their evil ends sri lanka cannot allow that to happen which brings me to my third recommendation which is that sri lanka needs to give new focus and priority to reconciliation and good governance the easter sunday bombings opened a potential new divide in sri lanka s already complex ethnic amalgam sri lanka continues to debate the pace and scope of reforms aimed at reconciliation between sinhalese and tamils some tensions remain as important priorities such as a truth and reconciliation commission reparations and accountability remain on the drawing board even as sinhalese tamil reconciliation remains a work in progress the easter bombings threaten to open new wounds and cleavages in sri lankan society and raise new questions will the attack on st anthony s church in batticaloa rekindle memories of the tamil muslim violence in the east during the country s civil war will extremist sinhalese buddhist groups seek to exploit popular anger about the attacks to renew their attacks on muslims as we saw most recently in kandy in may of last year will christians themselves the victims of muslim and sinhalese buddhist violence seek their own retribution this complex and combustible mix requires the country to come together for a national dialogue given the political chasm and open antipathy between the president and prime minister careful thought must be given as to who might lead such efforts two good places to start would be sri lanka s religious leaders and its youth groups cardinal ranjith has managed the aftermath of the attacks with considerable aplomb and grace and there is a long history interfaith dialogue that can help bring these disparate communities together and reduce tensions with tensions high and the possibility that social media can be misused to spread false rumors the communities would be wise to set up an early warning system to monitor rumors and then have senior religious figures quickly deny these this system has worked well in eastern indonesia likewise i was impressed that after the war youth groups like sri lanka unites sprang up to counter extremist narratives and engage sri lanka s youth so they became part of the solution but religious leaders and young people can only do so much the government itself has a crucial role to play to heal old and fresh wounds every sri lankan citizen should be able to count on equal justice and no group that breaks the law or violates the rights of other citizens should be above the law renewed thought should be given to increasing tamil and muslim recruits in the country s security services so they more accurately reflect sri lankan society as a whole the same should be done with the civil service islamophobia already on the rise in india and my own country should not be allowed to take root in sri lanka in the end any country s response must depend not on its political leaders who too often succumb to the temptation to defend narrow party and personal interests but rather on the strength of its institutions the recent constitutional crisis underlined the critical role of independent institutions like the constitutional council and the judiciary their continued independence will be an important part of restoring faith in sri lanka s ability to recover and prosper economic reforms let me now turn to the business climate international business looks to invest in countries that offer not only economic opportunity but also stability and predictability sri lanka s strategic location its relatively open market and its relatively well educated work force certainly will bring international business to your door but then they will measure the relative merits and risks of doing business here versus in huge and growing markets such as india or asean and sri lanka will often be found wanting in such comparisons certainly sri lanka has made impressive progress to boost its tourism sector that will face new challenges after the recent bombings apparel exports continue to thrive but efforts to diversify sources of growth beyond these areas have yielded little what to do with your relatively small market you must compensate by having world class openness and ease of doing business sri lanka is ranked 100 among 190 economies according to the latest world bank ease of doing business ratings it is true that sri lanka improved to 100 in 2018 from 111 in 2017 but 100 is still far too low to draw investors away from more attractive opportunities elsewhere india for example is 23 points better and prime minister modi has vowed that india will get to 50 countries such as uzbekistan albania and mongolia are still further up the rankings from sri lanka handicapped by what inevitably will be investor security apprehensions the country should therefore undertake efforts to work not only with the world bank to undertake more systematic reform efforts but benchmark those against those of nearby competitors like vietnam and india in the same vein more fundamental reforms are needed to address corruption transparency international ranks sri lanka 89 on its corruption perception index countries such as china belarus and cuba that any knowledgeable observer might guess would rank below sri lanka in fact rank above that should not be third as ai iot robotics and other new technologies shape the 21st century business future that future will belong to the educated in his influential new book on ai superpowers kai fu lee who headed google s ai efforts in china then started vcs in ai companies first in china then silicon valley predicts that the us and china will dominate ai because both generate huge and growing amounts have data have universities training world class engineers and have vcs to power further investment countries like sri lanka that want to succeed in this increasingly competitive environment will be wise to invest in their own universities who can then partner with us and chinese companies to support the research that can catalyze sri lanka specific ai growth unfettered pure research still matters credit suisse report that although china accounted for nearly one third of the world s 326 startups valued at us 1 billion or more its share of unicorns in sectors requiring more advanced scientific research capability such as ai big data robotics and software was just 14 percent compared to 40 percent in the us let me give another example from my own country erie pennsylvania which most people associate with the rust belt and aging uncompetitive factories most big factories there indeed have closed in recent years but the city is rebuilding itself around its local universities and a big insurance company profits from a big gambling casino in erie county are funneled partly to innovation spaces at four local campuses that are enabling erie to re invent itself sri lanka can do the same companies like accenture already are operating here to help your export oriented companies maintain their competitive edge sri lanka should prioritize developing partnerships with us universities that will enable bright young sri lankans to get degrees in ai iot cybersecurity and other fields that will increasingly underline growth and competitiveness in this century companies like coursera can offer intermediate solutions through online courses offered by our best universities as well as companies such as google and cyber security specialists palo alto network let me conclude on a note of optimism sri lanka stands to benefit from the us and chinese competition for influence in the asia pacific but it will need strong and unified political leadership to fully investigate the easter bombings an even handed security approach and a new commitment to reconciliation that will insulate sri lanka from efforts by isis or others to exploit religious differences to expand their hate filled influence even as sri lanka grapples with these shorter term challenges it must take active measures to establish the university and business partnerships that can position the country to ride rather than be overtaken by the opportunities presented by ai and other new technologies these are tall challenges but sri lanka has overcome worse

historically culturally linguistically even financially and economically hungary has always been an outlier it was the least likely cee state to be drawn into russia s orbit after world war two and the first to rebel against muscovite rule though many link the fall of the berlin wall to the collapse of the soviet union the first cracks in the communist edifice appeared in june 1989 when hungary opened its border with austria in the 1990s hungary became a vociferous advocate of free trade german carmakers rushed in to set up production units while local banks were sold to lenders from the likes of belgium italy and austria even now notes julia kiraly a former deputy governor of financial stability at hungary s central bank the mnb the country remains the region s most open economy to the casual observer that may come as something of a surprise under viktor orban who has led the country since 2010 hungary has again demonstrated a willingness to tread its own path the prime minister s second election victory he was also prime minister between 1998 and 2002 was a classic cry of frustration from a disenfranchised electorate sick of the country s dire economic climate at the start of the decade four million hungarians out of a population of 10 million lived in poverty while more than 12 of working age adults were unemployed the prime minister railed against his predecessors focusing on the decision at the height of 1990s free market fervour to sell valuable state assets to foreign investors in sectors ranging from telecoms to banking to utilities often at knock down prices in 2015 the state paid 700m to wrest back control of budapest bank from ge capital mkb bank was bought from munich based bayerische landesbank nationalised and then re sold to hungarian investors a year later the government joined forced with the ebrd each buying 15 of the local operations of austria s erste group thereby cutting the share of the banking sector controlled by foreign lenders to around 45 from 70 80 a decade ago reckons gunter deuber head of economics fixed income and foreign exchange research at raiffeisen bank international rbi orban s policies many of them drawn up by mnb governor gyorgy matolcsy went thoroughly against the grain of mainstream european thinking they even garnered their own term orbanomics punitive new levies were imposed on local and foreign banks while lenders were also forced to swallow losses by converting foreign exchange loans back into hungarian forints at artificial rates to cut yawning levels of national debt citizens were forced to transfer 75 of any privately held pension into the public pot anyone who refused to do so was denied a state pension debt deficit reduced officials from strasbourg to frankfurt to brussels waited for orbanomics to fail openly and painfully or at the very least to die quietly behind closed doors yet it did not government debt as a share of gdp which stood at a shade under 70 at the end of 2017 according to imf data may be high by regional standards but it has fallen by 10 percentage points since the start of the decade under orban hungary s budget deficit has been halved while growth rates have quadrupled wages have risen strongly to the point where rising prices are a concern core inflation rose by 3 8 year on year in march 2019 according to data from the central statistical office the highest reading since december 2012 the country s credit ratings meanwhile have steadily improved moody s investors service which rates the sovereign baa3 with a stable outlook said in a december 2018 research note that policies designed to cut government debt and to keep the budget deficit below 3 of gdp had increased the sovereign s ability to withstand external shocks growth looks set to remain robust through 2019 and 2020 zoltán kovács the state secretary for international communications told globalmarkets that 2018 had been an especially good year with gdp growth of 4 8 he added the government is working to maintain this high growth rate provided the economy continues to perform this well and the debt ratio is reduced further upcoming ratings are also set to improve hungary continues to confound in other ways kiraly the former mnb official notes that the economic cycle appears for now to have parted ways with germany in the past when germany did well so did we and when it was in recession so were we this time that isn t the case in march germany s ifo institute tipped output in europe s largest economy to expand by 0 6 in 2019 against an earlier forecast of 1 1 due to weaker foreign demand for industrial goods and stronger headwinds for exporters kiraly also points to the fact that exports the key long standing driver of domestic growth had been replaced by internal demand retail sales jumped 8 4 year on year in february 2019 driven says peter virovacz ing s senior hungary economist by double digit wage growth and a vibrant real estate sector a strong and steady flow of capital from brussels to budapest also helps the eu spent 4 05bn 4 5bn in hungary in 2018 much of which is channelled into road building and environmental projects total eu spending as a share of hungarian gross national income in 2018 was 3 43 romania aside no other member state benefits more on a relative basis from european largesse this matters if only because on the surface at least brussels and budapest have been engaged for years in an increasingly incendiary war of words orban has accused european commission president jean claude juncker a man who once referred to the hungarian prime minister as a dictator of plotting to impose mandatory migrant quotas on member states hungary included eu frets investors invest in march 2019 orban s ruling fidesz party was suspended from the european people s party an alliance of centre right political groups of which juncker is also a member and in september 2018 the european parliament said the hungarian government posed a systematic threat to democracy and the rule of law but stopped short of imposing sanctions or suspending its federal voting rights european officials wring their hands fretful that orban s stated desire to build an illiberal state run according to hungarian rules and needs will be copied and emulated across central and eastern europe hungary s decision in 2015 at the height of the migrant crisis to build a wall along its border with serbia was widely castigated in western circles yet political bickering has been almost wholly ignored by corporate and portfolio investors inward fdi hit 3 8bn in 2018 according to data from unctad scattered across 98 greenfield projects up from 2 5bn and 83 projects the previous year most of the capital notes international communications secretary kovács came from us and german corporates adds marek drimal an emea strategist at société générale in london in recent years a lot of foreign capital has been put to work in the automotive sector and across oil and gas and construction if anything hungary s economy is these days even more deeply embedded in the single market there has been noise about hungary but most of the big western investors in the fdi space remain committed to the country says raiffeisen bank s deuber big companies when they invest heavily in a country don t leave quickly he adds that the hungarian premier has played a canny hand with foreign investors orban has been wise keeping very close contact with the business community particularly the big manufacturers orbanism revisited it is worth revisiting for a moment the underlying tenets of so called orbanism its mere existence and its acceptance in investment banking and policy making circles across europe suggest that hungary s prime minister and his inner circle have either by accident or design chanced upon a new and effective economic model mention of the term usually requires the commentator to remind the reader either with approval or with a sneer that orbanism refuses to cleave to the rules of contemporary economic orthodoxy but is this fair while some aspects of hungary s model are indeed unorthodox many others fit neatly and simply into the mainstream global economic discussion says raiffeisen bank s deuber yes the government is pushing for low rates and cheap financing conditions but you see that elsewhere in europe too it can also be argued that hungary often by pure accident regularly manages to be ahead of the curve its decision to put a sizeable chunk of the banking sector back in domestic hands went against prevailing wisdom and could have been handled with greater care but protectionism is now back in vogue across the continent france s president emmanuel macron a self styled liberal is retreating into the past directing state aid into the maw of national and continental champions with the aim of competing with china and the united states the same shift is taking place in the likes of germany and the netherlands as for barrier building it is easy to overlook the fact that seven of the eu s 28 member states including spain and latvia have built new walls or reinforced existing national boundaries since 2015 the transnational institute a netherlands based think tank reckons eu countries have built more than 1 000km of border walls since 1989 hungary s influence is also visible in the strict taxes long since eased that it imposed on locally licensed lenders in 2010 austria imposed a similar levy on its own banks the following year and romania is in the final throes of introducing a tax on banks financial assets based on market share orban s more autocratic tendencies and his willingness to stir the pot to heat up his political base has found favour in poland where the ruling law and justice party has assumed political control over state funded radio and television but there is as yet little sign of his illiberalism spreading across the rest of the region sound foundations one final issue needs to be addressed by any measure hungary s economy has outperformed this decade foreign capital continues to flow in and to be eagerly put to good and productive use but will the tenets of orbanism prevail how sturdy really are its economic foundations in its latest world economic outlook published in april the imf tipped output to expand by 3 6 in 2019 and by 2 7 in 2020 a slower rate of growth than bulgaria serbia poland and romania in its latest cee quarterly published in march 2019 italian lender unicredit warned that the honeymoon was over for an economy whose best year s of economic growth were now behind it it is also worth noting that while an unbending approach to immigration has been a vote winner it has produced some unpleasant side effects because the labour force is not expanding there is a huge upward pressure on wage growth notes socgen s drimal and while orban s workfare programme introduced in the dark days of 2010 has provided employment for hundreds of thousands of jobseekers most of the work is menial and transient while the official jobless rate at the end of january 2019 was 3 5 according to data from eurostat most economists put the real rate at 7 8 the cities are doing fine but in the east of the country there is a big and hidden unemployment problem says kiraly the country is being torn into two parts what looks healthy and positive is not real it s simply a disguise
as the economic recovery in europe progressed and output started to grow faster in 2017 optimism returned to forecasters although they were aware that europe had particularly benefitted from strong growth in global output and trade but they did not expect global crosscurrents and domestic growth impediments to impact on european growth as quickly and as massively as happened last year in 2018 early hopes that adverse factors would be short lived faded quickly the emergence of trade tensions in spring and the downturn of the manufacturing sector as well as the subsequent tightening of financial conditions led to a series of downward revisions to forecasts of global eu and euro area gdp growth in 2018 and 2019 as a result in spring 2019 most forecasters look ahead with diminished expectations e g imf 2019 ecb 2019 the commission s spring 2019 european economic forecast1 highlights the unexpectedly sharp slowdown in euro area gdp growth in the second half 2018 with italy falling into technical recession and germany on the brink of it this slowdown was driven by a conjuncture of several factors which it is important to disentangle in order to chart the economic outlook for the coming years and design appropriate economic policies this column contributes to this by examining the relative impact of cyclical patterns and shocks external and domestic as well as transitory and more permanent drivers of the economic outlook for europe the economic expansion in the euro area continued in 2018 at a pace of 1 9 this was markedly lower than in 2017 when economic growth got a push from external factors with net trade contributing massively without the sizeable carry over from strong growth in 2017 the annual gdp growth rate in 2018 would have been lower forecast revisions for euro area growth in 2019 since last autumn were unusually large 0 5 percentage points or more for the main international institutions as well as consensus reflecting the unexpected nature of the shocks at work since the second half of 2018 in early 2019 there seems to be a divergence between continued weakness in survey data and some strengthening of hard data eurostat s surprisingly positive flash estimate of 0 4 for first quarter gdp does not provide a breakdown of gdp components however the robustness of consumption and to a lesser extent investment in france documented by insee 2 as well as the exceptional strength of construction and the rebound of consumption in germany expected by the bundesbank 3 lend some support to the idea of robust domestic demand starting from a low base because of the slowdown in the second half of last year euro area gdp growth in 2019 is now forecast at 1 2 despite a slight rebound expected in the course of the year in 2020 growth is expected to reach 1 5 a number partly driven by the higher number of working days next year the maturing of the business cycle in europe is not sufficiently advanced to explain the recent slowdown supply constraints have only started to become binding in a small number of countries and sectors in the eu and have now been easing for almost a year figure 1 there is also no evidence of imbalances that would imperil the cycle a strong expansion that raises inflationary pressures and thereby triggers a strong monetary policy tightening is definitely not on the cards neither do we observe an over accumulation of capital investment has been rather weak during the recovery and has only recently accelerated figure 1 factors limiting production euro area manufacturing survey of respondents source commission business and consumer surveys likewise there is little evidence that a turning financial cycle would have caused the slowdown dynamics of leverage and financing conditions credit availability and cost asset prices have received a lot of attention as potential causes of a downturn in recent years borio et al 2018 ecb 2018 while the level and dynamics of private debt and high asset price valuations require monitoring recent episodes of financial market turmoil appear too limited and short lived to have dampened economic activity in a meaningful way all in all it appears unlikely that the business or financial cycles are responsible for the slowing of growth in europe the year 2018 saw a decrease in the pace of world ex eu trade growth to 4 6 after an exceptional expansion in 2017 5 4 world trade even contracted at the end of 2018 driven by emerging market imports the factors behind this slowdown are multiple and include the downturn in several emes including china late in the year amid increased financing costs trade policy uncertainty and a cyclical downswing of it and communication equipment production in east asia to be sure new tariffs implemented in recent quarters directly affect only a small share of world trade nonetheless they are likely to have affected manufacturing not only directly but also more importantly through the uncertainty about the future of trade policies and concerns that this may affect the economic viability of complex global value chains wozniak and galar 2018 gaulier et al 2019 investment in the maintenance and extension of such value chains may therefore have slowed however for the slowdown in world trade to explain the sharper drop in euro area growth the impact would have to be over proportional indeed export demand addressed to the euro area fell more strongly than world trade during most of 2018 due to the weakness of activity in our main trading partners moreover euro area manufacturing is very export oriented the correlation of quarterly manufacturing growth with goods exports is higher than with domestic demand components 0 87 for goods exports against 0 40 for private consumption and 0 55 for equipment investment 1995 2018 this suggests a close link between the general weakness of euro area manufacturing observed since the start of 2018 and lower export demand figure 2 manufacturing output and extra euro area exports source eurostat while the impact of the external environment may help to explain why growth has been slowing since the start of 2018 the euro area has also been hit by a number of sector and country specific factors that have weighed on economic activity throughout last year these include strikes social unrest in france extraordinary weather conditions which inter alia disrupted inland water transport on the rhine river as well as policy uncertainty which in italy led to a worsening of financing conditions among the specific factors the production disruption in the car manufacturing sector in the second half of 2018 stands out for its macroeconomic relevance european carmakers particularly in germany had problems with the introduction of the new worldwide harmonised light vehicles test procedure wltp that led to production disruptions as certifications had not yet been obtained for a large number of models when the regulation took effect in the eu on 1 september since many vehicle types had no certification by that date inventories were increased and production was temporarily interrupted the wltp effects added to regulatory discussions on limitations to the use of diesel cars in cities the ongoing dieselgate affair 4 and falling chinese and global demand for european cars the impact of these factors overlaps with more fundamental structural changes affecting the demand for combustion engine cars e g alternative power sources automated driving car sharing 5 figure 3 gdp loss due to 8 decrease in the german automotive sector output percentage points source oecd own calculations production in car manufacturing in germany decreased by 8 in the third quarter of 2018 with a direct mechanical loss of german gdp of more than 0 4 due to the high share of the automotive sector in total value added in germany close to 5 inter country input output icio tables released by the oecd further allow an estimation of the direct and indirect impact of the decline in automotive output on other sectors taking into account the decrease in output faced by the direct suppliers of the german automotive sector first round effect the impact amounts to 0 5 of gdp in germany and between 0 05 and 0 1 of gdp in hungary czechia and slovakia figure 3 including the spillovers to the whole value chain indirect effects the impact on gdp is significant in several countries gdp would have been 0 6 higher in germany without the fall in the automotive sector 0 2 higher in czechia hungary and slovakia 0 1 higher in slovenia and between 0 05 and 0 1 higher in austria poland and romania for all other countries the impact is estimated to be below 0 05 percentage points disconnected factors manufacturing and services wages and core inflation the ongoing weakness of manufacturing and export orders has so far coincided with dampened but still robust domestic demand and continued employment growth will the domestically oriented part of the economy proxied in figure 4 by confidence in the services sector which represents 73 of value added be able to withstand the slowdown of the manufacturing sector 17 of euro area value added figure 4 euro area manufacturing and services surveys and gdp source commission business and consumer surveys eurostat it is not necessarily the case that services activity follows developments in manufacturing with a lag statistically there is no lead lag relationship between the business surveys for services and manufacturing also the evidence from previous episodes of diverging manufacturing and services developments does not point to services performance systematically following manufacturing performance for instance service and manufacturing confidence dropped at the start of 2005 but then services recovered as of march while manufacturing continued declining and only increased as of june clearly services confidence better reflected the turnaround in gdp growth in the second quarter in 1999 both services and manufacturing confidence decoupled from gdp growth they signalled a slowdown in the first quarter while gdp growth actually accelerated manufacturing confidence started correcting for this decoupling already in the second quarter while services continued to wrongly signal a further decline this suggests that domestic demand may well carry the economy through the current weakness of manufacturing if it is not too deep or protracted the resilience of domestic demand in the euro area benefits from the strength of the economies of the former programme countries they not only achieved remarkable growth rates in the years after their exit from financial assistance programmes but sustained their strength and recorded up to last year growth rates above the average of their peers in the euro area see table 1 the unwinding of the macroeconomic imbalances accumulated before the crisis improved competitiveness and the positive impact of reforms have in the short term helped them to maintain their growth momentum while crucial challenges remain in place recent positive developments are projected to allow all former programme countries to grow in 2019 and 2020 above the average of the rest of the euro area table 1 economic growth in euro area member states after their exit from financial assistance programmes notes this average includes real gdp growth of 25 1 in 2015 which reflects the reclassification of economic activities of multinational corporates real gdp growth annual averages years 2019 and 2020 are forecast years figures in brackets indicate growth in the rest of the euro area in the respective period a second divergence at the current juncture concerns wage and price core inflation developments in line with falling unemployment and gradually tightening labour markets wage growth picked up to 2½ last year this has led to upward pressure on unit labour costs which increased by almost 2 in the euro area last year and are set to expand further this year however this cost pressure has not yet translated into higher core inflation hicp excluding energy and unprocessed food prices which has continued to remain broadly stable throughout 2018 bobeica et al 2019 with the recent weakening in economic activity the already muted pass through of higher wage growth to underlying price pressures is set to take longer than previously anticipated figure 5 illustrates the divergence by comparing a wage philips curve in black with a price philips curve in red over the whole observation period 2001 2019q1 wage growth has tended to be stronger than inflation dots and dashed regression lines this is also true for the most recent period since 2016 solid however while wage growth has picked up amid lower unemployment while inflation has hardly reacted thereby diverging both from wage developments and the inflation regression line figure 5 wage and price philips curves for the euro area source eurostat own calculations as downside risks remain large economic policy must stand ready to deal with a possible sharper downturn several important downside risks surround the forecast s central scenario of a rebound in the course of 2019 many of these are related to bad economic policies outside the euro area an escalation of trade conflicts or persistent uncertainty surrounding trade policies the possibility of a no deal brexit a more protracted slowdown in china and a sharper or longer slowdown in export demand constitute major risks within the euro area risks relate to remaining fragilities of financial sector balance sheets and the possibility of sovereign bank vicious circles also here some risks relate to the implementation of bad economic policies such as a roll back of structural reforms or imprudent fiscal policy many of these risks appear interconnected and non linear which could magnify their impact on the economy if they were to materialise this would put significant strain on the capacity of macroeconomic policies to stabilise the economy persisting gaps in the economy leave room for the economic expansion to continue before inflationary pressures build up but also point to vulnerabilities low inflation and the external surplus suggest that domestic demand can further increase before inflationary tensions emerge the current account surplus of the euro area suggests that the economy remains reliant on external demand investment is in turn dependent on export demand and therefore vulnerable to trade tensions as well as global economic sentiment considering the uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook policies should be designed to cover also the risk of a sharper and more protracted slowdown the distinction between preventive and curative action is particularly difficult however one of the lessons of the crisis is that a very cautious policy response in the face of pervasive uncertainties the so called conservatism principle of brainard 1967 may not be sufficient to avoid ending up in a bad equilibrium in any policy package short term measures aiming at sustaining demand and investment and longer term measures aiming at boosting potential growth should be combined it is important to take into account that the social fabric of euro area member states in many cases appears less robust than before the crisis despite overall improving employment numbers rising wages and strengthening economic activity the perception of an unfair distribution of the pain during the crisis and of the benefits during the upswing has fuelled social protests as well as anti establishment political currents in many parts of the eu and globally figure 6 structural balance and government debt 2019 source european commission the expected macroeconomic policy mix with continued monetary support and a slightly expansionary fiscal stance in the euro area as a whole would allow the expansion to continue albeit at a more moderate pace provided that the prospects of a rebound are confirmed by incoming indicators monetary policy has provided most of the macroeconomic stimulus over the past years and is expected to remain accommodating whereas the fiscal policy stance for the euro area as a whole is expected to be slightly expansionary in 2019 member states with very high public debt should however pursue a more prudent fiscal policy than currently envisaged figure 6 reducing uncertainty by committing to structural reforms aimed at increasing sustainable growth and to debt reduction where it is most needed would help households and companies spending and investment decisions and preserve favourable financing conditions for the public and private sectors several member states with fiscal space currently plan fiscal expansions in 2019 its effective delivery is important under the baseline of a moderate slowdown with additional measures if the downturn is sharper than expected by focusing on public investment both physical and intangible member states with fiscal space could in addition improve their own growth prospects for the medium term and generate positive spillovers within the euro area in a context of policy interest rates at the effective lower bound government investment in surplus countries can have positive gdp spillovers to the rest of the euro area in t veld 2016 structural reforms and a focus on the quality of public finances should complement macroeconomic policies in view of the constraints to macroeconomic policies moving towards a structure of public revenues and expenditure that favours education employment and investment is a means to increase the growth potential while being deficit neutral at the same time a redesign of tax and expenditure systems could be used to make them more inclusive other structural reforms that increase the growth potential and resilience should also be brought forward 6 measures to complete emu would increase the effectiveness of macroeconomic policies respecting the deadline of june 2019 set by the euro summit in december is important for the budgetary instrument for the euro area to be implemented with the next multiannual financial framework the absence of a euro area central fiscal stabilisation function complicates the task of smoothing shocks and increases the risk of avoidable output losses more work is needed on such a function the completion of the banking union including an agreement on the european deposit insurance system and a continued impetus to capital markets

2019 marks the fifth consecutive quarter of operating profit and ebitda margin expansion highlighting icl s focus on strategic initiatives and cost control icl s ceo raviv zoller stated we achieved a strong start to 2019 with significant profitability growth recorded in all of our three mineral value chains as our value focused strategy continued to bear fruits our performance is even more meaningful in light of the slow start to the agricultural year in the us brazil and israel which negatively impacted fertilizer sales and put pressure on the commodity phosphate market during the quarter we continued to make significant progress towards long term value creation by streamlining operations empowering our workforce improving the results of our yph joint venture increasing polysulphate production realigning our r d and signing an important agreement with the government of israel to end a decade long dispute on royalties this agreement will also simplify the royalty

q3 2018 operating income the company reported an operating income of 227 million in q1 2019 compared to 985 million for the first quarter of 2018 excluding a provision of 14 million following the final ruling in the royalty arbitration with the state of israel adjusted operating income increased by 65 to 241 million compared to 146 million in q1 2018 excluding the contribution of divested businesses the increase was driven by higher prices increase in sales volume in the bromine value chain and cost reductions across icl s mineral chains in addition icl s natural gas power plant which was launched in the second half of 2018 contributed to lower energy costs these were partially offset by an increase raw materials costs the strong sales of bromine based industrial solutions and an increase in phosphate fertilizers sales volumes more than offset lower sales quantities of potash specialty fertilizers and acids the negative impact of exchange rates on revenues which derived mainly from the euro devaluation against the us dollar compared to the average rate in q1 2018 was offset in the operating income as the devaluation of the israeli shekel the euro and the chinese yuan compared to their average rate in q1 2018 contributed to lower costs in us dollar terms financing expenses net the net financing expenses in q1 2019 amounted to 35 million compared to 15 million in the corresponding quarter last year q1 2018 financing expenses were particularly low mainly due to significant exchange rates impact the current quarter was also impacted by 6 million due to the new implementation of ifrs 16 we expect that this item will continue to be highly volatile tax expenses tax expenses in q1 2019 were 51 million compared to 45 million in q1 2018 reflecting an effective tax rate of about 27 and 5 respectively the adjusted effective tax rate excluding the provision following the resolution of the royalty dispute with israeli authorities totaled 26 in q1 2019 the company s exceptionally low tax rate in the corresponding quarter last year derived mainly from exempt income from the divestiture of businesses the tax rate in the first quarter of 2019 was negatively impacted by the appreciation of the israeli shekel against the dollar during the quarter compared to 2018 year end cash flow debt level in q1 2019 operating cash flow was 173 million compared to 36 million in the corresponding quarter in 2018 the increase was driven mainly by the increase in net income excluding the capital gain from divestitures along with higher cash received from derivative transactions as well as lower tax payments cash flow used for the purchase of property plant equipment and intangible assets amounted to 131 million compared to 127 million in q1 2018 the cash proceeds from the sale of property plant and equipment in the amount of 35 million recorded in q1 2019 derives from the sale and leaseback of office buildings in israel and sale of a plant in mexico the company s net financial liabilities at the end of the first quarter amounted to 2 527 million an increase of 315 million compared to december 31 2018 the increase of the net financial liabilities derives mainly from an increase of 300 million of long term liabilities as a result of ifrs16 implementation on january 1st 2019 at the initial application date the company recognized a lease liability in the amount of about 300 million according to the present value of the future lease payments discounted and concurrently recognized a right of use asset in the same amount in the first quarter of 2019 the company recognized depreciation expenses in the amount of 13 million in respect of the right of use asset and 6 million in finance expenses in respect of the lease liability instead of the lease expenses in the amount of 15 million which would have been recorded according to the previous standard review of operating segments starting from the first quarter of 2019 icl s management measures and accordingly present in its reports the results of its business divisions operating segments after allocation of general and administrative g a expenses per each division the updated reporting format of the division results will also assist investors who are interested in calculating the ebitda for each segment separately and not merely on the corporate level it should be noted that the allocation of g a expenses in comparable periods was made for convenience purposes only and changes may occur in the allocation methodology in future periods for more information please refer to the appendix in icl s q1 2019 presentation industrial products the bromine value chain segment achieved record quarterly operating income with operating margins of approximately 28 after allocation of g a expenses compared to 21 in q1 2018 the results were driven by increased prices and volumes across most of the segment s products industrial products accounted for 24 5 of sales and 40 2 of profit attributed to the business segments in the q1 2019 compared to 22 4 of sales and 43 7 of profit attributed to the business segments in q1 2018 significant highlights and business environment elemental bromine prices in china continued to increase during q1 as the local bromine production continues to be affected by strict environmental related regulation pressure and by the winter shutdown the seasonal decline in bromine prices which usually begins in march has not occurred yet as many producers have so far not returned from their winter shutdowns higher elemental bromine prices continued to drive higher bromine compound prices demand for bromine based flame retardants remained relatively stable strong sales of clear brine fluids were driven by higher activity in the gulf of mexico alaska and south america coupled with low availability of product in the market the performance of icl s phosphorous based flame retardants business was stable compared to q1 2018 as price increases were offset by lower sales volumes the segment s specialty minerals sales were stable as higher sales of de icing and de dusting salts were offset by lower sales of dead sea

solutions and flame retardants together with an increase in the selling prices of phosphorous based flame retardants potash segment profit after g a allocation increased by approximately 84 despite a decrease of 8 in potash sales volumes due to disruptions in the israeli railway services and the cessation of potash production in the uk the increase is mainly attributed to an increase of 13 or 33

attributed to segments in q1 2018 significant highlights and business environment potash prices were mostly stable during the first quarter of 2019 across global key spot markets supported by low availability and despite slow activity due to seasonality demand in the us was impacted by unfavorable weather which delayed fertilizer applications the emergence of demand in brazil was also delayed as buyers expected prices to moderate and due to the later than usual carnival festivities however demand began to emerge towards the end of the quarter supply side developments eurochem russia

lower than in the corresponding quarter last year mainly due to the termination of potash production at icl boulby at the end of q2 2018 as part of the transition to the polysulphate production together with a decrease at icl iberia this decrease was partly offset by increased production in sodom the production in sodom in q1 2018 included 5 days of production shut down for maintenance purposes while in 2019 the annual shutdown is scheduled for q4 and is also expected to be longer than usual approximately 3 weeks in order to allow for increased production in the following years the quantity of potash sold in q1 2019 was 92 thousand tonnes lower than in the corresponding quarter last year mainly due to a decrease in potash sales resulting from the disruptions in the israeli railway services and the termination of potash production in the uk results analysis sales expenses operating income millions q1 2018 figures 353 310 43 quantity 2 9 7 price 37 37 exchange rate 8 11 3 energy 9 9 transportation 1 1 operating and other expenses 5 5 q1 2019 figures 384 305 79 the increase in the segment s profit was driven primarily by higher potash prices as well as from a decrease in energy costs due to a new power plant in sodom the increase was offset by lower quantities sold of potash and increased sales of lower margin products such as polysulphate and electricity surplus from the new power plant the positive impact of exchange rates derived from the devaluation in the average exchange rate of the israeli shekel and the euro against the us dollar compared to q1 2018 which led to lower costs in us dollar terms more than offsetting the negative impact of the devaluation in the average exchange rate of the euro and the british pound on sales phosphate solutions phosphate solutions results in q1 2019 improved compared to the corresponding quarter last year with operating profit margin after g a allocation increasing from 5 3 in q1 2018 to 6 5 in q1 2019 the improved performance was supported by improved performance of the yph jv which recorded an operating profit of 5 5 million as well as higher prices across the phosphate value chain these were partly offset by an increase in raw materials prices mainly sulphur costs which are reflected in the quarter s sales and mga bought from third parties as well as lower sales volumes of specialty phosphates in south america and of dairy proteins the phosphate solutions segment accounted for 36 of sales and 14 5 of income attributed to the segments in q1 2019 compared to 36 of sales and 18 5 of income attributed to the segments in q1 2018 significant highlights and business environment excluding the rovita business which was divested at the beginning of the third quarter of 2018 global sales of phosphate specialties decreased by approximately 6 compared to the corresponding quarter last year to 283 million 52 of the segment sales including inter segment sales the decrease is attributed to lower acid sales in south america and lower dairy proteins sales sales of phosphate salts in europe and north america increased driven by higher prices and increased sales volume of industrial salts compensating for lower sales volumes of food salts in certain european markets improved performance in china was driven by an increase of local market share for industrial and food salts predominantly in the body care market phosphate acids global sales were down compared to q1 2018 due to lower sales volumes in south america driven by increased chinese imports performance in europe and north america was positively impacted by favorable market conditions which allowed for higher pricing with only moderate volume losses stable market prices and increased sales volumes contributed to the business performance in china in march 2019 icl finalized the sale of assets related to the closure of its production facility in mexico recording a capital gain of 1 million the downward trend in phosphate commodity prices during q1 2019 was driven by excess supply and was intensified by a seasonally soft demand across global markets together with unfavorable weather in the us and relatively high dap stocks in india sulphur prices also decreased during q1 2019 major suppliers reacted to the market trends during february eight major chinese phosphate fertilizers producers so called the 6 2

profit derived mainly from a positive price impact throughout most of the phosphate value chain including higher prices of phosphate fertilizers as well as phosphate based acids salts and food additives the negative impact of sales quantities on the operating profit despite the positive contribution to sales was driven by higher sales volumes of lower margin products such as phosphate commodities mainly fertilizers coupled with a decrease in sales of higher margin products mostly acids the negative impact of raw materials derived mainly from higher prices of sulphur consumed during the quarter relative to sulphur consumed during q1 2018 the negative impact on sales from the devaluation in the average exchange rates of the euro the israeli shekel and the chinese yuan against the dollar compared to q1 2018 was mostly offset by lower costs in us dollar terms due to the devaluation in the average exchange rates of the production currencies innovative ag solutions the ias segment experienced a soft quarter due to weather related delays in fertilizer applications in north america and israel and due to unfavorable exchange rates mainly the devaluation in the average exchange rate of the euro against the dollar compared to q1 2018 icl s innovative ag solutions ias segment accounted for 14 of sales and 5 4 of profit attributed to the segments in q1 2019 compared to 15 of sales and 12 of profit attributed to the segments in the q1 2018 significant highlights and business environment sales to the specialty agriculture market were lower compared to the corresponding quarter last year due to weather delays and unfavorable exchange rates nevertheless sales volumes to the european market were stable while sales of straight fertilizers increased in north america the segment recorded higher sales in india and brazil for its water soluble npks and controlled release fertilizers as a result of the segment s focused sales and marketing and also benefitted from price initiatives in israel and spain sales to the turf and ornamental market were stable higher sales in europe which were supported by favorable weather conditions advanced sales in the uk driven by

time to change strategy my recent letters described what i think the future will look like i hasten to add it isn t what i think the future should look like or what i want to see almost the entire developed world has painted itself into a corner it won t necessarily be terrible i don t expect another great depression or economic upheaval but we will have to adapt our portfolios and lifestyles to this new reality the good news is the changes will happen relatively slowly we have time to adapt in war movies it s common for the dashing leader to make bold promises like we will never retreat ahead of a glorious victory the assumption is that retreat is bad but real life military strategists say retreat can be the right move when the odds are against you better to save your ammunition for another time better yet adopt a new strategy that gives you a better chance my last few letters may look like retreat but i m just recognizing reality there is no plausible path to stopping the world s debt overload much less paying it off without a serious and painful purge if you know of such a path please share it with me but i haven t seen one so i foresee a tough decade ahead summing up 1 entitlement spending interest on the debt defense spending and so forth will continue to produce trillion dollar plus deficits 2 no constituency is arguing to reform the entitlement system by reducing benefits by the middle of the next decade deficits will be in the 1 5 trillion range even under the cbo s optimistic assumptions while the numbers look marginally different elsewhere the developed countries are all going the same direction toward higher deficits 3 following the next recession and there is always one coming the us deficit will be well north of 2 trillion and the total debt will quickly rise to 30 trillion it will almost certainly be in the 40 trillion range before 2030 unless interest rates drop significantly simply paying the interest will consume much of the tax revenue fortunately i expect interest rates to drop significantly think japan 4 a growing body of academic literature and real world experience suggests there is a point beyond which debt becomes a drag on growth that means that the recovery after the next recession will be even slower than the last one if as i expect the federal reserve and other central banks react with massive quantitative easing it is entirely possible that the whole developed world will begin to look like japan slow nominal gdp growth low interest rates that penalize savers low inflation or even deflation etc 5 in such an environment normal equity index funds won t produce the returns many have grown to expect 6 public pension funds will get hammered in the bear market and many will have difficulty meeting their obligations governments will be forced to either cut benefits raise taxes or both that is not going to make for a happy citizenry it will play out in different manners all across the world but the resulting frustration will be the same and to put it very bluntly frustration is inadequate to describe the result of underfunded pensions retirees made plans for their futures based upon receiving those pensions and taxpayers likewise make plans 7 all of this will have significant investment implications which we will visit below and in great detail in the coming weeks and months but japanification to use a word is going to make income and wealth inequality worse not better this all being the case the priority now isn t whether to retreat in the sense of changing your investment strategies but how and to where so you can pick up the fight later developing a strategy requires us to understand exactly what is happening and why so i m looking at the situation from different angles we have a problem you have likely heard of income inequality that wealthy people are making a larger share of our collective income in one sense it s nothing new of course the people with the highest incomes have more of the total math guarantees it but it is true that the top s share has grown in recent decades as has the share of assets owned by the wealthiest ray dalio of bridgewater associates has been writing about this for a few years now here s a chart and quote from his latest article as shown below the income gap is about as high as ever and the wealth gap is the highest since the late 1930s today the wealth of the top 1 of the population is more than that of the bottom 90 of the population combined which is the same sort of wealth gap that existed during the 1935 40 period a period that brought in an era of great internal and external conflicts for most countries those in the top 40 now have on average more than 10 times as much wealth as those in the bottom 60 that is up from six times in 1980 dalio thinks it is significant that inequality at least by these measures is now in the same area it was in the great depression it plunged in the postwar years and began rising again in the 1980s i suspect if we had data going back a few centuries we would see that those 30 or so years between 1950 and 1980 were actually the statistical aberration mass prosperity hasn t been the historic norm it certainly wasn t that in the 1800s and the gilded age nor was it so in europe some people see this inequality as somehow unfair i think it is more complex than that it depends on how those with wealth became so there s a big difference between a despots who use political authority to enrich themselves and their friends b monopolists who thrive by taking choice away from consumers instead of adding to it and c entrepreneurs who grow wealthy by selling useful products to willing consumers incidentally dalio does a good job describing the problem but i think he lays the blame at the wrong doorstep his proposed solutions leave a lot to be desired i will discuss this at length in a forthcoming letter the problems begin when people perceive the wealthy are getting rich at the expense of others and it s hard to escape that conclusion when the data say the top tier is keeping a bigger share of the pie even if the pie is growing especially when your piece of the pie is not growing nearly as fast as those of the top the relative distance becomes even more stark let s review some charts from my friend bruce mehlman s latest fascinating slide deck he has much more that you can and definitely should view here if you take gdp as a proxy for national income it s been growing far faster than median family income even adjusted for inflation the wider that gap gets the more people feel like they are being left behind here s another one comparing stock market growth with family net worth this isn t really surprising since we know the top quintile owns most of the stocks the lower 80 see little direct benefit but the magnitude of the disparity is still remarkable one reason income may be unequal is that talent is increasingly unequal too or at least the willingness of businesses to buy talent here s a chart showing the most valuable companies have been getting that way with a smaller headcount mehlman cites technology as the explanation for this and i agree that s a significant part of it but so are other things like the increasing number of sectors where a small number of companies whose existence is enabled by financial engineering and monetary policy dominate their respective markets my good friend ben hunt of epsilon theory notes that the s p 500 companies have the highest earnings relative to sales in history quoting ben this is a 30 year chart of total s p 500 earnings divided by total s p 500 sales it s how many pennies of earnings s p 500 companies get from a dollar of sales earnings margin essentially at a high level of aggregation so at the lows of 1991 1 in sales generated a bit more than 0 03 in earnings for the s p 500 today in 2019 we are at an all time high of a bit more than 0 11 in earnings from 1 in sales it s a marvelously steady progression up and to the right temporarily marred by a recession here and there but really quite awe inspiring in its consistency yay capitalism ben goes on to say many people think that is because of technology he argues it is the financialization of our economy and the fed s loose policies i agree 100 if you think they haven t changed the rules since the 1980s and 1990s you aren t paying attention boys and girls work saving technology isn t bad in the past it freed our bodies from dangerous exhausting toil and now it s freeing our minds from mental drudgery we can adjust the problem is that it is hitting us so fast farming went from manual labor to automation over several generations now we re traveling an equal distance in only a few years resulting in millions of unemployed humans as unhappy as all this is making people now imagine how it will be when recession hits and then couple that with an ever increasing explosion of new technologies that reduce demand for many types of labor like automated driving no solutions some degree of unhappiness and discontent is part of the human condition it s what drives us to improve our lives we accept challenges as long as we think we have a fair chance at overcoming them many americans no longer believe they have that chance that s partly because they have higher expectations possibly too high but right or wrong the perception is there it affects behavior and more to the point it affects what people expect from the government when they perceive less ability to reach the next level on their own they look to washington for help i noted last week that almost no one really wants to cut government spending even the so called fiscal conservatives mostly nibble around the edges reducing budget growth here and there bill clinton was wrong when he said the era of big government is over in 1996 it s bigger than ever and growing faster than ever whether you like it or not that is a fact government revenue is not growing faster than ever which means rising debt even in today s relative prosperity again whether you like this or not is irrelevant it s happening i see no way out raising taxes on the wealthy won t get us even close to a balanced budget even at confiscatory levels raising taxes on the middle class won t happen in a recession the only tax system with a shot at actually paying for current spending even without adding the new programs some democrats want is a vat or value added tax and it is anathema in both parties no matter how i look at this i keep coming back to gigantic deficits that the federal reserve will have to monetize in some fashion probably something like the previous qe rounds but on a vastly larger scale and thus my belief it will launch an era of japan like deflation and economic doldrums if you think this is impossible or i m being too pessimistic please please tell me why i m wrong show me where we can get the necessary tax revenue without severely impacting the economy show me how we can cut benefits without getting massive pushback from politicians and please show me how we get off the path we are on and tell me what scenario you think is more plausible i don t see one i really don t friends don t let friends buy and hold you probably read my letters because they help inform your investing strategy if so then let me say this loud and clear your strategy probably needs to change the methods that worked well recently won t cut it in the new era i think we will enter soon at the risk of repeating myself for the 20th time bear markets like last december that are not accompanied by recessions have v shaped recoveries bear markets that happen in the context of a recession have long recoveries the next one because of the massive debt that will be increasing at an astounding rate is likely to see an even slower recovery friends don t let friends buy and hold at a minimum you need some type of hedging program on your equity portfolios using a simple 200 day moving average to signal the time for going to cash while not the best will help protect you from the worst of a massive bear market the recent flurry of ipo filings by unicorn companies like wework ought to be ringing alarm bells the venture capital investors who financed these businesses thus far are ready to exit they re doing so because they think the risk reward equation is as favorable as it will ever be possibly they re wrong but i don t think so we have reached the distribution stage when insiders and professional investors become net sellers while the small investors who missed most of the bull market finally jump in history says it won t end well for the latter group as the economy weakens into recession and public markets retreat i think we ll see two strategic trends first active management will return to prominence as investors realize prices can move in both directions the rias mutual funds managers and hedge funds that have managed to hold on through the lean years and many didn t will draw assets once again that doesn t mean they will succeed performance wise but they ll get a chance to try second and possibly more important the best opportunities will leave the public markets entirely we already see this unfolding as the number of listed companies declines mainly at the expense of small caps there is just no reason for most successful companies to accept the hassles and expense of an exchange listing they can raise all the capital they need from that small number of investors in whom most of the wealth is now concentrated this will unfortunately aggravate the inequality frustrations our regulatory structure keeps most private investments off limits to the average investor or even above average net worth investors so even if you manage to accumulate some capital you may not have the much better options for investing it than those with a few million dollars and more the government has rigged the markets against small investors in the name of protecting them that doesn t mean investment success will be impossible you ll have opportunities but you may have to hunt for them and act quickly when you find them that s what active managers do and not just in stocks and bonds i foresee many opportunities in real estate as well there are going to be amazing opportunities in new technologies like smart generals sometimes we have to retreat from the unwinnable battle and develop a different plan that s what i am doing we ll go deeper into this subject at my conference in dallas which is now less than two weeks away i can t wait you can hear and or see most of it with a virtual pass i truly don t know of a better educational opportunity for investors than either directly attending the strategic investment conference or getting your virtual pass please note that for people like me who prefer to learn by reading and not listening all of the speeches will be transcribed for the virtual pass and attendees automatically get them the conference is may 13 16 and there are usually a few spots that open from people having to cancel at the last minute if you can make it you probably should i look forward to seeing you there dallas sic and conversations shane and i will head for dallas next wednesday taking care of some local business and meeting friends and hopefully getting to watch the new avengers movie and then turn our complete focus to the conference surprisingly my travel calendar after that is fairly sparse for the early summer with a few potential spots here and there i was in washington dc this week where i did a video interview with my friend neil howe we discussed a wide variety of subjects including what the last half of the fourth turning will look like he foresees a great deal of political angst there is the real potential for the same kind of political stresses that gave us franklin roosevelt almost 90 years ago for some of you that is a scary thought and others will say about time i then had the privilege of spending some time with good friend newt gingrich and some of his staff we drove to a bookstore in virginia for a book signing and then he took two of us to a hole in the wall italian restaurant near his home he quizzed me for some time on my view of the economy and its interplay with society and in return i got to ask a few questions as well newt has some of the best stories as does neil howe i have been with them together and it is a priceless moment just for the record i also met with those of a different political and economic philosophy i do so all the time one of the greatest investment risks is a lack of imagination in that we can t imagine what could actually go wrong with our main investment thesis as mark twain supposedly said it ain t what you don t know that gets you into trouble it s what you know for sure that just ain t so michael lewis s book the big short opens with this similar quote from leo tolstoy the most difficult subjects can be explained to the most slow witted man if he has not formed any idea of them already but the simplest thing cannot be made clear to the most intelligent man if he is firmly persuaded that he knows already without a shadow of a doubt what is laid before him i spend a great deal of time trying to determine if what i already know for a fact is actually the case that is especially true when i m developing a new thesis that makes me uncomfortable but if the facts change what else can we do but evolve with them and on that note let me wish you a great week find a friend or two and swap a few stories it will make your life better your trying to see the way forward analyst

estimates from cia world fact book 2018 calculations from cme economic research the dispute is not without consequence to the us either although advocates of washington s approach to trade seem to think that china will bear most of the cost of the tariffs the tariffs are also a tax on u s consumers and on u s businesses boosting the tariff to 25 on 200 billion of chinse goods will probably raise u s consumer prices by about 0 1 and could shave perhaps 1 of u s corporate earnings if a 25 tariff was applied to all 500 billion of chinese goods entering the us consumer prices could easily rise 0 3 and corporate profits could fall by perhaps 3 or more bear in mind that these estimates are back of the envelope calculations the actual impact could be either greater or lesser than what these estimates suggest the case for a greater impact lies in multiplier effects and second and third round impacts from the trade war if hopes for a deal are dashed and further escalation negatively impact business confidence it could slow investment on both sides of the pacific more than these numbers would suggest is likely moreover it could lead china to devalue the renminbi taking emerging market currencies and commodity prices down with it this would offset some of the potential for higher u s inflation as well as insulate chinese exports from some portion of the impact of higher tariffs but it would do so at the cost of harming u s exports to other countries and potentially devastate the u s farm sector especially if the brazilian real and the russian ruble sink as they did after last year s round of increased tariffs figure 2 finally if china growth does slow it could make it more difficult to service china s debts figure 2 the may 2018 round of tariffs weakened rmb and other currencies the case that the impact could be less than what we suggest is predicated on the idea that chinese and u s authorities could offset some of the impact of the trade dispute in the us for example the federal reserve fed could ease monetary policy though doing so might risk having to live with increased inflation moreover continued overt administration pressure on the fed to ease policy could backfire forcing the fed to keep rates steady even if growth does begin to suffer because of the trade dispute an overly tight monetary policy or other factors in the current political climate in washington it is difficult to see how a fiscal stimulus could be enacted especially with a 4 5 of gdp budget deficit meanwhile the chinese have options as well in addition to currency devaluation they could ease fiscal policy further though doing so would risk accelerating the chinese government s accumulation of debt china could also cut interest rates an approach to easing monetary policy that they haven t used since 2016 cutting rates could increase the pressure for capital flight and could exacerbate downward pressure on their currency finally the people s bank of china pboc could also further reduce the reserve requirement ratio figure 3 doing so would allow the banks to lend more but whether they do so would depend upon both the confidence of bankers as well as the appetite of consumers and businesses for more loans if the pboc succeeded in creating a lending boom it could give a short term boost to growth but at the long term expense of adding to china s debt burden figure 4 figure 3 the pboc could cut rates or ease reserve requirements figure 4 more fiscal and monetary stimulus could push china s debt ratios higher finally we could emphasize the strong correlation between chinese growth and subsequent movements in the price levels and exchange rates of both commodities and currencies of commodity exporting nations figure 5 it could be that the trade dispute is resolved quickly and all of this worry is for naught but if the higher tariffs do come into effect and the talks break down because there is not a face saving way out for either country the fate of commodity markets and the currencies of commodity exporting nations will depend to a great extent on how successful us and chinese policy makers are in offsetting the negative consequences of the trade dispute figure 5 the li keqiang measure of chinese gdp is especially pertinent to commodities and emfx bottom line an escalation in the us china trade dispute could have profound consequences for currencies commodities and other asset classes china could try to offset negative impacts through easier monetary and fiscal policy but only at the risk of running up more debt it will be difficult for the us to use monetary or fiscal policy to counterbalance any negative impact from trade the us farm sector is especially at risk if the trade war escalates and isn t resolved soon

the second half of 2018 contributed to lower energy costs these were partially offset by an increase raw materials costs the strong sales of bromine based industrial solutions and an increase in phosphate fertilizers sales volumes more than offset lower sales quantities of potash specialty fertilizers and acids the negative impact of exchange rates on revenues which derived mainly from the euro devaluation against the us dollar compared to the average rate in q1 2018 was offset in the operating income as the devaluation of the israeli shekel the euro and the chinese yuan compared to

the cash proceeds from the sale of property plant and equipment in the amount of 35 million recorded in q1 2019 derives from the sale and leaseback of office buildings in israel and sale of a plant in mexico the company s net financial liabilities at the end of the first quarter amounted to 2 527 million an increase of 315 million compared to december 31 2018 the increase of the net financial liabilities derives mainly from an increase of 300 million of long term liabilities as a result of ifrs16 implementation on january 1st 2019 at the initial application date the company recognized a lease liability in the amount of about 300 million according to the present value of the future lease payments discounted and concurrently recognized a right of use asset in the same amount in the

tax rate of about 27 and 5 respectively the adjusted effective tax rate excluding the provision following the resolution of the royalty dispute with israeli authorities totaled 26 in q1 2019 the company s exceptionally low tax rate in the corresponding quarter last year derived mainly from exempt income from the divestiture of businesses the tax rate in the first quarter of 2019 was negatively impacted by the appreciation of the israeli shekel against the dollar during the quarter compared to 2018 year end cash flow debt level in q1 2019 operating cash flow was 173 million compared to 36 million in the corresponding quarter in 2018 the increase was driven mainly by the increase in net income excluding the capital gain from divestitures along with higher cash received

the cash proceeds from the sale of property plant and equipment in the amount of 35 million recorded in q1 2019 derives from the sale and leaseback of office buildings in israel and sale of a plant in mexico the company s net financial liabilities at the end of the first quarter amounted to 2 527 million an increase of 315 million compared to december 31 2018 the increase of the net financial liabilities derives mainly from an increase of 300 million of long term liabilities as a result of ifrs16 implementation on january 1st 2019 at the initial application date the company recognized a lease liability in the amount of about 300 million according to the present value of the future lease payments discounted and concurrently recognized a right of use asset in the same amount in the

philadelphia fed president patrick harker said yesterday that he saw current fall in inflation as transitory and he continued to see one increase at most this year possibly one at most regarding interest rates but he also emphasized that if any component of the outlook were to affect my view on the appropriate path of monetary policy it would be inflation for now we re not there yet harker said it would take more data to convince me to change the policy path on trade harker also warned that tariff is not a healthy thing for the economy overall and trade tensions are part of an umbrella of uncertainty that is weighing on businesses and markets separably dallas fed president robert kaplan said current dip in inflation should be just transitory and he s not inclined to cut interest rate to deal with current sluggish inflation though to him there is no bias to move interest rate in either direction kaplan also noted that trade uncertainty is impacting on firms supply chains and it has chilling effect on us industries though trade uncertainty is not yet having material impact on us gdp he s also concerned with deceleration in global economy elsewhere germany factory orders

ake arkema s board of directors met on 6 may 2019 to review the group s consolidated financial statements for the first quarter of 2019 at the close of the meeting chairman and ceo thierry le hénaff stated the group s first quarter financial performance close to its record high levels was in line with the guidance issued at the beginning of the year and demonstrates the group s good resilience in a global economic environment that was less favorable compared with the first quarter of 2018 several points deserve to be highlighted this solid start to the year was supported by the increased results delivered by bostik which is reaping the benefits of its efforts to enhance product mix and raise selling prices in the face of persistently high raw materials costs as well as its ongoing initiatives to improve its competitiveness at the same time the acrylics business confirmed its gradual improvement and the specialty businesses reported an increase in their overall results despite a significant decline in volumes in the automotive electronics and oil gas markets unsurprisingly earnings for pmma and fluorogases came in lower than the exceptional levels achieved in the prior year our transformation strategy towards specialty chemicals therefore continues to bear fruit and beyond the short term arkema will continue to pursue its reflections and projects in order to further increase the share of specialties within its business portfolio 1 the intermediate chemicals businesses comprise the acrylics pmma and fluorogases business lines key figures for first quarter 2019 in

comparative figures for 2018 have not been restated first quarter 2019 business performance sales rose 2 0 year on year to 2 215 million selling prices increased 1 3 thanks to continued actions to raise prices in the high performance materials division and downstream acrylics volumes declined 2 5 compared with the very high level recorded at the beginning of 2018 coating solutions benefited from good market dynamics in the high performance materials division demand was lower year on year in the automotive electronics and oil gas markets and overshadowed the success of innovations in several growing segments such as batteries and 3d printing the currency effect was a positive 2 8 mainly attributable to the rise in the us dollar against the euro the scope effect was limited at 0 4 in a less favorable global economic context ebitda of 370 million remained at a high level albeit slightly down on the high comparison base of first quarter 2018 the decrease in volumes was partially offset by the benefits of higher selling prices a favorable foreign exchange impact and the 13 million positive effect from the application of ifrs 16 in this environment specialty businesses which made up 71 of group sales demonstrated their resilience reporting year on year growth thanks to the pro active policy of raising selling prices and despite the significant decrease in the contribution from specialty molecular sieves as expected ebitda for the intermediate chemicals businesses was lower compared with last year s record high comparison base in fluorogases and the mma pmma chain at 16 7 ebitda margin resisted well at high levels recurring operating income rebit of 247 million includes 123 million recurring depreciation and amortization up 17 million against last year primarily as a result of the ifrs 16 impact and an unfavorable currency effect rebit margin stood at 11 2 operating income came in at 226 million 265 million in first quarter 2018 it includes 12 million in net other expenses mainly corresponding to restructuring costs and 9 million in depreciation and amortization mainly resulting from the revaluation of assets as part of the bostik den braven and xl brands purchase price allocation the financial result represented a net expense of 27 million in the continuity of last year 23 million in first quarter 2018 the income tax expense of 49 million reflects the geographic split of results excluding exceptional items the tax rate amounted to 21 of recurring operating income consequently net income group share totaled 147 million versus 188 million in first

both from increased selling prices against a backdrop of high raw materials costs and constant efforts to improve product mix towards higher value added applications volumes declined 6 7 year on year mainly reflecting the exceptional contribution from specialty molecular sieves in first quarter 2018 and a lower demand compared to last year in the automotive consumer electronics and oil gas markets market dynamics should gradually improve the scope effect was a positive 0 8 corresponding to the integration of acquisitions in adhesives the positive 2 2 currency effect was mainly driven by the rise of the us dollar against the euro at 162 million ebitda was down on the excellent performance of first quarter 2018 reflecting weaker volumes in advanced materials the ebitda margin resisted well at 16 1 the same level as that reached over full year 2018 in adhesives ebitda rose year on year thanks to the gradual pass through of higher raw materials costs and efforts on optimizing the product

china as expected the negative 2 4 price effect reflects the high selling prices achieved in first quarter 2018 for the mma pmma chain and fluorogases the currency effect was a positive 3 0 mainly attributable to the rise in the us dollar against the euro at 157 million ebitda was slightly down year on year reflecting the normalization of market conditions in the mma pmma chain in the continuity of fourth quarter 2018 fluorogases declined relative to their exceptional performance of 2018 particularly in europe which was impacted by the development of illegal hfc imports these factors were partially offset by the excellent performance of thiochemicals in spite of the more volatile market conditions ebitda margin was stable at high levels at 24 5 coating solutions 25 of

its efforts to raise selling prices in its more downstream businesses the price effect for the division as a whole was overall stable 0 5 negative effect in a context of lower propylene prices for acrylic monomers the division s ebitda increased 15 2 year on year to 76 million benefiting from good demand for acrylic monomers and the gradual pass through of the increase in raw materials prices in its downstream businesses driven by this positive momentum ebitda margin expanded to 13 6 from 13 0 in the first quarter of 2018 cash flow and net debt at 31 march 2019 arkema generated 73 million in free cash flow in first quarter 2019 significantly up on the negative 25 million recorded in first quarter 2018 this was driven by a lower increase in working capital requirements negative 90 million versus negative 221 million in the prior year while the group pursued its ambitious organic capital expenditure policy to support its future growth the increase in working capital requirements in the first quarter of 2019 reflects the usual seasonality albeit somewhat offset by lower volumes and the lower cost of certain raw materials the ratio of working capital to annualized sales stood at 15 1 at end march 2019 versus 15 3 at end march 2018 total capital expenditure amounted to 109 million compared with 63 million in first quarter 2018 of which 86 million was recurring and 18

november 2016 and was previously a director of kirkland lake gold inc from october 2014 tony makuch president and chief executive officer of kirkland lake gold commented we are off to a strong start in 2019 with record gold production and sales and very low unit costs in q1 2019 macassa had an outstanding quarter achieving record production operating cash costs per ounce and aisc per ounce the mine s strong results were mainly related to continued grade outperformance from stopes around the 5700 level of the south mine complex given that we will be mining in this general area for the balance of the year we are optimistic that we will continue to see very strong results from macassa at fosterville we continued to develop on and increase production from the swan zone in q1 2019 with stope production advancing on multiple levels as we develop deeper into the zone we are targeting higher levels of production from swan particularly in the second half of the year which is expected to drive higher levels of consolidated production in the third and fourth quarters based on the strong results at macassa and fosterville in q1 2019 and the outlook for the remainder of the year we have raised the lower end of our consolidated production guidance for the year and now expect to produce at least 950 000 ounces and improved our operating cash cost per ounce sold guidance which we are now targeting at 285 305 turning to our financial results we achieved record net earnings and free cash flow in q1 2019 our cash position grew 25 in one quarter ending march 2019 at 416 1 million our operating earnings were very strong and our net earnings beat the previous record in q4 2018 even though we had unfavourable foreign exchange movements this quarter as well as a higher effective tax rate looking ahead with production and sales levels expected to increase in the second half of the year we are well positioned for increased levels of profitability and cash flow going forward

million or 54 from q1 2018 revenue of 198 2 million the increase in revenue from q1 2018 reflected a 58 increase in gold sales to a quarterly record of 232 929 ounces which had a 113 5 million favourable impact on revenue compared to the same period in 2018 partially offsetting the impact of higher volumes was a 6 1 million unfavourable variance related to a 2 reduction in the average realized gold price to 1 307 per ounce from 1 333 per ounce in q1 2018 the increase in gold sales was largely attributable to fosterville where ounces sold more than doubled to 132 048 ounces from 61 500 ounces in q1 2018 also contributing to higher volumes was a 26 increase in sales at macassa to 67 305 ounces from 53 363 ounces a year earlier increased production levels largely reflecting improved average grades mainly accounted for the higher sales volumes at both fosterville and macassa q1 2019 revenue increased 24 6 million or 9 from q4 2018 revenue of 280 3 million of the increase 16 3 million related to a 6 increase in the average realized price from 1 237 per ounce the previous quarter to 1 307 per ounce in q1 2019 a 3 increase in gold sales from 225 692 ounces in q4 2018 contributed 8 9 million to the growth in revenue quarter over quarter the growth in gold sales reflected a 11 increase in sales at fosterville from the 118 955 ounces sold the previous quarter which more than offset reduced gold sales from macassa and taylor in q1 2019 earnings from mine operations earnings from mine operations in q1 2019 totaled 185 3 million double the 92 8 million of earnings from mine operations in q1 2018 and 8 higher than 170 8 million the previous quarter the increase from both prior periods resulted from higher levels of revenue in q1 2019 production costs in q1 2019 totaled 70 0 million which compared to 71 5 million in q1 2018 and 64 6 million in q4 2018 the increase in production costs compared to the previous quarter is primarily due to higher sales volumes in q1 2019 depletion and depreciation costs in q1 2019 totaled 41 3 million which compared to 27 9 million in q1 2018 and 37 3 million the previous quarter the increase from the same period in 2018 reflected significant growth in production volumes which was only partially offset by a small reduction in depletion and depreciation expense on a per ounce produced basis resulting from an increase in the level of mineral reserves at the company s operations following the release of the company s december 31 2018 mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates on february 21 2019 royalty expense in q1 2019 totaled 8 3 million compared to 6 0 million in q1 2018 and 7 6 million the previous quarter higher sales volumes mainly accounted for the increase in royalty expense compared to both prior periods unit cost performance see non ifrs measures operating cash costs per ounce sold averaged 290 a 157 per ounce or 35 improvement from q1 2018 mainly resulting from a 53 improvement in the average consolidated grade to 17 6 g t from 11 5 g t for the same period a year ago operating cash costs at fosterville averaged 144 per ounce sold a 50 improvement from 287 per ounces sold in q1 2018

ounce sold as well as a reduction in sustaining capital expenditures on a per ounce sold basis sustaining capital expenditures totaled 42 0 million unchanged from q1 2018 on a per ounce sold basis sustaining capital expenditures averaged 180 in q1 2019 versus 285 for the same period a year ago fosterville and macassa were the key drivers of the improvement in aisc per ounce sold aisc per ounce

payment expense in q1 2019 totaled 3 4 million versus 1 8 million for the same period in 2018 and 1 3 million in q4 2018 with the increase from both prior periods largely related to share price

colombes france business wire regulatory news arkema paris ake arkema s board of directors met on 6 may 2019 to review the group s consolidated financial statements for the first quarter of 2019 at the close of the meeting chairman and ceo thierry le hénaff stated the group s first quarter financial performance close to its record high levels was in line with the guidance issued at the beginning of the year and demonstrates the group s good resilience in a global economic environment that was less favorable compared with the first quarter of 2018 several points deserve to be highlighted this solid start to the year was supported by the increased results delivered by bostik which is reaping the benefits of its efforts to enhance product mix and raise selling prices in the face of persistently high raw materials costs as well as its ongoing initiatives to improve its competitiveness at the same time the acrylics business confirmed its gradual improvement and the specialty businesses reported an increase in their overall results despite a significant decline in volumes in the automotive electronics and oil gas markets unsurprisingly earnings for pmma and fluorogases came in lower than the exceptional levels achieved in the prior year our transformation strategy towards specialty chemicals therefore continues to bear fruit and beyond the short term arkema will continue to pursue its reflections and projects in order to further increase the share of specialties within its business portfolio 1 the intermediate chemicals businesses comprise the acrylics pmma

group s quarterly financial statements appended to this press release the comparative figures for 2018 have not been restated first quarter 2019 business performance sales rose 2 0 year on year to 2 215 million selling prices increased 1 3 thanks to continued actions to raise prices in the high performance materials division and downstream acrylics volumes declined 2 5 compared with the very high level recorded at the beginning of 2018 coating solutions benefited from good market dynamics in the high performance materials division demand was lower year on year in the automotive electronics and oil gas markets and overshadowed the success of innovations in several growing segments such as batteries and 3d printing the currency effect was a positive 2 8 mainly attributable to the rise in the us dollar against the euro the scope effect was limited at 0 4 in a less favorable global economic context ebitda of 370 million remained at a high level albeit slightly down on the high comparison base of first quarter 2018 the decrease in volumes was partially offset by the benefits of higher selling prices a favorable foreign exchange impact and the 13 million positive effect from the application of ifrs 16 in this environment specialty businesses which made up 71 of group sales demonstrated their resilience reporting year on year growth thanks to the pro active policy of raising selling prices and despite the significant decrease in the contribution from specialty molecular sieves as expected ebitda for the intermediate chemicals businesses was lower compared with last year s record high comparison base in fluorogases and the mma pmma chain at 16 7 ebitda margin resisted well at high levels recurring operating income rebit of 247 million includes 123 million recurring depreciation and amortization up 17 million against last year primarily as a result of the ifrs 16 impact and an unfavorable currency effect rebit margin stood at 11 2 operating income came in at 226 million 265 million in first quarter 2018 it includes 12 million in net other expenses mainly corresponding to restructuring costs and 9 million in depreciation and amortization mainly resulting from the revaluation of assets as part of the bostik den braven and xl brands purchase price allocation the financial result represented a net expense of 27 million in the continuity of last year 23 million in first quarter 2018 the income tax expense of 49 million reflects the geographic split of results excluding exceptional items the tax rate amounted to 21 of recurring operating income consequently net income group share totaled 147 million versus 188 million in first quarter 2018 excluding the post tax impact of non recurring items adjusted net income came in at 165 million

the positive 4 7 price effect was largely positive across all product lines and results both from increased selling prices against a backdrop of high raw materials costs and constant efforts to improve product mix towards higher value added applications volumes declined 6 7 year on year mainly reflecting the exceptional contribution from specialty molecular sieves in first quarter 2018 and a lower demand compared to last year in the automotive consumer electronics and oil gas markets market dynamics should gradually improve the scope effect was a positive 0 8 corresponding to the integration of acquisitions in adhesives the positive 2 2 currency effect was mainly driven by the rise of the us dollar against the euro at 162 million ebitda was down on the excellent performance of first quarter 2018 reflecting weaker volumes in advanced materials the ebitda margin resisted well at 16 1 the same level as that reached over full year 2018 in adhesives ebitda rose year on year

quarter 2018 for the mma pmma chain and fluorogases the currency effect was a positive 3 0 mainly attributable to the rise in the us dollar against the euro at 157 million ebitda was slightly down year on year reflecting the normalization of market conditions in the mma pmma chain in the continuity of fourth quarter 2018 fluorogases declined relative to their exceptional performance of 2018

quarter 2018 this was driven by a lower increase in working capital requirements negative 90 million versus negative 221 million in the prior year while the group pursued its ambitious organic capital expenditure policy to support its future growth the increase in working capital requirements in the first quarter of 2019 reflects the usual seasonality albeit somewhat offset by lower volumes and the

the last year has been an uncertain one for bond markets four rate hikes by the us federal reserve in 2018 and the promise of more to come in 2019 sent the markets into a swoon if further tightening was on any central bank s agenda an inverted yield curve the first since 2007 quickly moved it off the table for context on these developments and insight into what lies ahead we sat down with michael metcalfe head of global macro strategy for state street global markets to hear his perspective he shared some compelling data points from state street s quarterly bond compass publication and offered an intriguing prediction about the second quarter of 2019 i think q2 is likely to be a watershed moment for financial markets what follows is a lightly edited transcript of our discussion cfa institute when it comes to fixed income flows what key investor sentiment trends did you notice in q1 2019 michael metcalfe few expected central banks to capitulate on monetary tightening quite as quickly as they did in q1 as a consequence long term investors were not prepared for the stellar bond market returns that followed nevertheless investors have adjusted their fixed income portfolios revealing what they believe could happen next demand for treasuries surged into the top quartile as investors chased returns but they did so primarily at the front end of the curve investors are not yet betting on a recession even though they have reduced their holdings of high yield corporate debt growth forecasts have been reduced everywhere especially in europe however investors demand for yield appears to be trumping both growth and fiscal fears for now amid continued recovery in flows into italian sovereign debt and european corporates at the expense of bunds equity investors in emerging markets appear to be waiting for a trade deal but bond investors have already seen enough and are in the process of buying back their underweight the inflation outlook for emerging market debt is also improving what were the leading and lagging indexes for fixed income performance in the quarter what were the drivers i think q2 is likely to be a watershed moment for financial markets the investor and market panic in q4 2018 has been swiftly followed by a rapid and broad capitulation by central banks the question now is does this reflect the elevated risk of a coordinated global slowdown or even recession that markets worried about in q4 or the restart of a new reflation wave us fixed income markets provide some clues as to which way investors are leaning on the recession or reflation question they began the year with near neutral returns in treasuries but have rapidly chased returns this quarter aggregate demand for us treasuries hit a 12 month high at the end of march and investors are now beginning to build an overweight this demand has not come entirely at the expense of riskier fixed income instruments while demand for us mortgage backed securities mbs and investment grade corporates remained robust high yield bonds did see some outflows in the quarter a trend we flagged in the q1 edition of the bond compass demand for treasuries at the front end of the curve which rose to a five year high during the quarter has led this year s surge this trend stands in contrast to 2018 when demand was entirely led by appetite for the longer dated treasuries just as there was a clear desire to lengthen portfolio duration last year so there is a desire to shorten duration today also of note demand for the belly of the curve which typically performs well during recessionary periods has so far been relatively neutral so investors are enthusiastically buying treasuries although they are not betting on a recession just yet and are reluctant to add to their overweight at the long end of the curve at these yield levels looking outside the united states what are you seeing in terms of performance what s your outlook with the end of qe at the close of 2018 hopes that the ecb would begin to tighten in 2019 have already been dashed as growth forecasts have tumbled in markets this is not so much a question of the shape of the curve or a coming recession but of whether a recession is already here and how to deal with the returning challenge of negative yields across swathes of european sovereign debt the response has been interesting rather than panic about what growth means for italy s fiscal sustainability investors have continued to buy italian government bonds yields trump fear for now and the same can be said of the inflows into european corporate debt it is worth noting though that investors remain skeptical of french bonds which have some of the same risks as italy without the yield outside of mainland europe gilts have also continued to sell rather than serve as a safe haven amid the ongoing brexit negotiation gilts risk losing in either outcome there could be a return of boe hikes in the case of a long delay or the risk of capital flight and sterling induced inflation in the event of a no deal brexit local currency emerging market sovereign debt is recovering the fed s capitulation means the risks of rising us rates and a strengthening dollar are modest on balance news about the us china trade war appears to be meandering to a more constructive outcome and the recovery in em currencies means that the inflation threat has turned too in response even though recession risk has risen in developed markets long term investors continue to return to local currency debt markets this trend is especially true in mexico indonesia and south africa meanwhile investors have remained more cautious on turkey in your quarterly bond compass piece you have a tool called pricestats what data does it track what does it look to predict pricestats began life as an mit massachusetts institute of technology research project called the billion prices project and the offshoot of that was a company called pricestats with which state street now has a joint venture what it does is scrape tens of thousands of publicly available retail prices off the internet in more than 30 countries and we aggregate those prices up into a measure of inflation that in a number of countries is very similar to the inflation rate that s produced by the statistical agencies you can see in the bond compass that in the us and the eurozone it has tracked the official data very well the advantage of calculating inflation this way and collecting it online is that we can do it daily and we can almost do it in real time so we only have a three day publication lag before we know what the inflation rate is on a daily basis it gives us an almost real time pulse on retailers pricing decisions it can show and give insight into demand trends or obviously and most recently how quickly oil prices are feeding through into consumer prices so it s like a real time pulse of the economy and in periods like the q4 selloff where we ve had such a drastic change in the market s view of growth these real time indexes are very helpful to get a check on what retailers are doing you featured a portfolio manager colleague discussing his approach to actively managing short term duration debt what does that look like and what s the outlook given the shape of the current yield curve jim palmieri senior pm and head of structured credit at state street global advisors manages our active ultra short term strategy what makes the method unique is employing both quantitative and fundamental techniques in the total return process because fixed income markets are persistently inefficient jim and his team use a three pronged approach with structural cyclical and tactical elements to extract alpha from these inefficiencies throughout a market cycle the structural process establishes modest portfolio risk for markets that are considered fairly valued to take advantage of some of the longer term inefficiencies the team identifies an example of a current structural inefficiency is the kink in the yield curve in the space between cash like securities and intermediate duration bonds next the cyclical process revolves around the firm s monthly asset allocation meeting this meeting incorporates feedback from all the members of the active team to establish risk targets for duration curve and asset allocation this framework allows us to take advantage of market pricing that jim and his team feel have deviated from fair value the final component is a tactical process where individual securities are carefully selected to construct the portfolio this has been a key source of alpha over time ultimately the top down asset allocation decisions and bottom up security selection combine to provide a consistent and diversified source of alpha over the long term as evinced by the team s long term track record in early 2019 you identified the opportunity that convertibles represented to investors does that still hold true today or has volatility whipsawed that a bit i think that anything that could offer a bit more yield and a bit more upside because investors are still income hungry is still relatively attractive as you say it probably needs volatility to calm down a little bit but i think we re going through a phase now where markets have to some extent gotten ahead of the data so your market risky assets have dislocated far more i would say than the data would suggest they should have and i think there s been a little panic in markets about a coming recession if we get calmer data like we seem to be getting in the us then i think some of that volatility will calm down and investors will be refocused on trying to pick up yield if you liked this post don t forget to subscribe to the enterprising investor all posts

aron 2017 8 evidence suggests that enabling regulation promotes the profitability and sustainability of mobile money systems 9 critical regulatory lessons are summarised by aron 2019 di castri 2013 and klein and mayer 2011 the economics of mobile money the micro view mobile money potentially helps ameliorate several areas of market failure in developing economies 10 lower transactions costs transactions costs are reduced for sending and receiving money especially with inadequate transport infrastructure these include the transport costs of travel the travel time and the waiting time in long queues coordination costs between individuals between firms and suppliers or customers and between government and individuals and costs of delays and leakages acting like a tax or complete loss through theft from insecure methods of money transfer improved transparency the impact of enhancing transparency through electronic records is far reaching every deposit withdrawal transfer or payment transaction through mobile money creates a recorded financial history this protects customers rights and fosters trust in business promoting the growth of efficient payments networks mobile money makes international remittances more affordable and traceable tax collection could be improved through mobile payment and avoidance reduced through more visible spending mature mobile money systems foster the formalisation of the economy integrating informal sector users into business networks formal banking and insurance and linking to government through social security tax and secure wages payments saving mobile money alters the nature of saving and increases saving through digital means for the unbanked poor their immersion in physical cash creates considerable frictions in their financial lives radcliffe and voorhies 2012 cash based households save informally with risk of theft e g cash under the mattress accumulation of assets such as jewellery or livestock and saving via informal savings groups mobile money electronic accounts safely store cash though without paying interest and offer possibilities for commitment savings accounts dupas and robinson 2013 encouraging saving by the poor privacy and empowerment of women women or minority groups often face limitations in opportunities and access to property an aspect of inequality that can produce widespread economic inefficiencies mobile money can alter bargaining power within the family empowering female mobile money users greater privacy may influence both inter household allocations jakiela and ozier 2016 and intra household allocations duflo and udry 2004 compared with cash receipts the reduced observability of the timing and sizes of mobile transfers and the accumulated electronic balances could protect savings for the recipient risk and insurance living standards of the poor are at risk of communal shocks including pestilence other natural disasters conflict and medical epidemics and idiosyncratic shocks including theft damage to the homestead illness and death formal insurance is typically absent but family clan and network ties can create informal insurance networks monitored by trust relationships within the network de weerdt and dercon 2006 jack and suri 2011 suggest how mobile money can facilitate risk spreading the geographic reach of networks can enlarge timely transfers of even small amounts of money can arrest serious declines otherwise hard to reverse more efficient investment decisions can be made improving the risk and return trade off mature mobile money systems allowing access to micro insurance provide an additional buffer expanding network and labour market opportunities mobile money could alter the size and cohesion of social networks improved risk sharing and cheaper long range remittances expand the scope of labour decisions to higher risk but higher return occupations or migration to higher return labour markets suri and jack 2016 reduced transactions costs of remittances might foster more liberal attitudes to migration from the homestead jack and suri 2011 though distant migrants are less observable and accountable there is huge scope for research on network formation or dissolution and on migration and remittance decisions using mobile money transactions data chuang and schechter 2015 empirical evidence from the micro literature demonstrating welfare and risk sharing gains from mobile money across countries could bolster the case for government and donor support and investment a burgeoning microeconomic empirical literature has attempted to quantify the economic gains of access to secure financial services through mobile money and factors driving the adoption of mobile money however this literature is burdened by problems with data methodology and identification data challenges institutional and political regime changes affect the uptake of mobile money in côte d ivoire for example the cessation of conflict from 2012 was key to mobile money adoption pénicaud and katakam 2014 shifts occur over time in the relevance of determinants e g cheaper more capable smartphones widen access and ownership in principle one could test empirically for the effects of shifts and regime changes empirical regressions will be mis specified when omitting hard to measure variables linked to mobile money such as spillover learning effects in the community and technological and quality changes important observables such as education quality and wealth are typically poorly measured which may exacerbate the biases definitional ambiguities can introduce measurement bias in mobile money usage 11 however if privacy concerns can be overcome new access to a rich seam of big data the administrative mobile money transactions from business and individuals presents an enormous research opportunity 12 figure 6 registered and active total accounts source data from the gsma state of the industry report 2017 note this figure shows that of the 690 000 registered accounts in december 2017 only 168 000 were 30 day active i e at least one transaction was performed in the preceding 30 days challenges for empirical methods the quantitative empirical work encompasses studies assessing the determinants of the adoption of mobile money i e a proxy for usage of mobile money is the dependent variable and studies of the effects of mobile money on microeconomic outcomes examples of the latter include whether mobile money promotes improved risk sharing food security consumption business profitability saving and effective use of cash transfers two selection problems are faced raising the problem of ambiguous causality 13 the roll out of mobile money by operators and their agents may not be random if they choose areas to operate in based on household and village characteristics for instance if wealth determines agent selection into a village and wealth is not properly controlled for in regressions this will exaggerate the effect of mobile money in promoting consumption it is difficult to disprove self selection by the agents toward more profitable locations 14 a second selection problem is undisputed adoption of mobile money by individuals is influenced by factors both observable e g education urban dwelling and the use of banking services and unobservable e g susceptibility to risk community learning spill over effects and changes in technology preference that may also be correlated with mobile money use thus it is difficult to establish one way causality using measures of usage of mobile money the dominant empirical methodologies in this field are randomised controlled trials rct 15 quasi experiments with a difference in differences estimation strategy or the non parametric method of propensity score matching and instrumental variables the methods have differing degrees of success in dealing with heterogeneity16 at the individual or household level another consideration is whether results can be scaled up or transported to generalise to other contexts with different institutional structures assessing the evidence a detailed technical survey of a range of studies is presented in aron 2017 2018 the best of these studies exploits panel data amongst the most convincing analyses are the difference in differences analyses demonstrating how mobile money has fostered risk sharing amongst informal networks after large shocks the proposed mechanism stems from the reduced transaction costs the focus is not on the direct effect of mobile money usage on welfare but on how mobile money usage interacts with a negative income shock e g a drought or flood while controlling for household characteristics 17 in kenya jack and suri 2014 find total consumption of mobile money users is unaffected by negative income shocks while consumption drops for non users especially the poorest for tanzania riley 2018 further examines the potential beneficial spillover effects of mobile money to the rural village community following a negative shock the ugandan rural panel study of munyegera and matsumoto 2016a supports qualitative evidence that education and wealth influence adoption several studies claim the beneficial influence of mobile money on reported savings by saving method and on saving flows demombynes and thegeya 2012 munyegera and matsumoto 2016a and mbiti and weil 2016 however the results are compromised by problems of ambiguous causality and no robust and conclusive results can be reached rct studies in mozambique and afghanistan batista and vicente 2016 blumenstock et al 2015b suggest saving did not increase though saving methods switched to mobile money these studies use small and specialised samples and are probably not generalisable far less satisfactory are several non rct welfare studies reviewed where results are generally judged unreliable by aron 2018 problems of ambiguous causality for the mobile money usage dummy are centre stage and the use of various methods18 to mitigate this are not always convincing two stronger studies are for uganda munyegera and matsumoto 2016a and kenya suri and jack 2016 the kenyan panel study suggests consumption growth for female headed households was positive with access to mobile money with occupational shifts out of farming and 2 of kenyan households were lifted out of poverty but the result is tempered by probable bias see aron 2018 19 a convincing rct welfare study by aker et al 2016 finds household welfare improved after drought for recipients of cash transfers through mobile money accounts in niger intra household bargaining power for women was promoted20 and their productivity improved by reduced transport costs travelling and queuing time recipients were more likely to cultivate and market cash crops and child diets improved to reap such benefits the mobile money infrastructure must be functional generalisability awaits replication across other locations cultures continents and time periods final thoughts atkinson 2015 argued that economic inequality is often aligned with differences in access to use of or knowledge of information and communication technologies e g figure 7 he stressed that researchers firms policymakers and governments have the possibility to shape the direction and path of technological change aid agencies donors and international agencies have strongly fostered the beneficial growth of mobile money and financial inclusion figure 7 the percentage of people not using the internet in 2016 source constructed using data from the itu world telecommunication ict indicators database static micro data based snapshots are liable to understate the system wide benefits of mobile money micro analysis misses the positive externalities linked to network growth and increased transparency and formalisation of the economy the static analysis misses the likelihood that many benefits take time to

2016 on market failure in a more general context of financial services using the number of mobile money accounts or the number of registered customers may induce multiple counting of the same individual if several accounts are held with different providers if registered customers are inactive and globally two thirds of registered accounts are inactive with a generous 90 day definition this

geotagged data blumenstock 2012 and explore social networks relevant for work on remittances aker and blumenstock 2015 technically this is an endogeneity problem which in econometrics occurs when an explanatory variable is correlated with the error term because of simultaneous causality omitted variables and or measurement error there are several statistical methods that aim to correct the resulting bias in the regression estimates several authors contend there is little statistical correlation between agent roll out and household observable characteristics that might have been associated with future outcomes but they use partial one at a time correlates only which are not decisive for a critical discussion see aron 2018 see also deaton and cartwright 2016 heterogeneity refers to the variation across surveyed individuals some of which can be observed and controlled for e g individuals differing by age and education but some of which is difficult to measure e g the changing technological preferences of individuals thus omitted heterogeneity is an omitted variable and hence a kind of endogeneity the best of these studies exploits the properties of panel data to remove sources of unobserved time invariant household heterogeneity using household fixed effects include location by time dummies and rural by time dummies to help control for time varying heterogeneity and include appropriate controls for household characteristics poor instrumentation and a lack of balanced panel data are problems here this study is at its most convincing in the differenced specification for consumption but even there bias arises from the limited control of heterogeneity aron 2018 cash transfer recipients were able temporarily to conceal the arrival of the

to the terms operating netback corporate netback net debt and net debt to funds flow these indicators are not recognized measures under gaap ifrs and do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by gaap ifrs accordingly the company s use of these terms may not be comparable to similarly defined measures presented by other companies management uses these terms for the reasons set forth below please see the company s march 31 2019 md a for a reconciliation of such measures to the most directly comparable gaap ifrs measures operating netback operating netback is a common non gaap financial measure used in the oil and natural gas industry which is a useful supplemental measure to evaluate the specific operating performance by product at the oil and natural gas lease level the most directly comparable gaap measure to operating netback is funds flow operating netback is calculated as oil and natural gas revenue less royalties operating and transportation expenses it is presented on an absolute value and per unit basis funds flow and corporate netback corporate netback is a common non gaap financial measure used in the oil and natural gas industry which evaluates the company s profitability at the corporate level corporate netback is equal to funds flow which is a directly comparable gaap measure petrus analyzes these measures on an absolute value and per unit basis management believes that funds flow and corporate netback provide information to assist a reader in understanding the company s profitability relative to current commodity prices it is calculated as the operating netback less general and administrative expense finance expense decommissioning expenditures plus other income and the net realized gain loss on financial derivatives net debt net debt is a non gaap financial measure and is calculated as current assets excluding unrealized financial derivative assets less current liabilities excluding unrealized financial derivative liabilities and deferred share unit liabilities and long term debt petrus uses net debt as a key indicator of its leverage and strength of its balance sheet there is no gaap measure that is reasonably comparable to net debt net debt to funds flow net debt to funds flow is calculated as the period ending net debt divided by the trailing quarter funds flow annualized advisories basis of presentation financial data

financial measure it also discloses adjusted income from continuing operations which excludes gain loss on sale or impairment of long lived assets interest outside of normal operations other operating credits and charges net early debt extinguishment and adjusts for a normalized tax rate adjusted ebitda and adjusted income from continuing operations are not a substitute for the gaap measure of net income or operating cash flows or other gaap measures of operating performance or liquidity lp has adjusted ebitda in this press release because it uses this as important supplemental measure of our performance and believe that similarly titled measures are frequently used by securities analysts investors and other interested persons in the evaluation of companies in our industry some of which present similarly titled measures when reporting their results lp uses adjusted ebitda to evaluate its performance as compared to other companies in its industry that have different financing and capital structures and or tax rates it should be noted that companies calculate similarly titled measures differently and therefore as presented by lp may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies in addition adjusted ebitda has material limitations as a performance measure because it excludes interest expense income tax benefit expense and depreciation and

operations which excludes gain loss on sale or impairment of long lived assets interest outside of normal operations other operating credits and charges net and early debt extinguishment adjusted for a normalized tax rate is a useful measure for evaluating our ability to generate earnings and that providing this measure will allow investors to more readily compare the earnings referred to in the

expense benefit for the september 30 2019 tax year using a u s statutory tax rate of 21 we computed income tax expense for the year ended september 30 2018 using a u s statutory tax rate of 24 5 for the three and six months ended march 31 2018 we recorded tax benefit expense of 0 1 million and 8 8 million respectively related to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the information available the tax reform also included a one time mandatory repatriation transition tax on previously untaxed accumulated and current e p of certain of our foreign subsidiaries we made a reasonable estimate of the transition tax and for the three and six months ended march 31 2018 we recorded a provisional transition tax obligation of 0 7 million and 11 3 respectively the accounting

obligate the account holders to reimburse intl fcstone financial for any account deficits in their accounts as of march 31 2019 the aggregate receivable from these client accounts net of collections and other allowable deductions was 29 4 million with no individual account receivable exceeding 1 4 million intl fcstone financial continues to pursue collection of these receivables and intends both to enforce and to defend its rights aggressively and to claim interest and costs of collection where applicable we have been named in arbitrations brought by clients seeking damages relating to the trading losses in these accounts we believe that such cases are without merit and intend to defend them vigorously at the same time we have initiated numerous arbitration proceedings against clients to recover deficit balances in their accounts we believe we have a valid claim against our clients based on the express language of the customer contracts and legal precedent and intend to pursue collection of these claims vigorously we have done an assessment of the collectability of these accounts considered the status of arbitration proceedings and have concluded that we do not have a sufficient basis to record an allowance against these uncollected balances as we move through the collection and arbitration processes and additional information becomes available we will continue to consider the need for an allowance against the carrying value of these uncollected balances depending on future collections and arbitration proceedings any provisions for bad debts and actual losses ultimately may or may not be material to our financial results currently we do not believe that any potential losses related to this matter would impact our ability to comply with our ongoing liquidity capital and regulatory requirements interest income expense interest income increased 20 3 million or 73 to 48 2 million in the second quarter compared to 27 9 million in the prior year as a

hedging and ces segments decreased 6 to 1 9 billion in the second quarter compared to the prior year however the effect of increases in short term interest rates drove an aggregate 5 1 million

not have discretionary authority to transact trades on behalf of our clients operating revenues increased 3 to 80 6 million in the second quarter compared to 78 3 million in the prior year exchange traded revenues declined 5 to 38 9 million in the second quarter primarily driven by lower client activity in both the domestic grain markets and in certain omnibus relationships introduced by our commercial hedging employees which are reflected in the other category above these declines were partially offset by a strong quarter in our lme business overall exchange traded contract volumes decreased 13 versus the prior year however the average rate per contract increased 9 to 5 99 otc revenues increased 10 to 30 8 million in the second quarter compared to 28 0 million in the prior year despite a 7 decrease in otc volumes otc revenues were positively affected by a 6 4 million partial reversal of marked to market declines recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 related to certain longer tenor positions which are directionally hedged but suffered declines in value during periods of lower market activity at the end of the calendar year agricultural otc revenues declined 21

million in the second quarter interest income increased 43 to 7 3 million compared to 5 1 million in the prior year the increase in interest income was driven by an increase in short term interest rates as well as a 3 increase in average equity for exchange traded futures and options clients versus the prior year to 918 3 million in the second quarter segment income increased 9 to 30 2 million in the second quarter compared to 27 6 million in the prior year primarily as a result of the 2 3 million increase in operating revenues discussed above and a 2 1 million decline in variable expenses excluding interest expense these increases were partially offset by a 2 0 million increase in non variable direct expenses including a 0 8 million increase in bad debt expense variable expenses

driven by 6 growth in the volume of payments made and an 8 increase in the average revenue per trade compared to the prior year this growth was driven by increased activity from our international banking clients particularly related to capital transactions mergers and acquisitions and smaller recurring payments segment income increased 17 to 15 8 million in the second quarter compared to 13 5 million in the prior year this increase primarily resulted from the increase in operating revenues partially offset by a 1 1 million increase in non variable direct expenses versus the prior year period primarily driven by higher non variable compensation variable expenses excluding interest expressed as a percentage of operating revenues decreased to 23 in the second quarter compared to 25 in

conversion fees these adr fees are included in the consolidated income statements as transaction based clearing expenses operating revenues in debt capital markets increased 38 in the second quarter

decreased 30 in the second quarter compared to the prior year as assets under management decreased 26 to 347 3 million in the second quarter compared to 469 8 million in the prior year the decline in

peyto spent the majority of the first quarter advancing its greater sundance liquids rich cardium play with all drilling and completions focused on the cardium success with this program was evidenced by some of the strongest initial production and most consistent well results in the company s 20 year history in this play as well peyto added 49 sections of new cardium lands in the quarter all with

the prior year this is in contrast to the average daily aeco gas price of 2 49 gj in q1 2019 historically monthly prices have outperformed daily prices however this was not the case in the first quarter peyto typically hedges the majority of the aeco exposed production using fixed price swaps settled against the monthly price which is why such a large portion of peyto s unhedged gas received the monthly price on average for q1 2019 peyto realized a natural gas price of 2 48 mcf 2 16 gj or 135 of the aeco monthly average price this was the result of a combination of approximately 14 of natural gas production being sold into the daily or monthly spot market at an average of 1 94 gj approximately 78 having been pre sold at an average hedged price of 2 04 gj and approximately 8 being sold to export markets in eastern canada at 3 69 gj in the first quarter of 2019 ngl prices relative to natural gas prices justified the operation of peyto s oldman deep cut plant only during the

marketing peyto continues to make meaningful progress on its market diversification strategy this thoughtful plan is designed to complement the company s highly successful hedging strategy and endeavors to achieve over the long term a balanced marketing approach whereby 40 of natural gas sales are linked to aeco based pricing 40 are linked to us based pricing and 20 are sold directly to intra alberta industrial markets the company has been actively securing both synthetic and physical transportation arrangements to link gas sales to us based markets and eastern canadian markets that are more closely tied to nymex price for 2019 peyto has 25 of forecast natural gas volumes linked to nymex prices with 84 of this volume already hedged 12 linked to eastern canadian markets in dawn and ventura where 13 is hedged 100 of ventura volumes are hedged for this summer and 63 to the aeco market where 72 is hedged the result of these arrangements means less than 5 of annual revenue is exposed to the aeco spot market for 2020 peyto has 47 of forecast natural gas volumes linked to nymex prices 13 to dawn and ventura and 40 to aeco at those markets 6 of the nymex and 38 of the aeco volume has already been hedged for a real time summary of peyto s market diversification portfolio and future hedges refer to peyto s website at activity update drilling activity was shut down in mid april for the annual spring breakup period while completion activity continued with the completion of four standing cardium wells four additional wells remain standing awaiting completion which is expected to occur in june no new wells were brought on production in april however 5 gross 4 5 net cardium wells have recently been equipped and tied in during the first week of may production in april was impacted by extremely volatile aeco natural gas prices where at times peyto had approximately 10 of its dry gas production shut in due to low prices this reduced april average production by approximately 1 000 boe d the new liquids rich wells added in may all with ngl yields in excess of 75 bbl mmcf have grown current liquid production to 12 500 bbl d this added liquid volume has created high gathering system pressures which has backed out approximately 1 500 boe d of existing production pipeline looping and plant liquid handling projects are ready to be installed immediately following spring breakup to recover this production also since the end of the first quarter peyto has acquired 7 net sections of cardium rights at an average cost of 55 acre increasing total crown purchases this year to 67 sections peyto s first montney well which was drilled in the fourth quarter of 2018 will also be completed in june the company plans to complete the well using a slick water fracture stimulation which will incorporate approximately 3 400 tonnes of sand pumped along the 1 935m horizontal lateral new ventures peyto continues to work on design attributes for its big sunny storage scheme reservoir simulation work has been completed and a pilot project utilizing existing vertical wells is currently being contemplated the company is also awaiting the imminent market impact to local propane prices by a new west coast export terminal before making a final investment decision on the swanson deep cut facility installation as this facility will primarily extract liquid propane from the sales gas stream in addition peyto continues to evaluate opportunities to vertically integrate its energy business to extract maximum value from existing and future reserves and infrastructure assets outlook the current capital program for 2019 remains unchanged with an expected range of 150 to 200 million involving the drilling of approximately 50 cardium liquids rich gas wells the testing of peyto s new montney play the continued accumulation of new lands which add profitable drilling inventory and continued debt reduction the rapidly growing liquids revenue particularly from free wellhead condensate is expected to help offset weak summer spot gas prices by replacing declining dry gas production with more liquids rich gas peyto will be able to increase its sales revenue on a unit of production basis while continuing to drive down total supply cost resulting in increasing cash netbacks peyto s continues to pursue its long term strategy of becoming a more fully integrated energy business opportunities to invest in new infrastructure to extend the value chain will continue to be investigated as will additional opportunities for market

except as may be required pursuant to applicable securities laws barrels of oil equivalent to provide a single unit of production for analytical purposes natural gas production and reserves volumes are converted mathematically to equivalent barrels of oil boe peyto uses the industry accepted standard conversion of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil 6 mcf 1 bbl the 6 1 boe ratio is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip it does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead and is not based on current prices while the boe ratio is useful for comparative measures and observing trends it does not accurately reflect individual product values and might be misleading particularly if used in isolation as well given that the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil to natural gas is significantly different from the 6 1 energy equivalency ratio using a 6 1 conversion ratio may be misleading as an indication of value non ifrs measurements within this news release references are made to terms commonly used in the oil and gas industry funds from operations funds from operations per share and netbacks do not have any standardized meaning under ifrs and previous gaap and are referred to as non ifrs measures funds from operations are described in footnote 1 to the first table on page 2 of this news release netbacks are a non ifrs measure that represents the profit margin associated with the production and sale of petroleum and natural gas netbacks are per unit of production measures used to assess peyto s performance and efficiency the primary factors that produce peyto s strong netbacks and high margins are a low cost structure and the high heat content of its natural gas that results in higher commodity prices the company s calculation of the non ifrs measures included herein may differ from the calculation of similar measures by other issuers therefore the company s non ifrs measures may not be comparable to other similar measures used by other issuers non ifrs measures should only be used in conjunction with the company s annual audited and interim financial

this story appears in the may 30 2019 issue of forbes subscribe hardly a day goes by without some eminence from business or finance proclaiming with furrowed brow and seeming sorrow that capitalism is in crisis and must be overhauled if it is to survive and not be replaced with some variant of socialism inequality climate change obscene levels of corporate profits stagnant wages soaring healthcare costs crushing levels of student debt rampant wall street greed high tech monsters and much more are all laid at the feet of an allegedly heartless unresponsive capitalistic system it ain t so contrary to all this highbrow hand wringing the problem is bad government policies and worse a fundamental misunderstanding of free markets it s time for a reality check regarding this much maligned system spencer platt getty images capitalism free enterprise free markets whatever you label our system is moral because one succeeds by meeting the needs and wants of other people an entrepreneur tries to discern needs people don t know they have until a product or service is introduced to the market think steve jobs and the iphone and ipad businesspeople try to persuade you to buy what they offer unless the government gets involved there is no coercion countless people are trying to come up with ways to make everyone s lives better if they succeed they might gasp get rich but we are all better off ever more sophisticated supply chains rise up which work precisely because no tsar or central planner is in charge government mistakes not inherent flaws in free markets are at the root of every economic crisis in modern times the great depression was triggered by the draconian smoot hawley tariff act which imposed higher taxes on thousands of import items triggering a global trade war that devastated economies this felony was compounded when countries germany britain and the u s were the worst offenders substantially raised taxes in the teeth of a sharp downturn the terrible inflation of the 1970s was the result of the federal reserve and other central banks repeatedly printing too much money the crisis of 2008 09 sprang from the u s deliberately weakening the dollar which set off a flight to hard assets such as housing high taxes are growth killers taxes are a burden countries that keep the burden light do better than those that don t after it recovered from wwii europe had growth rates comparable to or even better than those of the u s but in the 1970s the weight of taxation became heavier and heavier with the imposition of vats and higher effective income tax rates result microscopic paces of expansion every time the u s has enacted big tax cuts its economy has blossomed the economy s post obama pickup came from the 2017 tax reduction and deregulation excessive regulations hurt regulatory expert philip howard cites a typical example an upstate new york apple orchard is subject to 5 000 rules from 17 different programs regulations cost the u s some 2 trillion a year on average a manufacturer pays 2 000 to 4 000 in annual taxes per worker its regulatory burden is 20 000 to 35 000 is it any wonder that manufacturing has suffered until recently don t blame student debt on free enterprise government is the villain with the best intentions washington created programs to help people pay for college primarily pell grants and student loans studies from the new york fed and others confirm that the more money colleges collected via these schemes the more students were charged high priced healthcare is not a failure of capitalism free markets are the solution here not more government control ours is a third party healthcare system government primarily medicare and medicaid insurance companies and large employers not consumers hospitals revenues depend on how well they negotiate with third parties not on how well they please their patients what a drug company charges for a medicine is far smaller than what you see reflected on a hospital bill a big chunk of the price charged goes to pay pharmaceutical benefit managers discovering in advance what a procedure might cost is a herculean effort in normal markets if you make an advance in productivity competitors will likely follow suit quickly not so in healthcare or higher ed the surgery center of oklahoma posts all of its prices online it has topflight surgeons its overhead is low by industry standards and the cost of an operation is a fraction of that charged at traditional hospitals and clinics because patients pay the entire amount in advance prices are higher if a patient wants the center to file their insurance claim yet it has few imitators why because there is no consumer market since third parties foot most of the bill most patients have no incentive to compare quality and prices and would be hard put to do so even if they wanted to take electronic records every dry cleaner and gas station has had them for 20 years but not healthcare providers there was no competitive advantage then washington decided to mandate them but did so destructively in a manner worthy of the defunct soviet union purdue university president mitch daniels has frozen tuitions since he took office in 2013 he has enacted numerous efficiencies so that to attend this prestigious institution a student today pays less than a student did six years ago by the way daniels has boosted the number of purdue s tenured professors but just as with the case of the surgery center of oklahoma and other hospitals there s no stampede of colleges and universities urgently following purdue s example free markets reduce poverty real incomes per person have risen over 50 fold since we achieved independence before the industrial revolution which capitalism made possible individual incomes in the world grew imperceptibly today despite all the economic policy mistakes poverty is plummeting over the past 20 years 1 billion people have escaped abject poverty free markets always turn scarcity into abundance today s luxuries into tomorrow s common products among countless examples is the handheld phone the first cellphone of the early 1980s which could only make calls was as large as a shoe box weighed as much as a brick had barely an hour of battery life and cost 3 995 today there are billions of cellphones and most have the capability that a supercomputer had a couple of decades ago the same happy phenomenon of getting more for less would happen in healthcare if certain free market reforms were enacted such as nationwide shopping for medical insurance and removing restrictions on medical savings accounts inequality wages until recently had stagnated since the financial crisis of 2008 and they hadn t been improving much in the decade before then once again the problem was faulty government actions investment is the sine qua non for progress and more investment takes place when money has a stable value until the 1970s the dollar had been fixed to gold and the u s economy had grown as no other nation s ever had before but since then our average growth has declined 25 or more and guess what income growth hasn t been as robust as when we were on the gold standard either another factor relentlessly rising medical costs employer provided insurance counts as part of an employee s compensation even though compensation has risen the cash part has lagged not helping either has been the surge in federal payroll taxes labeled fica on your paycheck stub with a regime of low taxes a trustworthy dollar and a patient oriented healthcare system cash wages would rise very nicely profits are essential they are moral without them the economy stagnates and regresses the economist joseph schumpeter famously coined the phrase creative destruction vibrant economies need enormous amounts of new capital to move forward change constantly destroys old capital look at what the internet did to the value of legacy newspaper and magazine publishers which must be replaced capital is needed to finance startups most fail and expansions as well as the productivity improvements of existing businesses capital comes from profits and savings in that sense profit is a cost of doing business more and more young people want to work for outfits that are not just business this is one of the great virtues of capitalism the system seamlessly adjusts to people s wants and expectations wise companies quickly pick up and respond to these changes forbes has written frequently about these companies and the individuals pioneering their efforts some people in business do bad amoral or unethical things yes they do but that s not something unique to capitalism people were guilty of bad behavior long before adam smith penned his capitalist classic an inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations in 1776 moreover in an open free market and democratic system the bad ones are usually flushed out unlike in authoritarian or socialist regimes socialism never works it always leads to blood tyranny and tears as can be seen today in venezuela cuba and north korea and in the recent past in the soviet union maoist china and communist cambodia where in less than four years the regime slaughtered more than one fourth of the population what about the socialism of scandinavia and europe they are not socialist in the sense that the government owns and runs the economy many of these countries have elaborate welfare programs restrictive labor laws and overtaxation but all this is beginning to change what self styled american socialists overlook is that countries like sweden have been scaling back government sweden has been cutting taxes it has no inheritance tax and it allows school choice which is anathema to bernie sanders and his ilk as for the rest of the eu the average rate of economic growth since the crisis of 2008 has been minuscule less than half that of the u s more to the point capitalism creates the wealth that makes welfare states possible that s why more and more europeans are looking at pro capitalist reforms such as low taxes to gin up their economies
the new fangled modern monetary theory mmt that says a country can borrow in its own currency without worrying about inflation or government deficits and debt is not the right recipe for central and eastern europe according to the ebrd s chief economist the idea that a country can run larger budget deficits has made mmt popular with left leaning politicians in the united states such as bernie sanders and congresswoman alexandria ocasio cortez who want to fund schemes for healthcare or a green new deal to tackle climate change sergei guriev ebrd chief economist said the argument might work for the us where government bond yields are so low that it can benefit from increasing sovereign debt provided the funds raised are used for productive purposes this is especially true in countries where interest rates are below the gdp growth rates so countries naturally grow out of debt he told globalmarkets this unfortunately is not the case in most of ebrd countries of operations where debt sustainability is still a very salient issue his criticism echoed the verdict of the international monetary fund at the spring meetings last month incoming chief economist gita gopinath said there was no free lunch adding there are limits to how much countries can spend the imf s financial counsellor tobias adrian said unsustainable fiscal policies are problematic they can trigger crises currency weakness petr krpata chief emea strategist at ing bank said mmt would not work for countries in the cee that tended to be price takers in financial markets he told globalmarkets the us was in a unique position because the dollar was the world s reserve currency one of the by products of mmt would be a sharply weaker currency he said clearing the bar for smaller currencies and more open economies to do something like this is way way higher because their currencies would of course decline meaningfully the idea that mmt could be applied to more open economies that are price takers is not on the cards james knightley ing s chief international economist said the imperative to tackle climate change was much greater in the us than in europe the us is in a very different position than europe he told globalmarkets europe is prepared to take very aggressive action if you think of emissions targets and the fuel economy in comparison with the us a survey of leading economists by the chicago booth igm forum in april found 76 strongly disagreed and 24 disagreed with the statement that countries that borrow in their own currency could finance as much real government spending as they want by creating money none agreed

company financial results total revenue for the first quarter ended march 31 2019 was 393 1 million a 0 5 increase from the same quarter of the prior year or a 2 8 increase on a constant currency basis this growth was largely driven by net new business improvements in commercial terms and contractual rate escalations the maturation of the clearfield utah facility the opening of the build to suit facility in middleboro massachusetts at the end of the third quarter of 2018 and the incremental revenue associated with the portfresh acquisition in january 2019 all within the global warehouse segment these factors were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates the exit of two sites in the second quarter of 2018 the impact of one less business day in the first quarter of 2019 as compared to the first quarter of 2018 and the later timing of the easter holiday in 2019 for the first quarter of 2019 the company reported a net loss of 4 6 million or 0 03 per diluted share compared to a net loss of 8 6 million for the same quarter of the prior year net loss for the current quarter included the impact of approximately 12 6 million of asset impairment charges

ebitda was 71 1 million for the first quarter of 2019 compared to 71 7 million for the same quarter of the prior year this reflects a 0 8 decrease over prior year largely impacted by unfavorable

first quarter 2019 global warehouse segment results for the first quarter of 2019 global warehouse segment revenues were 289 6 million an increase of 3 1 million or 1 1 compared to 286 5 million for the first quarter of 2018 this growth was primarily driven by the same factors mentioned above warehouse segment contribution noi was 90 8 million or 31 4 of segment revenue for the first quarter of

points in segment margin period over period as previously mentioned growth was largely impacted by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates and the later timing of easter in 2019 as compared to 2018 additionally the year over year profit growth was strained by higher workers compensation and health care costs as a reminder during the first quarter of 2018 the company had a 1 million benefit related to workers compensation despite these items the year over year growth was driven by the aforementioned revenue trends combined with operating efficiency gains driven by power savings and the leveraging of its fixed expenses the company ended the first quarter of 2019 with 144 total facilities in its global warehouse segment portfolio of the 144 total facilities 137 meet the company s

benefit 4 141 8 728 we view and manage our business through three primary business segments warehouse third party managed and transportation our core business is our warehouse segment where we provide temperature controlled warehouse storage and related handling and other warehouse services in our warehouse segment we collect rent and storage fees from customers to store their frozen and perishable food and other products within our real estate portfolio we also provide our customers with handling and other warehouse services related to the products stored in our buildings that are designed to optimize their movement through the cold chain such as the placement of food products for storage and preservation the retrieval of products from storage upon customer request blast freezing case picking kitting and repackaging and other recurring handling services under our third party managed segment we manage warehouses on behalf of third parties and provide warehouse management services to several leading food retailers and manufacturers in customer owned facilities including some of our largest and longest standing customers we believe using our third party management services allows our customers to increase efficiency reduce costs reduce supply chain risks and focus on their core businesses we also believe that providing third party management services to many of our key customers underscores our ability to offer a complete and integrated suite of services across the cold chain in our transportation segment we broker and manage transportation of frozen and perishable food and other products for our customers our transportation services include consolidation services i e consolidating a customer s products with those of other customers for more efficient shipment freight under management services i e arranging for and overseeing transportation of customer inventory and dedicated transportation services each designed to improve efficiency and reduce transportation and logistics costs to our customers we provide these transportation services at cost plus a service fee or in the case of our consolidation services we charge a fixed fee we also operate a limestone quarry on the land we own around our carthage missouri warehouse which contains substantial limestone deposits we do not view the operation of the quarry as an integral part of our business notes and definitions we calculate funds from operations or ffo in accordance with the standards established by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts or nareit nareit defines ffo as net income or loss determined in accordance with u s gaap excluding extraordinary items as defined under u s gaap and gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets plus specified non cash items such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures we believe that ffo is helpful to investors as a supplemental performance measure because it excludes the effect of depreciation amortization and gains or losses from sales of real estate all of which are based on historical costs which implicitly assumes that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions ffo can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and among other equity reits we calculate core funds from operations or core ffo as ffo adjusted for the effects of gain or loss on the sale of non real estate assets non offering related equity issuance expenses non recurring public company implementation costs acquisition diligence and integration related costs stock compensation ipo grants severance reduction in workforce costs and equity acceleration terminated site operations costs litigation and other related settlement costs loss on debt extinguishment and modifications foreign currency exchange gain or loss excise tax settlement and alternative minimum tax receivable from the tax cuts and jobs act benefit we believe that core ffo is helpful to investors as a supplemental performance measure because it excludes the effects of certain items which can create significant earnings volatility but which do not directly relate to our core business operations we believe core ffo can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods while also providing a more meaningful predictor of future earnings potential however because ffo and core ffo add back real estate depreciation and amortization and do not capture the level of recurring maintenance capital expenditures necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties both of which have material economic impacts on our results from operations we believe the utility of ffo and core ffo as a measure of our performance may be limited we calculate adjusted funds from operations or adjusted ffo as core ffo adjusted for the effects of amortization of loan costs debt discounts and above or below market leases straight line rent provision or benefit from deferred income taxes stock based compensation expense from grants of stock options and restricted stock units under our equity incentive plans non real estate depreciation depletion or amortization including in respect of the china jv and recurring maintenance capital expenditures we believe that adjusted ffo is helpful to investors as a meaningful supplemental comparative performance measure of our ability to make incremental capital investments in our business and to assess our ability to fund distribution requirements from our operating activities ffo core ffo and adjusted ffo are used by management investors and industry analysts as supplemental measures of operating performance of equity reits ffo core ffo and adjusted ffo should be evaluated along with u s gaap net income and net income per diluted share the most directly comparable u s gaap measures in evaluating our operating performance ffo core ffo and adjusted ffo do not represent net income or cash flows from operating activities in accordance with u s gaap and are not indicative of our results of operations or cash flows from operating activities as disclosed in our consolidated statements of operations included in our annual and quarterly reports ffo core ffo and adjusted ffo should be considered as supplements but not alternatives to our net income or cash flows from operating activities as indicators of our operating performance moreover other reits may not calculate ffo in accordance with the nareit definition or may interpret the nareit definition differently than we do accordingly our ffo may not be comparable to ffo as calculated by other reits in addition there is no industry definition of core ffo or adjusted ffo and as a result other reits may also calculate core ffo or adjusted ffo or other similarly captioned metrics in a manner different than we do the table above reconciles ffo core ffo and adjusted ffo to net income which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with u s gaap we calculate ebitda for real estate or ebitdare in accordance with the standards established by the board of governors of nareit defined as earnings before interest expense taxes depreciation depletion and amortization gains or losses on disposition of depreciated property including gains or losses on change of control impairment write downs of depreciated property and of investments in unconsolidated affiliates caused by a decrease in value of depreciated property in the affiliate and adjustment to reflect share of ebitdare of unconsolidated affiliates ebitdare is a measure commonly used in our industry and we present ebitdare to enhance investor understanding of our operating performance we believe that ebitdare provides investors and analysts with a measure of operating results unaffected by differences in capital structures capital investment cycles and useful life of related assets among otherwise comparable companies we also calculate our core ebitda as ebitdare further adjusted for impairment charges on intangible and long lived assets loss or gain on disposal of depreciated property severance reduction in workforce costs and equity acceleration terminated site operations costs non offering related equity issuance expenses non recurring public company implementation costs acquisition diligence and integration costs litigation and other related settlement costs strategic alternative costs loss on debt extinguishment modification and termination of derivative instruments stock based compensation expense foreign currency exchange gain or loss multiemployer pension obligation loss on partially owned entities and reduction in ebitdare from partially owned entities we believe that the presentation of core ebitda provides a measurement of our operations that is meaningful to investors because it excludes the effects of certain items that are otherwise included in ebitdare but which we do not believe are indicative of our core business operations ebitdare and core ebitda are not measurements of financial performance under u s gaap and our ebitdare and core ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies you should not consider our ebitdare and core ebitda as alternatives to net income or cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with u s gaap our calculations of ebitdare and core ebitda have limitations as analytical tools including these measures do not reflect our historical or future cash requirements for recurring maintenance capital expenditures or growth and expansion capital expenditures these measures do not reflect changes in or cash requirements for our working capital needs these measures do not reflect the interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our indebtedness these measures do not reflect our tax expense or the cash requirements to pay our taxes and although depreciation depletion and amortization are non cash charges the assets being depreciated depleted and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and these measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements
guest post by tom luongo it s getting tiresome watching donald trump s bipolar presidency it seems he can t let a day go by without making some massive announcement to raise tariffs threaten sanctions or overthrow a government every 24 hours is another exercise in chasing the trump reality show around every lull in the perpetual news cycle has to be seized upon to create more chaos so he can validate his insanity trump has so many plates spinning there s no way he s actually thinking anything through take the latest fiasco chinese trade talks one day talks are going well the next we re raising tariffs to 25 that s where we are today because trump thinks he s winning the trade war and china won t give him what he wants so he ll disrupt global trade until he does it doesn t matter how many times he s told tariffs don t work the costs are not paid by the exporter they are paid by the consumer tariffs don t shift manufacturing of the goods imported onshore they are supplied by other countries or substituted for lesser goods the consumer pays higher prices for end user goods the domestic members of the supply chain pay higher input prices while sclerotic domestic producers are subsidized to stay non competitive warfare is welfare the problems with threatening these tariffs are myriad but the main ones are trump is an economic ignoramus who only likes to look at one side of the trade ledger his advisors are all paranoid neoconservatives who can only see the world in terms of power because these advisors are who they are they all push trump to his worst decisions by feeding him exactly what he wants to hear it doesn t matter if it s intelligence about the potential for a venezuelan coup or the efficacy of sanctioning everyone who buys a drop of iranian oil trump likes punishing people he thinks have wronged him the national security council played a key role in driving the argument to end the waiver program especially richard goldberg a new member of the trump administration and a longtime advocate for confronting iran according to the two sources he was instrumental one of the sources said national security adviser john bolton added goldberg to the nsc in january previously goldberg was an adviser at the foundation for defense of democracies fdd think tank headed by mark dubowitz a leading advocate for tougher handling of iran since the united states first round of sanctions against the country under former president barack obama in 2012 goldberg was an aide to then senator mark kirk a republican and delivered a blow to tehran by writing legislation that closed iran s last legal loophole in selling oil under the obama sanctions that legislation targeted the belgium based swift financial messaging system over which iran was conducting billions of dollars in oil trade bolton was in charge of the failed venezuela operation and is the architect of both the iran sanctions plan as well as scuttling peace talks with north korea do you really think he s not involved in telling trump to up the pressure on china by giving them an ultimatum to deal or see tariffs raised to 25 this the same day that bolton announces moving an aircraft carrier group to the persian gulf as a message to iran never forget that all of this can be avoided by trump having one shred of courage to stop this welfare for the merchants of death dollars locked and loaded that the impetus to weaponize the u s dollar through trade and hybrid warfare comes from this corner of trump s administration is not news neither is trump s impulsiveness cravenness and inability to think systemically what is news however is that trump thinks he has the leverage here because the s p 500 is flirting with a new all time high as i said above trump is an economic ignoramus he refuses to see the opposite side of the trade ledger we export trillions in debt which fuels our trade deficit with china and receive goods in return those funds created out of thin air aren t used for domestic investment they simply goose gdp gross national spending as that money flows through the economy tariffs won t solve this trump lowered corporate tax rates to 20 a good thing certainly and is trying to cut through regulatory red tape also a good thing but it isn t enough if he doesn t cut government spending at the same time what s never admitted by mainstream economists is that gdp can fall and economic value created by the economy can rise boosting gdp with fake spending fueled by new debt at artificially low rates isn t wealth creation in fact it is ultimately capital destructive it is malinvestment that shows up everywhere as ghost cities empty malls crumbling infrastructure and cultural malaise which leads to political degradation this is why trump is a coward he doesn t have the courage to confront this he just blames everyone else for not paying their fair share he s focused the anger and frustration of americans impoverished by these policies on everyone else there is no issue that gets people more angry with me among trump supporters ripping him on tariffs it s insane how deeply this idea is embedded it s economic warfare in which the bombs go up and come straight back down a courageous president however would level with the american people and say we ve spent beyond our means we in washington with our insane policies have destroyed your communities government can t solve these problems only you can we ve cut taxes and and now we re cutting spending and i will veto any budget that doesn t do so the best way to improve the american economy is to get real and put the money back into your hands government doesn t produce wealth at best it shuffles it around you produce wealth it will be tough but i have faith in you the american people stephen miller will never write that speech that s the fight he won t have instead he does what every other crackpot politician has ever done guns and butter and then sells that as a trade war with china no one is ever to blame for their economic messes blame the other guy blame the corporations blame everyone except the people who actually did it and compound the problem by taking it out on the rest of the world trump s market problem he thinks the stock market is the weather vane of his presidency and that when it s rising he can make outrageous demands and when it s falling he has to tack against it it s why everything is so bipolar and we re being pushed every day in a different direction a quick look at the dow jones industrials on a weekly basis since trump embarked on his trade and tariff war should give you an idea of how much volatility has increased in case the picture itself is unclear the numbers are since hitting a peak in january 2017 volatility as measured by the difference in closing prices week to week and the range of each week has more than doubled for move of the second half of 2018 we saw got used to three sigma or grater movements in the dow this is the real effect of political and policy uncertainty and if trump s goal is a rising stock market someone should show him this chart 2017 is what you want don not 2018 because for all intents and purposes it hasn t gone anywhere in over a year not that i think trump is the only reason for this volatility but his pressure on dollar liquidity and his consistent scaring capital markets with shutting down trade isn t helping anything the fed is helping this along no doubt he helped break the eurodollar system last year with his overnight tariffs on aluminum and his pullout from the jcpoa the u s share market is rising precisely because he has embarked on a mad policy of weaponizing the dollar he thinks there is no possible way anyone can get out of using the dollar and therefore this won t hurt him or the u s in the long run in the short run he s right dollar liquidity is causing massive capital flight into u s assets but it isn t coming here necessarily as long term investment tariffs have consequences the problem is he forgets that he s the one subject to an election while china s leadership is not everything china has done politically under xi jinping has been to safeguard the chinese state in the event of a crisis back here we have one major party half of the president s party his own staff and the permanent bureaucracy actively plotting a coup against him oh and there s an election in eighteen months but his advisers keep telling him china is a paper tiger squeeze them and they will capitulate but it hasn t happened yet and it won t china s not going to implode over these tariffs it will give xi and his central bank the opportunity to devalue the yuan in response to the slower flow of dollars it has to protect the lion s share of its trade with southeast asia and europe whose currencies are already in trouble and it will bail out the most strategically sensitive banks and businesses over exposed to them it s what they did last year in response to the 10 tariff and it is what will happen this time so if trump doesn t want a stronger dollar he can t look to the fed to give it to him the structure of the offshore dollar markets is not under their control as always markets are bigger than central planners if global trade is the m0 of the world then restricting it at a time of maximal dollar based debt capacity is the stupidest thing you can do if your goal is a lower dollar and trade balance with china we don t need a lower dollar we need a dollar that buys more value at home and that can t happen with the fed and treasury pumping money in while choking us with the debt behind it but don t worry folks economic warfare man has a plan for that too it is my sincere desire to provide readers of this site with the best

adjusted ebitda adjusted cash from operations and free cash flow all of which are non gaap financial measures please note that earnings shall mean adjusted earnings and ebitda shall mean adjusted

our website with that i will now turn the call over to pierre pierre r brondeau chairman and chief executive officer thank you michael and good morning everyone as you saw in our earnings release fmc continued to outperform the market as we have for the past 6 quarters we are especially pleased with the strong volume growth this in addition to a price increase in all regions as well as cost control which led to strong top and bottom line results our outperformance relative to the market is driven by 3 key elements balanced geographic exposure the strength of our product portfolio and finally our diverse crop exposure advertisement advertisement turning to slide 3 fmc reported 1 2 billion in the first quarter revenue which reflects a year over year increase of 8 on a reported basis and 14 excluding fx headwinds this increase was driven by strong commercial execution that enabled growth in the region adjusted ebitda was 343 million an increase of 4 compared to recast financials from the year ago period and 13 million above the midpoint of our guidance company ebitda margins were nearly 29 despite 95 million in combined headwinds from raw material costs and foreign currencies adjusted eps was 1 72 in the quarter an increase of 9 versus recast q1 2018 and 0 09 above the midpoint of the guidance the strong eps was driven by higher volume price increases and product mix moving now to first quarter revenue analysis on slide 4 q1 revenue grew by 8 with volume contributing 9 growth and price mix another 5 growth for a total of 14 organic growth this was offset partially by a 6 headwind from fx performance in the quarter was driven by strong commercial execution and demand for product which led to above market growth the strongest growth came from latin america at 30 followed by north america at 7 emea at 3 and asia at 1 with 1 excluding foreign currency headwinds our organic growth was even stronger with latin america up over 40 emea up 11 and asia up 8 although q1 is a seasonally smaller quarter of the year in latin america the outperformance was broad based the role we rolled in infestation and increased acreage drove strong demand in brazil for cotton insecticide demand for herbicides and insecticides in sugarcane as well as robust demand for insecticides in soy bean applications were also key contributors to the growth our price increases in the region offset nearly all the impact of fx on both the top and bottom lines over the past 3 years we have implemented a disciplined channel inventory management system in brazil so that we can maintain visibility on inventory levels of fmc products throughout our distribution channels the fmc sales team conducts monthly check of all third party warehouses retailers and growers and then capture the data in our inventory tracking system these data indicates that channel inventories of fmc products are low and in line with levels typically expected during this time of the year despite very strong growth in 2018 and in q1 2019 advertisement advertisement in north america despite the weather issues in the quarter that caused a late start to the season and an expected shift in acreage away from soybeans demand for preemergent herbicides remained more of growth drivers as glyphosate resistance continues to spread we saw good customer uptake for preemergent herbicides especially authority supreme herbicide that was launched last year we saw robust sales of rynaxypyr insect control for fruit and vegetable applications including altacor insect control for tree nuts our anthem herbicide and topguard eq fungicide also had strong sales also in north america in q1 we launched our first new active ingredient from the legacy fmc r d pipeline lucento fungicide it is gaining traction already in corn soybean and peanuts applications and the successful launch suggests we can reach peak sales of 30 million to 50 million sooner than previously expected growth in emea was driven by favorable weather with very strong sales in turkey and south western europe as well as new direct market access in belgium and the netherlands our diamide products including coragen altacor and prevathon insect control had robust demand across the region and pricing actions helped offset the significant portion of the fx headwind in asia we saw double digit growth in pakistan china japan and southwest asia china growth was led by diamide products including coragen and benevia insect control in india we are seeing the benefits of a commercial restructuring last year as we are gaining sales traction as we are gaining sales traction across more of the portfolio in addition to reviewing our regional business i would like to highlight our plant health business which is globally managed with financial results embedded in all the regions it consists of biological micronutrients and seed treatment products and continues to grow over 20 per year this part of the portfolio is approaching revenues of 200 million in 2019 slide 5 shows the balance of our revenue across geographies and crops from a geographic standpoint our revenue is spread nearly equally in 4 regions which provides a natural hedge against the effect of microeconomic and weather events in the region or country these types of events impacts our industry on a regular basis our geographic diversity provides a certain amount of insulation from specific events as we have demonstrated during the recent flooding in parts of u s and the drought in australia advertisement advertisement as you can see on the right side of this slide the spread of fmc revenue in each region across the 4 quarters of the year is relatively balanced in north america and asia while the seasonality in emea and latin america are complementary this means we have a meaningful revenue contribution from 3 regions every quarter of the year which also gives us some protection from adverse events in one region or country when considering crop exposure 60 of fmc revenue is in a wide variety of higher value niche crops with the remainder of the revenue on row crops fmc does not rely too heavily on any one crop or any one region making our performance more predictable and sustainable turning now to slide 6 first quarter ebitda was 343 million up 4 versus recast reserve from q1 2018 strong demand led to year over year volume increase of 55 million of ebitda we achieved price increases in all region which contributed 53 million to year over year ebitda growth with the strongest contribution from emea and latin america volume and price together more than offset the headwinds from raw material costs and fx which totaled 95 million in the quarter looking ahead to our 2019 outlook on slide 7 given the strong performance in q1 and more clarity on the outlook for the year we are raising our guidance for 2019 revenue ebitda and eps we expect 2019 revenue for fmc will be in the range of 4 5 billion to 4 6 billion up 50 million at the midpoint versus prior guidance and reflecting 6 year over year growth at the midpoint versus 2018 recast sales excluding a forecasted 3 fx headwind our organic sales growth estimate is now 9 at the midpoint we also expect total company ebitda of 1 18 billion to 1 22 billion up 50 million at the midpoint versus prior guidance and representing 8 growth versus 2018 recast results as a reminder in 2019 our ebitda guidance for the total company and includes all expenses we are also raising our guidance for 2019 earnings per diluted share to a new range of 5 62 to 5 82 an increase of 7 at the midpoint compared to our prior guidance this represents growth of 9 at the midpoint over recast 2018 and only includes the impact of the 100 million in share repurchase completed in q1 for the second quarter we expect revenue to be in the range of 1 185 billion to 0 1215 billion which represent growth of 4 in the midpoint excluding an expected 4 fx headwind our organic sales estimate is 8 growth at the midpoint advertisement advertisement we are also forecasting ebitda of 325 million to 345 million in q2 which would be an increase of 5 year over year at the midpoint this is despite significant fx and manufacturing cost headwinds we expect second quarter eps to be in the range of 1 60 to 1 70 up 10 at the midpoint versus recast results from q2 2018 for 2019 we expect the overall crop protection market will be flat to up low single digit we expect latin america to grow in the mid to high single digit north america and asia to be flat to up low single digit and emea to be flat to down low single digit all these estimates are in u s dollar terms in latin america continued strength in cotton in brazil recovering conditions in argentina and an expected strong soybean season across the region next fall will drive the market growth in north america market growth will come from an increase in corn and wheat acreage and more normalized price pressure in emea we expect recovery of cereals acreage for the strength of the u s dollar relative to the euro is likely to reduce the market growth rate in the region by 200 to 300 basis points we expect growth in asia to be driven by more normal weather conditions across the region fx is expected to be an headwind in asia which is embedded in our outlook for the market as you can see the full year 2019 ebitda bridge on slide 8 the headwinds from fx and higher manufacturing costs are significant factors for 2019 the full year negative impact from fx is expected to be 7 at the ebitda level plus another 13 headwind from higher raw material costs representing a total of about 220 million we expect price increase will offset the 145 million of this combined headwinds or approximately 65 as was widely reported in late march there was an explosion in an industrial park in china one plant operated by one of fmc s contract manufacturing tollers is located near the explosion that plant has been shut down temporarily as the government shut the entire plant down to investigate the root cause of the blast it is important to note however that fmc s global manufacturing network provides us significant supply chain flexibility due to the strength of our partnerships and our alternate sourcing options we are confident that we can continue to secure supply of the fmc active ingredients normally manufactured at the impacted tollers location as needed we have already included the impact of this situation in our guidance turning to slide 9 the second quarter ebitda bridge reflects a 55 million cost headwind similar to q1 but lower fx headwinds of 20 million representing a total of about 75 million in headwind we expect price increase in q2 will affect 60 million or about 80 of these headwinds advertisement advertisement i will now turn the call over to andrew andrew d sandifer executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks pierre let me start this morning with a few specific income statement items foreign exchange had a negative impact on revenue of approximately 6 in the first quarter offsetting this for strong volume growth of 9 and price increases of 5 for the full year we continue to expect foreign exchange to be an approximately 3 headwind to revenue interest expense was 1 million higher for the quarter and implied by our prior full year guidance with higher commercial paper balances through the quarter due to the timing of share repurchases interest expense for the full year is now expected to be in the range of 137 million to 143 million reflecting primarily changes in the mix of foreign versus domestic borrowings as compared to our initial outlook for 2019 the higher levels of foreign borrowing will allow us to more cost effectively manage currency risks in certain countries in particular argentina adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 15 in line with the midpoint of our guidance range we are maintaining our full year tax rate guidance of 14 to 16 advertisement advertisement moving onto the balance sheet and cash flow gross debt as of march 31 was 3 1 billion up roughly 450 million from the end of 2018 reflecting the expected seasonal build in working capital and our decision to continue regularly purchasing fmc stock across the year rather than waiting for the more cash generative quarters later in the year gross debt to trailing 12 month ebitda at quarter end was just below 2 8x this is above our targeted leverage of 2 5x again due to the seasonality of our cash flow and the timing of share repurchases but we expect to rapidly return to leverage levels below 2 5x in the second half of the year turning to slide 10 adjusted cash from operations was negative in the first quarter as expected reflecting a more normal seasonal build of working capital cash from operations was also substantially below the prior year period although this comparison is misleading due to several nonrecurring impacts that benefited working capital in the prior year period including a step down in pass through balances in brazil which reduced cash used for receivables lower cash used for inventory given inventory levels in the acquired business at the time of acquisition and a significant increase in accounts payables associated with the ramp up of the acquired business post acquisition excluding these onetime items in the prior year period the impact of working capital on cash from operations was generally consistent with the prior year and our expectations capital investment and spending on legacy and transformation efforts in the quarter were at a pace consistent with our full year guidance for those uses of cash as expected free cash flow was negative for the quarter and well below the prior year period due to the fact as i just mentioned impacting cash from operations as well as 2 additional positive impacts to legacy and transformation spending in the prior year period first the prior year period results include proceeds from a required antitrust divestiture and second the prior year period results reflect certain transaction true up payments received following the closing of the acquisition of the deposits fmc continues to expect to generate adjusted cash from operations of 750 million to 850 million in 2019 with capital spending anticipated to be in the range of 140 million to 160 million for 2019 as well as legacy and transformation spending in the range of 200 million to 250 million we expect to generate free cash flow before financing of 375 million to 475 million for the full year advertisement advertisement we ve repurchased 1 88 million fmc shares year to date at an average price of 79 70 for a total of approximately 150 million including 100 million of repurchases made early in the first quarter as discussed on our last call along with 50 million of repurchases thus far in the second quarter it is our intent to remain a regular purchaser of fmc shares throughout the year purchasing a total of up to 500 million of fmc shares in 2019 inclusive of the 150 million already completed as of today in summary 2019 looks to be another year of exceptional financial performance for fmc with increasing cash generation and improved cash conversion 6 top line growth despite fx headwinds and tepid market growth 8 ebitda growth despite significant cost increases and fx impacts 9 eps growth with potential further upside from additional share repurchases and return on invested capital in the mid teens percent and with that i ll turn the call back to pierre pierre r brondeau chairman and chief executive officer thank you andrew following a very strong 2018 fmc delivered exceptional performance in q1 and we expect this to continue for the foreseeable future the growth rate and ebitda margins are at the very top of the industry and sustainable additionally we have a clear path to expand ebitda margin another 200 to 300 basis points with improving mix from new product introduction existing tsas and finishing the implementation of our new sap system starting with our q2 earnings call we will provide an annual update on r d pipeline which includes 6 synthetic molecules in the development phase 15 synthetic molecules in the discovery phase and 6 biological phase we plan to do this every year on the q2 call i will now turn the call back to the operator for questions thank you for your attention questions and answers operator operator instructions your first question comes from the line of chris parkinson from credit suisse please go ahead chris parkinson credit suisse analyst thank you you did touch on this but there has been a lot of noise on active ingredient procurement in china over the past 2 years and as you accurately flagged the recent accident that is driving the flare up again can you just give us your perspectives on how fmc can overall insulate itself from these pressures and also offer some color on kind of where we were on this team a few years ago where we are now and then how you see this developing for the future for fmc as well as the industry as a whole pierre r brondeau chairman and chief executive officer thank you chris yes it s a very valid point and the situation in china is certainly impacting many of the ag companies let me talk specifically about fmc i think 2018 was a difficult year you remember with what happened in china and i must say that our manufacturing and supply chain organization used 2018 not only to resolve the 2018 problems but to diversify further our source of intermediates and ais for the future i have to say that following 2018 we ve developed a very broad network with multiple sources for critical intermediates for for active ingredients and we ve done that in different ways so i would say what we are doing today beyond 2018 beyond 2019 is focusing on the high priority product intermediates or ais and we are already implementing solutions outside of china and how do we do that for example right now working on developing capacity in our european plants mostly in denmark to produce some of these products we are also contracting with some of our key partners in china to produce outside of china for especially in europe we re looking also to the outsourcing from europe from india through partners for our own plant so we are diversifying our network it s moving fast but of course it will still be for the next few years a strong need for china to operate for 2019 we believe today that we can face the situation of the shutdown assuming it s reopening within the time frame we are expecting which is in a very conservative forecast there is a cost to it because we have to implement last minute solutions and we have factored that 30 million cost in ebitda forecast for the year but we do believe right now we are pretty secure from a supply standpoint to our customers as long as things do not get worse so 2 pro actions one was making sure we could act in a way which give us what we need for 2019 but we ve used this 2018 situation and 2019 to broaden our supply of intermediates and ais using europe using india to produce outside of china chris parkinson credit suisse analyst great and just a quick follow up you previously laid out some framework to improve cash flow conversion at your analyst day i fully understand it s a little bit early but can you just update us on your progression as well as your conviction to hit these targets just anything to help us conceptualize the opportunity here will be greatly appreciated and that s may be just a quick point on updates on uses of cash andrew d sandifer executive vice president and chief financial officer sure chris this is andrew thanks for the question i think certainly where we stand today we continue to believe it s a strong trajectory for improving cash generation and cash conversion from fmc the biggest driver in the step up over the next 2 years will be moving past the spending for on legacy and transformation particularly the transformation efforts finishing the dupont integration the implementation of our sap s 4hana system and the related spending and as you can see in our slide today that spending is about 200 million 250 million this year of that a certain portion less than half of that 1 3 to half of that will continue as sort of ongoing legacy spend that s one of the biggest step changes we ll see in 20 versus 19 in cash conversion combined with the ongoing growth of the top line we re expecting still very substantial 7 to 9 ebitda growth over the in the mid term horizon and that will flow through cash flow pretty directly with a small headwind from working capital growth 20 to 30 of incremental sales so we can very easily see a path from guidance this year would have free cash flow before financing at about 55 ish percent of net income very easily in within the next 2 to 3 years i would expect that number to be in the upper 70s if not the 80s percent as we move past this big lump of transformation expense so that s the story on cash generation and conversion from a cash deployment perspective i think we continue to be committed to fully funding the organic growth of the company we re guiding spending between 140 million and 160 million on capital expense this year notably not particularly heavy load in aggregate that s about 3 5 of our sales and then with the other funds that are not committed to organic growth pretty sizable amount we are strongly committed to continuing to return those to shareholders through dividend which we made a significant raise last year and through share repurchases which as you see we made pretty steady progress and chipping away this year with 150 million done so far chris parkinson credit suisse analyst thank you operator your next question comes from the line of mark connelly from stephens please go ahead mark connelly stephens analyst thank you so two things investors seem to be particularly concerned about the potential for the molecules you picked up from dupont so can you give us a sense of how that group performed in the quarter and whether your expectations have changed any you mentioned diamide specifically in asia and emea can you tell us whether the growth that we re seeing in those sales is coming primarily from your fmc customers or is it coming from your continued growth that was already in place before you bought the assets mark a douglas president and chief operating officer yes mark to your first question in terms of growth of the acquired assets in the first quarter those growth rates were in the mid teens for the acquired assets pretty broad based as we said in the press release and in the slides that you see it s very difficult to actually parcel out exactly where that growth is coming from in terms of the synergy growth what we are seeing is market expansions so from a geographic standpoint we highlighted southwestern europe which is very good area for us that is coming from distribution where we ve expanded our distribution networks over the last 18 months places like china where again we re gaining traction with major distributors and retailers latin america on some of the crops we mentioned such as cotton so it s very broad based i don t think our expectations have changed at all in terms of growth rates for these products we were surprised last year at the amount of traction we got and obviously we ve continued that in q1 we expect that to continue for certainly the next few years mark connelly stephens analyst super and just a question on late planting clearly you haven t been hurt by it but do you approach the selling season any differently when planting is delayed i mean obviously aside from the potential for acreage shifts do you anticipate any different significant differences in application that would affect the way you re rolling product into the market mark a douglas president and chief operating officer not really mark i think from our perspective when things do get delayed you better have product in the right place in the distribution channel because when the planting does start i think everybody knows it goes 24 7 and demand is very high so for us it s very much a case of from a logistics and supply chain perspective working with our distribution partners and retail partners to make sure we ve got the right products in the right place obviously we talked about the pre emergent side of our business uptake has been very strong and i would say uptake has been very strong in the high end of our preemergent so products like authority supreme which are extremely high performance we ve seen good demand there getting ready for the market when it eventually gets here mark connelly stephens analyst super thank you very much operator your next question comes from the line of don carson from susquehanna please go ahead don carson susquehanna analyst yes just wanted to follow up on the u s season the preemergent so is the product actually going out to the grower and are the pounds in the ground being applied or is there a risk here that we could see a build up in channel inventories of your preemergent products mark a douglas president and chief operating officer no don i think the preemergent now is some of it is going on the ground the market is delayed so some of it s waiting in distribution channel that s normal obviously the timing of application will be critical we re getting into the period now where growth will come we re very confident in terms of how much we expect from our preemergent businesses year and certainly we have the right products in the right places today don carson susquehanna analyst and a follow up on latin america you had very strong 40 organic growth but obviously this is your lightest quarter of the year how should we think about sustainable organic growth as the year progresses and for the year as a whole mark a douglas president and chief operating officer yes we ve talked about a market in latin america that is obviously going to grow in that mid to high single digits i think brazil will be at the top end of that range q1 although a light quarter we had very good performance on the cotton throughout across the portfolio insecticides were strong obviously increased acreage all the trade issues that are working their way through today obviously brazil is a major exporter of soy we continue to expect soy acreage to increase in brazil and with that we should expect to enjoy increased sales as well don carson susquehanna analyst thank you operator your next question comes from the line of steve byrne from bank of america please go ahead steve byrne bank of america analyst yes thank you just continuing that discussion about brazil you had very strong insecticide demand in brazilian soybeans would you say that that is driven by the economic benefits that those growers are having given the trade disputes or is this a reflection of just insect populations that are effectively not controlled by intacta or maybe intacta had some waning efficacy issues mark a douglas president and chief operating officer yes steve i think it s a combination of the two i mean obviously the brazilian growers are looking to get the maximum yields they can given the high demand they see from the export markets especially to china so that s one factor that i think the whole industry is seeing i think second for us is the growth in our insecticides in the quarter were really focused on the pest spectrum that is more related to a lot of the legacy fmc products not necessarily the diamide products here although we are seeing slight leakage on leps which is very strong for the rynaxypyr portfolio so it s a bit of both actually it s a bit of the market growth but then it s pests that are particularly adept to what we have in our portfolio and that s mainly the legacy side of fmc business steve byrne bank of america analyst and just also wanted to ask you a little bit about the diamides particularly your efforts to create some new formulation that contain multiple modes of action potentially giving a little longer patent estate there can you give us an update on those efforts mark a douglas president and chief operating officer yes sure maybe i can take the opportunity to talk about that patent estate and how we see the world we talked about that at the investor day i think people have to be aware that we have a patent estate that is very deep and very broad and also covers multi years for instance we talked about rynaxypyr and some of the main patents coming off in 2022 well the reality is they don t come off until 2023 in brazil and in the european union until 2024 so you can see there is a longer period of time we have a number of activities under way within the portfolio some of it relates to formulations those activities are in high gear we are applying for registration today as we speak in many countries across the world so from a formulation capability standpoint it s for us steady as she goes we are looking at other activities as well to defend these high value franchise that we have i m not going to talk too much detail about what they are but it is very broad so we re expecting that post patent you will see continued growth in the fmc portfolio from the diamide s perspective pierre r brondeau chairman and chief executive officer i think in india something i think contrary to what has been written in some reports where dates of patent expiration were actually wrong there is the composition patents which are protecting a product but everybody does that in that field you do have an estate of patents which are protecting the manufacturing as well as the composition and the performance all of that make it very difficult for people to come and produce the product on the day there is somewhere in this world an expiration so we have the composition which protect the product then we have all the manufacturing patents which make it difficult for people to manufacture even when we get to a place where they can from a patent standpoint manufacturer they need to get the registration and they need to do the capital investment for the manufacturing which i can tell you in some cases is quite high so you can see today even on some products take an example so essentials which is by the way a very large molecule that has a market in the world of 600 million 700 million mark a douglas president and chief operating officer yes it s probably more in the 350 million to 400 million pierre r brondeau chairman and chief executive officer 400 million it s a molecule where we end up supplying a lot the people who are selling that molecule because you need to have the capacity and the technology to do it so it is not something where sales disappear on the day of the expiration of the composition patent which for us go to 2022 23 and 24 steve byrne bank of america analyst thank you operator your next question comes from the line of joel jackson from bmo capital markets please go ahead joel jackson bmo capital markets analyst hi good morning you gave some good commentary you expect the crop protection market globally to grow i think flat to up low single digit obviously your guidance mid to high single digits fx here can you walk through exactly why you re outperforming the market is it all just the diamides maybe break down a bit through the highest buckets here between the diamides and legacy products what s really letting your outperformance mark a douglas president and chief operating officer so yes i mean joe the diamides are growing obviously we believe we re taking share in certain markets and we re also expanding in terms of crops and geographies i would say on the other side of the curve our herbicide portfolio continues to grow we see that growing in latin america we see it growing in the u s and canada we also see growth in india on new applications such as sugarcane we also another area that we don t talk a lot about though is the herbicide portfolio that we acquired we re seeing good growth there in europe on cereals and also new formulations being introduced into europe so that s another area of growth and then lastly there s 2 other areas the fungicides which will continue to expand with new formulations both in the u s and in europe and then we also have our plant health business that pierre highlighted in his script where we see growth in biologicals and micronutrients so if you think of the buckets of activity that s how i would describe it joel jackson bmo capital markets analyst i want to follow up on one of the topics your biologicals so and i have is wrong but at your investor day in early december my memory was that biologicals are tough to develop efficacy tough to reproduce and maybe this wasn t to be something that fmc was going to throw a lot of money in on the r d side maybe talk about you can give an r d pipeline update in a few months and talk about some of the things in the pipeline for biologicals is there been a shift at fmc in the last 5 6 months about what you may be able to do down the road biologicals mark a douglas president and chief operating officer no actually joe may be we didn t communicate in the right way because we ve been invested heavily in biologicals since around 2013 we have very much the belief that biologicals are going to play an important part in the crop protection industry either as stand alone products or equally as important with formulations with synthetic chemistry we have 6 strains in our pipeline both fungicides biostimulants i can tell you now that the money we re putting into this has increased every year since 2013 so for us we see this is an important growth area and as we said the plant health business is growing at greater than 20 and is getting close to 200 million so it s becoming a meaningful part of the portfolio we do a lot of educating not only internally on biologicals but with our retailers distribution and growing network selling biologicals is different they behave differently they have different modes of action so all that has to be built up over time but i can tell you now we re very committed to biologicals pierre r brondeau chairman and chief executive officer it s going to be miscommunicating because since 2013 we ve made acquisitions of research laboratory we have been investing in r d we have actually built an r d center in denmark which is solely focused on biologicals including fermentation capability so it s one of the priorities we have for the company and the spending has been growing year after year since 2013 joel jackson bmo capital markets analyst thank you operator your next question comes from the line of daniel jester from citi please go ahead daniel jester citi analyst yeah hi good morning everyone i just wanted to go to your 2019 ebitda bridge it looks like you have price and mix being 145 million benefit but that s fully offset by cost so i know it s a little bit early but conceptually does that mean that you re going to continue to push price later this year and into 2020 to make up for some of these logistic challenges that you talked about and you ve been raising price for a while now but farmer economics are still maybe uneven globally so how confident are you that these price initiatives are going to be both to come to fruition pierre r brondeau chairman and chief executive officer i think pricing situation continues to be sell through we are definitely not increasing systematically across the board we do it where the molecule can afford an increase in pricing we are very thorough around it and very systematic we also use the seasons for example you increase price in latin america in the third and fourth quarter of the year well you will do that at different timing in north america so it s over a long period of time but it s not constant across the year for every region so we do believe that the pricing increase we do have for the full year right now we have quite a high level of confidence that it s sustainable and manageable and like anything price increase has to be a our customers are smart and they understand what they are buying and what they are paying for so it s going to be very well thought through and done where you believe you can do it and that s what we ve been doing so i think we have a situation which is right now quite stable and we have a good way forward in 2019 the critical question which should be asked because we don t have an answer is how sticky those pricing are when the headwinds are disappearing so that is a 2020 situation and we don t have an answer as you can guess we re going to try to hold onto those prices even in the face of less headwind as long as possible daniel jester citi analyst that was very helpful and then on the inventory situation really appreciated the additional color you talked about in brazil about how you re doing checks throughout the channel do you do similar exercise in some of your other regions and what is that telling you about the channel inventories of fmc products pierre r brondeau chairman and chief executive officer yes we not to the same extent for example in north america we do not have to do it as much because there is data which are generated by the industry especially around what we call edi which are product on the ground so when you have regular data coming at you from all of the suppliers of what goes into the market versus what goes underground you are usually able to have a pretty good view of the inventory situation north america and i d say mark may be you want to add to this but i think north america is one of the places where we are concerned not concerned may be too strong of a word but we are watching the situation around inventory level where we have much more visibility today or less concern in latin america but on a regular basis yes it is a process different methodologies we re using but we are very highly focused on inventory of products into the channel brazil and latin america being a place where we have developed our own system because that s the place where things could get out of control faster operator operator instructions next we ll go to the line of kevin mccarthy from vertical research please go ahead kevin mccarthy vertical research analyst good morning i appreciate the detail that you ve provided on geographic trends on slide 4 i was wondering if you kind of disaggregated the sales in a different way by product category insecticides herbicides fungicides where would have seen the fastest growth globally and which category would have been the slowest mark a douglas president and chief operating officer yes let me think let me quickly think about that through so insecticides are the fastest growing segment broad based not any one particular product i would say pockets in asia china india are fast growing brazil depending on the crop obviously we mentioned soy and cotton as 2 sugarcane is more balanced and then i would say in the u s as well on the niche crops tree nuts fruits that would be a good market for us and then in europe on pretty much all the niche crops down the south of europe next would be herbicides for us growing the next strongest and then followed by fungicides operator your next question comes from the line of mike harrison from seaport global securities please go ahead mike harrison seaport global securities analyst hi good morning pierre r brondeau chairman and chief executive officer good morning mike mike harrison seaport global securities analyst the 30 million in higher raw material costs that are baked into your guidance is that exclusively related to the plant explosion that you referenced or are there other factors that are worsening in china and also just wondering the timing of that 30 million impact is that going to be more of a q3 or q4 phenomenon or is it something you re seeing right now pierre r brondeau chairman and chief executive officer so first yes the 30 million is exclusively due to the plant explosion and where we had to procure some of the products with different type of contracts so answer to your first part of the question yes in terms of impact highest impact of the 30 million will be in q3 and then about even between q2 and q4 operator your next question comes from the line of mike sison from keybanc please go ahead mike sison keybanc analyst hey guys nice start to the year when i take a look at your 2019 outlook volume growth of 6 levering to 15 ebitda growth pretty impressive given how high your margins are is that kind of the right operating leverage to think about the business going forward and is there any major changes between the regions in terms of volume growth to ebitda growth pierre r brondeau chairman and chief executive officer i think the numbers you re talking about our numbers which not the kind of leverage we were expecting of course you could have have worse or better leverage depending upon the traditional exit remember that we are facing very significant adverse costs this year which are going against us and we are mitigating that with price increase but that s a kind of leverage we could expect globally looking forward especially with a to an eye on 2021 we hope to be able to leverage our systems plus exit of tsas where you could have even higher translation of sales growth into higher ebitda growth and margin so all in all we don t believe there is nothing out of the ordinary in the numbers we are producing today in take into account the adverse conditions from a profitability standpoint per region mark you want say a couple of words mark a douglas president and chief operating officer yes mike if you think back 5 7 years ago we used to talk about the disparity of our profitability across the regions i can tell you today that with the portfolio we have and the way it s balanced around the world profitability for fmc across the regions is pretty balanced so that growth rate around the world as we see it it really flows through to the bottom line so don t think of any one region of having a very high margin or comparatively lower margin they re pretty much balanced around the world operator your next question comes from the line of chris kapsch from loop capital markets please go ahead chris kapsch loop capital markets analyst good morning i had a follow up on the pricing discussion i m just wondering if the strong pricing and pricing outlook is there any way you could parse it out by how much of that is just sort of related to the fx paradigm as opposed to the cost issues that you and the industry is incurring and then also is there any instances where your procurement flexibility and agility has translated into some share gains for particular product lines whereas maybe your competitors might have been seeing a little bit more dislocation in terms of their sourcing active ingredients or intermediates pierre r brondeau chairman and chief executive officer yes let me the first question was mark a douglas president and chief operating officer pricing fx versus raw materials pierre r brondeau chairman and chief executive officer yes so fx versus raw materials there is only one place in the world where the selling methodologies is accepted from the supply side and the customer side where there is a link of fx to pricing that s brazil brazil is a place for as far as we can remember there was almost indexation of pricing to currency everywhere else in the world it is a negotiation so the way we look at it from a commercial standpoint we just consider and we re outside of brazil cost and when there is cost we are facing whether it s a raw material or an fx cost we do what we can in the places where we can afford to do it increase price to decrease our headwind in terms of cost not differentiating fx from raw material or other costs from a procurement standpoint and then the second part of your question i think what we re doing and i m not trying to compare ourselves to what our competitors are doing because internally they don t exactly know what they do but still we have uncovered in 2018 that supply disruption in china or issues are not things which cannot be dealt with there is multiple sources of products in this world which are available if you do have a very active supply chain organization and procurement organization and yes we ve been very very highly focused not only at fixing long term problem by diversifying away from china supply but also by creating throughout procurement organization and supply chain the number of partnership which are almost standby partnership ready to jump in as soon as we have issues operator and your final question today comes from the line of aleksey yefremov from nomura please go ahead aleksey yefremov nomura analyst thank you good morning in the case you re tolling partners plant in china doesn t restart in the timing you expect what are the consequences how can you describe the ongoing loe to costs and also could you potentially be limited on availability of active ingredients pierre r brondeau chairman and chief executive officer so i want to be very careful on what i say because in no case should we substitute our sales to the chinese authorities but we have no reason to believe today that the plant will not restart it is a question of when every signal we have is that the plant will restart and when we do a forecast with a 30 million headwind cost it is a very conservative forecast indication we have is that right now it is the worst case scenario but once again i want to be careful we believe the plan we have outlined for you guys from a financial standpoint is very achievable and we have no reason to believe it will not restart we have a lot of indication but that s about as far as i can go michael j wherley director of investor relations that s all the time that we have for the call today as always i m available following the call to address any additional questions you may have thank you and have a good day operator ladies and gentlemen that does conclude the fmc

financial reporting standards ifrs these financial measures include operating netback per boe funds flow from operations or funds flow provided by operations funds flow from operations per boe funds flow provided by operations netback and free funds flow management uses these non gaap measures for its own performance measurement and to provide shareholders and investors with additional measurements of the company s efficiency and its ability to fund a portion of its future capital expenditures the company considers operating netbacks per boe to be a key measure as it demonstrates parex profitability relative to current commodity prices the following is a description of each component of the company s operating netback per boe and how it is determined oil and natural gas sales per boe is determined by sales revenue excluding risk management contracts less non cash oil revenue from overlifted ocensa pipeline volumes divided by total equivalent sales volume including purchased oil volumes royalties per boe is determined by dividing royalty expense by the total equivalent sales volume and excludes purchased oil volumes production expense per boe is determined by dividing production expense by total equivalent sales volume and excludes purchased oil volumes and transportation expense per boe is determined by dividing transportation expense by the total equivalent sales volumes including purchased oil volumes funds flow provided by operations per boe is a non gaap measure that includes all cash generated from operating activities and is calculated before changes in non cash working capital divided by produced oil and natural gas sales volumes free funds flow is determined by funds flow provided by operations less capital expenditures

matters advisory the term boe means a barrel of oil equivalent on the basis of 6 mcf of natural gas to 1 bbl of oil boe s may be misleading particularly if used in isolation a boe conversation ratio of 6 mcf 1 bbl is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead given the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6 mcf 1bbl utilizing a conversion ratio at 6 mcf 1 bbl may be misleading as an indication of value this press release contains a number of oil and gas metrics including operating netbacks these oil and gas metrics have prepared by management and do not have standardized meanings

josh frydenberg managing technology and disruption in a way that enhances consumer outcomes sean davey afr there s a lot more that can be done around managing population growth between federal and state governments and local governments they re important too but certainly the amount of money we are investing in this election and this budget into infrastructure is a significant contribution to that task but reflecting the challenge melbourne s grown by 2000 people a week it s putting huge pressure on health education transport services we see all that a lot in our electorates afr is that a new thing where the sort of tiers of government are now being blurred we re seeing in this election governments funding things that are sort of local council projects or state government projects frydenberg i d say these issues matter to the local community but if state governments ignore them then the federal government can step in there s enough to be done that s going to require federal and state support afr comes through in the city deals and things like that frydenberg correct city deals are important but there s also the managing of the ageing population and we re seeing that through the health spend a big focus for us has been home care packages for example to allow people to age in home but also for example and housing affordability to try to incentivise seniors to downsize by primping out and putting extra money into super but then to free up their property into the housing market so i think in terms of housing and ageing and health care there s a bit there and then the third thing is obviously something which is very close to the coalition s heart is capitalising on the massive middle class growth in the region advertisement free trade one of the real success stories of the coalition has been the free trade agreements we ve achieved with china and japan and korea the tpp and most recently in indonesia so when we came to government about 26 per cent of our two way trading relationships were covered by ftas now it s above 70 per cent bill shorten said that the tpp was dead in the water he as you know wasn t persuaded on the china fta jason clare has raised the spectre of reopening old trade agreements and labor hasn t been enthusiastic about the indonesian one either so there s a very different approach here from us about capitalising on opportunities in the region there s no doubt our free trade agreements have been great success stories we re seeing a big increase in our exports to those particular markets we ve had the 14th consecutive monthly trade surplus and one in five australian jobs are connected to trade but it s also about asian language literacy it s also about people to people links the new colombo plan has been a real success i think more than 40 000 people have gone into the region population growth is not a bad thing it s about how you manage that growth how do you unlock the potential of your regions so if you ask me about thinking more broadly as a treasurer about the economy i m thinking about managing technology and disruption in a way that enhances consumer outcomes i m thinking of working with the states and investing more and more into infrastructure to improve the country s management of population growth you see population growth for me is not a bad thing it s about how you manage that population growth how do you unlock the potential of your regions how do you bus the commuter in your cities then thirdly it s about capitalising on the new relationships in the region so that s how i think about it advertisement also the budget is our economic plan if someone says to you oh what are you going to do after legislating tax cuts hang on legislating tax cuts are a pretty big deal and we ve got a broad legislative agenda with other things in my space including implementing the royal commission recommendations for example opt in insurance which is important and other things will be contested so i see a very busy agenda i see the budget giving us our economic plan afr just quickly on that though people are saying there s not a big agenda there s not much you re not doing much after the election is there a case that actually not a lot of government intervention and government sitting back is actually a good thing do you buy that or do you think government needs to be getting in there doing a lot frydenberg i don t think you can make a broad sweeping statement that applies to every case governments need to target their resources to where it s needed and to areas where the private sector wouldn t necessarily deliver a better outcome i think it s highly critical today about labor s plan to boost wages in the childcare sector at the expense of taxpayers because it leaves more questions than answers ten billion dollars for a 20 per cent increase for 100 000 childcare workers what about the other 93 000 what about the age care workers what about disability support what happens after eight years we know what that policy is all about boosting union membership but i think they ve really got themselves in a kerfuffle on that by saying that it was going to be the first cab off the rank and then not being able to follow that through tax reform afr now about a couple of specifics in policy areas tax you described the income tax changes as reforms you re flattening out the brackets and so forth is that pretty much it do you have other ideas for tax reform down the track something broader changing the tax mix switch frydenberg conceptually philosophically we re focused on providing a reward for effort and ensuring people earn more and keep more of what they earn so at every opportunity we look to reduce taxes you have to do that in a fiscally responsible way and we believe that we ve done that 144 billion last year 158 billion this year with a focus on low and middle income earners advertisement i think though what you ll see is a boost to household consumption which the rba has also pointed out as a result of the tax cuts and that s going to be good news for economic activity within eight weeks time you re going to have a couple teacher and a tradie on 60 000 each getting 2160 into their pocket that s gonna boost consumer spending and economic activity afr because you said at the pre budget interview we did the pro growth agenda with global headwinds is that still mostly your philosophy we use the word stimulus you use pro growth agenda frydenberg well the pro growth agenda i think is broader than just tax it s actually the infrastructure standards it s the apprenticeships and the skills training but this is how you generate greater productivity growth because multi factor productivity has grown over the last five years under us about 0 9 per cent whereas under labor i think it was 0 2 per cent over their last five years now we always want productivity to be higher we also always want wages to be higher but there s no doubt that infrastructure tax and skills are the ways forward to higher productivity which is a focus for us i mean don t forget also the instant asset write off advertisement afr you re not going to adopt the australian investment guarantee labor s policy the business community would like you to frydenberg well let me be critical of labor s investment guarantee they re saying that they re providing an incentive from 2021 22 so they attack us for having taxing measures over the later years of the forwards their s kick in in 2021 22 secondly it s been described by the grattan institute as old economy and discriminating against knowledge based service industries and thirdly let s put it in perspective they re saying what about a billion dollars a year and then on the other hand they re whacking you know retirees with a 57 billion tax afr so it s an affordability thing as much as anything frydenberg well no no i m not saying that i m just saying that i think it s not a properly thought through policy and i think it s a little bit of window dressing on their behalf to make up for a series of policies ir tax and trade which are anti business advertisement and there were more ifs than a rudyard kipling poem right i mean announcement of their small business wages it was laughable i mean it was 141 million over the forwards right and there were more ifs than a rudyard kipling poem right do you know his poem afr you guys used to have policies like that joe hockey had incentives for taking on mature workers productivity frydenberg we have the path program which is all about getting young people interns and i announced on budget night that we were doubling the incentives for employers to 8000 to take on apprentices as well as providing a 2000 incentive to apprentices so but labor s policy you know was all about just having an announceable to go with the julia kevin affair advertisement afr so part of it is you ve got to get people to take a bit more risk as well right if you want to increase productivity frydenberg but you see this is where i took issue with chris about his analogy between an income earner and a retiree who s got investment in shares who is trying to justify his retiree tax by talking about the tax paid by a nurse and i pointed out that one s taxing income and one s taxing capital and i ve heard from the labor party this sort of marxist view that we tax income too highly and capital too lowly afr on that question on the risk thing part of it is trying to get some credit growth out there right so some of the banks would frydenberg well investing in productive infrastructure interest rates advertisement afr with the banks thing you ve asked banks to send on interest rate cuts so when that comes to lending it out to businesses and so forth and to go and buy houses there s an interest rate buffer at 7 per cent way too high frydenberg when sorry when afr apra have the 7 per cent that s something that you could lean on or guide or influence them in changing isn t it frydenberg well it s not on my agenda now right because an election two weeks to go and you know apra have their rules for a reason they re prudential regulators and i think they ve done a pretty good job ensuring that we have a well regulated system but they re always looking at the suitability and applicability of their rules just as they did with investor growth in the housing market it was targeted it was time limited it boosted resilience in the system according to the rba governor but now it s been removed afr yeah is there an argument to look at it again advertisement frydenberg look it s not a question that i m focusing on over the next two weeks but what i am looking at is the global economy and as you know in the imf outlook they decreased their outlook and the us has seen there s been some more tariff restrictions but china s got a stimulus which is having an impact but it s still around the 6 per cent growth the fed hasn t moved on rates as much as some people in the markets had opined on but generally global growth which is still above 3 per cent has been slightly downgraded including in our budget us china trade war afr just on that the us china trade war seems to have flared again overnight i mean it s a fairly significant escalation i think if these tariffs increase at us750 billion and set at 25 per cent are actually executed on in the coming days and week what s your latest assessment of that situation and potential implications for australia if that happens frydenberg well we always want cool heads to prevail and we ve always argued that trade differences between countries need to be amicably resolved and preferably through world trading or the world trading system rules advertisement that being said the united states has got legitimate issues which they re entitled to raise that australia with china as our number one trading partner and the united states as our number one investor we certainly benefit from a more harmonious relationship between those two great countries afr you think to get serious globally are you confident your current policy settings over the next year or so will keep us above water if you had to do more to stimulate the economy or grow the economy what would be your preferred method monetary fiscal would you bring forward tax cuts frydenberg i didn t bring that crystal ball to the interview afr would you be prepared to take measures if the global slowdown was more serious than forecast frydenberg well we think we ve got the settings right we are very conscious of the challenges globally but at the same time the australian economy is remarkably diverse in that now more than 70 per cent of the economy is services and we ve got good trading export flows into the growing markets in the region at the same time domestically we ve been resilient we ve got a well prudentially regulated banking system we ve got strong labour market numbers advertisement let s not forget chris bowen set us a test when he came to government he said keep unemployment below 6 25 per cent well it s now 5 per cent when he was in government it was 5 7 per cent and in the largest state of nsw i think it s 4 3 per cent afr so we could ride it out if it gets pretty rough is what you re saying we ve got the right settings to ride out the challenges or to meet the challenges as they arise frydenberg well i think we ve got the right settings to ride out the challenges or to meet the challenges as they arise not just globally but also domestically because we haven t seen the full flow through of the impact of drought and flood now we saw farm gdp down 6 per cent last year and we also see that playing to manufacturing particularly around food manufacturing but the full impact of the floods in northern queensland have not played out afr have you had an estimate on the gdp advertisement frydenberg i don t but one area which we are concerned about is the housing market under labor afr well it s a bit concerning now isn t it frydenberg well afr 15 per cent house prices frydenberg there s a couple of things corelogic put down their numbers for the month of april and they said there d been a moderation in the housing price decreases so it was down 0 5 per cent for the month advertisement but in their words they said the wild card was labor s housing tax and we know that dwelling investment has increased by on average 5 5 per cent for the last five years but in the budget down 7 per cent in 2019 20 down 4 per cent in 2020 21 and the master builders association have said that there will be 32 000 fewer jobs or 42 000 fewer dwellings as a result of cgt and negative gearing afr if you win the election though there ll be no housing tax if you win the election is the housing market going to be all fine again frydenberg well we re confident that we have the macro and the micro policy settings to generate strong labour market growth and healthy economic activity which will support the housing market but what concerns us is if labor got in and brought in their housing tax not only would it affect dwelling investment but it would affect household consumption which is 60 per cent of gdp and it will go straight to household or consumer confidence if their home is worth less their ability to borrow is more difficult and so this will have a real knock on effect and as you know many small businesses borrow money against their family home in order to fund the expansion of their business now if their home is worth less their ability to borrow is more difficult or the quantum is more difficult to get and so this will have a real knock on effect so it s the worst possible time afr do you think the downturn will stop if you guys get re elected labor s tax changes don t come in do you think that will bring some more to the market advertisement frydenberg i m guided by the most recent corelogic data which said that recent falls have now moderated and that the wild card is labor s housing tax afr can i just put a scenario to you what s happening right now as house prices come down is that fewer developers will go out and start doing projects you see approvals plummet huge drop 37 per cent down on last year when that happens fewer workers get employed fewer construction workers come into the market it s a bit of a lag affect as well like six months so six months from now we re going to see fewer jobs in the construction sector if you have fewer jobs unemployment starts to rise frydenberg well as you know the budget forecast is for 5 per cent so that s good news and the most recent statement on monetary policy indicated that the labour market was healthy and strong so i m confident that the labour market will continue to grow and will continue to create jobs and we ll meet our target of 1¼ million new jobs but the other week i met with about 30 stakeholders in the property market frydenberg so people who were in everything from construction to mortgage broking to real estate agents it was at the real estate institute of victoria it was a formal roundtable last week and they were scared about labor s housing tax there was genuine and deep concern about the impact it would have on their sector and by the way it s also playing into existing sentiment and we ve seen that from some of the analysts so far sqm which is a very reputable group have said under labor s policy rents could go up by as much as 22 per cent and housing prices down by as much as 16 per cent income tax cuts advertisement afr just on the personal income tax cuts the government s been shy about promoting the fact that higher income earners who work pretty hard actually stand to get a decent tax cut why doesn t the coalition why isn t it championing this and selling this more why is it scared to highlight it actually people who do are paid more than average are actually going to get a good tax cut and we want to reward it frydenberg the numbers are all in the budget documents afr yeah but you re scared to promote it frydenberg no not at all not at all we afr say it i m not scared to promote this frydenberg what i will say is we re very proud of the tax package that we put down in the budget and of the 158 billion with the tax cuts is focused on the lower and middle income earners and for those between 45 000 and 200 000 we ll see their marginal rate fall from 32 5 per cent down to 30 per cent there s 9 million taxpayers within that tax bracket that s 70 per cent of overall taxpayers and not only will they get significant tax cuts but the progressive nature of our tax system is maintained because the top 5 per cent which equates to the top marginal rate of tax will get even a slightly larger part of the overall tax burden advertisement afr will the people above the top marginal tax rate still be paying the same proportion of tax after those reforms are in frydenberg so i think the number is 32 7 today and it goes to 32 9 someone on 200 grand pays 10 times as much tax as someone on 45 forced divestment afr can i ask you about energy if you get elected forced divestment are you going to persist with that legislation frydenberg that s our policy afr do you ever envisage the day where you d actually have to use it advertisement frydenberg that s our policy well we ve got to get it through the parliament but we re all for lower energy prices it seems the labor party are trying to obstruct policies that will get us there afr if you win the election would you consider encouraging the rba to think about reviewing its inflation target given it s really hard to hit frydenberg i was looking at this before back in 2008 inflation was up to 5 per cent and they were having this debate about whether they should change the range and now 2 4 per cent has been the average since 92 okay so it s right in the band so we ve got no plans to change the band and the band served australia well since 1992 it s a good discipline just like tax to gdp at 23 9 is our cap and we re at 23 3 today we re staying with it but let me not forget about the labor party on tax to gdp they said that it was really important to have a cap and chris bowen said it at the press club now it s going to be 25 9 young voters afr the youngest person in australia in the workforce today who would ever have worked through a recession would be 44 years of age and a survey i got today is showing that the priorities of people between the ages of 18 and 30 strong economy is number 19 on the list so my question is how do you think younger voters priorities will help you get re elected advertisement frydenberg well in terms of the housing market over 100 000 first home buyers got a loan approval over the last year which was the highest number since 2009 that was the last financial year young people are focused on a job and we ve been successful in getting more than 100 000 young people into a job over the last year which has actually been the highest number on record we ve been successful in bridging the gender pay gap we ve got policies to allow people to put more money into super to buy a home policies like the new colombo plan and giving young people opportunity to study abroad we re investing in apprenticeships and skills more generally we re increasing funding for schools the economy is at the heart afr we know that but a lot of young people don t frydenberg well the challenge for all of us is to communicate the importance of a strong economy to everyone s wellbeing afr if you lose government on may 18 will you stick your hand up for the leadership frydenberg we re going to win government on may 18 and i m focused afr win or lose is scott morrison going to stay as leader advertisement frydenberg we re going to win government on may 18 and i m focused on ensuring that happens and supporting scott to remain as prime minister of australia afr do you want to see the adani mine go ahead frydenberg well our position is if it goes through the final approvals afr state approvals frydenberg state approvals then it helps create jobs in that part of australia where there is a need for more jobs our position has always been very consistent rigorous approval process and most recent decisions were made after receiving the relevant scientific advice of the independent agencies so unlike bill shorten we won t say one thing to the miners in mackay and another to the baristas of melbourne
oil and petroleum products carolyn kissane academic director and clinical professor at the center for global affairs at new york university leads the conversation on the geopolitics of oil faskianos thank you welcome to the final session of the winter spring 2023 cfr academic webinar series i m irina faskianos vice president of the national program and outreach here at cfr today s discussion is on the record and the video and transcript will be available on our website cfr org academic if you would like to share these materials with your colleagues or classmates as always cfr takes no institutional positions on matters of policy we are delighted to have carolyn kissane with us to discuss the geopolitics of oil dr kissane is the academic director of both the graduate program in global affairs and the graduate program in global security conflict and cybercrime at nyu s center for global affairs where she is also a clinical professor she also serves as director of the energy climate justice and sustainability lab in the school of professional studies at nyu she was named in 2013 by breaking energy as one of the top ten new york women in energy and top ten energy communicator she s a member of the council on foreign relations and the national committee on u s china relations and serves on several boards so carolyn thanks very much for doing this we really appreciate it i thought we could begin by talking about how has the geopolitics of oil changed especially vis à vis russia s war in ukraine and opec s recent announcement to cut oil production kissane well first of all i d just like to say thank you so very much for having me i m really delighted i am a big fan of cfr s academic webinars so to have the opportunity to participate in this in this way is very meaningful to me so thank you so wow there is so much happening in this space the geopolitics of oil this has been a tremendous fourteen months russia s reinvasion of ukraine very much upended the geopolitics of oil because russia is a significant producer one of the top three in the world and it s you know it s caused a kind of a reshaping a kind of a remapping of the of oil geopolitics and we ve seen some you know shifts in how countries think about oil security in light of larger questions about broader energy security questions and also on top of that is the ongoing energy transition coupled with you know climate change and the need to decarbonize so there s just it s been quite a you know a year and a half that has really sort of put energy security and oil security very much at the forefront of people s minds faskianos fantastic i thought maybe you had some really interesting data to show us and if you could walk us through those the trends you are seeing and really bring it to life that would be fantastic kissane sure so before i do i have a couple of slides and before i share my slides i think it s really important that sort of we understand how interconnected sort of the global energy system is and how interconnected we are when it comes to the flows of oil you know some countries are very well resourced endowed so they have oil and other countries do not so they need to import oil there s really no country in the world that doesn t need oil for larger national security issues and i think one of things that many people sort of are not necessarily aware of or think about is the amount of oil that gets produced every day so every day the world consumes over 100 million barrels a day and every day that 100 million barrels has to be has to be moved it has to be you know as part of getting it into the system getting it to its respective destinations and what we re not seeing which maybe some people may have thought that we would see at this point is we re not seeing a reduction in demand but we re seeing an expansion in demand and much of that global demand is coming out of asia and we re also of course seeing the with the reopening of china lots of really interesting questions as to what oil demand will be in china for the 2023 2024 years whether or not they will they will sort of put extra pressure on global demand and you know irina just also you know it s i m going to share this in my slides but you know last week s decision from opec to reduce production of course had an impact on the price of oil so when the decision was announced on sunday by monday morning we saw an uptick in the price it s stabilized but we are sort of looking at 80 plus a barrel oil and again lots of uncertainty as to what that s going to mean across economies that are in recessions experiencing sort of the beginnings of a recession and sort of what does it mean for the global economy where we may see sort of more energy inflation so one of the things that i really like to do when i teach the geopolitics of oil is sort of show some visuals because i think again sort of really reinforcing the interconnected nature of our global energy system but also sort of seeing where in the world is oil produced and where in the world are the are the importers and also just a couple of sort of fun pieces on what we have seen just this you know in the last week of course some of this you ll be familiar with those in the audience but this decision on the part of opec to reduce production by 1 2 million barrels a day again happening at a time not when we have an excess supply but when we re seeing a tight supply across the oil market so it came as a bit of a surprise to you know to even the most you know longstanding analysts and opec observers and again part of this is directed probably toward self interests on the part of saudi arabia and the oil producers that are really going to make the cuts but of course it also has an impact here for those of you that are sitting in the united states what does it mean then for prices that americans pay at the gas pump so the biden administration sort of came out after this decision was made in sort of being disappointed surprised that opec would make this decision now it s also important to sort of recognize that this is not just a singular opec decision this is part of now a larger opec and opec does also include russia as well as other countries like kazakhstan and mexico so the opec that we have historically known is now different because you have other countries that are not official members but nonetheless are part of what we now refer to as opec and these are the countries that are part of opec and really the country that s considered to be sort of in the driver s seat of opec is that of saudi arabia because saudi arabia is the largest producer within the opec organization producing anywhere from 10 to 11 million barrels a day venezuela has the largest reserves but it is far from being at capacity in terms of what it can what it can produce so just to kind of put that into perspective these are opec countries and their respective reserves and then non opec the united states being a non opec country but again this sort of this chart to the right shows you know again the world is consuming a little over 100 million barrels a day expected to increase over 2023 and into 2024 question marks as to when we may see peak oil demand but again to sort of link this to energy security energy security especially when it s in the context of oil security is making sure that we have adequate supply at affordable prices so when we see a reduction in supply at a time of tight markets that suggests that we re also going to see higher prices that s going to directly hit vulnerable economies and so again just to sort of point out sort of where in the world sort of are the top three oil producers the united states saudi arabia and russia russia remains in the top three canada as well our you know neighbor to the north and china is also a producer of oil the united states figure here also includes gas liquefied so liquid petroleum which the united states is endowed with a lot of both oil and natural gas and then the top oil consuming countries you have u s china and india now the united states is not the largest importer that position is now held by china but as far as consumption goes we consume over 20 million barrels a day again big question mark about china in terms of whether or not we will see higher demand coming out of china over the next year two years with china s reopening and what is being you know discussed as revenge tourism and more chinese who have accumulated a lot of savings 2 1 trillion how are they going to use that savings and whether or not after three years of being under lockdown restrictions whether or not we ll see impacts to demand and i think russia is there s lots of questions about russia and this is now we re fourteen months into you know russia s reinvasion of ukraine and i emphasize reinvasion because oftentimes we forget that you know russia invaded ukraine in 2014 but russia is still moving its oil and up until you know a few months ago its overall production and exports were as high at some points even higher than pre invasion now you have new countries that are takers of russian oil and they re buying it at discounted prices we see turkey singapore china has been a big buyer as well as india that they have been buying discounted russian oil lots of interesting questions that we could discuss about the oil price cap and seaborne embargo to europe but i think the takeaway from this slide is that russia continues to produce oil continues to sell it selling at a discounted price but there are still many countries in the world that are eager to take russian oil and again i m not going to go into this but i just love this slide to just emphasize the you know the world s pipelines these are the pipelines that help sort of the transit of oil something also that s really unique and interesting to look at is just tanker traffic so the tankers that carry oil around the world but again you know there are a lot of pipelines so twenty three two thousand three hundred and eighty one operational oil and gas pipelines again these are it s moving a lot of the oil that is consumed every day and then finally is this is you know one of the things that we oftentimes we think about the hundred million barrels a day that the world is consuming over 75 percent of the world s oil is controlled managed by state owned oil companies so saudi aramco being one pdvsa of venezuela being another but it s really important to sort of recognize the position that state owned companies have the rest is controlled or managed by international oil companies exxonmobil chevron eni total and a host of other host of other companies but again i think the you know to understand that nocs as they re referred to are very very important for understanding their role in the larger context of the geopolitics of oil and again what we saw last week coming out of opec this decision this is also being driven by state budget concerns this is again it s about the production of oil but it s also about you know governments and their budgets and oftentimes you know there is a desire to add more rather than you know more revenues rather than less so those are the slides that i have and i hope that they sort of provide some sort of context and a little bit of you know that we can discuss in the questions that i really look forward to answering from the audience faskianos thank you carolyn that was great so now we re going to go to all of you for your questions and comments gives queuing instructions all right so i m going to go to the first raised hand in the thing amadine hom go to you first and please accept the unmute yourself pause you are still muted pause ok i don t know are you there oh i think ok let s go to morton holbrook q yes good afternoon dr kissane what a shocking presentation laughs a hundred million barrels a day and it s going up notwithstanding the paris climate agreement of 2015 is that agreement simply a dead letter or is it having any effect on oil on fossil fuel production particularly oil production or what s the best scenario in terms of reducing dependence on fossil fuels considering the oil market thank you kissane well hi morton thank you so much for that excellent question yeah that s kind of why i emphasize that number is because a lot of people sort of just aren t aware of how much oil we continue to consume and again what the demand expectations are moving forward and these demand expectations are you know coming out of forecasts from the international energy agency so i think there s a big question as to when we see peak demand and you know if you look at bp scenarios they expect peak demand to happen you know before 2030 where as you know others kind of contest that they that they think that peak demand won t happen until after 2030 i mean again a lot depends on you know what we are now experiencing in the energy transition and how sort of quickly are we can we transition away from oil i think what s really critical when we re looking at oil is oftentimes we think only about the transportation sector so we re thinking about cars we re thinking about planes you know we re thinking about trucks and tankers and all these things but it s petrochemicals you know there s just a lot of oil that also goes into fertilizer so it really is across our economy and across economies across the global system one of the things that i always tell my students is even during covid where you had many countries right much of the world was experiencing some level of lockdown we did have a reduction in oil demand but it wasn t it wasn t like 20 million barrels it was under ten so the fact that now it s 2023 the world has reopened it s really hard to sort of see or to know with certainty is when we re going to see that see that reduction in demand now i think with the paris agreement what s also important is to note is you know if you re if you re in the oil and gas space and i was just at a conference earlier this morning where this was a point of conversation was you know what are the companies doing to reduce the emissions from production so how are they integrating carbon capture sequestration you know how are they managing the emissions that come from the production of fossil energy in this case that we re talking about oil and i think one of the things that i think if you sort of follow oil markets or a country like saudi arabia they are marketing low emission oil now we could you know we could sort of challenge well what does that you know what does that really mean but you are having you know countries that are now sort of competing to state that they have lower emitting carbon in the production in the production of oil and that s a whole other interesting sort of thing to look at in the context of the geopolitics of oil is to kind of understand the variation across emissions across different countries in the production of oil so we are you know again we are going to be going into cop 28 this fall again we are not seeing you know and we haven t seen a you know reduction in fossil energy demand again lots of people are sort of you know hoping that we ll start to see it sooner rather than later but for the time being and again you know to irina s first question that you know the last fourteen months and with you know with russia s invasion of ukraine it has both shown us that you know europe is sort of seeking to hasten the energy transition by building out more renewable energy and creating more opportunities to buy electric vehicles but there s still big swaths of the world that you know are still and have yet to move towards you know really reducing and that are actually going to see higher demand moving forward as their economies grow faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from jovana vujanic who is a graduate student at lewis university how big of an of an impact will the decision of the saudi energy minister to cut oil production have on the relationship between the united states and saudi arabia kissane love the question thank you so much yeah no it s a great one so my take is that of course this decision came as a bit of a surprise and it wasn t something that the united states you know wanted but i would say that the u s saudi relationship has been very tense for the last ten years and as part of that there are lots of different reasons for that but this is yet kind of another thing that saudi has done and again i think it s also saudi has taken a non alignment policy with relation to its position on russia and ukraine so it continues to you know it continues to have a relationship with russia it also has the relationship with ukraine as we saw you know china just brokered a very significant deal between saudi arabia and iran you know again saudi arabia and iran are two are two important producers for china so china is a large importer of oil so if you go back to world war the end of world war ii that s when the united states established the oil for security relationship with saudi arabia and as we have grown sort of more i wouldn t say independent but our as our own oil production has increased especially through the shale revolution our dependence on the middle east and saudi arabia more specifically has shifted so i think we re seeing a very different saudi arabia today which i think is going to be a challenge for the united states i think it s going to be very interesting to see what the summer holds last summer the biden administration did tap into the u s strategic petroleum reserves the largest the largest take in the history of the reserves which started in 1975 you know taking 180 million barrels out you know not because there was massive supply disruptions but because you know as the administration said it was you know it was it was it was a war it was a war specific decision because the you know russia s invasion of ukraine was causing energy prices to skyrocket and to cushion the american consumer and to better cushion the sort of the global economy the united states withdrew from the spr so i think the summer is going to be very interesting but i think we re going to see definitely much more attention in the years to come between the united states and saudi arabia it s not the relationship of the past this is a kind of a very new relationship that s a great question faskianos thank you thank you let s go curran flynn who has a raised hand q hello faskianos we can hear you but we re getting feedback so you might have two devices open q can you hear me now faskianos yes q that s better ok faskianos that s better thank you thank you so much q so i m here at king fahd university in saudi arabia right next to aramco here with my class from international relations and one of my students has a question nasser al nasir ph here he is q so thank you mrs carolyn my question is how could russia s use of alternative transportation methods such as the east siberian pipeline to china impact the u s market the domestic market and the role of the spr given potential insurance workarounds from russia s side such as ensuring russian tankers through their rdif fund and thank you to mrs irina kissane thank you and dr flynn thank you so much for having your students join this webinar so i m a little so the question is about the east siberian pipeline just could you would you mind repeating it i just want to make sure i have it i m clear on the question q so how could russia s use of alternative transportation methods such as the east siberian pipeline to china impact the u s energy markets i mean domestically and the spr given potential insurance workarounds from russia s side such as ensuring russian tankers to the rdif fund kissane yeah and that s a great question you know i think that you know begs a lot of things that we could be looking at right in terms of you know russia s kind of ability or capacity to sort of work around or find workarounds to the sanctions that were imposed and i think we ve seen sort of new markets so this kind of reshaping of the energy map with oil we see that as kind of in technicolor right whereas you know a lot of russian oil would go west is now going east you know china india being takers and of course you know other countries as well you know what will be its impact on the on the u s market i think that s you know again i do think the sanctions were sort of carefully put into place so that there wouldn t be massive disruptions so we again you know russia produces over 10 million barrels a day and about 7 million of those barrels are exported so you know if we lost all of that that would be a you know that would cause some very significant economic disruption globally we already saw you know impacts to sort of grains grain exports and food security in many different parts of the world so you know russia is finding different ways you have shadow tankers that russia is using to move to move its oil as you pointed out the east siberian pipeline you know i think there s only so much the united states can do or and european countries that are part of the sanctions regime can do to curtail russian exports of oil but i think that you know i think russia again has a has a desire and also you know revenue needs they re funding a very expensive war that they re finding ways to get their to get their oil out i think an interesting question is you know what does this mean in the years ahead the lack of investment for example that s going into russian energy infrastructure a lack of sort of any kind of western investment that is that is going in and what that is going to mean but again you know i think to your question i think we will see some you know we are seeing some impacts right there s a big question as to what you know what the next six months to a year will look like with regards to the reduction from opec and if we were to see a deeper curtailment on russian oil and you know would the united states then tap more into the spr we re now at you know we re down to seven hundred thousand barrels which of course is not insignificant but we also sort of have to be you know judicious about how we use the spr but thank you for the question faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from michael let s see trevett a ph d candidate at the university of southern mississippi china and other countries claim there are petroleum reserves under the south china sea what are your estimates of the potential amount there and has china begun to extract any of this oil kissane michael thank you so much that s a great question so china already is an oil producing country so you do have oil production in china in the south china sea i can t i can t say exactly i know that there have been geological tests that have shown the reserves again you do have you know you do have territorial concerns about sort of where is this you know can china can china tap those or seek to explore and tap those reserves again if there are if there is contention over the territory in which these reserves are located so you know china again one of the things that s very interesting about china is that china is an oil producer but china has seen over the last you know the last decade they have seen that they have experienced peak demand so i mean sorry peak supply so they are not producing as much as they used to and so you re seeing a year on year reduction in the producing capacity you know if you go back maybe five or six years ago there was lots of questions about if china could kind of replicate what happened in the united states around the shale oil revolution i think one of the big challenges for china is that of the you know where the shale reserves are located it s not near water lots of questions as to and some of it basically some of the tests have shown that it s it definitely is proving harder that you know they cannot sort of model the same level of development that we have seen in the united states so yeah no i think in the south china sea again i think we it s potentially possible that we might see it i wouldn t i wouldn t i wouldn t say it s soon faskianos thank you i m taking the next question from rob warren at the anglo american university of prague this question also got an upvote how do you foresee venezuela s role in the global oil market changing moving forward and can it be reintegrated into the global economy kissane oh these are all fantastic questions thank you all so much yeah venezuela is again you know venezuela has they have the largest reserves in the world as part of this webinar right you cfr had a kind of a primer on venezuelan and kind of you know you look at sort of where venezuela is and one of the biggest challenges confronting venezuela is both its politics but it s also it basically you know you don t have you don t have international oil service providers in the country i think the only the only one now that the u s the u s has sort of given a sanctions exemption to is that of chevron but i think yeah i mean if you were to see you know kind of shifts in the political regime and you were to see more openness then i think you could imagine you know venezuela having an opportunity or a pathway forward to be more integrated into the global energy system and the global oil system you know i think one of the big problems that venezuela faces is that most of its infrastructure is really old at this point and it would need a significant amount of reinvestment to get it up to a place that it could sort of meet its potential so you know venezuela is one of these countries that s not producing as much as it could right it has the potential to be producing 2 million plus more barrels per day but you know we ve seen that they really have just they went into freefall so i think that s a big issue and another big issue which god it goes back to an earlier question is that of emissions so the oil that comes out of venezuela is a very very heavy oil so it s it has very large carbon emissions associated with the production of that oil so that i think is again as we you know think about the emissions from oil production in countries that are sort of seeking to kind of market themselves as low emission producers you know venezuela definitely will have a very hard time recouping its where its oil sector was again it has the capacity it has the reserves but getting that getting that oil out of the ground right now you have a lot of significant above ground risks faskianos thank you i m going to go next to clemente abrokwaa raised hand so please unmute yourself q can you hear me please faskianos yes we can q thank you thank you so much for your for your talk i was also very shocked about the amount of barrels that we consume every day laughs i didn t know that but anyway i m from penn state university and my question is you just mentioned about the above ground you know effects and so the movement towards like electric vehicles and so on how do you think it is going to affect the african continent kissane thank you q i am i m thinking you know the economies and then infrastructure it will be very difficult for them to laughs move with the rest of the world in terms of electric vehicles and so on i just wanted your take on that kissane thank you clemente it s an excellent question yeah i mean you have countries across the african continent that not only have oil reserves but are already producing right nigeria is a is an oil producing country also has more capacity but again you have some above ground risks you also have the need for investment of new infrastructure i think one of the things that has been very interesting and i think it s getting it s getting more attention as it deserves is how western governments are some of i think a challenge across africa is that a lot of western governments have sort of said listen we re not going to invest in fossil fuels or also financial institutions western financial institutions we re not going to invest in fossil fuels or new projects that are fossil based and that you know that s problematic when you look across the african continent where you still don t have you know 100 percent energy access you know the idea of the transition to electric vehicles which is taking a very very long time even here across the across developed economies so the need for the infusion of more capital to go into you know across the continent of africa for oil and gas that s for their economies and for their own economic growth i think is really really pivotal and i think this is something that you know is being discussed across multilateral financial institutions and also you know is it hypocrisy right for western banks that have you know kind of funded the oil and gas industry or helped to fund the oil and gas industry in the united states and many different parts of the world and that are now sort of not allowing those funds to flow to africa and they have the again they have the they have the resources so you know is it you know the equity of some of these decisions that are being made i think is one that s is one that s really important and again i you know i said earlier in this talk is that you know all most of the demand for oil is not coming from north america and from europe all of the demand that we re seeing and new demand that we re going to see is coming from asia and is going to come from africa so again you know how are we going to make sure that that demand is met again going back to that idea of energy security so there is there is accessibility so there is reliable sources of energy at affordable prices you know without sort of thinking about kind of a whole of energy approach so i think it s very it s a very complex issue and i think you know western banks who have sort of taken very sharp positions on what they will and will not fund when it comes to new oil and gas projects are getting sort of challenged as to you know what does that mean then for you know countries across africa that are still very much in need of more energy not less and again recognizing that you know evs that again are still are you know we re seeing adoption here in the united states and across europe but it s a big big big adoption in china but it s very uneven so how do we ensure greater energy security for the continent of africa i think is a really critical question faskianos thank you i ll take the next question from kyle bales who is a senior at lewis university in romeoville illinois how is the war between russia and ukraine having an effect on the progress of the european green deal maybe you can tell us what the european define the european green deal for us carolyn give us the context for that kissane yes so again this is another fantastic question yeah the european green deal it s this is this is great yeah i mean a lot of people would say that the european green deal now is that the russia s invasion of ukraine has sort of said hey this is why the green deal is so important this is why we really need to more quickly transition to renewable energy because look what look what happened when we were dependent on russia for over 30 percent of our natural gas and look when russia you know illegally invades ukraine and suddenly weaponizes gas we are left very energy insecure it affects it affects consumers it affects industry across the continent so i think we re seeing not just through the green deal but we re also seeing through sort of european green industrial policy so in some ways akin to what you know we put into effect in this past summer is the inflation reduction act and we re seeing almost kind of this industrial competition around clean energy technologies and so europe is investing you know i think it s about 250 billion the united states it s about 370 billion towards the kind of the energy transition and helping to support domestic industries and companies to you know to be able to you know develop the technologies and to have the you know the opportunity to contribute to the energy transition so i think one thing though whenever i talk about europe it s really important is to sort of recognize that you know when you look across europe you have very different policies and kind of approaches to sort of thinking about energy and how quickly some countries want to transition and can transition whereas others you know are probably going to experience a slower transition so just really interesting example as you talked about the green deal is the eu taxonomy the green taxonomy that went into effect in the january of 2022 and there you had like really a lot of contention between france and germany because france wanted to make sure that nuclear was part of the green taxonomy germany was opposed right but germany wanted to make sure natural gas was part of the green taxonomy so ultimately in the end both natural gas and nuclear and again this was this predated russia s invasion of ukraine but in the eu green taxonomy you have you know you have both nuclear and natural gas in addition to other renewable energies that can make up this taxonomy that includes specific measures towards adaptation and mitigation for climate change so you know i think you re seeing this kind of some people call it a race a competition you know ideally it s you know we re kind of working together to because we re all sort of going in the same direction to you know support the transition and to reduce to reduce carbon emissions and to bring in more sort of cleaner energy technologies into our system faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from dr laeed zaghlami q yes good afternoon this is laeed good afternoon irina good afternoon carolyn i m very pleased to be part of your program just to want to be back to africa and particularly to nigeria how practical the two projects that nigeria is advocating for pipelines one from through algeria and the other one to morocco through western african countries how practical are these pipelines to supply gas to europe and parts of some african countries faskianos and dr zaghlami you are at algiers university correct q indeed irina yes i am professor at university of algiers faculty of information and communication faskianos thank you kissane dr laeed can i can i keep you on for just one second can i ask you what is the what is the status right now is it it s planned under construction where is what is the status of those two pipelines my understanding is that it s they re proposed but q yes well actually in practically the pipeline between algeria and abuja which means through niger and so forth is already in progress whereas the other project through thirteen western african countries they are supposed to be implemented by 2047 but is it is there any political game or something of strategic inaudible how practical how logical how efficiently will be for nigeria to have two similar project s kissane yeah no it s again thank you for the question you know pipelines again that s why i wanted to show the laughs kind of the map of pipelines is because you know a lot of pipelines transverse you know multiple countries right and this is this requires not just you know a lot of cooperation but it requires technically it also can be very complex to build to build pipelines and when you re talking about something like as you as you point out these are you know crossing many countries you know i think one of the again one of the issues is whether or not since you know what already is under construction i think you can you know with confidence that one will be completed anything that s not yet under construction and again the timeline 2047 is way out there a lot of a lot of uncertainty as to what the status of those projects will be moving forward for various reasons in terms of making sure that the investments are there someone i know that studies pipelines he says you know until the steel is in the ground you don t have the pipeline and so until you know that you ve got that you know you ve got all the oks and you feel that kind of security of being able to build it and being able to provide the resources to supply it and to move it i think algeria has been a really interesting case that hasn t gotten enough attention in terms of algerian gas that has that has helped support europe over the last years we ve seen an increase in algerian gas going into europe again a lot of attention on u s lng and the increase of liquefied natural gas exports into europe but also algeria has been you know very important for helping to support european energy security and make up for some of the losses of the of the russian gas and i think we ll see more attention on algeria and algeria s role as a you know as an important source of energy especially you know gas going into going into europe moving forward faskianos so i ll take the next written question from vincent brooks who is at harvard and diamondback energy board of directors how do you view the purchasing of discounted russian oil by india in particular relative to the purchasing by china how are they using the oil purchased and are you seeing more internal usage or external profit making sales in places like africa and what are the implications of all of this kissane right great great question so all of the above laughs in some ways right there is definitely sort of profits that are being made you know i was i was talking about this last week with someone and you know if you sort of put your shoe put yourself in the shoes of india right so india is a is a rapidly growing economy 1 4 billion you know if you had if you have very high energy inflation and high oil prices that s going to have ripples effects across the indian economy and so you know when you have a kind of opportunity to buy you know pretty steep discounted oil which you know they had been able to buy from russia you know for purposes of national security they ve been buying the oil and one of the things that s very interesting about india is that actually india has been building out its refining capacity so a lot of that oil is both for domestic and some of it is being sort of re exported but i think what we ve seen is that they re using that oil to also sort of enhance their capacity and capabilities as a rapidly emerging refining power in asia and we see that in some ways in china too so china even though oil demand was down in 2022 much of the oil that they were buying from russia went into its strategic supplies which you know they now have access to and again i think you know a big question is what we re going to see moving forward around oil demand in china wood mackenzie just published a really interesting piece kind of very bullish on the expectations for oil demand in china so whether or not they re going to continue to buy you know russian oil and again sort of taking advantage of these lower prices you know and i think i think one of the things that it s kind of an inconvenient truth whereas a lot of this oil trading used to happen in europe so european trading houses were kind of the main the main points of russian oil trade a lot of that has been moved out so you know russia has found ways to kind of bypass some of the sanctions and have set up in some cases they ve set up trading houses and some of those trading houses have been sort of set up in places that you know that they can sort of again bypass the compliance to the sanctions and you have some you have some russian oil traders that are making a lot of money laughs selling discounted oil and then reselling it a really interesting case a couple of months ago was out of malaysia malaysia announced or in the you know that they were that 1 5 million barrels were produced and sold but only malaysia doesn t produce that much so those were russian barrels that were sort of being sold under sort of the malaysian under the malaysian barrel so again i think china and india have you know have taken advantage some of this has again as i said has been re exported and some of it you know has been re exported through petroleum products because china and india you know both are building and have refining capacity faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from bhakti mirchandani at columbia university what global trajectory do you see for nuclear the russia ukraine crisis has taken some of the refining capacity offline and nuclear has the potential to change the geopolitics of energy and so what steps can be taken to foster nuclear energy kissane bhakti thank you and i was just at columbia earlier today for the center for global energy policy s conference yeah nuclear is very interesting right so when we re thinking about you know decarbonizing our energy systems you know nuclear plays a very important role because it s zero emitting so in certain parts of the world china being one saudi arabia you know you have a lot of new nuclear build you know in other parts of the world you have a lot of contention about nuclear we saw that even in germany which have you know three remaining nuclear power plants and even in the midst of massive energy crisis over the last year there was still sort of pushback about no those nuclear power plants need to be shut down whereas you would think ok in light of energy insecurity let s keep them open so you know france is an interesting country france had planned to reduce its nuclear capacity by 50 percent but this past year they pivoted and they ve said no we re actually going to build out more nuclear and we re sort of we re totally scrapping that idea of reducing nuclear energy and nuclear is very important for france s electricity system sweden has also announced that they are going to build new nuclear and they re going to increase by i think almost 50 percent again part of this is their to meet their targets of net zero we also see japan japan you know the fukushima disaster really turned japanese the japanese public off of nuclear very very deep opposition to restarting the nuclear power plants but this past year even though there s still safety concerns on the part of the public the public is also very concerned about energy insecurity and higher prices so nuclear being a domestic source of energy so i think when you look at you know net zero pathways i have not seen a net zero pathway that does not include nuclear so here in the united states the net zero america project out of princeton very important place for nuclear we just have a really hard time laughs building nuclear at cost so it s very expensive usually it s significant cost overruns and of course there is the i think they have a really significant pr problem people there s still a lot of concern about the safety of nuclear so i think to your point it s very very important for decarbonizing energy systems but you re going to see i think very disjointed approaches some countries are going are embracing nuclear and other countries are sort of doubling down on their opposition and are not going to allow nuclear to be part of the energy system faskianos we have so many questions and we are just not going to get to them all so i m going to take the next question from christian bonfili who s at torcuato di tella university in argentina so do you think carolyn that the landscape resulting from the ukraine invasion by russia vis à vis securitization of gas and energy between europe and russia could accelerate energy transition toward greener energy kissane great question i think in europe it is and i think you know many analysts would agree that the iea for example you know you had the you know how does europe continue you know to enhance and achieve energy security without the dependence on russia gas and a lot of that is through renewable energy you also have a lot of new attention on hydrogen and the role that hydrogen will play i think i think europe is being cautious and so they are not saying that they are going to completely move away from gas so as earlier questions are they getting gas from algeria or are they getting gas from norway are they getting more gas from the united states in the form of liquefied natural gas and then also an uncomfortable truth is they continue to get liquefied natural gas from russia so we ve seen an increase in lng from russia going into europe that said i think all in you are seeing that you know countries across europe are saying ok you know how can we enhance our energy security how do we build more sort of domestic energy sources solar wind we re seeing you know more rapid deployment you ve got a lot of questions about supply chains and things like that but i think overall i think the answer would be that it s quickening the energy transition faskianos so i will take the moderator prerogative to just ask the final question for you to close on and just to give us your top three what are the major challenges for the geopolitics of oil as you look out over the next five to ten year horizon that you would leave us with to be looking for kissane ok you know so i think what we saw right tensions between saudi arabia and the united states we also have a you know a hot war cold war depending on you know the term you want to use between the united states and china and lots of sort of questions as to what that s going to look like i think there s you know i think there s concern that you know we re not reducing demands but we re seeing tightening supply and so that s going to have you know very significant impacts for economies especially economies that are already very fragile economically fragile politically fragile so that concerns me a lot in terms of you know what happens when you know economies don t have adequate access to energy to make sure that their industries that their that consumers you know are able that the lights can stay on and you can get you know if you re dependent on cars you re depending on trucks like all these kinds of things are really really critical so i think we have to be very cautious moving forward that we don t take more out of the system before we have adequately set up the system to be resilient and to be able to sort of meet the energy security demands that are not are not they re not decreasing i think they are increasing and becoming even more complex so i think there s a lot of concerns and a lot of uncertainty and you know this definitely is going to be an area to watch in the years ahead faskianos carolyn kissane kissane excuse me thank you very much for shaping and sharing this discussion for sharing your terrific insights with us and to all of you for your questions and comments i m really sorry that we could not get to them all

and definition of these terms as well as other non gaap financial terms to which we may refer during today s conference call are provided on our website with that i will now turn the call over to pierre pierre r brondeau chairman and chief executive officer thank you michael and good morning everyone as you saw in our earnings release fmc continued to outperform the market as we have for the past 6 quarters we are especially pleased with the strong volume growth this in addition to a price increase in all regions as well as cost control which led to strong top and bottom line results our outperformance relative to the market is driven by 3 key elements balanced geographic exposure the strength of our product portfolio and finally our diverse crop exposure turning to slide 3 fmc reported 1 2 billion in the first quarter revenue which reflects a year over year increase of 8 on a reported basis and 14 excluding fx headwinds this increase was driven by strong commercial execution that enabled growth in the region adjusted ebitda was 343 million an increase of 4 compared to recast financials from the year ago period and 13 million above the midpoint of our guidance company ebitda margins were nearly 29 despite 95 million in combined headwinds from raw material costs and foreign currencies adjusted eps was 1 72 in the quarter an increase of 9 versus recast q1 2018 and 0 09 above the midpoint of the guidance the strong eps was driven by higher volume price increases and product mix moving now to first quarter revenue analysis on slide 4 q1 revenue grew by 8 with volume contributing 9 growth and price mix another 5 growth for a total of 14 organic growth this was offset partially by a 6 headwind from fx performance in the quarter was driven by strong commercial execution and demand for product which led to above market growth the strongest growth came from latin america at 30 followed by north america at 7 emea at 3 and asia at 1 with 1 excluding foreign currency headwinds our organic growth was even stronger with latin america up over 40 emea up 11 and asia up 8 although q1 is a seasonally smaller quarter of the year in latin america the outperformance was broad based the role we rolled in infestation and increased acreage drove strong demand in brazil for cotton insecticide demand for herbicides and insecticides in sugarcane as well as robust demand for insecticides in soy bean applications were also key contributors to the growth our price increases in the region offset nearly all the impact of fx on both the top and bottom lines over the past 3 years we have implemented a disciplined channel inventory management system in brazil so that we can maintain visibility on inventory levels of fmc products throughout our distribution channels the fmc sales team conducts monthly check of all third party warehouses retailers and growers and then capture the data in our inventory tracking system these data indicates that channel inventories of fmc products are low and in line with levels typically expected during this time of the year despite very strong growth in 2018 and in q1 2019 in north america despite the weather issues in the quarter that caused a late start to the season and an expected shift in acreage away from soybeans demand for preemergent herbicides remained more of growth drivers as glyphosate resistance continues to spread we saw good customer uptake for preemergent herbicides especially authority supreme herbicide that was launched last year we saw robust sales of rynaxypyr insect control for fruit and vegetable applications including altacor insect control for tree nuts our anthem herbicide and topguard eq fungicide also had strong sales also in north america in q1 we launched our first new active ingredient from the legacy fmc r d pipeline lucento fungicide it is gaining traction already in corn soybean and peanuts applications and the successful launch suggests we can reach peak sales of 30 million to 50 million sooner than previously expected growth in emea was driven by favorable weather with very strong sales in turkey and south western europe as well as new direct market access in belgium and the netherlands our diamide products including coragen altacor and prevathon insect control had robust demand across the region and pricing actions helped offset the significant portion of the fx headwind in asia we saw double digit growth in pakistan china japan and southwest asia china growth was led by diamide products including coragen and benevia insect control in india we are seeing the benefits of a commercial restructuring last year as we are gaining sales traction as we are gaining sales traction across more of the portfolio in addition to reviewing our regional business i would like to highlight our plant health business which is globally managed with financial results embedded in all the regions it consists of biological micronutrients and seed treatment products and continues to grow over 20 per year this part of the portfolio is approaching revenues of 200 million in 2019 slide 5 shows the balance of our revenue across geographies and crops from a geographic standpoint our revenue is spread nearly equally in 4 regions which provides a natural hedge against the effect of microeconomic and weather events in the region or country these types of events impacts our industry on a regular basis our geographic diversity provides a certain amount of insulation from specific events as we have demonstrated during the recent flooding in parts of u s and the drought in australia as you can see on the right side of this slide the spread of fmc revenue in each region across the 4 quarters of the year is relatively balanced in north america and asia while the seasonality in emea and latin america are complementary this means we have a meaningful revenue contribution from 3 regions every quarter of the year which also gives us some protection from adverse events in one region or country when considering crop exposure 60 of fmc revenue is in a wide variety of higher value niche crops with the remainder of the revenue on row crops fmc does not rely too heavily on any one crop or any one region making our performance more predictable and sustainable turning now to slide 6 first quarter ebitda was 343 million up 4 versus recast reserve from q1 2018 strong demand led to year over year volume increase of 55 million of ebitda we achieved price increases in all region which contributed 53 million to year over year ebitda growth with the strongest contribution from emea and latin america volume and price together more than offset the headwinds from raw material costs and fx which totaled 95 million in the quarter looking ahead to our 2019 outlook on slide 7 given the strong performance in q1 and more clarity on the outlook for the year we are raising our guidance for 2019 revenue ebitda and eps we expect 2019 revenue for fmc will be in the range of 4 5 billion to 4 6 billion up 50 million at the midpoint versus prior guidance and reflecting 6 year over year growth at the midpoint versus 2018 recast sales excluding a forecasted 3 fx headwind our organic sales growth estimate is now 9 at the midpoint we also expect total company ebitda of 1 18 billion to 1 22 billion up 50 million at the midpoint versus prior guidance and representing 8 growth versus 2018 recast results as a reminder in 2019 our ebitda guidance for the total company and includes all expenses we are also raising our guidance for 2019 earnings per diluted share to a new range of 5 62 to 5 82 an increase of 7 at the midpoint compared to our prior guidance this represents growth of 9 at the midpoint over recast 2018 and only includes the impact of the 100 million in share repurchase completed in q1 for the second quarter we expect revenue to be in the range of 1 185 billion to 0 1215 billion which represent growth of 4 in the midpoint excluding an expected 4 fx headwind our organic sales estimate is 8 growth at the midpoint we are also forecasting ebitda of 325 million to 345 million in q2 which would be an increase of 5 year over year at the midpoint this is despite significant fx and manufacturing cost headwinds we expect second quarter eps to be in the range of 1 60 to 1 70 up 10 at the midpoint versus recast results from q2 2018 for 2019 we expect the overall crop protection market will be flat to up low single digit we expect latin america to grow in the mid to high single digit north america and asia to be flat to up low single digit and emea to be flat to down low single digit all these estimates are in u s dollar terms in latin america continued strength in cotton in brazil recovering conditions in argentina and an expected strong soybean season across the region next fall will drive the market growth in north america market growth will come from an increase in corn and wheat acreage and more normalized price pressure in emea we expect recovery of cereals acreage for the strength of the u s dollar relative to the euro is likely to reduce the market growth rate in the region by 200 to 300 basis points we expect growth in asia to be driven by more normal weather conditions across the region fx is expected to be an headwind in asia which is embedded in our outlook for the market as you can see the full year 2019 ebitda bridge on slide 8 the headwinds from fx and higher manufacturing costs are significant factors for 2019 the full year negative impact from fx is expected to be 7 at the ebitda level plus another 13 headwind from higher raw material costs representing a total of about 220 million we expect price increase will offset the 145 million of this combined headwinds or approximately 65 as was widely reported in late march there was an explosion in an industrial park in china one plant operated by one of fmc s contract manufacturing tollers is located near the explosion that plant has been shut down temporarily as the government shut the entire plant down to investigate the root cause of the blast it is important to note however that fmc s global manufacturing network provides us significant supply chain flexibility due to the strength of our partnerships and our alternate sourcing options we are confident that we can continue to secure supply of the fmc active ingredients normally manufactured at the impacted tollers location as needed we have already included the impact of this situation in our guidance turning to slide 9 the second quarter ebitda bridge reflects a 55 million cost headwind similar to q1 but lower fx headwinds of 20 million representing a total of about 75 million in headwind we expect price increase in q2 will affect 60 million or about 80 of these headwinds i will now turn the call over to andrew andrew d sandifer executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks pierre let me start this morning with a few specific income statement items foreign exchange had a negative impact on revenue of approximately 6 in the first quarter offsetting this for strong volume growth of 9 and price increases of 5 for the full year we continue to expect foreign exchange to be an approximately 3 headwind to revenue interest expense was 1 million higher for the quarter and implied by our prior full year guidance with higher commercial paper balances through the quarter due to the timing of share repurchases interest expense for the full year is now expected to be in the range of 137 million to 143 million reflecting primarily changes in the mix of foreign versus domestic borrowings as compared to our initial outlook for 2019 the higher levels of foreign borrowing will allow us to more cost effectively manage currency risks in certain countries in particular argentina adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 15 in line with the midpoint of our guidance range we are maintaining our full year tax rate guidance of 14 to 16 moving onto the balance sheet and cash flow gross debt as of march 31 was 3 1 billion up roughly 450 million from the end of 2018 reflecting the expected seasonal build in working capital and our decision to continue regularly purchasing fmc stock across the year rather than waiting for the more cash generative quarters later in the year gross debt to trailing 12 month ebitda at quarter end was just below 2 8x this is above our targeted leverage of 2 5x again due to the seasonality of our cash flow and the timing of share repurchases but we expect to rapidly return to leverage levels below 2 5x in the second half of the year turning to slide 10 adjusted cash from operations was negative in the first quarter as expected reflecting a more normal seasonal build of working capital cash from operations was also substantially below the prior year period although this comparison is misleading due to several nonrecurring impacts that benefited working capital in the prior year period including a step down in pass through balances in brazil which reduced cash used for receivables lower cash used for inventory given inventory levels in the acquired business at the time of acquisition and a significant increase in accounts payables associated with the ramp up of the acquired business post acquisition excluding these onetime items in the prior year period the impact of working capital on cash from operations was generally consistent with the prior year and our expectations capital investment and spending on legacy and transformation efforts in the quarter were at a pace consistent with our full year guidance for those uses of cash as expected free cash flow was negative for the quarter and well below the prior year period due to the fact as i just mentioned impacting cash from operations as well as 2 additional positive impacts to legacy and transformation spending in the prior year period first the prior year period results include proceeds from a required antitrust divestiture and second the prior year period results reflect certain transaction true up payments received following the closing of the acquisition of the deposits fmc continues to expect to generate adjusted cash from operations of 750 million to 850 million in 2019 with capital spending anticipated to be in the range of 140 million to 160 million for 2019 as well as legacy and transformation spending in the range of 200 million to 250 million we expect to generate free cash flow before financing of 375 million to 475 million for the full year we ve repurchased 1 88 million fmc shares year to date at an average price of 79 70 for a total of approximately 150 million including 100 million of repurchases made early in the first quarter as discussed on our last call along with 50 million of repurchases thus far in the second quarter it is our intent to remain a regular purchaser of fmc shares throughout the year purchasing a total of up to 500 million of fmc shares in 2019 inclusive of the 150 million already completed as of today in summary 2019 looks to be another year of exceptional financial performance for fmc with increasing cash generation and improved cash conversion 6 top line growth despite fx headwinds and tepid market growth 8 ebitda growth despite significant cost increases and fx impacts 9 eps growth with potential further upside from additional share repurchases and return on invested capital in the mid teens percent and with that i ll turn the call back to pierre pierre r brondeau chairman and chief executive officer thank you andrew following a very strong 2018 fmc delivered exceptional performance in q1 and we expect this to continue for the foreseeable future the growth rate and ebitda margins are at the very top of the industry and sustainable additionally we have a clear path to expand ebitda margin another 200 to 300 basis points with improving mix from new product introduction existing tsas and finishing the implementation of our new sap system starting with our q2 earnings call we will provide an annual update on r d pipeline which includes 6 synthetic molecules in the development phase 15 synthetic molecules in the discovery phase and 6 biological phase we plan to do this every year on the q2 call i will now turn the call back to the operator for questions thank you for your attention questions and answers operator operator instructions your first question comes from the line of chris parkinson from credit suisse please go ahead chris parkinson credit suisse analyst thank you you did touch on this but there has been a lot of noise on active ingredient procurement in china over the past 2 years and as you accurately flagged the recent accident that is driving the flare up again can you just give us your perspectives on how fmc can overall insulate itself from these pressures and also offer some color on kind of where we were on this team a few years ago where we are now and then how you see this developing for the future for fmc as well as the industry as a whole pierre r brondeau chairman and chief executive officer thank you chris yes it s a very valid point and the situation in china is certainly impacting many of the ag companies let me talk specifically about fmc i think 2018 was a difficult year you remember with what happened in china and i must say that our manufacturing and supply chain organization used 2018 not only to resolve the 2018 problems but to diversify further our source of intermediates and ais for the future i have to say that following 2018 we ve developed a very broad network with multiple sources for critical intermediates for for active ingredients and we ve done that in different ways so i would say what we are doing today beyond 2018 beyond 2019 is focusing on the high priority product intermediates or ais and we are already implementing solutions outside of china and how do we do that for example right now working on developing capacity in our european plants mostly in denmark to produce some of these products we are also contracting with some of our key partners in china to produce outside of china for especially in europe we re looking also to the outsourcing from europe from india through partners for our own plant so we are diversifying our network it s moving fast but of course it will still be for the next few years a strong need for china to operate for 2019 we believe today that we can face the situation of the shutdown assuming it s reopening within the time frame we are expecting which is in a very conservative forecast there is a cost to it because we have to implement last minute solutions and we have factored that 30 million cost in ebitda forecast for the year but we do believe right now we are pretty secure from a supply standpoint to our customers as long as things do not get worse so 2 pro actions one was making sure we could act in a way which give us what we need for 2019 but we ve used this 2018 situation and 2019 to broaden our supply of intermediates and ais using europe using india to produce outside of china chris parkinson credit suisse analyst great and just a quick follow up you previously laid out some framework to improve cash flow conversion at your analyst day i fully understand it s a little bit early but can you just update us on your progression as well as your conviction to hit these targets just anything to help us conceptualize the opportunity here will be greatly appreciated and that s may be just a quick point on updates on uses of cash andrew d sandifer executive vice president and chief financial officer sure chris this is andrew thanks for the question i think certainly where we stand today we continue to believe it s a strong trajectory for improving cash generation and cash conversion from fmc the biggest driver in the step up over the next 2 years will be moving past the spending for on legacy and transformation particularly the transformation efforts finishing the dupont integration the implementation of our sap s 4hana system and the related spending and as you can see in our slide today that spending is about 200 million 250 million this year of that a certain portion less than half of that 1 3 to half of that will continue as sort of ongoing legacy spend that s one of the biggest step changes we ll see in 20 versus 19 in cash conversion combined with the ongoing growth of the top line we re expecting still very substantial 7 to 9 ebitda growth over the in the mid term horizon and that will flow through cash flow pretty directly with a small headwind from working capital growth 20 to 30 of incremental sales so we can very easily see a path from guidance this year would have free cash flow before financing at about 55 ish percent of net income very easily in within the next 2 to 3 years i would expect that number to be in the upper 70s if not the 80s percent as we move past this big lump of transformation expense so that s the story on cash generation and conversion from a cash deployment perspective i think we continue to be committed to fully funding the organic growth of the company we re guiding spending between 140 million and 160 million on capital expense this year notably not particularly heavy load in aggregate that s about 3 5 of our sales and then with the other funds that are not committed to organic growth pretty sizable amount we are strongly committed to continuing to return those to shareholders through dividend which we made a significant raise last year and through share repurchases which as you see we made pretty steady progress and chipping away this year with 150 million done so far chris parkinson credit suisse analyst thank you operator your next question comes from the line of mark connelly from stephens please go ahead mark connelly stephens analyst thank you so two things investors seem to be particularly concerned about the potential for the molecules you picked up from dupont so can you give us a sense of how that group performed in the quarter and whether your expectations have changed any you mentioned diamide specifically in asia and emea can you tell us whether the growth that we re seeing in those sales is coming primarily from your fmc customers or is it coming from your continued growth that was already in place before you bought the assets mark a douglas president and chief operating officer yes mark to your first question in terms of growth of the acquired assets in the first quarter those growth rates were in the mid teens for the acquired assets pretty broad based as we said in the press release and in the slides that you see it s very difficult to actually parcel out exactly where that growth is coming from in terms of the synergy growth what we are seeing is market expansions so from a geographic standpoint we highlighted southwestern europe which is very good area for us that is coming from distribution where we ve expanded our distribution networks over the last 18 months places like china where again we re gaining traction with major distributors and retailers latin america on some of the crops we mentioned such as cotton so it s very broad based i don t think our expectations have changed at all in terms of growth rates for these products we were surprised last year at the amount of traction we got and obviously we ve continued that in q1 we expect that to continue for certainly the next few years mark connelly stephens analyst super and just a question on late planting clearly you haven t been hurt by it but do you approach the selling season any differently when planting is delayed i mean obviously aside from the potential for acreage shifts do you anticipate any different significant differences in application that would affect the way you re rolling product into the market mark a douglas president and chief operating officer not really mark i think from our perspective when things do get delayed you better have product in the right place in the distribution channel because when the planting does start i think everybody knows it goes 24 7 and demand is very high so for us it s very much a case of from a logistics and supply chain perspective working with our distribution partners and retail partners to make sure we ve got the right products in the right place obviously we talked about the pre emergent side of our business uptake has been very strong and i would say uptake has been very strong in the high end of our preemergent so products like authority supreme which are extremely high performance we ve seen good demand there getting ready for the market when it eventually gets here mark connelly stephens analyst super thank you very much operator your next question comes from the line of don carson from susquehanna please go ahead don carson susquehanna analyst yes just wanted to follow up on the u s season the preemergent so is the product actually going out to the grower and are the pounds in the ground being applied or is there a risk here that we could see a build up in channel inventories of your preemergent products mark a douglas president and chief operating officer no don i think the preemergent now is some of it is going on the ground the market is delayed so some of it s waiting in distribution channel that s normal obviously the timing of application will be critical we re getting into the period now where growth will come we re very confident in terms of how much we expect from our preemergent businesses year and certainly we have the right products in the right places today don carson susquehanna analyst and a follow up on latin america you had very strong 40 organic growth but obviously this is your lightest quarter of the year how should we think about sustainable organic growth as the year progresses and for the year as a whole mark a douglas president and chief operating officer yes we ve talked about a market in latin america that is obviously going to grow in that mid to high single digits i think brazil will be at the top end of that range q1 although a light quarter we had very good performance on the cotton throughout across the portfolio insecticides were strong obviously increased acreage all the trade issues that are working their way through today obviously brazil is a major exporter of soy we continue to expect soy acreage to increase in brazil and with that we should expect to enjoy increased sales as well don carson susquehanna analyst thank you operator your next question comes from the line of steve byrne from bank of america please go ahead steve byrne bank of america analyst yes thank you just continuing that discussion about brazil you had very strong insecticide demand in brazilian soybeans would you say that that is driven by the economic benefits that those growers are having given the trade disputes or is this a reflection of just insect populations that are effectively not controlled by intacta or maybe intacta had some waning efficacy issues mark a douglas president and chief operating officer yes steve i think it s a combination of the two i mean obviously the brazilian growers are looking to get the maximum yields they can given the high demand they see from the export markets especially to china so that s one factor that i think the whole industry is seeing i think second for us is the growth in our insecticides in the quarter were really focused on the pest spectrum that is more related to a lot of the legacy fmc products not necessarily the diamide products here although we are seeing slight leakage on leps which is very strong for the rynaxypyr portfolio so it s a bit of both actually it s a bit of the market growth but then it s pests that are particularly adept to what we have in our portfolio and that s mainly the legacy side of fmc business steve byrne bank of america analyst and just also wanted to ask you a little bit about the diamides particularly your efforts to create some new formulation that contain multiple modes of action potentially giving a little longer patent estate there can you give us an update on those efforts mark a douglas president and chief operating officer yes sure maybe i can take the opportunity to talk about that patent estate and how we see the world we talked about that at the investor day i think people have to be aware that we have a patent estate that is very deep and very broad and also covers multi years for instance we talked about rynaxypyr and some of the main patents coming off in 2022 well the reality is they don t come off until 2023 in brazil and in the european union until 2024 so you can see there is a longer period of time we have a number of activities under way within the portfolio some of it relates to formulations those activities are in high gear we are applying for registration today as we speak in many countries across the world so from a formulation capability standpoint it s for us steady as she goes we are looking at other activities as well to defend these high value franchise that we have i m not going to talk too much detail about what they are but it is very broad so we re expecting that post patent you will see continued growth in the fmc portfolio from the diamide s perspective pierre r brondeau chairman and chief executive officer i think in india something i think contrary to what has been written in some reports where dates of patent expiration were actually wrong there is the composition patents which are protecting a product but everybody does that in that field you do have an estate of patents which are protecting the manufacturing as well as the composition and the performance all of that make it very difficult for people to come and produce the product on the day there is somewhere in this world an expiration so we have the composition which protect the product then we have all the manufacturing patents which make it difficult for people to manufacture even when we get to a place where they can from a patent standpoint manufacturer they need to get the registration and they need to do the capital investment for the manufacturing which i can tell you in some cases is quite high so you can see today even on some products take an example so essentials which is by the way a very large molecule that has a market in the world of 600 million 700 million mark a douglas president and chief operating officer yes it s probably more in the 350 million to 400 million pierre r brondeau chairman and chief executive officer 400 million it s a molecule where we end up supplying a lot the people who are selling that molecule because you need to have the capacity and the technology to do it so it is not something where sales disappear on the day of the expiration of the composition patent which for us go to 2022 23 and 24 steve byrne bank of america analyst thank you operator your next question comes from the line of joel jackson from bmo capital markets please go ahead joel jackson bmo capital markets analyst hi good morning you gave some good commentary you expect the crop protection market globally to grow i think flat to up low single digit obviously your guidance mid to high single digits fx here can you walk through exactly why you re outperforming the market is it all just the diamides maybe break down a bit through the highest buckets here between the diamides and legacy products what s really letting your outperformance mark a douglas president and chief operating officer so yes i mean joe the diamides are growing obviously we believe we re taking share in certain markets and we re also expanding in terms of crops and geographies i would say on the other side of the curve our herbicide portfolio continues to grow we see that growing in latin america we see it growing in the u s and canada we also see growth in india on new applications such as sugarcane we also another area that we don t talk a lot about though is the herbicide portfolio that we acquired we re seeing good growth there in europe on cereals and also new formulations being introduced into europe so that s another area of growth and then lastly there s 2 other areas the fungicides which will continue to expand with new formulations both in the u s and in europe and then we also have our plant health business that pierre highlighted in his script where we see growth in biologicals and micronutrients so if you think of the buckets of activity that s how i would describe it joel jackson bmo capital markets analyst i want to follow up on one of the topics your biologicals so and i have is wrong but at your investor day in early december my memory was that biologicals are tough to develop efficacy tough to reproduce and maybe this wasn t to be something that fmc was going to throw a lot of money in on the r d side maybe talk about you can give an r d pipeline update in a few months and talk about some of the things in the pipeline for biologicals is there been a shift at fmc in the last 5 6 months about what you may be able to do down the road biologicals mark a douglas president and chief operating officer no actually joe may be we didn t communicate in the right way because we ve been invested heavily in biologicals since around 2013 we have very much the belief that biologicals are going to play an important part in the crop protection industry either as stand alone products or equally as important with formulations with synthetic chemistry we have 6 strains in our pipeline both fungicides biostimulants i can tell you now that the money we re putting into this has increased every year since 2013 so for us we see this is an important growth area and as we said the plant health business is growing at greater than 20 and is getting close to 200 million so it s becoming a meaningful part of the portfolio we do a lot of educating not only internally on biologicals but with our retailers distribution and growing network selling biologicals is different they behave differently they have different modes of action so all that has to be built up over time but i can tell you now we re very committed to biologicals pierre r brondeau chairman and chief executive officer it s going to be miscommunicating because since 2013 we ve made acquisitions of research laboratory we have been investing in r d we have actually built an r d center in denmark which is solely focused on biologicals including fermentation capability so it s one of the priorities we have for the company and the spending has been growing year after year since 2013 joel jackson bmo capital markets analyst thank you operator your next question comes from the line of daniel jester from citi please go ahead daniel jester citi analyst yeah hi good morning everyone i just wanted to go to your 2019 ebitda bridge it looks like you have price and mix being 145 million benefit but that s fully offset by cost so i know it s a little bit early but conceptually does that mean that you re going to continue to push price later this year and into 2020 to make up for some of these logistic challenges that you talked about and you ve been raising price for a while now but farmer economics are still maybe uneven globally so how confident are you that these price initiatives are going to be both to come to fruition pierre r brondeau chairman and chief executive officer i think pricing situation continues to be sell through we are definitely not increasing systematically across the board we do it where the molecule can afford an increase in pricing we are very thorough around it and very systematic we also use the seasons for example you increase price in latin america in the third and fourth quarter of the year well you will do that at different timing in north america so it s over a long period of time but it s not constant across the year for every region so we do believe that the pricing increase we do have for the full year right now we have quite a high level of confidence that it s sustainable and manageable and like anything price increase has to be a our customers are smart and they understand what they are buying and what they are paying for so it s going to be very well thought through and done where you believe you can do it and that s what we ve been doing so i think we have a situation which is right now quite stable and we have a good way forward in 2019 the critical question which should be asked because we don t have an answer is how sticky those pricing are when the headwinds are disappearing so that is a 2020 situation and we don t have an answer as you can guess we re going to try to hold onto those prices even in the face of less headwind as long as possible daniel jester citi analyst that was very helpful and then on the inventory situation really appreciated the additional color you talked about in brazil about how you re doing checks throughout the channel do you do similar exercise in some of your other regions and what is that telling you about the channel inventories of fmc products pierre r brondeau chairman and chief executive officer yes we not to the same extent for example in north america we do not have to do it as much because there is data which are generated by the industry especially around what we call edi which are product on the ground so when you have regular data coming at you from all of the suppliers of what goes into the market versus what goes underground you are usually able to have a pretty good view of the inventory situation north america and i d say mark may be you want to add to this but i think north america is one of the places where we are concerned not concerned may be too strong of a word but we are watching the situation around inventory level where we have much more visibility today or less concern in latin america but on a regular basis yes it is a process different methodologies we re using but we are very highly focused on inventory of products into the channel brazil and latin america being a place where we have developed our own system because that s the place where things could get out of control faster operator operator instructions next we ll go to the line of kevin mccarthy from vertical research please go ahead kevin mccarthy vertical research analyst good morning i appreciate the detail that you ve provided on geographic trends on slide 4 i was wondering if you kind of disaggregated the sales in a different way by product category insecticides herbicides fungicides where would have seen the fastest growth globally and which category would have been the slowest mark a douglas president and chief operating officer yes let me think let me quickly think about that through so insecticides are the fastest growing segment broad based not any one particular product i would say pockets in asia china india are fast growing brazil depending on the crop obviously we mentioned soy and cotton as 2 sugarcane is more balanced and then i would say in the u s as well on the niche crops tree nuts fruits that would be a good market for us and then in europe on pretty much all the niche crops down the south of europe next would be herbicides for us growing the next strongest and then followed by fungicides operator your next question comes from the line of mike harrison from seaport global securities please go ahead mike harrison seaport global securities analyst hi good morning pierre r brondeau chairman and chief executive officer good morning mike mike harrison seaport global securities analyst the 30 million in higher raw material costs that are baked into your guidance is that exclusively related to the plant explosion that you referenced or are there other factors that are worsening in china and also just wondering the timing of that 30 million impact is that going to be more of a q3 or q4 phenomenon or is it something you re seeing right now pierre r brondeau chairman and chief executive officer so first yes the 30 million is exclusively due to the plant explosion and where we had to procure some of the products with different type of contracts so answer to your first part of the question yes in terms of impact highest impact of the 30 million will be in q3 and then about even between q2 and q4 operator your next question comes from the line of mike sison from keybanc please go ahead mike sison keybanc analyst hey guys nice start to the year when i take a look at your 2019 outlook volume growth of 6 levering to 15 ebitda growth pretty impressive given how high your margins are is that kind of the right operating leverage to think about the business going forward and is there any major changes between the regions in terms of volume growth to ebitda growth pierre r brondeau chairman and chief executive officer i think the numbers you re talking about our numbers which not the kind of leverage we were expecting of course you could have have worse or better leverage depending upon the traditional exit remember that we are facing very significant adverse costs this year which are going against us and we are mitigating that with price increase but that s a kind of leverage we could expect globally looking forward especially with a to an eye on 2021 we hope to be able to leverage our systems plus exit of tsas where you could have even higher translation of sales growth into higher ebitda growth and margin so all in all we don t believe there is nothing out of the ordinary in the numbers we are producing today in take into account the adverse conditions from a profitability standpoint per region mark you want say a couple of words mark a douglas president and chief operating officer yes mike if you think back 5 7 years ago we used to talk about the disparity of our profitability across the regions i can tell you today that with the portfolio we have and the way it s balanced around the world profitability for fmc across the regions is pretty balanced so that growth rate around the world as we see it it really flows through to the bottom line so don t think of any one region of having a very high margin or comparatively lower margin they re pretty much balanced around the world operator your next question comes from the line of chris kapsch from loop capital markets please go ahead chris kapsch loop capital markets analyst good morning i had a follow up on the pricing discussion i m just wondering if the strong pricing and pricing outlook is there any way you could parse it out by how much of that is just sort of related to the fx paradigm as opposed to the cost issues that you and the industry is incurring and then also is there any instances where your procurement flexibility and agility has translated into some share gains for particular product lines whereas maybe your competitors might have been seeing a little bit more dislocation in terms of their sourcing active ingredients or intermediates pierre r brondeau chairman and chief executive officer yes let me the first question was mark a douglas president and chief operating officer pricing fx versus raw materials pierre r brondeau chairman and chief executive officer yes so fx versus raw materials there is only one place in the world where the selling methodologies is accepted from the supply side and the customer side where there is a link of fx to pricing that s brazil brazil is a place for as far as we can remember there was almost indexation of pricing to currency everywhere else in the world it is a negotiation so the way we look at it from a commercial standpoint we just consider and we re outside of brazil cost and when there is cost we are facing whether it s a raw material or an fx cost we do what we can in the places where we can afford to do it increase price to decrease our headwind in terms of cost not differentiating fx from raw material or other costs from a procurement standpoint and then the second part of your question i think what we re doing and i m not trying to compare ourselves to what our competitors are doing because internally they don t exactly know what they do but still we have uncovered in 2018 that supply disruption in china or issues are not things which cannot be dealt with there is multiple sources of products in this world which are available if you do have a very active supply chain organization and procurement organization and yes we ve been very very highly focused not only at fixing long term problem by diversifying away from china supply but also by creating throughout procurement organization and supply chain the number of partnership which are almost standby partnership ready to jump in as soon as we have issues operator and your final question today comes from the line of aleksey yefremov from nomura please go ahead aleksey yefremov nomura analyst thank you good morning in the case you re tolling partners plant in china doesn t restart in the timing you expect what are the consequences how can you describe the ongoing loe to costs and also could you potentially be limited on availability of active ingredients pierre r brondeau chairman and chief executive officer so i want to be very careful on what i say because in no case should we substitute our sales to the chinese authorities but we have no reason to believe today that the plant will not restart it is a question of when every signal we have is that the plant will restart and when we do a forecast with a 30 million headwind cost it is a very conservative forecast indication we have is that right now it is the worst case scenario but once again i want to be careful we believe the plan we have outlined for you guys from a financial standpoint is very achievable and we have no reason to believe it will not restart we have a lot of indication but that s about as far as i can go michael j wherley director of investor relations that s all the time that we have for the call today as always i m available following the call to address any additional questions you may have thank you and have a good day operator ladies and gentlemen that does conclude the fmc corporation conference

exploring sino myanmar relations maldives political crisis and other recent developments from south asia analysis myanmar signs three agreements with china sreeparna banerjee myanmar is soaring high since participating in the second belt and road forum for international cooperation held from 25 28 april 2019 at beijing china the nation formally became a bri partner country after signing a 15 point mou establishing the china myanmar economic corridor cmec in september 2018 state counsellor and foreign minister aung san suu kyi has since returned home with a chinese grant of 1 billion yuan 148 million for development project in the country the grant would be used for projects to improve people s livelihoods studies for major projects and humanitarian assistance for people displaced by civil war in northern myanmar during suu kyi s six day visit the two nations signed three agreements the agreement on economic and technical cooperation memorandum of understanding on the china myanmar economic corridor cmec cooperation plan 2019 30 and the memorandum of understanding on the formulation of the five year development programme for economic and trade cooperation which aims to enhance cooperation in investment and productivity sustainable development the mou on cmec is envisaged to promote cooperation in the following areas in line with the myanmar sustainable development plan industry transportation energy agriculture digital silk road finance tourism environmental protection people to people exchanges science and technology personnel training water resources and flood prevention and control the estimated 1 700 kilometre long corridor is supposed to connect kunming the capital of china s yunnan province to myanmar s major economic checkpoints at mandalay yangon and the kyaukphyu special economic zone sez china has proposed 30 projects under the cmec but myanmar has approved only nine so far under the cmec agreement the myanmar government agrees to build three border economic cooperation zones in shan and kachin states myitsone controversy it was extremely interesting to observe that there was no mention of the myitsone dam during suu kyi s beijing visit hence no mention of any collaboration between the two nations on the same as is known the project for long has been mired in controversy the myitsone project envisaged the construction of a dam 3 2 km south of the confluence of the mali hka and the n mai hka rivers where the river irrawaddy originates the hydro power part of the reservoir was to have an installed capacity of 6 000 mw under the initial agreement 90 percent of the electricity generated was to be sold to china and the rest was to be been available for myanmar s use free of charge the deal has been strongly criticised in myanmar as it was seen as a one sided project that was tilted overwhelmingly in china s favour with few benefits for myanmar concern also exists that china will gain control over one of myanmar s main water sources which will leave the country more vulnerable to chinese pressure besides there are concerns over social and environmental costs that the local population has to bear the mega dam is expected to flood 766 sqkm of territory in the kachin state and over 15 000 persons are likely to be displaced and deprived of their livelihoods the flooding will destroy the rich biodiversity of the area as well as disrupt agricultural lands and fisheries in both the immediate area and downstream quake prone area of additional concern the dam is located in an earthquake prone area and damage to the dam in the event of an earthquake could result in flooding of myitkyina situated 40 km downstream thus people sentiment had been thoroughly negative when the proposal was again surfaced in recent times suu kyi s nld government is also weighing its stance carefully by not wholly committing to the project so that the people remain in their favour since the general election is knocking at the door and the ethnic minority holds an important and sizable percentage of votes it is also trying to not upset its good friend neighbour and saviour china by entering the orbit of bri and also in the sidelines looking for other feasible locations to execute the hydro power projects and also holding talks to shrink investments heavy weight neighbour china has always favoured the geopolitical importance myanmar serves myitsone dam was considered important since the electricity generated was seen to be useful for the industrialization and development of yunnan however in recent years yunnan has developed a greater electrical production capacity and is even exporting its surplus but the recent push given to myanmar was seen as a strategic move to softly coerce the latter for huge compensation but it seems that china is more focussed on the larger influence it has over the kyaukphu deep sea port and cmec thus myitsone in its current stage remains a win win since whether it is constructed or relocated or other projects are created or compensations are pulled no matter which shape it may take the chinese stake continues to remain high maldives yameen s dilemma n sathiya moorthy following his twin electoral failures of the past months former president abdulla yameen seems needing his party and the socialist conservative constituency more than ever however the constituency and possibly the party parties too seem to be looking out for a new and credible leadership that can lead them to victory in the nation wide local council polls next year and beyond too the divided socialist conservative constituency that was demoralised especially after president ibrahim solih s maldivian democratic party s mdp clean sweep of the parliamentary polls last month have now cause for some hope though not celebration though yameen had lost the presidential polls his 42 percent vote share against victorious solih s 58 percent had kept their hopes alive but not after provisional results of the parliamentary polls gave the mdp 65 of the 87 seats with a whopping vote share of 75 percent according to the official results published a few days after the polls the mdp while retaining the provisionally declared 65 seats however has polled only 46 percent critics of the party are quick to claim the rest are all non mdp voters though many of them too are anti yameen it is based on such a construct that some of them are already talking about a new leadership for yameen s ppm pnc combine even before the parliamentary polls others were also speaking of the need and possibility of expanding re discovering the traditional socialist conservative base according to them the constituency suffered the first set back when incumbent president maumoon abdul gayoom lost to mdp s mohammed nasheed in the first multi party democracy polls of 2008 further deterioration set in when yameen lost to solih in the 23 september presidential polls last year the conservatives other than close aides of yameen are not ready to concede much credit to him for winning the 2013 presidential polls against nasheed who had quit office before his five year term ended in february 2012 according to them whether it was nasheed 2008 or yameen 2013 or solih 2018 their victory in the presidential polls owed to a cross ideology coalition based on more immediate issues anti incumbency vote in the eyes of the traditional conservatives all three were anti incumbency votes whether long term or short to them gayoom s 30 years of rule was their best and also of the nation s but others contest they are unwilling to consider leave alone concede the emergence of a pro democracy plank under the mdp particularly with the passing of generations youth comprises over half the nation s population voters independent analysts have argued that born into new found prosperity heralded by the gayoom regime the youth of the communication era were are inclined to looking for change as much in governmental approach as in personal life and life styles the conservatives concede the point half heartedly but counter argue to them gayoom s inability to change with the times and with the new generations was the cause of his electoral downfall and of their constituency they have no explanation why then should yameen gayoom s estranged half brother too failed the same way to the same right liberal constituency their inability to speak the language of the youth and also their overarching inability to communicate can explain their failure failings only partially unkindest cuts that all is not well for the gayoom clan comprising the two ex presidents and the former s four politician children became clearer during the september polls last year when the two lost even more miserably in the parliamentary polls yet the unkindest cut if it could be called in yameen s case came about when his chosen ppm house leader ahmed nihan hussain manik quit the post after losing his seat in the new parliament to be sworn in on 28 may nihan who incidentally was sent back from the chennai airport in india after yameen presidency s anti democracy initiatives last year did not stop there he wanted the entire party leadership to quit as well providing for the new generation to take over the reins for the future translated it meant that yameen had failed the party and or the nation s conservatives and should quit too nihan did not talk about the pending and upcoming court cases and investigations against yameen which could tie down the ppm pnc combine in unending legal knots and political embarrassment in the coming months especially ahead of next year s local council polls though yameen s arrest and legal problems were not unexpected his untimely arrest only a month ahead of the parliamentary polls did demoralise the campaign cadres denied the party the required leadership and funds until the high court released both only a week ahead of polling too late for their good the trial against yameen in the money laundering case can go all the way up to the supreme court so do can other criminal cases that the police is just now investigating apart from those that may be taken up for his anti democracy acts and decisions if the mdp administration could find a way to hold him legally and constitutionally accountable wants party more today yameen needs the party more than ever before it was equally so when he was contesting the presidential polls in 2013 the party s need for his leadership was confined to the term of his presidency he having foisted himself on the ppm ousting even party founder gayoom so much so when the maldives independent reporting nihan s decision and suggestion indicated that the ppm pnc combine might look for a younger leader yameen promptly named two vice presidents for the former one of the two vice presidents ghassan maumoon is one of the elected ppm parliamentarians now is one of half brother gayoom s four children with the gayoom clan otherwise down and out with older son faaris a one time presidential aspirant losing his parliamentary seat too this time yameen seems to be hoping to re orient gayoom s 45 percent family votes from elections 2008 and leverage to regain his lost constituency 42 percent vote share from last year s presidential polls at the very least the gayoom constituency is no more there but the conservatives still seem to dominate the electoral scene though divided as they are or that seems to be the calculation of all those who want an anti mdp grouping to emerge the maldives independent had named yameen s estranged home minister umar naseer and or impeached vice president mohamed jameel ahmed as possible candidate s though neither has reacted there may be another or other dark horse s if at all it came to that given the emerging national regional and global scenario the ppm wanting to shed the conservative image may also consider electing a woman leader as may be recalled the mdp wanting set a precedent and sent out a message chose mariya didi now defence minister as the party s chairperson when nasheed was president it is another matter even otherwise the mdp had appealed to the urban woman voters and also youth of both genders conservative constituency whatever the future holds the mdp cannot afford to overlook the conservatives argument that all that is not the party s votes is theirs only to be mopped up under an all acceptable common leader or a collective leadership whether under a single party or more citing the parliamentary poll figures the argument is that the remaining 54 percent was non mdp mostly anti yameen votes and can be clubbed together as conservative constituency still with 81 3 percent of the 264 442 votes polled yameen s ppm pnc combine polled 16 percent vote share from 46 constituencies though winning only eight seats outgoing speaker gasim ibrahim s jumhoore party jp which continues to be in the mdp led ruling coalition even while contesting against the party that too in the ppm pnc company brokered at the last minute polled 11 2 percent votes winning five seats out of 41 contested independent candidates including 21 fielded by gayoom s maldives reform movement mrm and adding up to 174 polled the second highest 21 6 percent votes among the seven victors one is from gayoom s mrm but most others including jp and ppm rebels are expected to work with president solih for the record ppm s one time coalition partner in the maldives development alliance mda won two seats with 2 9 percent vote share speculation for future these figures read better than the provisional figures put out by the the edition mihaaru media house while seat shares are exact as the final figures the provisional figures had put the mdp vote share at an all time high of 75 percent for any political party or candidate in the democracy era according to the provisional figures the ppm pnc combine got nine percent votes jp five percent and independents 8 5 percent the question still remains such calculations of the non mdp anti mdp conservatives are relevant to the ground situation if nothing else soon after the presidential polls the future if not fate of the yameen centric ppm pnc combine was known so was the mdp decision to go it alone leaving behind the three allies whose votes too had helped solih win the presidency for the party yet the anti mdp parties and the independents including gayoom s mrm could not bring themselves around to working together and more particularly to work with under yameen they however can have consolation that incumbent yameen s 42 percent in the presidential polls that he contested alone was close to mdp s 46 percent in the parliamentary elections which the party faced on its own the rest is all speculation in and for the future country reports afghanistan call for ceasefire at the end of the consultative peace jirga kabul the delegates have issued a 23 article resolution requesting

the pundits of global finance capital and their stooges in pakistan have once again come up with the idea of prostrating in front of the idols of capitalism which is sure to play havoc with the lives of millions of pakistanis our policy to appease the imf and the world bank is likely to unleash a wave of liberalization privatization and deregulation that will lead to more unemployment poor living standards and substantial cuts in public spending before one starts heaping eulogies on the two global bodies one needs to critically assess the purpose of their creation and the miracles that their policies have demonstrated in several parts of the world these institutions were created in the 1940s by the most democratic countries of the world that ended up setting up the most undemocratic ways to run these global organizations the us s voting share in in the imf is 17 16 percent and in the world bank 16 41 percent japan holds the next highest voting shares with 6 27 percent and 7 87 percent respectively washington also has the unique privilege of appointing the president of the world bank and is the only country entitled to a permanent place among the bank s executive directors so it is no surprise that these institutions were employed as a tool to serve the interests of the global hegemon punishing states that dared to challenge the rapaciousness of western capitalism for instance salvador allende the first elected socialist leader of chile infuriated the us and its western allies by asserting that his country should take care of its own natural resources and run the economy this did not go down well with the arrogant modern imperial powers that are then said to have forced the world bank to stop giving loans to the elected government in 1972 triggering an economic chaos that culminated in a military coup soon after the coup the doors were opened for military dictator general pinochet whose brutal regime not only assassinated allende but also decimated up to 130 000 chileans in a 17 year despotic rule the world bank showered 350 5 million between on chile 1973 and 1976 almost 13 times the 27 7 million it gave during the three year allende presidency integration of the developing countries economies was also one of the main purposes of these institutions to achieve this they came up with the idea of the structural adjustment programme that sought to pressure the third world countries into privatizing industries and the service sector cutting in government spending liberalizing capital markets which leads to unstable trading in currencies promoting market based pricing which tends to raise the cost of basic goods and raising interest rates the world bank instituted its saps in 1980 and the imf imposed them in 1986 according to a research paper by asad sami during 1980 93 70 developing countries were subjected to 566 stabilization and structural adjustment programmes with disastrous consequences the author claims that between 1984 and 1990 third world countries under saps transferred 178 billion to western commercial banks the enormous capital drain prompted morris miller a canadian former world bank director to remark not since the conquistadors plundered latin america has the world experienced such a flow in the direction we see today such policies led to the stagnation of growth in developing countries besides doubling their debt burden to over 1 5 trillion by the end of the 1980s doubling again to 3 trillion by the end of the 1990s the ruling elite of the western capitalist world ruthlessly exploited the developing countries especially those of latin america and africa to understand how such policies ruined the lives of millions across the world one needs to see what happened in peru mexico and other parts of the globe in 1990 an imf sponsored stabilization package produced catastrophic consequences in peru within no time fuel prices increased 31 times by 2 968 percent and that of bread 12 times by 1 150 percent the prices of most basic food staples increased by six or seven times 446 percent in a single month yet wages had already been compressed by 80 percent in the period prior to the adoption of these measures in august 1990 imf saps were first imposed on mexico in 1982 and by 1992 infant deaths due to malnutrition tripled the minimum wage fell by 60 percent and the percentage of the population living in poverty rose from less than half to more than two thirds such policies also hit africa the situation of the continent was not rosy prior to the arrival of the international monetary institutions in 1980 but even then during 1960 1980 sub saharan africa s gdp per capita grew by 36 percent between the 1980s and 2000s it actually fell by 15 percent dictation by the international monetary institutions led to the rise of rampant poverty and by 2015 413 million people were living on less than 1 90 a day despite following these anti people policies the average life expectancy for sub saharan africa is only 47 years the lowest in the world a drop of 15 years since 1980 forty percent of the population suffers from malnutrition that causes low birth weight among infants and stunts growth in children advocates of a free market economy could brag about the increasing trade that the mineral rich continent witnessed from 1989 to 1999 it is estimated that sub saharan africa s trade as a percentage of gdp a key indicator of globalization increased from 78 1 percent to 95 6 percent in dollar terms trade grew from 175 billion in 1990 to 187 billion in 1999 for the same period foreign direct investment jumped from 923 million to 7 9 billion in 1999 but contrary to the tall claims of international monetary institutions export expansion and rising foreign investment in africa neither increased growth nor reduced poverty or debt in reality most african exports are raw materials and non oil commodity prices dropped by 35 percent on average from 1997 and 2004 tax holidays and profit repatriation might have helped foreign companies to accumulate immense wealth but made very little difference to the lives of millions of africans per capita income one of the tools to measures the development of a country also fell between 1980 when saps were imposed on 36 of sub saharan africa s 47 countries and 2004 it fell for most sub saharan countries by 25 percent during the 1980s and for 18 countries these incomes were lower in 1999 than in 1975 in 1960 sub saharan africa s per capita income was about one ninth of that in high income oecd countries by 1998 it had deteriorated dramatically to about 1 18 africa s external debt has increased by more than 500 percent since 1980 to 417 billion in 2017 saps have transferred more than 229 billion in debt payments from sub saharan africa to the west since 1980 africa spends four times more on debt interest payments than on healthcare this combined with cutbacks in social expenditure caused healthcare spending in the 42 poorest african countries to fall by 50 percent during the 1980s more than 200 million africans have no access to health services as hundreds of clinics hospitals and medical facilities have been closed to be continued the writer is a freelance journalist email egalitarianism444 gmail com
stock markets have recovered much of monday s falls as a trade deal still looks possible there are some major sticking points but both sides are still keen on reaching an agreement the rba keep rates on hold and helps the aud recover it s been a wild ride for stock markets already this week as president trump s tweet threatening more tariffs on china riled the markets only for them to recover most of the losses by monday s close sentiment was further improved early tuesday morning as reuters released this short but important message beijing reuters china s commerce ministry said on tuesday vice premier liu he will visit the united states on may 9 and may 10 for bilateral trade talks at the invitation of senior u s officials the ministry did not elaborate on the talks or give the expected topics of discussion the major worry this week was that china would cancel the visit and de rail the trade deal talks in response to trump s tweet since the visit will still happen we can assume the trade deal talks will continue and a deal could come at any time there are obviously some sticking points or trump would not have tweeted what he did but both sides will be keen to reach an agreement in the coming months something us treasury secretary steven mnuchin alluded to as he said the tariffs would be reconsidered if the trade talks get back on track here s danske bank with some more markets and we initially feared that the tariff increase would derail the trade talks and china would stay away this week according to lighthizer the us team saw an erosion of commitments from china that led to the decision to increase tariffs according to mnuchin the chinese wanted to renegotiate elements that had already been finalised and the us is not prepared to do that apparently china is not willing to change its laws as part of a deal but to some extent that probably reflects that china has already implemented some of the things the us wants the new foreign investment law among other things bans technology transfer raises ipr protection and declares that chinese and foreign firms should be treated equally both sides are still fighting for the best deal they can get and it appears trump s tweet was simply part of this process advertisement rba bullish hold the australian dollar is one of the major movers on tuesday morning and has rallied strongly after the rba meeting in the early hours sentiment was overly bearish on the ozzie as the market was expecting a rate cut and when this did not come the aud squeezed higher here s westpac with some insight the reserve bank board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 1 50 this was westpac s forecast although markets were uncertain with around a 50 probability priced in for a rate cut and 14 26 market economists forecasting a cut bloomberg survey 3 may there are two main reasons behind this decision firstly the rba s response to the recent march quarter inflation report was not as negative as had been expected the second issue of importance was the board s noting in the april meeting minutes that members also discussed the scenario where inflation did not move any higher and unemployment trended up noting that a decrease in the cash rate would likely be appropriate in these circumstances this gives a clear set of conditions where a rate cut would be likely even still the market still expects a rate cut this year and westpac anticipated the rba s next move will be to cut in august this may give the aud some time to recover some of its recent falls but data is not helping the situation retail sales figures just came in and show some very weak growth real retail sales dipped 0 1 in q1 coming in well below consensus expectations of a 0 3 gain with the quarter on a par with the flat result in q4 annual growth has slowed to 1 1 yr but with a cumulative gain of just 0 2 over the last three quarters is in danger of dropping below 1 yr next quarter reported westpac

unemployment and wage growth seems to be intact indeed since the unemployment rate slipped below 4 5 a popular estimate of the natural rate of unemployment or u average hourly earnings have accelerated in other words the philips curve for wages has re steepened nicely over the course of the last few years but many remain perplexed as to why in an environment of very low unemployment rates end user inflation rates cpis pces are having a hard time hitting the fed s 2 target we think the problem with the inflation phillips curve is that we are looking for a purely domestic factor u rate to impact an increasingly global one inflation it is not a coincidence that the relationship between the gap in unemployment unemployment rate minus u and changes in inflation rates fell apart in the wake of increased global interconnectedness advertisement perhaps it is just not possible in this backdrop for the fed to get us to 2 inflation without an extreme event like an asset bubble which is why the only time in the last 25 years they did it was on the heels of the housing bubble that mortgage equity withdrawal driven demand boost to spending probably helped a bit if true the inflation target should be much lower to account for this focusing on whether the estimate of u is too low versus focusing on structural elements that have kept inflation down puts the fed at risk of running too loose monetary policy commodities copper prices fell on tuesday towards 2 1 2 month lows hit last week on worries about demand after us president donald trump said he would raise tariffs on

a comparable basis for all businesses that we owned during 2019 we have adjusted our historical revenue and ocf for the three months ended march 31 2018 to i include the pre acquisition revenue and

2019 and ii reflect the translation of our rebased amounts for the three months ended march 31 2018 at the applicable average foreign currency exchange rates that were used to translate our results for the three months ended march 31 2019 we have included cabletica in the determination of our rebased revenue and ocf for the three months ended march 31 2018 we have reflected the revenue and ocf of cabletica in our 2018 rebased amounts based on what we believe to be the most reliable information that is currently available to us generally pre acquisition financial statements as adjusted for the estimated effects of a any significant differences between u s gaap and local generally accepted accounting principles b any significant effects of acquisition accounting adjustments c any significant differences between our accounting policies and those of the acquired entities and d other items we deem appropriate we do not adjust pre acquisition periods to eliminate nonrecurring items or to give retroactive effect to any changes in estimates that might be implemented during post acquisition periods as we did not own or operate the acquired businesses during the pre acquisition periods no assurance can be given that we have identified all adjustments necessary to present their revenue and ocf on a basis that is comparable to the corresponding post acquisition amounts that are included in our historical results or that the pre acquisition financial statements we have relied upon do not contain undetected errors the adjustments reflected in our rebased amounts have not been prepared with a view towards complying with article 11 of regulation s x in addition the rebased growth percentages are not necessarily indicative of the revenue and ocf that would have occurred if these transactions had occurred on the dates assumed for purposes of calculating our rebased amounts or the revenue and ocf that will occur in the future the rebased growth percentages have been presented as a basis for assessing growth rates on a comparable basis and are not presented as a measure of our pro forma financial performance the following table provides

referenced in our form 10 q ocf is the primary measure used by our chief operating decision maker to evaluate segment operating performance ocf is also a key factor that is used by our internal decision makers to i determine how to allocate resources to segments and ii evaluate the effectiveness of our management for purposes of incentive compensation plans as we use the term ocf is defined as operating income or loss before depreciation and amortization share based compensation provisions and provision releases related to significant litigation and impairment restructuring and other operating items other operating items include i gains and losses on the disposition of long lived assets ii third party costs directly associated with successful and unsuccessful acquisitions and dispositions including legal advisory and due diligence fees as applicable and iii other acquisition related items such as gains and losses on the settlement of contingent consideration our internal decision makers believe ocf is a meaningful measure because it represents a transparent view of our recurring operating performance that is unaffected by our capital structure and allows management to i readily view operating trends ii perform analytical comparisons and benchmarking between segments and iii identify strategies to improve operating performance in the different countries in which we operate we believe our ocf measure is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our performance with the performance of other companies in the same or similar industries although our measure may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other public companies ocf should be viewed as a measure of operating performance that is a supplement to and not a substitute for operating income net earnings or loss cash flow from operating activities and other u s gaap measures of income or cash flows a reconciliation of our operating income to total ocf is

cash flow definition and reconciliation we define adjusted fcf as net cash provided by our operating activities plus i cash payments for third party costs directly associated with successful and unsuccessful acquisitions and dispositions ii expenses financed by an intermediary and iii insurance recoveries related to damaged and destroyed property and equipment less a capital expenditures b distributions to noncontrolling interest owners c principal payments on amounts financed by vendors and intermediaries and d principal payments on finance leases effective december 31 2018 and in connection with our hurricane insurance settlements we changed the way we define adjusted free cash flow to include proceeds from insurance recoveries related to damaged and destroyed property and equipment we believe this change is appropriate as such cash proceeds effectively partially offset payments for capital expenditures to replace the property and equipment that was damaged or destroyed as a result of the hurricanes we believe that our presentation of adjusted fcf provides useful information to our investors because this measure can be used to gauge our ability to service debt and fund new investment opportunities adjusted fcf should not be understood to represent our ability to fund discretionary amounts as we have various mandatory and contractual obligations including debt repayments which are not deducted to arrive at this amount investors should view adjusted fcf as a supplement to and not a substitute for u s gaap measures of liquidity included in our consolidated statements of cash flows the following table provides the reconciliation of our net cash provided by operating activities to adjusted fcf for the indicated periods three months ended march 31 2019

walker martin chairman ceo advertisement advertisement thanks a lot faisel i d like to thank everyone who attended our investor day here in san diego we appreciated having the opportunity to provide a comprehensive update on our strategy and capital plans and enjoy taking many of you to visit our lng facility in baja california as well as sdg e where we highlighted our wildfire mitigation program and showcased tour ph of the california utility assets we hope you came away from our conference with the following first we have a sharper strategic focus second we ve improved our capital discipline and third we are investing in a high performance culture since our investor day we held our internal top 300 leadership meeting leaders across our company came together here in san diego to discuss steps we re taking to better align our 20 000 employees to directly support our strategic mission of becoming north america s premier energy infrastructure company there was a great sense of energy among the team as we set our course for the next year and beyond from an execution standpoint we continue to make progress on our goals just last month we completed the sale of our wind assets which brings the total cash proceeds from our renewables to midstream divestitures to approximately 2 5 billion well above market expectations next our focus is on successfully completing the planned sale of our south american businesses which we re targeting to close around the end of this year proceeds from our asset sales will be used to advance our strategic mission by funding growth while also strengthening our balance sheet by paying down parent debt now looking forward sempra is well positioned our businesses at the intersection of two key trends that are transforming the energy markets the transition toward cleaner energy which is happening market by market and the u s is growing dominance in the global energy markets we expect our assets to play a key role in further in both of these trends which in turn should create jobs both in the united states and mexico bolster the economies of both countries and drive future value creation for our shareholders advertisement advertisement before handing it off the call to joe i d also like to highlight that we are affirming our 2019 adjusted eps guidance range as well as our 2020 eps guidance range please turn to the next slide where joe will discuss how we are executing on our operational goals joseph allan householder president coo thanks jeff before touching on some of the legislative discussions happening in california on wildfire risk i would like to mention that last week the cpuc issued a favorable proposed decision on sdg e s wildfire mitigation plan enabling us to continue to improve our industry leading program advertisement advertisement now on the legislative front we re pleased with governor newsom and the strike force s leadership and their proposals the most important aspects are mitigating the threat of wildfires through measures such as increase vegetation management advancing emergency response to minimize damage if an event occurs and defining proposals that can help ensure healthy utilities to achieve california s greenhouse gas reduction goals we believe the strike force s recent recommendations of liquidity fund a wildfire fund and changes to inverse condemnation help narrow the focus of the blue ribbon commission we are actively engaged to help ensure that our customers and our shareholders interests are addressed and that our existing wildfire mitigation efforts are recognized we re optimistic that effective legislative solutions could be introduced and approved this summer although positive headway is being made the current regulatory environment and threat of wildfires in this state are factors we must take into account in our regulatory filings including the cost of capital proceeding please turn to slide 6 this cpuc cost of capital proceeding is very important to our two utilities because our currently authorized return on equity numbers were last updated in july of 2017 and where were the result of a two year extension from our last cost of capital proceeding approved in 2013 a lot has happened since 2017 and even more so since 2013 advertisement advertisement over this time period in california customer needs state mandates energy goals the environment the regulatory construct have all can change considerably they ve had a corresponding and material impact on the risk profile of california industrial and utilities our cost of capital applications reflect this shift in risk and the higher roes are designed to help ensure access to the capital markets specifically our request for focused on returns that are commensurate with the increased risk of operating in california investment grade credit ratings to preserve reasonable rates for customers and maintain access to capital to continue investing in safety and reliability and financial stability with this in mind we requested first an increase to our authorized roes at sdg e we requested a base roe of 10 9 plus a 3 4 adder for a total of 14 3 an increase from our currently authorized roe of 10 2 we arrived at the wildfire adder by estimating risk associated with potential unrecoverable wildfire liability premiums required by insurers and premiums required by investors in our catastrophe bonds at socalgas we requested an roe of 10 7 compared to its currently authorized roe of 10 05 and second an increase in our authorized capital structure to 56 equity for both utilities which has been our average actual capital structure over the past five years and puts us within the range of debt ratios for moody s a rated regulated electric and gas utility companies advertisement advertisement we believe our roe applications are appropriate based on our financial modeling input from external consulting experts and taking into account the current capital markets and regulatory environment we also believe the applications will help to ensure the credit worthiness and financial integrity of our california utilities for additional perspective our base roe request are similar to our authorized roes prior to 2012 which were around 11 we submitted our ferc cost of capital filing for sdg e in october of last year which included a proposed roe of 11 2 compared to our current roe of 10 05 in terms of timing settlement discussions have started and are expected to go through the second half of the year our requested ferc roe increases clearly lower than our proposed cpuc roe increase this is primarily due to the fact that when these applications were filed events that have occurred since that time and most importantly differences in the probability of cost recovery between the two regulatory jurisdictions regarding our 2019 grc filings based on the activity we ve seen we continue to believe we ll receive a proposed decision from the cpuc in mid 2019 with an effective date of january 1 2019 southern california edison recently received their proposed decision but from a timing perspective each rate case is assessed on an individual basis and has led by different commissioners and administrative law judges we continue to believe our proposals are in the best interest of all stakeholders involved with a focus on safety and reliability for our customers advertisement advertisement please turn to the next slide shifting to our texas utility business we re happy to report the settlement has been reached with key stakeholders in oncor s proposed acquisition of infrareit and sempra s proposed acquisition of a 50 interest in sharyland the last regulatory steps in the transaction our approval and a final order from the puct this is consistent with our previous timeline and we would expect to close the transaction in mid 2019 now please turn to slide 8 i d now like to spend a few minutes discussing our infrastructure businesses let me start with cameron as you ll recall at our investor day we were able to raise sempra s projected annual run rate earnings guidance range for cameron lng phase 1 to 400 million to 450 million train 1 continues to achieve key milestones to support its timeline and most recently we introduced feed gas in mid april we expect to begin producing lng from this train shortly and began recognizing earnings in mid 2019 based on updated disclosures the epc contractor now expects train 2 to produce lng in q1 2020 and train 3 to produce lng in q2 of 2020 due to a longer construction and commissioning schedule moving on to our development projects both eca and port arthur recently received non fta approval to export lng additionally port arthur received ferc authorization to site construct and operate the lng facility these approvals bring us one step closer to reaching fid for these important projects related to ienova we re still targeting commercial delivery of natural gas at the marine pipeline in the second quarter of this year advertisement advertisement the terminal businesses ienova announced two new capacity contracts with a global integrated oil company this included an additional contract for 740 000 barrels of storage at the previously announced manzanillo marine terminal development project as well as 290 000 barrels of capacity at a new storage terminal project in guadalajara this new guadalajara terminal is their seventh terminal project and one of 12 projects currently in development or under construction please turn to the next slide where trevor will review our financial results trevor i mihalik evp cfo thanks joe earlier this morning we reported first quarter gaap earnings of 441 million or 1 59 per share this compares favorably to first quarter 2018 earnings of 347 million or 1 33 per share on an adjusted basis first quarter earnings were 534 million or 1 92 per share this compares favorably to our first quarter 2018 adjusted earnings of 372 million or 1 43 per share please turn to slide 10 where i ll discuss the key drivers of our quarterly results the variance in our first quarter 2019 adjusted earnings when compared to last year was affected by the following items 79 million of higher equity earnings at the sempra texas utility segment resulting from the acquisition of our interest in oncor in march of 2018 35 million and 31 million at socalgas and sdg e respectively related to the january 2019 cpuc decision allocating certain deferred income tax balances to shareholders this benefit was included in our 2019 adjusted guidance 23 million of higher earnings from south american operation including 15 million at peru due to an increase in rates and lower cost of purchased power and 7 million of higher earnings combined from both utilities as a result of lower depreciation due to the assets classified as held for sale 21 million in lower expense related to foreign currency and inflation effects net of foreign currency hedges in mexico and 15 million of higher earnings at sempra lng from our marketing operations primarily driven by changes in natural gas prices which was offset by 18 million of lower operational earnings at sdg e comprised of 27 million of lower cpuc based operating margin in 2019 due to the delay in the 2019 grc decision while absorbing higher operating costs offset by 9 million of higher earnings from electric transmission operations and 25 million of higher costs related to increased net interest expense and mandatory convertible preferred stock dividends at the parent driven by the oncore acquisition please turn to slide 11 to recap we continue to execute on our path to premier looking forward our key priorities are executing on our 25 billion five year base capital plan optimizing our capital allocation with a focus on strengthening the balance sheet advancing our lng development opportunities and engaging with stakeholders in key regulatory and legislative proceedings at our u s utilities we believe our strategic mission and disciplined capital allocation plan should help us reach our operational and financial goals well into the future with that we ll conclude the prepared remarks and start to take your questions questions and answers operator operator instructions and our first question will come from greg gordon with evercore isi greg gordon evercore isi institutional equities research division analyst hi guys how are you doing jeffrey walker martin chairman ceo good morning greg greg gordon evercore isi institutional equities research division analyst a couple of questions i think obviously the quarterly earnings were significantly better than consensus and i think that you utility analysts no matter how long they ve been doing this and i ve been doing quite a while often at time hard time with the quarterly just given how the regulatory model in california causes things to be extremely lumpy sometimes in this case it was the the utility income tax benefit that was 66 million positive on the quarter i know that you put that that was also you footnoted that was also in your full year guidance range that you gave at analyst day but can you just it s probably not a recurring item even though it s considered an ongoing item so how do we bridge to 2020 to the growth guidance that you gave for sdg e and socalgas what are the sort of not in specific mathematical terms but in general terms that sort of replace that and offset it so that you can show growth despite that item being sort of a one time thing jeffrey walker martin chairman ceo well thanks for that question greg and obviously i think there s a number of big levers in front of us for 2019 and you can probably list a lot of these but obviously we re quite focused on getting our grc approved for both socalgas and sdg e you recall that the year one step up in our filed request for socalgas was close to a 20 step up in a 10 step up in the attrition for sdg e and then in the outer years sdg e is roughly 5 to 6 and socalgas is 6 to 7 so the outcome of the grc is important both for 2019 and 2020 and i will remind you that in the reported results for q1 we held there are no additional attrition revenues above what we got in 2018 so that should lead to some form of understatement for q1 secondly you recall that we ve got our ferc roe pending i think we requested 11 2 it s over 100 basis points above where we re currently at the expected effective date for that ferc decision independent of when this can be rolled upon is the 1st june in 2019 and then obviously the cost of capital proceeding at the puc is really really foundational to what we re trying to accomplish and in our base plan we ve requested a 10 9 number for sdg e you followed us long enough you recall in the 2008 to 2012 timeframe it was slightly higher than that i think it was around 11 1 so we think that s adequate and you did note that we have a 3 4 at or relative to whether the reforms that we re expecting this summer adequately put in place the same number for socalgas is at 10 7 roe so in general that there is going to be some moving pieces in 19 but our ability to execute well around those regulatory initiatives will have a big impact on 2020 greg gordon evercore isi institutional equities research division analyst thanks my second question bit more general the governor s framework is released by his i think you called the strike team or strike force contemplates several ideas to solve the wildfire the structural wildfire problem and one of them is the idea of this catastrophic wildfire fund and the understanding is that multiple constituencies would be asked to potentially contribute to capitalize that including the state but also including the utilities and that would create a buffer between utility balance sheets and potential future wildfire claims such that inverse condemnation would essentially in many ways be immunized and then if you see deal with fault later i mean how do you contemplate that is that a viable outcome for you because in some ways i think investors look at it and say well that s a little bit frustrating from a sempra specific perspective since you have best in class wildfire safety provisions you haven t had a fire in 10 years and yet you might ask to be contribute some amount of this fund in the long run it might be in the best interest of your shareholders to contemplate that and then on the other hand you have the best in class safety record so can you talk about how you re thinking about the evolution of this negotiation and what that might look like jeffrey walker martin chairman ceo yes it s a very thoughtful question let me try to do this i m going to give you a couple contextual comments first and then i ll talk about some of the levers that could be put in play that would bridge that buffer that you referred to first off we probably will stop short of forecast and an outcome and i can say across our management team we have growing optimism that we ll get some things done this summer there will be adequate first off i commented on this on the q4 call the governor newsom has really shown some strong leadership and i think one of the things i ll try to focus on greg is up and down the state all the right people that you d expect to be at the table are highly engaged which i think is promising secondly you referenced the strike force report but it does lay out a roadmap for preventing future wildfires in the future and this is a point you made a comment on sdg e we ve been a leader in this regard we ve been recognized nationally so i think that it gives us some credibility to be at the table and then thirdly the commission that was established under sb 901 as this report due to the legislature on july 1 i think that will be an important thing for all the investor owned utilities and its investors to track but there are three key working groups out of that commission now focused on utility costs recovery standards wildfire funding mechanisms and insurance affordability and the heart of your question goes to this issue of wildfire funding mechanisms and i would say this independent first off we think it s a good idea to have this type of fund in place i think it provides confidence to the market it protects the utility balance sheet and just as importantly it gives people who have incurred damages greg access to liquidity which i think inspire some confidence in the marketplace but the mechanism by which that funding level is met and the funding levels determined continues to be in play i don t want to speculate too much except to say that i know that the reduction of the subrogation rights of insurers that provide wildfire insurance to consumers is actively under consideration also know that there is a variety of things in the existing rate making formula in california such as the department of water resources bonds which are rolling off here in the short term so there s going be some headroom in existing rates relative to how we might raise those dollars and like you we ve also heard some of the discussions around potential equity contributions it s probably quite frankly too early to speculate on that except to say that we are certainly significantly small fraction of the state in terms of exposure we have invested 1 5 billion to date in hardening our back country in our vegetation management programs we spent another 300 million so around fire science our risk fuel content in the back country it s something like that came to the fore we certainly think that any contributions from us should recognize the point that you made which we re in a materially different situation greg gordon evercore isi institutional equities research division analyst thank you very clear have a good morning jeffrey walker martin chairman ceo thank you greg operator our next question will come from steve fleishman with analysts and wolfe research steven isaac fleishman wolfe research llc analyst hi thank you excuse me turning to good morning to cameron could you just first of all clarify the dates are first lng dates so in terms of actually turning it into earnings producing asset is that like three months after six months after what is a rough timeline for turning it commercial jeffrey walker martin chairman ceo yes what we usually look for is it s usually four to six weeks after you get first lng to get to substantial completion as well as earnings steven isaac fleishman wolfe research llc analyst okay and then i know this isn t an issue by 2021 but just for 2020 how should we think about the delay in terms of your guidance range joseph allan householder president coo well i think in your my prepared remarks we talked about the fact that there s really no change i mean frankly you go back to the analyst conference and we were looking at different contingencies for the year we build in the expectations of a potential delay like this the 2021 i think to your point steve is still when we expect full run rate earnings and you recall that at our investor day we raised our expectations around that to 400 million to 450 million steven isaac fleishman wolfe research llc analyst okay and then maybe just switching gears on to california wildfire fixes so all the right people together et cetera just do you think it s feasible to get done by this july timeframe are you more focused on just by the end of the session and what will kind of what are you keyed off of to kind of say that this will get done jeffrey walker martin chairman ceo so we re actually entertaining some of the key stakeholders in sacramento here in san diego later this week actually have a group of senior folks in administration touring our wildfire science center here at sdg e which we think is positive all the right conversations being held we certainly think toni akins who s from san diego has a very important role to play in the senate the governor s got the right folks on it guggenheim is an independent financial advisor they ve been meeting with all the credit rating agencies in fact some of the agencies has actually been out to sacramento so we think to your original point all the right folks are at the table i continue to be very key to offer this july 1st date which is a date that the blue ribbon panelists to make their reports to the legislature which i think is important and then obviously there has been a commitment to try to get a bill that is comprehensive to the legislature the middle of july which i think is the second data point to follow but look i go back to the point steve but this is the fifth largest economy in the world we have had a premium regulatory climate here for several decades i think there is a growing recognition in all my conversations that they understand the value of having a rated balance sheets from the investor owned utilities i think that we remain optimistic that we ll get something done steven isaac fleishman wolfe research llc analyst one last quick question just on the grc so we did finally getting edison grc and i guess some of the issues there were mixed but i know you filed your grc i think was the first one done under the ramp filing mechanisms so i guess the question really is how should we view the edison proposed decision as a barometer at all for yours jeffrey walker martin chairman ceo i ll make a couple comments and see if joe wants to add some but internally steve the way we ve talked about it is apples and oranges right so this risk assessment program that we use for our rate case really went into all the fundamentals of how you rank a hierarchy of risk operationally in your service territory and then you guys have that to expected capital spending right to make sure that you end up with a different risk mitigated set of outcomes if you look at the backdrop that the commission s reviewing our ramp based grc that backdrop is around how we take risk out of system and move toward more constructive regulation so i m not sure how much press technical difficulty assigned to the edison case but joe do you want to add anything about how you re thinking about our rate case joseph allan householder president coo sure thanks jeff hi steve i think you have to consider a few things when you think about it first each rate case filing is very different they have different assigned commissioners different staffs different alj s we ve already talked about the ramp i don t need to repeat that but our filing incorporate safety and reliability spending as directed by the puc a large component of the filing for sdg e was including additional wildfire mitigation efforts that include accelerating the hardening increased vegetation management above and beyond what we have to do additional fire prevention technology and if you look at the wildfire mitigation plan that we have that was just approved there s little additional capital because most of its already incorporated in this grc ramp request and if so kind of the same thing it s a continuation of integrity management for transmission distribution and storage so we think we have a very thoughtful filing around safety reliability and most of all importantly affordability for our customers so we think as jeff said there are apples and oranges steven isaac fleishman wolfe research llc analyst thank you jeffrey walker martin chairman ceo thanks steve operator next we ll go to julien dumoulin smith from bank of america julien patrick dumoulin smith bofa merrill lynch analyst hi good morning can you hear me jeffrey walker martin chairman ceo good morning julien you re loud and clear julien patrick dumoulin smith bofa merrill lynch analyst excellent so perhaps just to clarify a couple of things that have already been followed up on here how do you think about the wildfire mitigation plans and some of the responses in the proposed decisions that came back of late on the alj side first how do you think about translating a wildfire mitigation plan into some form of prudency and now given the way the things have been developing how do you think about clarifying that from a legislative perspective obviously this is one nexus i d be curious on your perspectives jeffrey walker martin chairman ceo yeah i ll make two comments in that regard and joe you feel free to come in behind me but you recall that our wildfire mitigation plan was focused on fire hardening vegetation management increase in our aerial support so we have the 24 hour capability with night time flying helicopter and then you may recall julien we ve got 177 weather stations in the back country six of those will be retrofitted as part of our plan and we ve asked for an incremental 100 million to 200 million associated with our mitigation plan for 2019 and that augments what joe covered because there s a fair amount of capital just in our ramp based grc filing so as you think about that contextually then you move over to how you might think about assign liability what we re trying to do is move away from some type of discretionary standard right so if the goal is to make sure that you re substantially compliant the whole goal of having this liquidity fund set up is to meet the needs of those people who have incurred losses separate and apart from that you recall julien that the commission always retains discretion regarding penalties if they think that there should have been a different standard applied so what we want to move away from is this idea of a discretionary standard where someone s interpolating how well you have complied with your established wildfire mitigation plan joseph allan householder president coo yes let me just add on to that h julien look i think that i m going to go back up to a different level we really applaud the work of the governor in his leadership and trying to address this he clearly recognizes that healthy utility companies are a key component of us providing clean safe and reliable energy and in order to have healthy utility companies we have to have certainty of recovery right we have to and that includes cost in operating our business and those incurred as a result of the application of inverse if we are operating in the normal course so his strike force has laid out a path where the blue ribbon commission and the california legislature to achieve that we think that s the way and as jeff said we need the certainty and if you were to look at our u s supreme court filing it goes through all of this right we have to have certainty of recovery and you can have a taken so i think this is the point we need to make julien patrick dumoulin smith bofa merrill lynch analyst and then just turning back very quickly to the mcdermott side of the equation just curious are there ongoing negotiations are just to clarify after some of the commentary last week here about the status of the project and not necessarily related to the timeline but just cost and even in that there obviously there s a lot of activity on their side of the equation how do you think about your leverage in the situation to ensure not just timely completion but also completion on budget as it stands today jeffrey walker martin chairman ceo let me take that julien i think look for all of you the most important thing to recognize is that this project is days away from beginning to produce lng and start delivering it to our customers and cameron lng and the epc contractor have common goals and getting this world class project completed safely and reliable and i want to kind of remind you all that sempra risk manages project and the imminent start up is very exciting for a few reasons one we have a very low cost world class lng project that has created substantial value for the shareholders two the high return asset that we have is a very high return asset it s going to begin producing earnings very soon cameron lng the business is very strong we have strong partners we have strong contracts and that supports our long term cash flows from this business so remember we put in our old project we re going to get like 12 billion of cash flows out of this thing and there have been ongoing discussions with the contractor over the last year or so they continue to move things a little to the right you can see in mcdermott s materials that they just have they re going to spend between the two of them about 1 billion to finish this thing and so they like to get some help but we would like to make sure we get the project done we want to make it get it done we want to get it done as soon as possible everybody is focused on it what we re really excited about is we re starting up right now and that s about all i can say right now julien patrick dumoulin smith bofa merrill lynch analyst fair enough thank you jeffrey walker martin chairman ceo thank you julien operator and christopher turnure from jpmorgan has our next question christopher turnure jp morgan chase co research division analyst good afternoon guys just a follow up on the last question joe is there a way that we can think about kind of your own internal processes for evaluating cameron timing and cost and construction versus what the contractors are doing there because i think you re being very deliberate in your message that that is what they re forecasting that s what their latest update points to certainly that was your message at the analyst day too and that was pretty recently that we had a affirmation of the old schedule versus now joseph allan householder president coo look i think that we when i say we let me talk about cameron lng cameron lng is a company it s owned 50 by sempra and 16 6 by the other three equity owners who are our customers cameron lng has people on the ground at the site every day as they have since the start of the construction and they oversee what s going on they re a big engineering team looking at the forecast of the schedule i can tell you that mcdermott has since last year when they took over cb i put a lot of focus and effort on this project and have gotten more deeply into the schedule and the costs over time as you ve seen in their announcements i think that david dickson is very intent on getting this project done he talks to all the partners as well as to cameron lng management we have assessed it we ve had partners engineers assess it we ve had our owner s engineer assess it we think the schedule is one that it seems very reasonable but it s in the hands of the contractor which is chiyoda and mcdermott so it s up to them to predict the schedule and the costs we think that what s laid out there we took that into account when we did our earnings guidance and that s about i d say christopher turnure jp morgan chase co research division analyst okay that s helpful color and then could you just give us a little bit more detail on the latam sale process and kind of how that s progressing next milestones to look for and i guess versus a base case what might move that schedule forward or backward jeffrey walker martin chairman ceo thank you the current sales process is being handled by trevor is our cfo and i ll let trevor address the next milestones trevor i mihalik evp cfo thanks jeff yes we re progressing well on schedule we ve seen robust interest across the board for these businesses and these are great businesses interest has been wide range from financial investors to sovereign and pension funds so we are targeting first round bids by the end of the second quarter and then go into the second round and then we re still targeting close sometime around the end of the year christopher turnure jp morgan chase co research division analyst okay and nothing that could move that forward or backward based on what you re seeing right now trevor i mihalik evp cfo no i think we ve got a pretty formalized process that we re working through and we re still adhering to the schedule that we laid out christopher turnure jp morgan chase co research division analyst okay great thanks trevor trevor i mihalik evp cfo yeah operator our next question will come from michael lapides with goldman sachs michael lapides goldman sachs group inc research division analyst hi jeff hi joe thank you for taking my question real quick if you had to peg which moves forward first is it the cameron expansion so four and five is it the first trains at port arthur or is that the small train at costa azul ph and if so what are the next key milestones we ve got to watch for jeffrey walker martin chairman ceo thank you for that question michael and i ll give some color commentary maybe joe can add into it but i think that the one that has the lead advantage currently as we currently have three heads of agreement at eca phase 1 already fully contracted in all three of those are moving toward having spas in place so just in terms of documentation that when its further along in terms of being 100 contracted and moving toward more definitive agreements i would also say that cameron expansion is something we remain optimistic about you will recall that when total stepped into lngs position they made it very clear to their shareholders that one of the attractive aspects of being in the original cameron partnership was they were committed and interested in seeing the expansion go forward which you may recall was something we were trying to do several years earlier so i think you ve got a lot of sight to the three participants in the expansion and we continue to have a lot of positive work being done there to make sure that the underlying economic support that and then obviously at port arthur we ve got 2 million tons per annum accounted for with our partner from poland we re continuing to have a lot of very positive conversations around port arthur and we think that is a remarkable site for a number of reasons so i think in general one of the things you recall that we did was we did a bottoms up strategic review of our lng business over the last 12 months and came away with you michael that not only is it a core business to sempra and sempra can continue to add value in terms of balance sheet and expertise we really raised our ambitions about what we thought we could accomplish so we re actually feeling quite constructive on all three of those projects michael lapides goldman sachs group inc research division analyst got it and then a question on the settlement in texas any impact meaning the settlement regarding infrareit and sharyland any impact of that settlement on the potential accretion dilution that you discussed when first announced joseph allan householder president coo i would say that we ve gone back and revisited our underlying economics and we feel equally good about how we underwrote that transaction before maybe 30 or 40 days of slippage in and out of when we expect to close but we feel great about the transaction frankly the type of growth that we outlined at the investor conference monthly you recall really had a lot to do with that central and west texas opportunity and the infrareit transaction actually lays into that growth probably even better than we originally thought when we underwrote the deal michael lapides goldman sachs group inc research division analyst got it thank you jeff much appreciated jeffrey walker martin chairman ceo thank you michael operator next we ll go to ryan levine from citi ryan levine citigroup inc research division analyst hi given the recent weakness in global lng do you anticipate any customers so inaudible if not nominator with lng in cameron one after the commissioning phase is complete can you comment on the nomination process now that you re nearing first half ph jeffrey walker martin chairman ceo i don t know if we ll go into kind of how we think about nominations ryan but i think that we do take questions from time to time about whether we see overall contracting model change and based upon our current conversations in the marketplace joe s been on the road i m on the road carlos ruiz ph we ve got our entire management team been over to make sure we were talking to the right folks we still see this as a long term contracting business and our goal as a first step as we move toward fid is making sure that we have high quality customers contracted for 20 years with very strong balance sheet and remember we re really on the infrastructure side of business right so we want to play in the exact same role or very similar to what we are doing at cameron which is a totally model ryan levine citigroup inc research division analyst okay and then on eca with the non fta approval received are there any remaining permits that the company is still looking to procure jeffrey walker martin chairman ceo yeah you raise a great point we ve got the non fta approval to export from the united states to mexico and then to also export from mexico abroad as issued by the department of energy we also in this year got our port arthur approval from ferc i ll let joe comment on what other permits we have in mexico and whether there s any that we re still pursuing joseph allan householder president coo thanks jeff hey ryan yeah really the major permit we got earlier about both the large scale and the mid scale site and then as jeff just mentioned the non fta what we still need to get and we have applied for and we ve done this before is we need our mexican export permit so that s under way the other things are just small local permits around building the site but those come later in the process but the only one that s more significant is this export from mexico we expect no problems with that ryan levine citigroup inc research division analyst thank you jeffrey walker martin chairman ceo thanks ryan operator our next question will come from shahriar pourreza with guggenheim partners jeffrey walker martin chairman ceo hi shahriar constantine lednev guggenheim partners hi good morning it s actually constantine here for shahriar a lot of the questions have been answered just a couple of kind of housekeeping items on the lng development projects now that kind of permitting has been progressing can you talk about how you see kind of the ownership structure is going to be similar to cameron where somebody offtakers might take an equity interest or just how to think about on that going forward jeffrey walker martin chairman ceo yeah thank you for that question i think as we went through our strategic review of our lng business over the last six to eight months we ve also been looking as we move toward an fid decision that eca phase 1 later this year and hopefully an fid decision around port arthur in q1 of next year one of the things we re looking at is how we finance these projects and the potential impacts to our balance sheet but you re on great point as you saw in the cameron facility phase 1 joe articulated this earlier our three partners are each and for just over 16 participation we think it s a great model to align the interests of partners around these large capital projects and to your point we expect that will be a model you ll continue to see us replicate going forward i would say if you went up to one million feet and looked across the portfolio of our lng projects we like to be in that 60 to 70 range of equity ownership in our projects constantine lednev guggenheim partners okay so kind of thinking about it the same way as it s been another just kind of small housekeeping item you mentioned the cost of capital application equity ratio is going to kind of shore up the credit ratings but both from your perspective and i guess what you can reflect on the cpuc some of the downgrades have come not on the heels of just formulaic metrics but also some of the regulatory and kind of legislated kind of structures around there so how are you thinking about that kind of going toward credit metrics jeffrey walker martin chairman ceo well i mean we have spent a lot of time with our credit rating agencies and obviously they re very focused on the process we ve described on this call around making sure that the legislative and regulatory model moves back to standard utility practice and procedure rates you always expect to have your reasonable costs returned plus an additional return on what s on your investments and i think that s what brokers you recall with the this application of the inverse condemnation model is there has been a leakage of utilities ability to recover all the cost that they have incurred so i think it s really a multipart effort you ve got to get back to the right regulatory regime that allows for the type of funding mechanisms to meet the liquidity requirements you ve got to get a improvement to the regulatory model and you ve got to make sure that your return on equity reflects the risk in the marketplace and i ve oftentimes said that your return on equities tend to be a proxy for the regulatory financial and operating risk that you see in the marketplace and that s why we filed our updated roe request as we have constantine lednev guggenheim partners okay i guess it s fair to say that kind of progress on all fronts as what you re targeting jeffrey walker martin chairman ceo yeah that s well said that s right constantine lednev guggenheim partners okay yeah that answers everything to me thanks jeffrey walker martin chairman ceo thank you operator and that does conclude our question and answer session today i d like to turn the call over to jeff martin for closing remarks jeffrey walker martin chairman ceo look i want to thank everyone for taking the time to join us on the call today i would say as we ve had conversations with our management team we actually have a lot of exciting things that we re working on right now and look forward to seeing many of you on the road in the next couple of months and per custom if you have any follow up

for the three months ended march 31 2019 we have included cabletica in the determination of our rebased revenue and ocf for the three months ended march 31 2018 we have reflected the revenue and ocf of cabletica in our 2018 rebased amounts based on what we believe to be the most reliable information that is currently available to us generally pre acquisition financial statements as adjusted for the estimated effects of a any significant differences between u s gaap and local generally accepted accounting principles b any significant effects of acquisition accounting adjustments c any significant differences between our accounting policies and those of the acquired entities and d other items we deem appropriate we do not adjust pre acquisition periods to eliminate nonrecurring items or to give retroactive effect to any changes in estimates that might be implemented during post acquisition periods as we did not own or operate the acquired businesses during the pre acquisition periods no assurance can be given that we have identified all adjustments necessary to present their revenue and ocf on a basis that is comparable to the corresponding post acquisition amounts that are included in our historical results or that the pre acquisition financial statements we have relied upon do not contain undetected errors the adjustments reflected in our rebased amounts have not been prepared with a view towards complying with article 11 of regulation s x in addition the rebased growth percentages are not necessarily indicative of the revenue and ocf that would have occurred if these transactions had occurred on the dates assumed for purposes of calculating our rebased amounts or the revenue and ocf that will occur in the future the rebased growth percentages have been presented as a basis for assessing growth rates on a comparable basis and are not presented as a measure of our pro forma financial performance the following table provides

referenced in our form 10 q ocf is the primary measure used by our chief operating decision maker to evaluate segment operating performance ocf is also a key factor that is used by our internal decision makers to i determine how to allocate resources to segments and ii evaluate the effectiveness of our management for purposes of incentive compensation plans as we use the term ocf is defined as operating income or loss before depreciation and amortization share based compensation provisions and provision releases related to significant litigation and impairment restructuring and other operating items other operating items include i gains and losses on the disposition of long lived assets ii third party costs directly associated with successful and unsuccessful acquisitions and dispositions including legal advisory and due diligence fees as applicable and iii other acquisition related items such as gains and losses on the settlement of contingent consideration our internal decision makers believe ocf is a meaningful measure because it represents a transparent view of our recurring operating performance that is unaffected by our capital structure and allows management to i readily view operating trends ii perform analytical comparisons and benchmarking between segments and iii identify strategies to improve operating performance in the different countries in which we operate we believe our ocf measure is useful to investors because it is one of the bases for comparing our performance with the performance of other companies in the same or similar industries although our measure may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other public companies ocf should be viewed as a measure of operating performance that is a supplement to and not a substitute for operating income net earnings or loss cash flow from operating activities and other u s gaap measures of income or cash flows a reconciliation of our operating income to total ocf is

cash flow definition and reconciliation we define adjusted fcf as net cash provided by our operating activities plus i cash payments for third party costs directly associated with successful and unsuccessful acquisitions and dispositions ii expenses financed by an intermediary and iii insurance recoveries related to damaged and destroyed property and equipment less a capital expenditures b distributions to noncontrolling interest owners c principal payments on amounts financed by vendors and intermediaries and d principal payments on finance leases effective december 31 2018 and in connection with our hurricane insurance settlements we changed the way we define adjusted free cash flow to include proceeds from insurance recoveries related to damaged and destroyed property and equipment we believe this change is appropriate as such cash proceeds effectively partially offset payments for capital expenditures to replace the property and equipment that was damaged or destroyed as a result of the hurricanes we believe that our presentation of adjusted fcf provides useful information to our investors because this measure can be used to gauge our ability to service debt and fund new investment opportunities adjusted fcf should not be understood to represent our ability to fund discretionary amounts as we have various mandatory and contractual obligations including debt repayments which are not deducted to arrive at this amount investors should view adjusted fcf as a supplement to and not a substitute for u s gaap measures of liquidity included in our consolidated

president and chief executive officer of gran tierra commented gran tierra has delivered another quarter of record production and has now profitably grown production at an average rate of 14 per year since early 2015 our strategy remains centered on full cycle returns with an emphasis on creating long term shareholder value through economic production and reserves growth our sharp focus on capital efficiency has achieved an economic return on average capital employed of 11 over the last 12 months with the current oil price and our low cost structure we have also been able to return significant value to shareholders via our ongoing share buyback program the combination of our high netback production access to infrastructure low declines and large resource base has created a sustainable business model which we expect to be fully funded by forecasted cash from operating activities in 2019 we operate over 95 of our production and have a 100 wi in 22 out of 31 of our blocks including all 17 in colombia s putumayo and all 3 in ecuador s oriente we currently have 2 3 million gross acres in colombia and 140 000 gross acres in ecuador all of which are in proven hydrocarbon basins with this large diverse and operated portfolio gran tierra has significant control and flexibility on capital allocation and timing during volatile periods in oil price and capital markets we are very excited about ayombero with oil charge proven in all three wells drilled to date which provides us with confidence in the potential for large oil in place volumes we are addressing the mechanical challenges that have been experienced in drilling and completion operations due to the highly over pressured reservoirs encountered in each well over the last four years we have successfully built a strong position in the three major producing basins in colombia and achieved a new country entry into ecuador s highly prospective oriente basin gran tierra now has a significant amount of exploration appraisal and development opportunities for years to come we believe that gran tierra is well positioned for an exciting year of growth in 2019 and beyond as we continue to create value in multi horizon proven hydrocarbon basins operations update acordionero 100 wi during the quarter the ac 35 ac 36 and ac 37 development oil wells and two water injectors were drilled on the south pad the ac

central and mochuelo pads as well as pad 4 the acordionero facilities expansion is designed for enhanced oil recovery and value by increasing capacities for fluid handling and water injection gran tierra expects to be injecting 18 500 bbl water injected per day bwipd during second quarter 2019 this expansion is expected to allow water injection to be ramped up to a maximum rate of 40 000 bwipd during second half 2019 ayombero 100 wi the ayombero 3 appraisal well is in the completion phase operations have been delayed due to completion challenges associated with the highly over pressured reservoir initial indications from drilling prior to logs are that a potential gross reservoir interval of approximately 600 ft has been penetrated while the over pressured formations have continued to prove challenging in terms of drilling and completion operations the company is very excited about the potential associated with the ayombero chuira la luna conventional carbonate resource play its substantial prospective resource base and the inventory of future potential drilling opportunities the three ayombero wells drilled to date have confirmed similar lithologies oil saturations and over pressure in the galembo member of the la luna carbonate reservoir suggesting reservoir and structural continuity after completion of ayombero 3 workovers are planned for the ayombero 1 and 2 wells put

does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead in addition given that the value ratio based on the current price of oil as compared with natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalent of six to one utilizing a boe conversion ratio of 6 mcf 1 barrel would be misleading as an indication of value this press release contains certain oil and gas metrics including operating netback and cash netback which do not have standardized meanings or standard methods of calculation and therefore such measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies and

including richard clarida and randal quarles made clear market bets on a rate cut were out of sync with policymakers view rbc capital markets on the fed s inflation target the relationship between unemployment and wage growth seems to be intact indeed since the unemployment rate slipped below 4 5 a popular estimate of the natural rate of unemployment or u average hourly earnings have accelerated in other words the philips curve for wages has re steepened nicely over the course of the last few years but many remain perplexed as to why in an environment of very low unemployment rates end user inflation rates cpis pces are having a hard time hitting the fed s 2 target we think the problem with the inflation phillips curve is that we are looking for a purely domestic factor u rate to impact an increasingly global one inflation it is not a coincidence that the relationship between the gap in unemployment unemployment rate minus u and changes in inflation rates fell apart in the wake of increased global interconnectedness advertisement perhaps it is just not possible in this backdrop for the fed to get us to 2 inflation without an extreme event like an asset bubble which is why the only time in the last 25 years they did it was on the heels of the housing bubble that mortgage equity withdrawal driven demand boost to spending probably helped a bit if true the inflation target should be much lower to account for this focusing on whether the estimate of u is too low versus focusing on structural elements that have kept inflation down puts the fed at risk of running

biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing innovative therapies for the treatment of respiratory diseases with significant unmet medical needs verona pharma s product candidate ensifentrine is an investigational potential first in class inhaled dual inhibitor of the enzymes phosphodiesterase 3 and 4 that has been demonstrated to have both bronchodilator and anti inflammatory effects in a single compound we believe ensifentrine has the potential to be the first novel class of bronchodilator in over 40 years and the first therapy for the treatment of respiratory diseases that combines bronchodilator and anti inflammatory activities in one compound verona pharma is developing ensifentrine for the treatment of copd cf and asthma and potentially other respiratory diseases in clinical trials the nebulized formulation of ensifentrine has been observed to result in bronchodilator effects when used alone or as an add on treatment to other copd bronchodilators it has shown clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements in lung function when administered in addition to frequently used short and long acting bronchodilators such as tiotropium spiriva compared with such bronchodilators administered as a single agent ensifentrine improved fev1 over four weeks in patients with moderate to severe copd when compared to placebo and improved copd symptoms and quality of life in a phase 2b multicenter european study performed in 403 patients in addition ensifentrine has shown anti inflammatory effects in a standard challenge model producing copd like inflammation in human subjects in a recent three day clinical pharmacology study ensifentrine was observed to significantly increase bronchodilation compared to placebo even in patients already on background treatment of lama laba dual bronchodilator therapy with or without inhaled steroids the improvement in lung function following a 1 5 mg dose of ensifentrine was statistically significant over a number of time points including over the first 4 hours after the morning dose over 24 hours and after the evening dose despite the primary endpoint of improvement at morning peak not having been met importantly ensifentrine produced clinically relevant and statistically significant improvements in air trapping residual volume on top of dual bronchodilator treatment which we believe may translate into further symptom improvement in these patients already on maximum standard of care therapy ensifentrine has been observed to be well tolerated in these studies having been administered to more than 800 subjects in 13 clinical trials verona pharma is also developing formulations of ensifentrine suitable for handheld inhaler devices in both dry powder inhaler dpi and pressurized metered dose inhaler pmdi formats we recently announced data from part 1 of our dpi study administering a single ascending dose of ensifentrine in moderate to severe copd patients showing clear dose dependent and statistically significant improvements in bronchodilation compared to placebo while observed to be well tolerated we now expect to announce further data from part 2 of this study sooner than previously indicated in the third quarter of 2019 in the current quarter we also expect to commence a pmdi study in moderate to severe copd patients with single dose data from part 1 of this study expected in the second half of 2019 and final data expected in the first quarter of 2020 we believe the availability of a handheld inhaler will greatly expand the market potential for ensifentrine to the millions of copd patients who prefer to use handheld devices despite treatment with currently approved therapies many patients with copd experience daily symptoms impairing their quality of life airway obstruction and air trapping due to narrow air passages are major causes of debilitating breathlessness dyspnoea reducing physical ability and causing anxiety and depression of the patients treated with dual bronchodilator lama laba and triple therapy lama laba ics research suggests that up to 40 approximately 800 000 patients in the us alone are uncontrolled remaining symptomatic and at an increased risk of exacerbations we believe ensifentrine has demonstrated improvement in lung function as measured by fev1 and symptoms which commonly are a precursor to exacerbations in clinical trials and may therefore be an attractive additional treatment for these uncontrolled patients furthermore in copd patients novel anti inflammatory therapies are required as current treatments such as ics and pde4 inhibitors are either effective only in specific subsets of exacerbating copd patients or are associated with distressing side effects which can reduce treatment compliance we have already observed that ensifentrine improves lung function as measured by fev1 and or residual volume when used either as a stand alone treatment or as an addition to single or dual bronchodilators and we believe it is well placed to potentially meet the need for an effective and well tolerated additional treatment for those copd patients who remain symptomatic and uncontrolled despite using currently available copd medications operational performance in the first quarter on january 14 2019 we announced top line data from an exploratory phase 2a double blind placebo controlled three way cross over trial in 79 subjects with copd which included two different doses of ensifentrine 1 5 mg and 6 mg or placebo dosed twice daily for three days in addition to a dual bronchodilator therapy comprising tiotropium and olodaterol a commonly used lama laba dosed once daily this clinical trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of ensifentrine dosed on top of lama laba and lama laba ics a high hurdle as patients already on maximum bronchodilator treatment have very few treatment alternatives it was conducted in the united states and united kingdom we reported top line data from this trial earlier than expected in january 2019 the data from this phase 2a trial demonstrated significant improvements in lung function with the 1 5 mg dose over periods of 0 4 hours 0 12 hours and 0 24 hours following the morning dose and on peak effect following the evening dose when ensifentrine was added to tiotropium and olodaterol in patients with moderate to severe copd despite not meeting the primary endpoint of an improvement in the morning peak lung function improvement in average fev1 additional bronchodilation following morning dose on the third day with 1 5 mg of ensifentrine was statistically significant when added on top of stiolto tiotropium plus olodaterol or lama laba compared to placebo over 0 4 hours p 0 039 and 0 24 hours p 0 02 ensifentrine compared to placebo produced a statistically significant improvement in evening peak fev1 on the third day of dosing additional bronchodilation when administered on top of the standard bronchodilator tiotropium plus olodaterol stiolto 1 5 mg p0 001 ensifentrine compared to placebo produced a statistically significant improvement in residual volume on the third day of dosing when administered on top of the standard bronchodilator tiotropium plus olodaterol stiolto following the morning dose 1 5 mg p 0 037 6 mg n s and the evening dose 1 5 mg p0 002 0 036 in addition to our nebulized formulation of ensifentrine we are also developing ensifentrine in both dpi and pmdi formulations for the maintenance treatment of copd patients who prefer to use a handheld inhaler device we estimate that in the us approximately 90 of the 3 7 million mild moderate copd patients and 80 of the 2 7 million severe very severe copd patients use inhalers for maintenance therapy we believe that the successful development of a dpi or pmdi formulation of ensifentrine for moderate disease would greatly expand the addressable market for the drug and represents a multi billion dollar potential opportunity on march 4 2019 we announced interim data from part 1 of our dpi study administering a single ascending dose of ensifentrine in moderate to severe copd patients showing a clear dose response with statistically significant improvements in bronchodilation compared to placebo at the higher doses studies we now expect to announce further data from part 2 of this study sooner than previously indicated in the third quarter of 2019 the study is designed in two parts in part 1 37 patients were randomized and given a single dose of ensifentrine in doses ranging from 150 6 000 µg peak fev1 increased from baseline in a dose dependent manner ranging from 68 ml to 333 ml p0 05 average fev1 0 4 hours and 0 12 hours also showed a dose response and demonstrated durability of effect over the dosing interval average fev10 4h ranging from 68 ml to 296 ml p1 0 12h ranging from 54 ml to 254 ml p0 05 ensifentrine dpi formulation has been observed to be well tolerated at each dose with an adverse event profile similar to placebo in the current quarter we expect to commence a pmdi study in moderate to severe copd patients with single dose data from part 1 of this study expected in the second half of 2019 and final data expected in the first quarter of 2020 opportunities also exist to explore the development of ensifentrine in dpi and or pmdi formulations for the treatment of asthma and other respiratory diseases outlook we intend to become a leading biopharmaceutical company focused on the treatment of respiratory diseases with significant unmet medical needs we recognize that our proposed strategy for achieving this goal depends on the totality of the data from all clinical trials conducted with ensifentrine future interactions with regulatory authorities and our commercial assessment of different development options for ensifentrine key elements of this strategy include a strong focus on bringing nebulized ensifentrine into phase 3 clinical trials for the maintenance treatment of copd which requires us to deploy our financial and other resources on nebulized and inhaled formulations of ensifentrine as a maintenance treatment for copd in the short term identifying compelling market opportunities such as patients with copd that continue to experience daily symptoms impairing their quality of life despite treatment with currently available medicines in our clinical trials we have observed that ensifentrine improves lung function in copd patients when used either as a stand alone treatment or as an add on to treatment with single and dual bronchodilators we believe that adding nebulized ensifentrine to symptomatic copd patients already treated with standard of care medicines represents a very significant market opportunity ongoing review of our ensifentrine development strategy in the context of additional data generated including from clinical trials regulatory interactions and market research to identify opportunities to enhance and de risk our late stage development and commercialization of ensifentrine we believe this review and data from our next dose ranging phase 2b study to generate additional data to facilitate and de risk dose selection for our phase 3 program will further enhance ensifentrine s potential commercial positioning we continue to expect to complete patient dosing in our phase 2 study by the end of 2019 and to progress into pivotal phase 3 trials in 2020 for the treatment of copd patients who may prefer administration using a handheld inhaler device we are developing ensifentrine in inhaler formulations we are progressing part 2 of our clinical trial in copd patients with multiple doses of our dpi formulation and now expect final data sooner than previously indicated in the third quarter of 2019 we expect to commence a clinical trial with the pmdi formulation this quarter with interim data from the single dose part 1 expected in the third quarter of 2019 and final data expected in the first quarter of 2020 advance the development of nebulized ensifentrine for the treatment of acute exacerbations of copd we are developing ensifentrine as an add on therapy to short acting bronchodilators and other commonly used therapies for the treatment of hospitalized patients with acute exacerbations of copd the timing for future studies in this indication remains subject to our decision to move more rapidly towards phase 3 clinical trials with nebulized ensifentrine for the maintenance treatment of copd develop ensifentrine for the treatment of cf the timing for future studies in this indication remains subject to our decision to move more rapidly towards phase 3 clinical trials with nebulized ensifentrine for the maintenance treatment of copd pursue development of ensifentrine for other respiratory diseases we believe that ensifentrine s properties as an inhaled dual inhibitor of pde3 and pde4 give it broad potential applicability in the treatment of other respiratory diseases such as severe asthma we may explore development of ensifentrine to treat other forms of respiratory disease following development of ensifentrine for the treatment of copd and cf we may seek strategic collaborations with market leading biopharmaceutical companies to develop and commercialize ensifentrine we believe any such collaborations could provide significant funding to advance the development of ensifentrine while allowing us to benefit from the development or commercialization expertise of our collaborators we may acquire or in license product candidates for the treatment of respiratory diseases we plan to leverage our respiratory disease expertise to identify and in license or acquire additional clinical stage product candidates that we believe have the potential to become novel treatments for respiratory diseases with significant unmet medical needs financial review financial review of the three month period ended march 31 2019 the operating loss for the three months ended march 31 2019 was 7 8 million march 31 2018 5 9 million and the loss after tax for the three months ended march 31 2019 was 5 4 million march 31 2018

an increase of 1 5 million the increase was predominantly attributable to a 1 3 million increase in clinical trial expenses relating to four clinical trials ongoing or in preparation of ensifentrine in the three months ended march 31 2019 compared to one trial in the three months ended march 31 2018 in addition spend on pre clinical development increased by 0 2 million general and administrative costs general and administrative costs were 1 8 million for the three months ended march 31 2019 as compared to 1 5 million for the three months ended march 31 2018 an increase of 0 3 million the increase was primarily attributable to a 0 3 million increase in professional fees finance income and expense finance income was 1 9 million for the three months ended march 31 2019 and 0 2 million for the three months ended march 31 2018 the increase in finance income was primarily due to a decrease in the fair value of the warrant liability of 1 6 million during the three months ended march 31

march 31 2019 compared to 10 3 million for the three months ended march 31 2018 the decrease was due to a decrease in the fair value of the warrant liability recorded in finance income compared to an

three months ended march 31 2018 an increase of 0 5 million the credits are obtained at a rate of 14 5 of 230 of our qualifying research and development expenditure and the increase in the credit amount was attributable to our increased expenditure on research and development compared to the prior period cash flows net cash used in operating activities increased to 9 9 million for the three months ended march 31 2019 from 6 2 million for the three months ended march 31 2018 this was due to an increase in operating costs driven by higher research and development costs as well as differences in the timing of supplier payments net cash generated from investing activities predominantly reflects the net movement of cash being placed on deposit for more than three months and such deposits maturing because deposits of more than three months are disclosed as short term investments separately from cash the increase in net cash generated in investing activities to 9 0 million for the three months ended march 31 2019 from 4 5 million for the three months ended march 31 2018 was due to the net movement of funds from short term investments to cash being greater during the three months ended march 31 2019 cash cash equivalents and short term investments cash cash equivalents and short term investments at march 31 2019 decreased to 54 0 million from 64 7 million at december 31

plc the company and its subsidiaries are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing innovative therapeutics for the treatment of respiratory diseases with significant unmet medical needs the company is a public limited company which is dual listed with its ordinary shares listed on the alternative investment market of the london stock exchange and its american depositary shares on the nasdaq global market the company is incorporated and domiciled in the united kingdom the address of the registered office is 1 central square cardiff cf10 1fs united kingdom the company has two subsidiaries verona pharma inc and rhinopharma limited rhinopharma both of which are wholly owned 2 basis of accounting the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of verona pharma plc and its subsidiaries verona pharma inc and rhinopharma limited together the group for the three months ended march 31 2019 do not include all the statements required for full annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the group as of december 31 2018 the 2018 accounts on which the company s auditors delivered an unqualified audit report have been delivered to the registrar of companies these unaudited condensed interim financial statements were authorized for issue by the company s board of directors the directors on may 7 2019 there have been no changes other than the adoption of ifrs 16 to the accounting policies as contained in the annual consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december 31 2018 which have been prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards ifrs as issued by the international accounting standards board iasb the interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis management having reviewed the future operating costs of the business in conjunction with the cash held as of march 31 2019 believes the group has sufficient funds to continue as a going concern for at least 12 months from the date this report is issued the group s activities and results are not exposed to any seasonality the group operates as a single operating and reportable segment dividend the directors do not recommend the payment of a dividend for the three months ended march 31 2019 three months ended march 31 2018 nil and the year ended december 31 2018 nil 3 change in accounting policy adoption of ifrs 16 ifrs 16 leases is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after january 1 2019 and replaces ias 17 leases it eliminates the classification of leases as either operating leases or finance leases and instead introduces a single lessee accounting model the adoption of ifrs 16 resulted in the group recognizing lease liabilities within current liabilities and corresponding right of use assets for the arrangements within property plant and equipment that were previously classified as operating leases the group s principal lease arrangements are for office buildings the group has adopted ifrs 16 retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings at january 1 2019 the standard permits a choice on initial adoption on a lease by lease basis to measure the right of use asset at either its carrying amount as if ifrs 16 had been applied since the commencement of the lease or an amount equal to the lease liability adjusted for any accrued or prepaid lease payments the group has elected to measure the right of use asset at its carrying value as if ifrs 16 had been applied since the commencement of the lease with the result of a 20 thousand impact on opening retained earnings initial adoption has resulted in the recognition of right of use assets of 325 thousand and lease liabilities of 316 thousand and the reclassification of prepaid lease rentals of 29 thousand as of january 1 2019 000s operating lease commitments including prepayments disclosed as at december 31 2018 600 less adjustments relating to prepaid lease payments 29 operating lease commitments as at december 31 2018 571 discounted using the group s incremental borrowing rate 526 less short term leases recognized on a straight line basis as expense 210 lease liability recognized as at january 1 2019 316 in applying ifrs 16 for the first time the group has used the following practical expedients permitted by the standard the use of a single discount rate to a portfolio of leases with reasonably similar characteristics accounting for operating leases with a remaining lease term of less than 12 months as at january 1 2019 as short term leases the use of hindsight in determining the lease term where the contract contains options to extend or terminate the lease and excluding initial direct costs from the initial measurement of the right of use asset the group is applying ifrs 16 s low value and short term exemptions the adoption of ifrs 16 has had no impact on the group s net cash flows although a presentation change has been reflected whereby cash outflows of 84 thousand are now presented as financing instead of operating there is a decrease of 9 thousand in general and administrative costs as depreciation of the right of use asset is less than the lease costs and a 9 thousand increase in finance expense from the presentation of a portion of lease costs as interest costs there is no significant impact on overall loss before tax and loss per share 4 segmental reporting the group s activities are covered by one operating and reporting segment drug development there have been no changes to management s assessment of the operating and reporting segment of the group during the period all non current assets are based in the united kingdom 5 financial instruments the group s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks market risk including foreign currency risk cash flow and fair value interest rate risk and credit risk and liquidity risk the condensed consolidated interim financial statements do not include all financial risk management information and disclosures required in the annual financial statements and they should be read in conjunction with the group s annual financial statements for the year ended december 31 2018 6 estimates the preparation of condensed consolidated interim financial statements require management to make judgments estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities income and expenses actual results may differ from those estimates in preparing these condensed consolidated interim financial statements the significant judgments made by management in applying the group s accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those applied to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2018 in addition the company carried out a value in use impairment review impairment of intangible assets goodwill and non financial assets the company notes that after the reduction in the share price since december 31 2018 at various points in the quarter the market value of the company was less than its net book value the company has carried out an impairment review and determined that company s value in use exceeds the carrying value of the company s assets and consequently that no impairment is required 7 finance income and expense three

basic loss per share of 5 1p march 31 2018 14 5p for the three months ended march 31 2019 is calculated by dividing the loss for the three months ended march 31 2019 by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue of 105 326 637 during the three months ended march 31 2019 march 31 2018 105 017 400 since the group has reported a net loss diluted loss per ordinary share is equal to basic loss per ordinary share each ads represents 8 shares of the company so the loss per ads is any period is equal to 8 times the loss per share 10 short term investments short term investments as at

to the july 2016 placement the company issued 31 115 926 units to new and existing investors at the placing price of 1 4365 per unit each of which was comprised of one ordinary share and one warrant the warrant holders can subscribe for 0 4 of an ordinary share at a per share exercise price of 120 of the placing price 1 7238 the warrant holders can opt for a cashless exercise of their warrants by choosing to exchange the warrants held for a reduced number of warrants exercisable at nil consideration the reduced number of warrants is calculated based on a formula considering the share price and the exercise price of the shares the warrants were therefore classified as a derivative financial liability since their exercise might result in a variable number of shares to be issued the warrants

lot faisel i d like to thank everyone who attended our investor day here in san diego we appreciated having the opportunity to provide a comprehensive update on our strategy and capital plans and enjoy taking many of you to visit our lng facility in baja california as well as sdg e where we highlighted our wildfire mitigation program and showcased tour ph of the california utility assets we hope you came away from our conference with the following first we have a sharper strategic focus second we ve improved our capital discipline and third we are investing in a high performance culture since our investor day we held our internal top 300 leadership meeting leaders across our company came together here in san diego to discuss steps we re taking to better align our 20 000 employees to directly support our strategic mission of becoming north america s premier energy infrastructure company there was a great sense of energy among the team as we set our course for the next year and beyond from an execution standpoint we continue to make progress on our goals just last month we completed the sale of our wind assets which brings the total cash proceeds from our renewables to midstream divestitures to approximately 2 5 billion well above market expectations next our focus is on successfully completing the planned sale of our south american businesses which we re targeting to close around the end of this year proceeds from our asset sales will be used to advance our strategic mission by funding growth while also strengthening our balance sheet by paying down parent debt now looking forward sempra is well positioned our businesses at the intersection of two key trends that are transforming the energy markets the transition toward cleaner energy which is happening market by market and the u s is growing dominance in the global energy markets we expect our assets to play a key role in further in both of these trends which in turn should create jobs both in the united states and mexico bolster the economies of both countries and drive future value creation for our shareholders before handing it off the call to joe i d also like to highlight that we are affirming our 2019 adjusted eps guidance range as well as our 2020 eps guidance range please turn to the next slide where joe will discuss how we are executing on our operational goals joseph allan householder president coo thanks jeff before touching on some of the legislative discussions happening in california on wildfire risk i would like to mention that last week the cpuc issued a favorable proposed decision on sdg e s wildfire mitigation plan enabling us to continue to improve our industry leading program now on the legislative front we re pleased with governor newsom and the strike force s leadership and their proposals the most important aspects are mitigating the threat of wildfires through measures such as increase vegetation management advancing emergency response to minimize damage if an event occurs and defining proposals that can help ensure healthy utilities to achieve california s greenhouse gas reduction goals we believe the strike force s recent recommendations of liquidity fund a wildfire fund and changes to inverse condemnation help narrow the focus of the blue ribbon commission we are actively engaged to help ensure that our customers and our shareholders interests are addressed and that our existing wildfire mitigation efforts are recognized we re optimistic that effective legislative solutions could be introduced and approved this summer although positive headway is being made the current regulatory environment and threat of wildfires in this state are factors we must take into account in our regulatory filings including the cost of capital proceeding please turn to slide 6 this cpuc cost of capital proceeding is very important to our two utilities because our currently authorized return on equity numbers were last updated in july of 2017 and where were the result of a two year extension from our last cost of capital proceeding approved in 2013 a lot has happened since 2017 and even more so since 2013 over this time period in california customer needs state mandates energy goals the environment the regulatory construct have all can change considerably they ve had a corresponding and material impact on the risk profile of california industrial and utilities our cost of capital applications reflect this shift in risk and the higher roes are designed to help ensure access to the capital markets specifically our request for focused on returns that are commensurate with the increased risk of operating in california investment grade credit ratings to preserve reasonable rates for customers and maintain access to capital to continue investing in safety and reliability and financial stability with this in mind we requested first an increase to our authorized roes at sdg e we requested a base roe of 10 9 plus a 3 4 adder for a total of 14 3 an increase from our currently authorized roe of 10 2 we arrived at the wildfire adder by estimating risk associated with potential unrecoverable wildfire liability premiums required by insurers and premiums required by investors in our catastrophe bonds at socalgas we requested an roe of 10 7 compared to its currently authorized roe of 10 05 and second an increase in our authorized capital structure to 56 equity for both utilities which has been our average actual capital structure over the past five years and puts us within the range of debt ratios for moody s a rated regulated electric and gas utility companies we believe our roe applications are appropriate based on our financial modeling input from external consulting experts and taking into account the current capital markets and regulatory environment we also believe the applications will help to ensure the credit worthiness and financial integrity of our california utilities for additional perspective our base roe request are similar to our authorized roes prior to 2012 which were around 11 we submitted our ferc cost of capital filing for sdg e in october of last year which included a proposed roe of 11 2 compared to our current roe of 10 05 in terms of timing settlement discussions have started and are expected to go through the second half of the year our requested ferc roe increases clearly lower than our proposed cpuc roe increase this is primarily due to the fact that when these applications were filed events that have occurred since that time and most importantly differences in the probability of cost recovery between the two regulatory jurisdictions regarding our 2019 grc filings based on the activity we ve seen we continue to believe we ll receive a proposed decision from the cpuc in mid 2019 with an effective date of january 1 2019 southern california edison recently received their proposed decision but from a timing perspective each rate case is assessed on an individual basis and has led by different commissioners and administrative law judges we continue to believe our proposals are in the best interest of all stakeholders involved with a focus on safety and reliability for our customers please turn to the next slide shifting to our texas utility business we re happy to report the settlement has been reached with key stakeholders in oncor s proposed acquisition of infrareit and sempra s proposed acquisition of a 50 interest in sharyland the last regulatory steps in the transaction our approval and a final order from the puct this is consistent with our previous timeline and we would expect to close the transaction in mid 2019 now please turn to slide 8 i d now like to spend a few minutes discussing our infrastructure businesses let me start with cameron as you ll recall at our investor day we were able to raise sempra s projected annual run rate earnings guidance range for cameron lng phase 1 to 400 million to 450 million train 1 continues to achieve key milestones to support its timeline and most recently we introduced feed gas in mid april we expect to begin producing lng from this train shortly and began recognizing earnings in mid 2019 based on updated disclosures the epc contractor now expects train 2 to produce lng in q1 2020 and train 3 to produce lng in q2 of 2020 due to a longer construction and commissioning schedule moving on to our development projects both eca and port arthur recently received non fta approval to export lng additionally port arthur received ferc authorization to site construct and operate the lng facility these approvals bring us one step closer to reaching fid for these important projects related to ienova we re still targeting commercial delivery of natural gas at the marine pipeline in the second quarter of this year the terminal businesses ienova announced two new capacity contracts with a global integrated oil company this included an additional contract for 740 000 barrels of storage at the previously announced manzanillo marine terminal development project as well as 290 000 barrels of capacity at a new storage terminal project in guadalajara this new guadalajara terminal is their seventh terminal project and one of 12 projects currently in development or under construction please turn to the next slide where trevor will review our financial results trevor i mihalik evp cfo thanks joe earlier this morning we reported first quarter gaap earnings of 441 million or 1 59 per share this compares favorably to first quarter 2018 earnings of 347 million or 1 33 per share on an adjusted basis first quarter earnings were 534 million or 1 92 per share this compares favorably to our first quarter 2018 adjusted earnings of 372 million or 1 43 per share please turn to slide 10 where i ll discuss the key drivers of our quarterly results the variance in our first quarter 2019 adjusted earnings when compared to last year was affected by the following items 79 million of higher equity earnings at the sempra texas utility segment resulting from the acquisition of our interest in oncor in march of 2018 35 million and 31 million at socalgas and sdg e respectively related to the january 2019 cpuc decision allocating certain deferred income tax balances to shareholders this benefit was included in our 2019 adjusted guidance 23 million of higher earnings from south american operation including 15 million at peru due to an increase in rates and lower cost of purchased power and 7 million of higher earnings combined from both utilities as a result of lower depreciation due to the assets classified as held for sale 21 million in lower expense related to foreign currency and inflation effects net of foreign currency hedges in mexico and 15 million of higher earnings at sempra lng from our marketing operations primarily driven by changes in natural gas prices which was offset by 18 million of lower operational earnings at sdg e comprised of 27 million of lower cpuc based operating margin in 2019 due to the delay in the 2019 grc decision while absorbing higher operating costs offset by 9 million of higher earnings from electric transmission operations and 25 million of higher costs related to increased net interest expense and mandatory convertible preferred stock dividends at the parent driven by the oncore acquisition please turn to slide 11 to recap we continue to execute on our path to premier looking forward our key priorities are executing on our 25 billion five year base capital plan optimizing our capital allocation with a focus on strengthening the balance sheet advancing our lng development opportunities and engaging with stakeholders in key regulatory and legislative proceedings at our u s utilities we believe our strategic mission and disciplined capital allocation plan should help us reach our operational and financial goals well into the future with that we ll conclude the prepared remarks and start to take your questions questions and answers operator operator instructions and our first question will come from greg gordon with evercore isi greg gordon evercore isi institutional equities research division analyst hi guys how are you doing jeffrey walker martin chairman ceo good morning greg greg gordon evercore isi institutional equities research division analyst a couple of questions i think obviously the quarterly earnings were significantly better than consensus and i think that you utility analysts no matter how long they ve been doing this and i ve been doing quite a while often at time hard time with the quarterly just given how the regulatory model in california causes things to be extremely lumpy sometimes in this case it was the the utility income tax benefit that was 66 million positive on the quarter i know that you put that that was also you footnoted that was also in your full year guidance range that you gave at analyst day but can you just it s probably not a recurring item even though it s considered an ongoing item so how do we bridge to 2020 to the growth guidance that you gave for sdg e and socalgas what are the sort of not in specific mathematical terms but in general terms that sort of replace that and offset it so that you can show growth despite that item being sort of a one time thing jeffrey walker martin chairman ceo well thanks for that question greg and obviously i think there s a number of big levers in front of us for 2019 and you can probably list a lot of these but obviously we re quite focused on getting our grc approved for both socalgas and sdg e you recall that the year one step up in our filed request for socalgas was close to a 20 step up in a 10 step up in the attrition for sdg e and then in the outer years sdg e is roughly 5 to 6 and socalgas is 6 to 7 so the outcome of the grc is important both for 2019 and 2020 and i will remind you that in the reported results for q1 we held there are no additional attrition revenues above what we got in 2018 so that should lead to some form of understatement for q1 secondly you recall that we ve got our ferc roe pending i think we requested 11 2 it s over 100 basis points above where we re currently at the expected effective date for that ferc decision independent of when this can be rolled upon is the 1st june in 2019 and then obviously the cost of capital proceeding at the puc is really really foundational to what we re trying to accomplish and in our base plan we ve requested a 10 9 number for sdg e you followed us long enough you recall in the 2008 to 2012 timeframe it was slightly higher than that i think it was around 11 1 so we think that s adequate and you did note that we have a 3 4 at or relative to whether the reforms that we re expecting this summer adequately put in place the same number for socalgas is at 10 7 roe so in general that there is going to be some moving pieces in 19 but our ability to execute well around those regulatory initiatives will have a big impact on 2020 greg gordon evercore isi institutional equities research division analyst thanks my second question bit more general the governor s framework is released by his i think you called the strike team or strike force contemplates several ideas to solve the wildfire the structural wildfire problem and one of them is the idea of this catastrophic wildfire fund and the understanding is that multiple constituencies would be asked to potentially contribute to capitalize that including the state but also including the utilities and that would create a buffer between utility balance sheets and potential future wildfire claims such that inverse condemnation would essentially in many ways be immunized and then if you see deal with fault later i mean how do you contemplate that is that a viable outcome for you because in some ways i think investors look at it and say well that s a little bit frustrating from a sempra specific perspective since you have best in class wildfire safety provisions you haven t had a fire in 10 years and yet you might ask to be contribute some amount of this fund in the long run it might be in the best interest of your shareholders to contemplate that and then on the other hand you have the best in class safety record so can you talk about how you re thinking about the evolution of this negotiation and what that might look like jeffrey walker martin chairman ceo yes it s a very thoughtful question let me try to do this i m going to give you a couple contextual comments first and then i ll talk about some of the levers that could be put in play that would bridge that buffer that you referred to first off we probably will stop short of forecast and an outcome and i can say across our management team we have growing optimism that we ll get some things done this summer there will be adequate first off i commented on this on the q4 call the governor newsom has really shown some strong leadership and i think one of the things i ll try to focus on greg is up and down the state all the right people that you d expect to be at the table are highly engaged which i think is promising secondly you referenced the strike force report but it does lay out a roadmap for preventing future wildfires in the future and this is a point you made a comment on sdg e we ve been a leader in this regard we ve been recognized nationally so i think that it gives us some credibility to be at the table and then thirdly the commission that was established under sb 901 as this report due to the legislature on july 1 i think that will be an important thing for all the investor owned utilities and its investors to track but there are three key working groups out of that commission now focused on utility costs recovery standards wildfire funding mechanisms and insurance affordability and the heart of your question goes to this issue of wildfire funding mechanisms and i would say this independent first off we think it s a good idea to have this type of fund in place i think it provides confidence to the market it protects the utility balance sheet and just as importantly it gives people who have incurred damages greg access to liquidity which i think inspire some confidence in the marketplace but the mechanism by which that funding level is met and the funding levels determined continues to be in play i don t want to speculate too much except to say that i know that the reduction of the subrogation rights of insurers that provide wildfire insurance to consumers is actively under consideration also know that there is a variety of things in the existing rate making formula in california such as the department of water resources bonds which are rolling off here in the short term so there s going be some headroom in existing rates relative to how we might raise those dollars and like you we ve also heard some of the discussions around potential equity contributions it s probably quite frankly too early to speculate on that except to say that we are certainly significantly small fraction of the state in terms of exposure we have invested 1 5 billion to date in hardening our back country in our vegetation management programs we spent another 300 million so around fire science our risk fuel content in the back country it s something like that came to the fore we certainly think that any contributions from us should recognize the point that you made which we re in a materially different situation greg gordon evercore isi institutional equities research division analyst thank you very clear have a good morning jeffrey walker martin chairman ceo thank you greg operator our next question will come from steve fleishman with analysts and wolfe research steven isaac fleishman wolfe research llc analyst hi thank you excuse me turning to good morning to cameron could you just first of all clarify the dates are first lng dates so in terms of actually turning it into earnings producing asset is that like three months after six months after what is a rough timeline for turning it commercial jeffrey walker martin chairman ceo yes what we usually look for is it s usually four to six weeks after you get first lng to get to substantial completion as well as earnings steven isaac fleishman wolfe research llc analyst okay and then i know this isn t an issue by 2021 but just for 2020 how should we think about the delay in terms of your guidance range joseph allan householder president coo well i think in your my prepared remarks we talked about the fact that there s really no change i mean frankly you go back to the analyst conference and we were looking at different contingencies for the year we build in the expectations of a potential delay like this the 2021 i think to your point steve is still when we expect full run rate earnings and you recall that at our investor day we raised our expectations around that to 400 million to 450 million steven isaac fleishman wolfe research llc analyst okay and then maybe just switching gears on to california wildfire fixes so all the right people together et cetera just do you think it s feasible to get done by this july timeframe are you more focused on just by the end of the session and what will kind of what are you keyed off of to kind of say that this will get done jeffrey walker martin chairman ceo so we re actually entertaining some of the key stakeholders in sacramento here in san diego later this week actually have a group of senior folks in administration touring our wildfire science center here at sdg e which we think is positive all the right conversations being held we certainly think toni akins who s from san diego has a very important role to play in the senate the governor s got the right folks on it guggenheim is an independent financial advisor they ve been meeting with all the credit rating agencies in fact some of the agencies has actually been out to sacramento so we think to your original point all the right folks are at the table i continue to be very key to offer this july 1st date which is a date that the blue ribbon panelists to make their reports to the legislature which i think is important and then obviously there has been a commitment to try to get a bill that is comprehensive to the legislature the middle of july which i think is the second data point to follow but look i go back to the point steve but this is the fifth largest economy in the world we have had a premium regulatory climate here for several decades i think there is a growing recognition in all my conversations that they understand the value of having a rated balance sheets from the investor owned utilities i think that we remain optimistic that we ll get something done steven isaac fleishman wolfe research llc analyst one last quick question just on the grc so we did finally getting edison grc and i guess some of the issues there were mixed but i know you filed your grc i think was the first one done under the ramp filing mechanisms so i guess the question really is how should we view the edison proposed decision as a barometer at all for yours jeffrey walker martin chairman ceo i ll make a couple comments and see if joe wants to add some but internally steve the way we ve talked about it is apples and oranges right so this risk assessment program that we use for our rate case really went into all the fundamentals of how you rank a hierarchy of risk operationally in your service territory and then you guys have that to expected capital spending right to make sure that you end up with a different risk mitigated set of outcomes if you look at the backdrop that the commission s reviewing our ramp based grc that backdrop is around how we take risk out of system and move toward more constructive regulation so i m not sure how much press technical difficulty assigned to the edison case but joe do you want to add anything about how you re thinking about our rate case joseph allan householder president coo sure thanks jeff hi steve i think you have to consider a few things when you think about it first each rate case filing is very different they have different assigned commissioners different staffs different alj s we ve already talked about the ramp i don t need to repeat that but our filing incorporate safety and reliability spending as directed by the puc a large component of the filing for sdg e was including additional wildfire mitigation efforts that include accelerating the hardening increased vegetation management above and beyond what we have to do additional fire prevention technology and if you look at the wildfire mitigation plan that we have that was just approved there s little additional capital because most of its already incorporated in this grc ramp request and if so kind of the same thing it s a continuation of integrity management for transmission distribution and storage so we think we have a very thoughtful filing around safety reliability and most of all importantly affordability for our customers so we think as jeff said there are apples and oranges steven isaac fleishman wolfe research llc analyst thank you jeffrey walker martin chairman ceo thanks steve operator next we ll go to julien dumoulin smith from bank of america julien patrick dumoulin smith bofa merrill lynch analyst hi good morning can you hear me jeffrey walker martin chairman ceo good morning julien you re loud and clear julien patrick dumoulin smith bofa merrill lynch analyst excellent so perhaps just to clarify a couple of things that have already been followed up on here how do you think about the wildfire mitigation plans and some of the responses in the proposed decisions that came back of late on the alj side first how do you think about translating a wildfire mitigation plan into some form of prudency and now given the way the things have been developing how do you think about clarifying that from a legislative perspective obviously this is one nexus i d be curious on your perspectives jeffrey walker martin chairman ceo yeah i ll make two comments in that regard and joe you feel free to come in behind me but you recall that our wildfire mitigation plan was focused on fire hardening vegetation management increase in our aerial support so we have the 24 hour capability with night time flying helicopter and then you may recall julien we ve got 177 weather stations in the back country six of those will be retrofitted as part of our plan and we ve asked for an incremental 100 million to 200 million associated with our mitigation plan for 2019 and that augments what joe covered because there s a fair amount of capital just in our ramp based grc filing so as you think about that contextually then you move over to how you might think about assign liability what we re trying to do is move away from some type of discretionary standard right so if the goal is to make sure that you re substantially compliant the whole goal of having this liquidity fund set up is to meet the needs of those people who have incurred losses separate and apart from that you recall julien that the commission always retains discretion regarding penalties if they think that there should have been a different standard applied so what we want to move away from is this idea of a discretionary standard where someone s interpolating how well you have complied with your established wildfire mitigation plan joseph allan householder president coo yes let me just add on to that h julien look i think that i m going to go back up to a different level we really applaud the work of the governor in his leadership and trying to address this he clearly recognizes that healthy utility companies are a key component of us providing clean safe and reliable energy and in order to have healthy utility companies we have to have certainty of recovery right we have to and that includes cost in operating our business and those incurred as a result of the application of inverse if we are operating in the normal course so his strike force has laid out a path where the blue ribbon commission and the california legislature to achieve that we think that s the way and as jeff said we need the certainty and if you were to look at our u s supreme court filing it goes through all of this right we have to have certainty of recovery and you can have a taken so i think this is the point we need to make julien patrick dumoulin smith bofa merrill lynch analyst and then just turning back very quickly to the mcdermott side of the equation just curious are there ongoing negotiations are just to clarify after some of the commentary last week here about the status of the project and not necessarily related to the timeline but just cost and even in that there obviously there s a lot of activity on their side of the equation how do you think about your leverage in the situation to ensure not just timely completion but also completion on budget as it stands today jeffrey walker martin chairman ceo let me take that julien i think look for all of you the most important thing to recognize is that this project is days away from beginning to produce lng and start delivering it to our customers and cameron lng and the epc contractor have common goals and getting this world class project completed safely and reliable and i want to kind of remind you all that sempra risk manages project and the imminent start up is very exciting for a few reasons one we have a very low cost world class lng project that has created substantial value for the shareholders two the high return asset that we have is a very high return asset it s going to begin producing earnings very soon cameron lng the business is very strong we have strong partners we have strong contracts and that supports our long term cash flows from this business so remember we put in our old project we re going to get like 12 billion of cash flows out of this thing and there have been ongoing discussions with the contractor over the last year or so they continue to move things a little to the right you can see in mcdermott s materials that they just have they re going to spend between the two of them about 1 billion to finish this thing and so they like to get some help but we would like to make sure we get the project done we want to make it get it done we want to get it done as soon as possible everybody is focused on it what we re really excited about is we re starting up right now and that s about all i can say right now julien patrick dumoulin smith bofa merrill lynch analyst fair enough thank you jeffrey walker martin chairman ceo thank you julien operator and christopher turnure from jpmorgan has our next question christopher turnure jp morgan chase co research division analyst good afternoon guys just a follow up on the last question joe is there a way that we can think about kind of your own internal processes for evaluating cameron timing and cost and construction versus what the contractors are doing there because i think you re being very deliberate in your message that that is what they re forecasting that s what their latest update points to certainly that was your message at the analyst day too and that was pretty recently that we had a affirmation of the old schedule versus now joseph allan householder president coo look i think that we when i say we let me talk about cameron lng cameron lng is a company it s owned 50 by sempra and 16 6 by the other three equity owners who are our customers cameron lng has people on the ground at the site every day as they have since the start of the construction and they oversee what s going on they re a big engineering team looking at the forecast of the schedule i can tell you that mcdermott has since last year when they took over cb i put a lot of focus and effort on this project and have gotten more deeply into the schedule and the costs over time as you ve seen in their announcements i think that david dickson is very intent on getting this project done he talks to all the partners as well as to cameron lng management we have assessed it we ve had partners engineers assess it we ve had our owner s engineer assess it we think the schedule is one that it seems very reasonable but it s in the hands of the contractor which is chiyoda and mcdermott so it s up to them to predict the schedule and the costs we think that what s laid out there we took that into account when we did our earnings guidance and that s about i d say christopher turnure jp morgan chase co research division analyst okay that s helpful color and then could you just give us a little bit more detail on the latam sale process and kind of how that s progressing next milestones to look for and i guess versus a base case what might move that schedule forward or backward jeffrey walker martin chairman ceo thank you the current sales process is being handled by trevor is our cfo and i ll let trevor address the next milestones trevor i mihalik evp cfo thanks jeff yes we re progressing well on schedule we ve seen robust interest across the board for these businesses and these are great businesses interest has been wide range from financial investors to sovereign and pension funds so we are targeting first round bids by the end of the second quarter and then go into the second round and then we re still targeting close sometime around the end of the year christopher turnure jp morgan chase co research division analyst okay and nothing that could move that forward or backward based on what you re seeing right now trevor i mihalik evp cfo no i think we ve got a pretty formalized process that we re working through and we re still adhering to the schedule that we laid out christopher turnure jp morgan chase co research division analyst okay great thanks trevor trevor i mihalik evp cfo yeah operator our next question will come from michael lapides with goldman sachs michael lapides goldman sachs group inc research division analyst hi jeff hi joe thank you for taking my question real quick if you had to peg which moves forward first is it the cameron expansion so four and five is it the first trains at port arthur or is that the small train at costa azul ph and if so what are the next key milestones we ve got to watch for jeffrey walker martin chairman ceo thank you for that question michael and i ll give some color commentary maybe joe can add into it but i think that the one that has the lead advantage currently as we currently have three heads of agreement at eca phase 1 already fully contracted in all three of those are moving toward having spas in place so just in terms of documentation that when its further along in terms of being 100 contracted and moving toward more definitive agreements i would also say that cameron expansion is something we remain optimistic about you will recall that when total stepped into lngs position they made it very clear to their shareholders that one of the attractive aspects of being in the original cameron partnership was they were committed and interested in seeing the expansion go forward which you may recall was something we were trying to do several years earlier so i think you ve got a lot of sight to the three participants in the expansion and we continue to have a lot of positive work being done there to make sure that the underlying economic support that and then obviously at port arthur we ve got 2 million tons per annum accounted for with our partner from poland we re continuing to have a lot of very positive conversations around port arthur and we think that is a remarkable site for a number of reasons so i think in general one of the things you recall that we did was we did a bottoms up strategic review of our lng business over the last 12 months and came away with you michael that not only is it a core business to sempra and sempra can continue to add value in terms of balance sheet and expertise we really raised our ambitions about what we thought we could accomplish so we re actually feeling quite constructive on all three of those projects michael lapides goldman sachs group inc research division analyst got it and then a question on the settlement in texas any impact meaning the settlement regarding infrareit and sharyland any impact of that settlement on the potential accretion dilution that you discussed when first announced joseph allan householder president coo i would say that we ve gone back and revisited our underlying economics and we feel equally good about how we underwrote that transaction before maybe 30 or 40 days of slippage in and out of when we expect to close but we feel great about the transaction frankly the type of growth that we outlined at the investor conference monthly you recall really had a lot to do with that central and west texas opportunity and the infrareit transaction actually lays into that growth probably even better than we originally thought when we underwrote the deal michael lapides goldman sachs group inc research division analyst got it thank you jeff much appreciated jeffrey walker martin chairman ceo thank you michael operator next we ll go to ryan levine from citi ryan levine citigroup inc research division analyst hi given the recent weakness in global lng do you anticipate any customers so inaudible if not nominator with lng in cameron one after the commissioning phase is complete can you comment on the nomination process now that you re nearing first half ph jeffrey walker martin chairman ceo i don t know if we ll go into kind of how we think about nominations ryan but i think that we do take questions from time to time about whether we see overall contracting model change and based upon our current conversations in the marketplace joe s been on the road i m on the road carlos ruiz ph we ve got our entire management team been over to make sure we were talking to the right folks we still see this as a long term contracting business and our goal as a first step as we move toward fid is making sure that we have high quality customers contracted for 20 years with very strong balance sheet and remember we re really on the infrastructure side of business right so we want to play in the exact same role or very similar to what we are doing at cameron which is a totally model ryan levine citigroup inc research division analyst okay and then on eca with the non fta approval received are there any remaining permits that the company is still looking to procure jeffrey walker martin chairman ceo yeah you raise a great point we ve got the non fta approval to export from the united states to mexico and then to also export from mexico abroad as issued by the department of energy we also in this year got our port arthur approval from ferc i ll let joe comment on what other permits we have in mexico and whether there s any that we re still pursuing joseph allan householder president coo thanks jeff hey ryan yeah really the major permit we got earlier about both the large scale and the mid scale site and then as jeff just mentioned the non fta what we still need to get and we have applied for and we ve done this before is we need our mexican export permit so that s under way the other things are just small local permits around building the site but those come later in the process but the only one that s more significant is this export from mexico we expect no problems with that ryan levine citigroup inc research division analyst thank you jeffrey walker martin chairman ceo thanks ryan operator our next question will come from shahriar pourreza with guggenheim partners jeffrey walker martin chairman ceo hi shahriar constantine lednev guggenheim partners hi good morning it s actually constantine here for shahriar a lot of the questions have been answered just a couple of kind of housekeeping items on the lng development projects now that kind of permitting has been progressing can you talk about how you see kind of the ownership structure is going to be similar to cameron where somebody offtakers might take an equity interest or just how to think about on that going forward jeffrey walker martin chairman ceo yeah thank you for that question i think as we went through our strategic review of our lng business over the last six to eight months we ve also been looking as we move toward an fid decision that eca phase 1 later this year and hopefully an fid decision around port arthur in q1 of next year one of the things we re looking at is how we finance these projects and the potential impacts to our balance sheet but you re on great point as you saw in the cameron facility phase 1 joe articulated this earlier our three partners are each and for just over 16 participation we think it s a great model to align the interests of partners around these large capital projects and to your point we expect that will be a model you ll continue to see us replicate going forward i would say if you went up to one million feet and looked across the portfolio of our lng projects we like to be in that 60 to 70 range of equity ownership in our projects constantine lednev guggenheim partners okay so kind of thinking about it the same way as it s been another just kind of small housekeeping item you mentioned the cost of capital application equity ratio is going to kind of shore up the credit ratings but both from your perspective and i guess what you can reflect on the cpuc some of the downgrades have come not on the heels of just formulaic metrics but also some of the regulatory and kind of legislated kind of structures around there so how are you thinking about that kind of going toward credit metrics jeffrey walker martin chairman ceo well i mean we have spent a lot of time with our credit rating agencies and obviously they re very focused on the process we ve described on this call around making sure that the legislative and regulatory model moves back to standard utility practice and procedure rates you always expect to have your reasonable costs returned plus an additional return on what s on your investments and i think that s what brokers you recall with the this application of the inverse condemnation model is there has been a leakage of utilities ability to recover all the cost that they have incurred so i think it s really a multipart effort you ve got to get back to the right regulatory regime that allows for the type of funding mechanisms to meet the liquidity requirements you ve got to get a improvement to the regulatory model and you ve got to make sure that your return on equity reflects the risk in the marketplace and i ve oftentimes said that your return on equities tend to be a proxy for the regulatory financial and operating risk that you see in the marketplace and that s why we filed our updated roe request as we have constantine lednev guggenheim partners okay i guess it s fair to say that kind of progress on all fronts as what you re targeting jeffrey walker martin chairman ceo yeah that s well said that s right constantine lednev guggenheim partners okay yeah that answers everything to me thanks jeffrey walker martin chairman ceo thank you operator and that does conclude our question and answer session today i d like to turn the call over to jeff martin for closing remarks jeffrey walker martin chairman ceo look i want to thank everyone for taking the time to join us on the call today i would say as we ve had conversations with our management team we actually have a lot of exciting things that we re working on right now and look forward to seeing many of you on the road in the next couple of months and per custom if you have any follow up questions feel free to contact faisel in the ir team have a great day

democratic socialists of america dsa and its two predecessor organizations the democratic socialist organizing committee dsoc and the new american movement nam had their origins in the early 1970s at the beginning of a long term rightward shift of united states and global politics this shift to the right from the 1980s of ronald reagan and margaret thatcher to the 2016 donald trump charade overshadowed the central role these organizations played in the movements of resistance to corporate domination as well as in today s ongoing project organizing an ideological and organizational socialist presence among trade union community feminist and people of color and other activists dsa made an ethical contribution to the broader american left by being one of the few radical organizations born out of a merger rather than a split dsa also helped popularize the vision of a democratic ecumenical multi tendency socialist organization an ethos that enabled it to incorporate many thousands of new members mostly out of the bernie sanders presidential campaign nevertheless it was under the leadership of dsa michael harrington and his groundbreaking the other america 1963 that catalyzed the civil rights movement its leaders and the kennedy administrations to prioritize not only issues of race but equal attention to domestic poverty and inequality this set the stage for martin luther king s poor people s campaign the foundations of democratic socialism have its origins in the eighteenth century and the breakdown of feudal europe specifically england where the medieval guilds and the protection of workers rights was subsequently replaced as a commodity the emergence of capitalism during this period further reinforced the subordination of labor under the domain of capital and the nightmarish results of this priority in the industrial revolution confronting this crisis were religious leaders philosophers and economic reformers arguing that labor creates profit not capital which is the hallmark of democratic socialism and today the dsa the origins of this position can be traced to such reformers as robert owen i argue that owen s model represents the initial development of what today has become known as democratic socialism robert owen and the industrial revolution the negative externalities of the industrial revolution provided the context for a democratic socialist economy movement led by robert owen 1771 1858 and the utopian socialists private property understood as the exclusive right of industrialists was identified as the source of existing exploitation and inequality while the industrial revolution brought about unprecedented wealth only capitalists received the lion s share though labor created massive profits surplus value for the capitalist class labor received a subsistence wage owen and the utopian socialists sought to counter this injustice by opting for labor s democratic ownership of capital and the surplus value they produced the industrial revolution that gathered momentum in eighteenth century europe and the united states created the historical context for democratic socialism utopians argued that private property capital was the source of existing inequalities but the framework of their thought based on conceptions of a preindustrial society is today remote the extensive development of factory production and the social conditions that ensued and the laissez faire interpretation of these events favored by conventional economists created the conditions in which modern socialism was born nonetheless the industrial revolution brought about unprecedented increases in productivity based on the development of factories and the widespread use of machinery the major cost of these innovations was borne by society s least powerful the working class or for all intents and purposes the vast majority of poor in 1750 the working class in europe specifically england and the united states lived near subsistence levels and the purchasing power of wages deteriorated considerably during the second half of the eighteenth century national income grew over this period so that workers relative living standards fell and the potential consumption they involuntarily sacrificed financed the investment required for industrialization had working class incomes kept in step with national income the average worker would have been approximately 50 percent richer in 1840 than thirty years earlier the industrial revolution replaced traditional occupations typically rural farming or guild status as an artisan in various crafts this change resulted from the breakdown of the old feudal societies of europe and the industrialization of those same economies due to mechanistic innovations in the means of production mechanization facilitated the division of labor creating tasks that women and children could perform entire families often worked to achieve subsistence the conditions under which labor was performed were unregulated and dangerous and involved long hours in dehumanizing conditions moreover the growth of factory production stimulated urbanization in europe and the united states as a result roads water sewage waste management public health and provisions for open spaces failed to keep pace with urban migration while housing was concentrated in crowded slums the inevitable result manifested itself in air and water pollution epidemics of typhoid and cholera and widespread respiratory and intestinal disease with a consequent low expectation of life successive administrations in england specifically during the nineteenth century industrial revolution were slow to intervene and remedy social problems and maintain the price of bread and impeded or subverted the development of trade unions within this context it can be asserted that the period of napoleonic war and the subsequent economic crisis constituted the bleakest chapter in british labor history precisely because the foundations of modern industry were erected on the suffering of workers denied access to the fruits of an expanding economy by contrast capitalists enjoyed absolute power over their labor force thus the industrial revolution created the modern working class nominally free but able to live only by selling their labor power suffice it to say britain witnessed a considerable development of radical economic doctrines in the first half of the nineteenth century the radical response owen s prestige was based on his reputation as a businessman an economic theorist and a social reformer from the age of ten he served as a draper s apprentice but at twenty he was the manager of a large cotton factory at new lanark which became renowned throughout britain for its conditions of work owen was a benevolent autocrat who insisted on strict industrial discipline but in combination with living wages a decent work environment abolition of child labor and compulsory education for workers children the profitability of new lanark demonstrated the shortsightedness of other capitalists notion that profit maximization is best achieved through the alienation and exploitation of labor new lanark provided a viable moral counterstrategy to neoliberal market rationality late eighteenth and early nineteenth century industrialization rested on three sets of institutional principles 1 the absolute nature of private property 2 a self regulating laissez faire market economy and 3 the transformation of labor into a commodity while owen accepted industrial innovations he did not agree with the unrestrained rule of private capital self regulating markets and the exploitation of human labor he argued these three economic truths were the ultimate causes of contemporary inequalities and social injustice and thus urged their elimination owen believed that an industrial economy if it is to be moral must be created based on the principles that every person must be treated with dignity and the proceeds of production were divided equitably the operation of any economy was then to be criticized and evaluated according to such principles owen believed that a more just and efficient economy should be focused on his experimental model at new lanark thus owen s political economy was based on three important radical tenants the first tenant is based on what owen described as an economy of high wages owen held the view that a wage increase or higher labor costs leads to 1 an improvement in the living standards of workers 2 which then leads to greater efficiency and production by workers in other words increased wages generate additional revenue for both company and workers yet owen s theory conflicted with the prevailing orthodoxy which argued that any wage increase occurred at the expense of profits and hence led to a diminution in employment and economic activity nevertheless by extending the economy of high wages from an individual firm to the nation owen embraced an embryonic under consumption theory of depressions he advocated a high wage policy that maintained purchasing power as a cure for unemployment and promotion of economic growth the second tenant on which owen based his political economy was a belief that an individualistic economy is inequitable irrational and antisocial moreover private ownership is an institution whereby one class gains power over the rest in order to maximize profits in contrast owen did not attack industry or new technology as it manifested itself in the burgeoning industrial revolution rather he denounced private ownership of the means of production the spread of unfettered and unregulated economic competition and elements of narcissistic individualism propagated through enlightenment liberalism owen argued to the contrary that private ownership and unrestrained competition destroys social cohesion furthermore he argued that individuals by themselves cannot simply improve their own lot in life rather it was within the context of a community and its many support networks that the betterment of individuals was realized the third tenant is based on owen s labor theory of value premised upon the priority of labor he viewed human labor as the natural standard of value and that this concept required capital and machinery to become the servant of labor owen believed that capital and profit are designed to serve the human person and community as its first moral priority public policy and not the market should determine the amount of labor expended on commodities and workers ought to be compensated based on both human needs and effort owen argued for economic cooperation rather than competition through a network of self governing communes where private ownership of the means of production was transformed into a democratic alliance eliminating any labor ownership conflict owen argued that capital and profit should never come at the expense of labor owen as social reformer owen s career as a national reformer can be understood in different stages between the publication of towards a new view of society in 1813 and a report to the county of lanark in 1821 he concentrated on ameliorating existing social problems such as poverty child labor inhumane work hours and unemployment he thought that these social injustices could be avoided if other manufacturers replicated new lanark on grounds of enlightened self interest indeed his arguments applied to capitalists more concerned with long term profitability than with immediate gains but he found that his appeals met with little response he then attempted to persuade government to alleviate poverty and inequality and was popular in official circles after 1815 only by virtue of the fact that he focused on the importance of environmental improvements more than his personal brand of socialism as he advanced beyond the role of wealthy philanthropist to structural reforms that threatened the establishment power centers he became decreasingly influential in elite circles between 1824 1835 owen established what he described as communist communities the cities of orbiston near glasgow tytherley in hampshire and new harmony in indiana were three of the most prominent the aim was to settle unemployed laborers on the land in self governed villages of unity and cooperation such schemes reflected his conviction that society as then constituted would permit cooperatives to supplant existing institutional structures owen did this by attempting to persuade the rich and influential about his ideas for social and economic transformation nevertheless the owenite settlements were challenged partly because of the hostile external environment of the business community and the agricultural depression which generated an influx of unemployed workers which exceeded capacity consequently an excess supply of labor to the villages of cooperation proved counterproductive to the communist communities yet not insurmountable owen persisted in his collectivist experimentations in 1824 the london co operative society was formed as a store for cooperative trading designed to supersede competitive distribution and allow craftsmen to exchange goods without capitalist intermediaries it aimed to sell at trade prices and use the savings accumulated through elimination of retailers profits to financially bolster socialist communities the next envisaged stage of development involved members cooperation to produce directly for each other rather than choosing between capitalist goods sold in their stores for example the london society opened an exchange bazaar for societies and individuals to engage in mutual exchange owen returned from the united states in 1829 after establishing more than three hundred cooperative societies in the united states and england this figure rose to almost five hundred by 1832 although many pursued solely educational objectives cooperative stores bought wholesale and sold retail the commodities demanded by their members but cooperative producers faced the difficult problem of obtaining a market for all their products this problem stimulated development of labor exchanges where workmen and producers cooperatives could exchange products directly and thus dispense with both employers and merchants the most important such institution the national equitable labor exchange was established by owen in 1832 and stimulated the formation of similar exchanges in provincial cities they sought to secure a wider market for cooperative groups and to enable them to exchange their products at an equitable valuation resting on labor time owen appointed trade union valuers to price goods on the basis of the cost of raw materials plus the amount of labor time expended on them a new currency of labor notes was issued for the conduct of transactions crucial weaknesses emerged however labor and commercial prices coexisted goods the exchanges offered more cheaply were soon disposed of while the more expensive remained unsold exchanges would not control their stocks to demand levels and movements in the manner of capitalist retailers since they had to take what members brought them consequently they became overstocked where there were many cooperative producers and understocked in trades where there were few in particular their supplies were concentrated on goods that could be produced by craftsmen possessing little capital despite this major weakness they enjoyed considerable success for a time but collapsed in the general crash of the movement in 1834 even then some exchanges balanced their books while the national equitable labor exchange incurred a heavy debt which then fell to owen when owen returned to england in 1829 he found that a trade union movement had emerged after the repeal of the combination acts in 1824 and in 1829 he witnessed the formation of the first modern national union the operative spinners while this was happening the next two years saw much social unrest in the form of agricultural riots and a wave of strike activity in the northern textile towns as a means of achieving the eight hour workday then by 1832 several distinct but related bodies such as the owenite societies cooperative stores cooperative producers labor exchange and trade unions looked to owen for leadership most were growing rapidly as workers disillusioned by the terms of the 1832 reform act swung away from political mobilization toward organized labor action owen sought the fusion of these groups into one national organization centrally directed and under worker control which would challenge and transform economic relations through its practice of cooperative production by 1833 the operative builders union was the largest in the country with a membership of sixty thousand the obu adopted an owenite agenda to take over the construction industry and reorganize it as a national guild to implement this program none of its members would work for capitalist builders who refused to join the guild the owners attempted to destroy the obu by a lockout by forcing those reemployed to sign a document i e a written pledge not to join a union which gives the employer the right to fire them if they violate the pledge the workers lost as the obu simultaneously fought the lockout and attempted to launch the guild with inadequate financial resources its members were then forced back to work by various regions during 1834 and by the end of that year the obu ceased to exist it split into craft sections with a greatly reduced membership owen nevertheless sought to unite all the associations intended for the improvement of the working class to this end he inspired the formation of the grand national consolidated trades union or gnctu which was intended to be a single inclusive union aiming to supersede capitalism by a cooperative system based on workers control of production it sought to implement on an economy wide basis a plan similar to the obu guild for construction ultimately the gnctu would control through its constituent members all industry thereby taking over the functions of capitalists parliament and local government it would become the locus of economic and ultimately political power the gnctu s formation was followed by feverish organization by discounting cooperative retail and producer societies unions alone attracted over one million members as with the obu owners reacted to the gnctu by presenting the document to workers with the threat of a lockout if not signed this response originated in derby it was imitated in other towns but derby remained the test struggle the workers lost being forced back to work after a lockout lasting four months given the repeal of the combination acts the case was pursued under the 1797 naval mutinies act which was never intended to apply to trade unions nonetheless this opportunity for the government to deter union organization arose because many unions adopted secret initiation ceremonies under the threat of employer retaliation as a result the gnctu encountered severe administrative problems the recruits it made and the disputes it faced were so abundant that urgent problems of management were inevitably ignored internal disention developed and owen became disillusioned he hoped to initiate bloodless revolution by providing examples of the benefits derived from cooperation accordingly he dissolved the gnctu in august 1834 arguing for a return to education and the need for an ethical appeal in preference to coercion the gnctu faded away but some of its constituent groups and elements of its cooperative ideology remained owen returned to establishing villages of cooperation e g queenswood in 1839 and in 1844 the rochdale pioneers cooperative society developed from a local owenite body however after 1834 the thrust of working class agitation moved from industrial to political arenas focusing on the demands of the chartists the grand national consolidated trades union was undoubtedly a failure in its implementation yet it was attempting an impossible task that no leadership could have achieved this is because trade unions were still learning the art of organizing into a cohesive effective unit at the time workers were only able to accomplish sporadic results from organizing into unions and cooperatives however they were unable to achieve any sustained action by contrast having just won a significant political victory in the 1832 reform act factory owners and burgeoning industrialists were determined in their resolve to counter any form of organized labor movement or cooperative based industry they also possessed the support of a whig government determined to show that the reform act would not destroy property rights against such power workers were poorly paid uneducated and only beginning to understand the importance to organized efforts to seek improved working conditions and living wage salaries although owen s innovations beyond the sphere of new lanark failed during his lifetime he left an enduring legacy to the future of radical theory the influence of owen s would be 1 he established a personal example of one who cast aside his personal wealth in an endeavor to secure a more just future for others 2 the economic measures at new lanark illustrated that a policy of high wages and improved conditions need not destroy profitability 3 many of owen s theoretical innovations e g labor value to replace money as an equitable labor exchange are not inherently impractical 4 his theories of and attempts to establish workers cooperatives made owen the instigator of a significant movement of later times as developments from the rochdale pioneers of 1844 demonstrate and 5 owen s appreciation of the role of trade unions in replacing individual worker motivations by collective policy provided a clue to improving quantitative and qualitative living standards and also pointed to a force that could potentially be harnessed for achieving a future transformation of just and productive economic relations owen s approach to resolving economic injustice epitomized the utopian approach to resolving exploitation he hoped for individual conversion then government action yet this was an unrealistic ambition given the existing power structure at the time what owen lacked was a theory of class struggle believing instead that the transition to socialism or a more democratic economy would occur through the influence of reason and persuasion nevertheless owen s worker co operatives represent what is arguably the initial stages of democratic socialism to legacy of fdr michael harrington and the democratic socialists of america urged the same owenite plan for a more just economy and society notes marx in capital discusses the expropriation of agricultural land from the poor who are dependent on that very land for their basic needs the historical context of the enclosure movement was based on a policy measure initiated by the aristocracy and wealthy land owners in eighteenth and nineteenth century england the movement was aimed at confiscating land that was owned in common by a village or at least available to the village for grazing animals and growing food the enclosure movement was designed to expropriate village land and redistribute it to the aristocracy and wealthy for their ownership in 1845 british parliament passed the enclosure act of 1845 in which the british government started enclosing land walls fences or hedges and awarding this land to the aristocracy and wealthy land owners who arguably knew how to make more efficient use of it the consequence for the people who were using this land was often eviction sending many of them to slums in the cities in hopes of finding work in low paying jobs such as factory work spawned by the industrial revolution the most well known enclosure movements were in the british isles but the practice had its roots in the netherlands and caught on to some degree throughout northern europe and elsewhere as industrialization spread

to gary gary s michel chief executive officer thanks karina good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today this morning we announced first quarter results in line with our expectations delivering revenue and adjusted ebitda growth of 6 8 and 3 2 respectively despite facing anticipated headwinds from market growth rates shifts in mix and foreign exchange i m pleased with how our associates executed during the first quarter to reinvigorate growth deliver productivity and implement our facility rationalization and modernization plan we realized price in excess of cost inflation and delivered net cost productivity savings through deployment of our jeld wen excellence model we introduced new and innovative products to the market and deployed capital through opportunistic share repurchases and m a jeld wen is on track to deliver revenue growth and accelerate core margin expansion as we progress through the remainder of 2019 similar to last quarter our volume mix challenges were largely isolated through our u s windows canadian and australasian businesses however the impact of volume in these businesses was further aggravated by pockets of softer new construction demand and extreme winter weather despite these headwinds to our growth and profitability we maintain core adjusted ebitda margins in line with the first quarter of 2018 by remaining disciplined in our pricing strategy aggressively controlling costs and driving productivity throughout the enterprise as mentioned overall price cost was a tailwind in the quarter we realized a 4 pricing benefit in north america representing the highest rate of price realization in several years in north america improved pricing and cost management drove a 40 basis point increase in core margin while positive net productivity in both europe and australasia partially offset raw material inflation and volume mix headwinds during the quarter we announced and closed the acquisition of vpi quality windows supplementing jeld wen s existing organic growth initiatives by providing a platform for profitable growth in the mid rise multifamily and commercial market segments more on vpi shortly we also made good progress on our footprint rationalization and modernization plan executing projects across all 3 of our geographic segments during the first quarter as we previously communicated we re on track to realize savings from these projects beginning in the back half of 2019 on our way to our longer term targeted savings of 100 million given our trajectory in the first quarter and the visibility to core margin drivers for the remainder of the year i remain confident that we ll achieve our full year guidance please turn to page 5 for a brief summary of our financial results for the first quarter john will provide a more detailed view shortly but let me hit a few highlights net revenues for the quarter increased by 6 8 year over year driven primarily by a 12 contribution from acquisitions partially offset by a 4 impact from foreign exchange and a 1 decrease in core revenue net income decreased by 23 7 million to 16 6 million due to the nonrecurrence of onetime benefits in the first quarter of 2018 adjusted ebitda increased by 2 8 million during the quarter to 90 6 million in line with our expectations adjusted ebitda margins declined by 30 basis points year over year to 9 due to the dilutive impact of recent acquisitions and unfavorable foreign exchange offset by 40 basis points of core margin expansion in north america and flat core margins on a consolidated basis additionally operating cash flow improved by 37 3 million year over year through improved working capital utilization net leverage at quarter end was approximately 3 2x temporarily above our target range due to the acquisition of vpi and seasonal working capital build we repurchased approximately 940 000 shares during the quarter for 15 million we re intently focused on driving growth and margin expansion in our core operations and will remain disciplined by investing in high return organic projects like our rationalization and modernization programs and new product development on page 6 i m excited to introduce a number of new products we launched from around the world during the first quarter each of these products offer unique and innovative solutions including improved aesthetics and enhanced functionality creating greater value for the homeowner and reducing time to install for builders and contractors a few examples our new finishield technology for vinyl windows provides an exterior finish with improved energy control durability and consistency unmatched by traditional paint in australia we re extending our recent alumiere window series with new features and options to achieve a retro mix the siteline panoramic gliding door received a bimsmith best award at the international builders show it addresses the rising consumer demand for larger daylight openings our proprietary door operation technology bridges the price and performance gap between standard patio doors and entry level wall systems for the most part these products expand jeld wen s existing product offerings and will deliver incremental revenue and margin expansion over time there are more innovations to come and i look forward to sharing them with you in the coming quarters please turn the page 7 in addition to innovation we continue to invest in capabilities to further enhance our growth and reach we re pleased to welcome the engaged associates of vpi quality windows to the jeld wen family vpi s premier brand and product offering serving the mid rise multifamily and commercial markets coupled with jeld wen s national distribution footprint will provide meaningful revenue synergies significant growth potential exists in vpi s traditional west coast end markets and we believe that vpi s superior product performance and overall value proposition including near perfect historical on site water intrusion test results position these products for broad acceptance across north america the acquisition closed on march 29 and integration is progressing as planned before turning it over to john i ll provide a brief update on our end market outlook for 2019 in north america the first quarter played out as anticipated with softness in residential new construction driven by a slowdown in key housing indicators in late 2018 and offset by healthy demand in repair and remodel markets in europe we saw mixed results across our regional operating units in both new construction and repair and remodel end markets in australasia softening residential new construction markets driven primarily by tightening credit standards were partially offset by relative strength in repair and remodel for the remainder of the year we anticipate a modest acceleration in new construction demand in north america weighted toward the second half of the year many key influencers of residential new construction and repair and remodel demand have improved including mortgage rates home price appreciation wage rate growth employment and the age of existing housing stock we also believe that growth in household formations in excess of recent new construction activity sets the stage for sustained housing growth in the united states for europe we anticipate continued mix results that differ by product line channel and geography varying rates of economic growth across europe are likely to persist leading to mix demand for building products brexit remains an overhang with uncertain economic consequences in australasia we anticipate a further deterioration in residential new construction in the second half of the year due in large part to tightened credit standards partially offset by stable repair and remodel activity with that i ll turn it over to john linker to provide a detailed view of our financial results for the first quarter of 2019 john linker chief financial officer thanks gary and good morning everyone i ll start on slide 10 for the first quarter net revenues increased 6 8 to 1 0 billion the increase was driven primarily by the 12 contribution of our recent acquisitions partially offset by a 4 headwind from foreign currency and a 1 decrease in core revenues we reported net income of 16 6 million for the first quarter a decrease of 23 7 million versus prior year the decrease in net income was primarily driven by the nonrecurrence of a 20 8 million nonoperational gain and related 7 1 million tax benefit recognized in the prior year on shares held of a minority equity investment our effective tax rate was 38 4 in the first quarter an increase compared to prior year as well as higher than our expectations for the quarter and full year of 33 to 36 excluding the impact of the gilti provision of u s tax reform our normalized tax rate in the first quarter would have been approximately 30 diluted earnings per share was 0 16 a decrease of 0 21 compared to prior year due to the same drivers i mentioned impacting net income partially offset by a lower share count adjusted diluted earnings per share was 0 23 adjusted ebitda increased 3 2 to 90 6 million adjusted ebitda margins declined by 30 basis points in the quarter to 9 year over year consolidated ebitda margins declined due to the impact of foreign exchange and recent acquisitions however we did see sequential improvements in many areas of our business core ebitda margins excluding the impact of fx and m a were unchanged compared to prior year core margins improved in north america for the second consecutive quarter while europe core margins decreased primarily due to inflation slide 11 provides a detail of our revenue drivers for the quarter our consolidated core revenues decreased 1 in the first quarter we realized positive price of 2 that was offset by a 3 decline in volume and mix total revenue was up 6 8 primarily coming from our recent acquisitions we saw positive price realization across all of our segments for the first time since the second quarter of 2018 please move to slide 12 where i ll take you through the segment detail beginning with north america net revenues in north america for the first quarter increased 13 6 primarily due to a 15 contribution from the acquisition of abs core revenues declined by 1 comprised of a 4 pricing benefit which did not fully offset unfavorable volume mix north america volume headwinds continue to be the most pronounced in our windows and canada businesses while our door business saw volume growth in retail and company owned distribution partially offset by weaker performance in traditional distribution which was also a headwind to mix adjusted ebitda in north america increased by 13 8 to 53 5 million adjusted ebitda margins expanded 10 basis points to 9 5 a sequential improvement from the 10 basis points decrease in the fourth quarter of last year north america generated core adjusted ebitda margin expansion of 40 basis points that was mostly offset by the dilutive impact of the abs acquisition this is the second consecutive quarter of year over year core margin improvement in north america moving on to slide 13 net revenues in europe for the first quarter decreased slightly by 0 6 the decrease in net revenues was driven primarily by foreign currency the domoferm acquisition contributed 7 to segment net revenue that was more than offset by 8 headwind from foreign exchange excluding this impact from currency and acquisitions europe generated core revenue growth of 1 primarily from improved pricing adjusted ebitda in europe decreased 16 7 or 28 2 million adjusted ebitda margins decreased 180 basis points to 9 4 margins were impacted by 50 basis points of core margin compression primarily from inflation as well as the dilution from the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange and the domoferm acquisition on slide 14 net revenues in australasia for the first quarter decreased 0 9 the a l windows acquisitions contributed 10 to net revenues but was not enough to offset the impact from the combination of foreign exchange and market factors that resulted in lower volumes core revenues declined 2 primarily to the unfavorable volume mix impact of the continued softening of the australia residential new construction housing market we were pleased to see positive price benefit in australasia in the first quarter as this is an improvement from the previous quarter adjusted ebitda in australasia decreased 1 9 to 16 4 million adjusted ebitda margins contracted by 10 basis points to 11 3 due primarily to unfavorable foreign exchange core adjusted ebitda margins were flat in the first quarter as net cost productivity was offset by the deleveraging impact of unfavorable volume mix on page 15 cash flow from operations improved 37 3 million in the first quarter of 2019 to a use of 28 0 million from a use of 65 3 million in the same period a year ago we improved operating cash flow through more efficient working capital utilization our cash flow performance was in line with our expectations as a reminder our first quarter operating cash flows are typically negative due to the seasonality of our working capital cycle our capital expenditures increased 4 5 million in the first quarter compared to prior year the increase was in line with our expectations and outlook for the full year on the balance sheet we ended the first quarter with total net debt of 1 48 billion an increase of 118 million since december 31 2018 the increase in our net debt was driven primarily by the cash used to fund the vpi acquisition we closed during the first quarter and our seasonal operating cash flow usage our net leverage ratio was 3 2x at the upper end of our target range up from 2 9x at year end 2018 our balance sheet remains strong and our capital structure liquidity and free cash flow generation will provide us with the flexibility to reduce our net leverage ratio over time and fund our strategic initiatives now before turning it back to gary i ll comment on why we are well positioned to deliver on our commitment in 2019 we executed to our plan in the first quarter amid the challenging market backdrop the new construction housing market continues to provide mixed signals across our global end markets and while we feel good about the long term demand drivers in these market we have positioned ourselves to stay ahead of these near term challenges by aggressively managing our cost structure we expect core adjusted ebitda margin to accelerate in the second half of the year as a result of our already completed pricing actions improving but modest increases in volume mix our pipeline of jem productivity projects and our footprint rationalization program we have good visibility to each of these earnings drivers and therefore i believe we are well positioned to deliver on our 2019 commitments now i d like to turn it back over to gary to go through our latest 2019 outlook and provide you with closing comments gary s michel chief executive officer thank you john please turn to page 17 we maintain our original expectations for 2019 of consolidated revenue growth of 1 to 5 including the partial year contribution from our vpi acquisition core revenue growth will be driven by pricing actions and modest volume growth in north america in the second half of the year partially offset by moderate new construction contraction in australasia we ve increased the lower end of our outlook range for adjusted ebitda so that the range is now 475 million to 505 million which reflects the partial year contribution from the recent vpi acquisition for the remainder of the year we also reaffirm our original expectations for a full year core margin improvement of at least 40 basis points we estimate that we will generate approximately 27 of our full year adjusted ebitda in the second quarter year over year earnings growth in the second quarter will be limited by unfavorable foreign exchange and incremental sg a investments which are specific to the second quarter and not expected to recur in the remainder of the year finally i ll note that we ve had no significant updates on the steves litigation since our last call in february and due to the ongoing nature of the proceedings we will not be able to take any questions on this topic during the q a session with that i d like to open up the call for q a operator questions and answers operator operator instructions your first question comes from the line of truman patterson from wells fargo your line is open truman patterson wells fargo analyst hi good morning guys nice quarter just wanted to dig in to north america on the negative volume and product mix you guys mentioned that windows canada and weather were a bit of a headwind i thought windows it started to turn the corner could you guys just give us an update into what it ll take to turn the volume and mix from a headwind to a tailwind and if you re seeing any improvement post first quarter gary s michel chief executive officer thanks tru for the question yes so north america is slightly down on core volumes we saw it s hard to quantify the weather obviously but if you were to take out kind of that period of harsh winter weather the areas where we serve we would have seen growth we clearly would have seen growth in the quarter which is encouraging on the windows side it does take some time to win back that business we re seeing some real positive response to our windows business number one all the operational issues are well behind us so that s been a benefit for us as well as the products that we ve launched in that area some that we talked about this morning as well as the ones that we ve launched in the siteline area over the last call 1 5 years so we re starting to see some real positive movement there unfortunately it takes time for these projects to come to fruition plus to win back some of the shares that we ve lost we re feeling pretty good about it we like our chances and what we re hearing from customers is very very positive so i think the mix of good products good operational performance and the strong relations that we have in the channel will start to pay of for us here in the remainder of the year truman patterson wells fargo analyst okay okay looking at your jeld wen efficiency model initiatives the jem initiatives of 100 million in 2022 how should we think about the cadence of this unfolding is it pretty evenly each year and if so could you just give a little bit of an update on north america as i didn t see anything in the press release that there s much productivity gains in the first quarter at all gary s michel chief executive officer so the way we ve laid it out is we re still on track to see some benefit kind of in that 10 million range still in 2019 from the rationalization modernization program jem is a set of tools that we re deploying across the enterprise not just north america but across all of jeld wen these tools very some very basic around problem solving visual management and the like developing a cadence toward our productivity pipeline and the way that we measure that and each door that we program and manage each one of those we like where we are on the rationalization program during the quarter we ve started to see some movement there we ve made some moves already in some of the smaller plans but the way that it kind of lays out is early on we developed standard work we take that standard work and we deploy that across the businesses and then we start the consolidation and rationalization because of the issues that we had last 12 18 months ago we wanted to be overly cautious before we close down facilities or rationalize facilities we want to make sure that we have the new facilities up and running and capable of meeting production so that we don t risk any customer disruption we ve done that very very effectively like i said i feel really good with what the teams have done so far and we re on track to do that as you think about it going forward clearly maybe we re going a little bit slow to go fast later we ll start to see that accelerate accelerated benefit from both jem and the rationalization programs kind of starting next year and into the future we re still committed to the 100 million from our jem programs a 100 million from the rationalization and modernization programs moving toward that 50 ebitda target truman patterson wells fargo analyst okay so the jem initiatives kind of have a longer tail to them similar to the footprint rationalization are there any near term gains that you might be able to discuss with us john linker chief financial officer so truman let me just amplify a little bit so as gary mentioned couple calls ago we laid out 100 million target for the blocking and tackling jem initiative that s in the core plans that aren t being rationalized and then 100 million for the footprint rationalization program yes we mentioned in the first quarter yes there wasn t a lot of talk in the materials about productivity in north america and that s true i mean in a 5 headwind to volume mix it is difficult to extract a lot of labor productivity and so definitely in the first quarter europe and australasia performed better on the cost productivity side in terms of the phasing of kind of the productivity for north america and globally for the back half of the year yes we ve got good visibility from sort of a pipeline of projects that build up and go throughout the year both on the sourcing side in terms of material sourcing as well as in the core plans due to some automation investments we ve made and things like that so yes i think it s fair to say that there s good visibility to improving productivity in north america in the back half of the year it s not 1 or 2 big projects that s it s a lot of smaller initiatives that add up to that pipeline and give us visibility operator your next question comes from the line of tim wojs from baird your line is open tim wojs baird analyst hey guys good morning nice job maybe just gary maybe just to start off on price cost just given the stronger realization in the u s that you saw there may be some moderation in things like steel any change to how you re viewing price cost overall for the overall company for the year and then i guess if you look at europe and you look at australia is there any opportunities to accelerate the pricing there or is it just going to be tougher with the tougher volume backdrop john linker chief financial officer tim thank you so let s take the cost side of the equation first i would say as we look at sort of the full year we re still viewing inflation in both material and freight we do see some areas that should be on a year over year basis start to get a little bit more favorable particularly in europe there s some opportunities to start seeing some lower inflation so if i think about sort of where the material and freight inflation is across the globe right now certainly the highest is still in north america and europe and australia are sort of on the lower end so from where we sit today i would say material and freight inflation in the 1 5 1 to 1 5 for the full year we re not going to forecast price for the full year but it s fair to say based of the actions that we ve taken we would expect that the same type of price cost tailwind from the first quarter to continuing into the back half of the year on the pricing side specifically while we have most of the actions behind us in north america there s a in europe there s a few areas of our business that kind of contractually have april 1 effective dates on price increases and so we would start to see some of that inflation that hit us on margins in q1 in europe we would expect to start to see some relief from that as we get some price increases through in the effective april 1 in europe tim wojs baird analyst okay okay that s helpful and then as we think about just how the quarter may have turned in this might be more of a north america specific question but how did you see trends kind of through the quarter into q1 and then any commentary on how april s performed so far john linker chief financial officer yes i think largely the quarter played out as we expected from a in the first quarter in north america i mean yes we kind of newly had some volume headwinds going into the quarter in windows as we talked about in the last call that was not a trend we thought we could turn around in the in 1 quarter i think certainly the unexpected items were the weather piece of it i mean winter weather is always initially in q1 but this year it was extreme we had canada shutdown for a number of days some of our retail partners in north america were slower to take orders due to weather and even in europe we had in austria some pretty severe weather that shut us down for a couple of days so there were some surprises but that s part of the course that we got to execute around i d say as we start to think about q2 and where we are heading in the quarter without getting too specific on q2 volume trends i mean i think we re sort of we re certainly cautiously optimistic that we re going to see some see the trend turnaround in the second half of the year but probably still some of those volume mix headwinds are going to be with us during q2 as well tim wojs baird analyst okay okay great well thanks for the color and the time and i can look on q2 thanks john operator your next question comes from the line of michael rehaut from jpmorgan your line is open elad hillman jp morgan analyst this is elad on for mike i just wanted to look a little bit close on north america volume mix which is down 5 and you ve talked a little bit around the volume impact i was wondering how much of that relates to volume and mix and really take deeper in the mix issue i think you spoke about the mix shift continuing to lower margin retail business i was just wondering if that s accelerating and any actions you re looking to take to offset this headwind or bridge the gap between the retailer versus traditional business margins in doors gary s michel chief executive officer yes so as john said earlier with primarily where we got affected in and some of the softness in the first quarter was in kind of our what we call our traditional channel with the move toward the retail business there are kind of proxies a little bit as well for new home construction versus repair and replace so the repair and replace business and that retail proxy for that continue to be relatively strong and that s where we ve seen the kind of volume mix change we do expect as we said in the comments looking forward to the second half of the year residential new construction in that traditional channel really starting to pick back up and we expect to see that beat some favorable growth as well as creating some favorable mix for us elad hillman jp morgan analyst thanks that s helpful and then also on the progress from the footprint rationalization and understanding the considerable approach to start and also point to savings in the second half of 19 i just wanted to confirm if you re still on track to that 10 million to 15 million given the timing of how things are progressing gary s michel chief executive officer yes absolutely we re still on track we ve made some smaller location closures during the first quarter really across the entire enterprise in all 3 regions we re still on track the savings within the year will still happen the only difference between that in that range is really not that the projects aren t coming to fruition it s really just more about how fast we feel about taking out latent capacity so the projects are really solid we feel really really good about them well on our way on longer term track as well on the rationalization so still committed to making that happen elad hillman jp morgan analyst great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of reuben garner from seaport global securities your line is open reuben garner seaport global securities analyst thanks good morning everybody so you updated your ebitda range it looked like the revenue was the same can you go through the buckets of your revenue outlook maybe what s changed over the last few months and i guess walk through what your expectations are for volume price mix fx if you could john linker chief financial officer sure so yes we did roll in the acquisition of vpi which we get about 9 months of we had our revenue range was for the full year was 1 to 5 and given just how early in the year we are and just the relative small size of the vpi acquisition did not see a catalyst to move that 1 to 5 range in terms of revenue certainly i guess the big piece of the overall 1 to 5 is coming from the acquisition that we did last year so we had 1 quarter that we now anniversaried for abs a l and domoferm acquisitions which all contributed to first quarter and now we ll get a little bit here from vpi this year so that s certainly a big piece of the revenue growth we do have a fairly significant headwind from fx on the top line and the bottom line primarily weighted toward the first 2 quarters of the year fx i would say is probably in the range of a 2 plus headwind to revenue and so that would certainly be a drag in that 1 to 5 and then the remainder would be just the core revenue growth so we re negative here in the first quarter on core revenue by minus 1 and so we would expect to see that accelerate as we get into the back half of the year and as we progress and give you we ll get more visibility on kind of the pipeline and demand the next few quarters we ll certainly update the revenue guidance as it s merited and as we get closer reuben garner seaport global securities analyst okay and then your core ebitda margin expansion target for this year can you help us with maybe how it s going to look on the gross margin or and or the sg a line what s your expectations are for the next few quarters john linker chief financial officer sure so we mentioned in the comments that we reaffirmed the 40 basis points of core ebitda margin expansion in the full year again on a consolidated basis we ve got a headwind from fx and a headwind from some of the m a that we lapped in the first quarter that was dilutive so not all of that 40 bps drops to the bottom line i would say that the vast majority of that 40 basis points is going to be on the cost of goods sold gross profit side on the core business the price cost and the productivity we do have some investments that we re making in the business on it side and some other areas they re going to be a bit of a headwind to sg a but certainly i would put most of that 40 basis points as core margin on the gross margin line operator your next question comes from the line of matthew bouley from barclays your line is open matthew bouley barclays analyst good morning thank you for taking my questions i wanted to start out with a question on vpi it sounded like you re calling for revenue synergies i guess one are there cost synergies as well that you d be able to quantify and two just kind of more broadly i think you mentioned that vpi might be more of a platform for you in the multifamily commercial window space so just kind of any thoughts on how you guys would be thinking about further m a in that market gary s michel chief executive officer yes thanks for the question we really like what we saw at vpi the product portfolio their capabilities in that multifamily commercial space really really strong but they re very much indexed and most of their success has been in the on the west coast and even to that extent somewhat on the upper west we thought that they started some other expansion and toward the east with some really strong customer relationships and we thought that with our we do believe with our distribution their product and expertise in that area it s just a great match for us on the revenue side and the growth side it s an area that we ve been playing in and one that we had targeted for further expansion and growth so it just was a great match there for revenue on the cost side clearly there s commodities that we share and we re already starting to see some benefits from combining our their buy with what we already buy at jeld wen and seeing some commodity opportunities there as well so really good kind of down in the middle of the fairway type of acquisition one that expands our capabilities in commercial multifamily which is obviously a growing area in the market space and it combines the best of both companies matthew bouley barclays analyst all right thank you for that gary and then i wanted to ask about europe even highlighting this kind of negative mix shift for a couple quarters here sounded like channel and product mix so just any additional detail on what s playing out there if that s going to kind of persist here into the second quarter or if there s any other actions you might need to take around that gary s michel chief executive officer yes i think when you look at it it s kind of mixed results depending on the regions some up some down a little bit of mix between project business and our commercial and residential business so we re watching all of that very closely obviously watching the cost side of the equation as well operationally we re doing well in europe our products are well accepted we ve got some price there but we also have to be cautious that we manage that price in light of where the volumes are coming i know that we ve gone very specifically on what s up what s down but we re seeing our traditionally strong north business doing pretty well central europe s now seen a little bit of softness and of course the overhang from brexit continues particularly as we look at that repair and replace business in the u k matthew bouley barclays analyst right thanks for the detail operator the next question comes from the line of michael dahl from rbc capital markets your line is open mike dahl good morning actually mike eisen on for rbc following up on some of the commentary you both talked a good deal amount about 1q being in line with what you expected specifically in north america when i m thinking about the prior guide you gave core growth of 3 to 4 can you help us bridge the gap for the rest of the year and help us think of is there anything that you see coming whether it d be new business wins or reloading in some of the channels what s going on that helps you give you confidence in such a step up for rest of the year john linker chief financial officer mike good morning sure so i think as thinking about the core growth we ll have to follow up with you off line on that 3 to 4 core i don t recall that commentary for the full year i think 1 to 5 on a consolidated revenue basis is certainly what we re maintaining on a full year as we think about growth rates in north america specifically we ve got i think the windows business from gary already mentioned a lot of investment on the front end commercial side on trying to regain share and build a pipeline and as we looked at sort of what s in our pipeline both on the door and window side relative to both our external expectations as well as relative to the comps that we have to perform against in the back half of the year we feel good that we ll start to see some core volume in the back half and then again pricing we ve already taken those actions which contributes to the core revenue growth and feel like that s pretty known at this point based off what we ve already put in place and so that gives us some visibility to that core revenue negative 1 we had in the first quarter starting to improve probably in the q3 q4 time frame mike dahl got it that s helpful and then following up you had some commentary in the prepared remarks about different demand trends in your different end markets and distribution channels can you help us think about where you think inventory levels are across those different channels we ve heard a lot of commentaries over the last couple of weeks about destocking in certain channels and whether you think there s anything nuanced about it that could cause a better reaction or rebound as we look forward gary s michel chief executive officer i think from where we stand i don t know that there s been destocking from where we stand yes for most mostly what we re saying is pretty adequate inventory levels we re pretty well stocked going into the season certainly compared to where we would have been in past seasons that s been one of the knocks that got us into trouble so we re certainly prepared our channel partners seem to be prepared as we look at the indicators that we talked about before repair and replace particularly here in north america has remained to be a pretty strong business and one that we ve been able to benefit from the residential new construction while it s been a little bit choppy since fourth quarter and in the first quarter we do see those indicators trending positive and i think that ll be pulled through primarily through our traditional channel so i think we re adequately positioned with our channel partners i think we ll see kind of more direct revenue in line with those market dynamics mike dahl appreciate all the insight thank you operator your next question comes from the line of phil ng from jefferies your line is open phil ng jefferies analyst hey guys obviously impossible to predict but there s potentially a threat of new tariffs being implemented by the end of the week when you needed to implement additional price increases how confident are you with your guidance for i believe at least mutual price cost and how quickly could that impact your p l if this does tick john linker chief financial officer thanks good morning phil yes let s try when we gave guidance back in february for the full year we anticipated there would be some step up in tariffs later in the year obviously impossible to predict in this environment sort of exactly when and how much i would say at this point we have we took some pricing actions earlier in the year as noted we also the supply side have already started to look at alternative sources to supply outside of china for our spend prior for 2018 we were in the range of around 110 million purchases of raw materials from china and we really had already started to look to mitigate that through other solutions so i would say we re aware of what may go through on friday we re updating our guidance as of today at this point i feel like even if this 10 if the 25 goes through effective friday that we ll still be able to absorb that in our guidance range that we re affirming today through a variety of levers we have to pull phil ng jefferies analyst got it and that s really helpful color john and then i guess on the 100 million jem restructuring initiatives it s obviously a impressive number and it s going to ramp up going in the next year more fully but do you expect these efforts kind of impact top line and profitability the near term and how much of these savings do you expect to actually drop through to the bottom line accounting for any potential sales leakage or dyssynergies operator okay so let me start with that first no we do not expect that jem were to affect our top line negatively in fact quite the opposite as we improve cycle time improve our operational performance develop standard work and deploy that across the enterprise we would expect that to be a net positive toward our ability to grow so quite frankly it s the opposite when we think about jem the jeld wen excellence model that s called a truly business operating system which while we talked about it quite a bit here in terms of the productivity that it will generate it s an all encompassing business operating system that looks at standard work and how we do all the processes within the business so if you think about it we re deploying standard work and visual management in our finance and marketing department and sales departments as well so while that may not drop out clearly as what we call traditional productivity it certainly allows us to increase our cycle time and increase our market share going forward by serving our customers better phil ng jefferies analyst thanks a lot really appreciate the color operator your next question comes from the line of scott schrier from citi your line is open scott schrier citi analyst hi good morning so a little bit following up on that last question i think earlier in the call you had said that you expect about 10 million of realization in 19 and then if i look at your guidance at the midpoint for the year it implies roughly 33 operating leverage seems like will be about 18 without that 10 million and i know you ve gone through some of the price cost to mix headwinds and everything i m wondering how that operating leverage kind of falls into where you look at your fixed and variable cost structure and then if i think about what s bracketing the guidance on the assumptions what s in there at the higher end of the range and what s in there at the lower end of the range gary s michel chief executive officer okay so if you think about it i think it s great question a couple of things on the jem and productivity side that s a part of it right so we re driving obviously we ve got price that we ve been talking about price realization to be positive this year as opposed to drag last year we ve got productivity that we ve driven into the business regardless of the rationalization and modernization program we re driving productivity in all parts of our business so that we re driving that leverage the rationalization and modernization portion effective part of our business across the enterprise and across the segments but that s where we re investing in standard work new automation and it will ultimately be a little bit longer term but that s where the 10 million drops out the additional productivity the additional price you will see that shorter term and then in addition to that that 10 million that we ll see this year from the rationalization will then accelerate going forward toward that 100 million that we ll expect from the total rationalization by 2022 scott schrier citi analyst thanks and then another one on vpi you had spoken about the potential for expanding the business and it was already in progress can you speak to the timing and magnitude if any of whether it s incremental capex or an sg a that would be needed to really start to grow that business gary s michel chief executive officer we believe that when we look at the capabilities that exist within vpi certainly their expertise in that commercial and multifamily area we re able to leverage that across our existing coverage for the markets so be it through distribution that we already have through our sales resources and our architectural and commercial support capabilities that we currently have if we need to add resources as we grow i think there ll be incremental and they ll be part of what you would expect that would go along with the revenue but they wouldn t there s not a big huge investment that needs to go to supplement that capability i think a lot of it exists and then you ll just see we will see it as we grow that revenue base and we expand there will just be a normal incremental portion of the sg a that would be required to support that kind of sale john linker chief financial officer yes i would just add on i think we talked about on previous disclosure that the vpi acquisition would be accretive the company margin s going to be a little slow to start out this year with some integration costs and higher health benefits and things like that as we bring vpi into our plan so maybe not quite right off the bat that accretive but certainly as we get into the back half of the year and then into next year we d see that business being accretive to consolidated margins and as we go after those revenue synergies that gary mentioned and as we start to get the material cost synergies i would expect to see that start to accelerate so i wouldn t expect any headwind from sort of a sg a or capex to go after those synergies scott schrier citi analyst great thank you very much operator your next question comes from the line of keith hughes from suntrust your line is open judith merrick suntrust analyst this is actually judy in for keith most of our questions have been answered but just looking forward on what you re looking at for acquisitions would you expect them to be kind of similar to vpi and like a synergy and the cost synergy basis kind of similar to that or what s your outlook for that john linker chief financial officer so look we re going to strategic m a is the key piece of our future growth platform we feel like our future growth strategy with our global platform we ve got opportunities to look at bolt on m a kind of globally in all 3 of our geographic segments and bolt on to our existing business i d say right now in the short term leverage is a little higher it s above our target range and we re going to want to see visibility to that leverage coming down and so any m a activity here for the second half of this year is going to be fairly limited as we really work to execute on getting the core margins up integrate what we bought in the last 12 to 18 months which is pretty significant that said as we move forward leverage comes down gets through the back half of this year we think there s a great m a opportunity here for this business given our cash flow capability to really look at m a as a core competency but bolt ons that are similar to vpi right down in the middle of the fairway similar products but maybe slightly different end markets but also starting to think about adjacencies that would have synergies in our through distribution channel down the road so we think there is a great opportunity looking forward scott schrier citi analyst okay that s helpful thank you gary s michel chief executive officer you re welcome operator your next question comes from the line of john lovallo from bank of america your line is open peter galbo bank of america analyst thank guys this is actually pete galbo on for john john i just wanted to confirm to one of the earlier questions around tariffs i think last quarter you had said that if tariffs went to 25 it would be 12 million to 17 million potential hit is that incremental relative to the 10 or would that have been the kind of the total overall hit that you would have seen going from 0 to 25 john linker chief financial officer no that was all in sorry i got to speak back there i think that would be all in tariff expectation for the full year it was included in our recent original guidance peter galbo bank of america analyst got it okay okay and maybe just switching gears if you guys could talk about you had a number of new product introductions that you had mentioned john at the builder show you had mentioned kind of a potential to start looking at maybe some composite based windows and other products can you just give us any update there maybe advantages that you see from offering composites whether it s from a price point and maybe what you think the market opportunity could be in that material john linker chief financial officer so yes we did hopefully that feedback is not coming through and you ll my answer but we didn t launch a number of products at ibs went through a few of those in the prepared remarks we did tease out the composite we re working toward that and we ll be launching that product for the market for commercial production later in the year and we ll be giving a lot more information about the product at that time but we do think there s a real opportunity there with new materials innovation is going to be key not only in windows space but also for doors and we re seeing innovation that s really crossing the business globally so we re able to use these material innovations as well as product innovations across all 3 of our operating geographies and actually across windows and doors as well so we think the composite is a great example there we talked about finishield earlier as an alternative to vinyl which has some better capabilities there as well did you get that answer or was that peter galbo bank of america analyst no i did it came through sorry about that is there any way gary maybe just in north america to put out a potential total market opportunity for composite windows or is that something you guys are not willing to disclose at this point gary s michel chief executive officer yes we don t typically talk about that but as we get closer to the commercial launch we ll certainly give you some more commercial color on that probably later in the year judith merrick suntrust analyst got it okay thanks guys operator your next question comes from the line of steven ramsey from thompson research group your line is open steven ramsey good morning maybe you can talk a little bit about abs and is that a kind of an ongoing or permanent headwind to north america margins and as far as internal improvement initiatives go is abs a part of this john linker chief financial officer good morning so in terms of abs and some of the other value added distribution acquisition that we did also mmi which was done in late 17 we had indicated at the time those deals with done yes initially it s slightly dilutive to company margins but when you start to look at sort of the throughput the total throughput opportunity for us of for jeld wen of being able to sell our richer mix of our products both interior and exterior doors through those channels that we thought there was an opportunity to have the total margin benefit that the jeld wen going to be accretive over time and particularly as we look to take out cost so i d say in north america in q1 abs yes was slightly dilutive to segment margins in q1 but as we kind of look through the second half of this year and into next year as we drive in some of those revenue synergies and also taking some of the cost out through potential facility rationalization we would view the kind of total opportunity to jeld wen as being a accretive scenario steven ramsey got you so you re saying that thesis going in for purchasing those companies still holds john linker chief financial officer yes absolutely yes we re happy with those acquisition so far integration is on track and feel good about where we are steven ramsey great and then last question on q1 demand and sales i d be interested to hear in areas that were not weather impacted can you talk about how demand was and if possible to break that out by the new construction side and the repair remodel side thinking north america there gary s michel chief executive officer yes i don t think we ll break it down any further than we already have other than to say that like i said earlier core slightly down on revenue overall but we had we have the benefit of those areas that were impacted would have been growth we saw the mix piece much more of a repair and replace retail versus residential new construction we expect in the second half that to start flipping in the other direction steven ramsey great thank you operator there are no further questions at this time mr gary michel i turn the call back over to you gary s michel chief executive officer thanks a lot and thank you all for joining us today we do appreciate your interest in your questions i d like to leave you with a couple of thoughts i m real pleased with our sequential and sustained improvements that we ve demonstrated across many parts of our business over the last few quarters we delivered positive productivity for 2 quarters in a row and also maintained our service levels with our customers we achieved year over year core margin improvement for 2 consecutive quarters and price cost is now a tailwind as opposed to the headwind that it was for most of 2018 we re confident that we have improved our operational performance combined with new product innovation these will lead to an acceleration of core revenue growth additionally we continue to make the investments that are required to drive margin improvement in future quarters as we proceed toward our long term ebitda margin target of 15 this includes executing on our footprint rationalization and modernization plan and accelerating to deployment of jem tools across the organization we look forward to speaking with you all again at the end of quarter in a few months and provide another update on our progress thanks again for joining us this morning have a great day operator this concludes today s conference call you may now disconnect

where annual capital plus share buybacks are forecasted to approximately equal annual funds flow from operations additional information on the quarter s expenses operating expenses increased to 10 09

operating and workover expenses in 2019 to trend lower to a range of 9 00 10 00 per boe as the forecasted full ramp up of gas to power facilities at the acordionero costayaco and moqueta fields has an expected positive impact on power reliability thereby reducing pump failure rates and the resultant expenses and diesel costs transportation expenses increased by 4 to 2 35 per boe up modestly from 2

president and chief executive officer of gran tierra commented gran tierra has delivered another quarter of record production and has now profitably grown production at an average rate of 14 per year since early 2015 our strategy remains centered on full cycle returns with an emphasis on creating long term shareholder value through economic production and reserves growth our sharp focus on capital efficiency has achieved an economic return on average capital employed of 11 over the last 12 months with the current oil price and our low cost structure we have also been able to return significant value to shareholders via our ongoing share buyback program the combination of our high netback production access to infrastructure low declines and large resource base has created a sustainable business model which we expect to be fully funded by forecasted cash from operating activities in 2019 we operate over 95 of our production and have a 100 wi in 22 out of 31 of our blocks including all 17 in colombia s putumayo and all 3 in ecuador s oriente we currently have 2 3 million gross acres in colombia and 140 000 gross acres in ecuador all of which are in proven hydrocarbon basins with this large diverse and operated portfolio gran tierra has significant control and flexibility on capital allocation and timing during volatile periods in oil price and capital markets we are very excited about ayombero with oil charge proven in all three wells drilled to date which provides us with confidence in the potential for large oil in place volumes we are addressing the mechanical challenges that have been experienced in drilling and completion operations due to the highly over pressured reservoirs encountered in each well over the last four years we have successfully built a strong position in the three major producing basins in colombia and achieved a new country entry into ecuador s highly prospective oriente basin gran tierra now has a significant amount of exploration appraisal and development opportunities for years to come we believe that gran tierra is well positioned for an exciting year of growth in 2019 and beyond as we continue to create value in multi horizon proven hydrocarbon basins operations update acordionero 100 wi during the quarter the ac 35 ac 36 and ac 37 development oil wells and two water injectors were drilled on the south pad the ac 35 development well which was drilled south of ac 34 penetrated high quality sections of the lisama a and c reservoirs the well was placed on production february 22 2019 and performed above original expectations with a 30 day average oil rate of 976 bbl of oil per day bopd gas oil ratio gor of 120 standard cubic feet per bbl scf bbl and water cut of 0 1 gas oil ratio of 120 standard cubic feet per bbl scf bbl and water cut of 0 1 the ac 37 development well the furthest south well drilled in the acordionero field to date encountered over 300 feet ft of net pay true vertical depth tvd which was significantly better than expectation and is expected to increase original oil in place estimates this well was placed on production on march 28 2019 and had a 30 day average oil rate of 910 bopd

maintained positive production results both wells were drilled down structure and completed only in the lisama a reservoir production declines in the quarter have been relatively low to date and provide confidence in future down structure infill development well locations across the field activity is expected to accelerate in second quarter 2019 with seven wells scheduled to spud on the south central and mochuelo pads as well as pad 4 the acordionero facilities expansion is designed for enhanced oil recovery and value by increasing capacities for fluid handling and water injection gran tierra expects to be injecting 18 500 bbl water injected per day bwipd during second quarter 2019 this expansion is expected to allow water injection to be ramped up to a maximum rate of 40 000 bwipd during second half 2019 ayombero 100 wi the ayombero 3 appraisal well is in the completion phase operations have been delayed due to completion challenges associated with the highly over pressured reservoir initial indications from drilling prior to logs are that a potential gross reservoir interval of approximately 600 ft has been penetrated while the over pressured formations have continued to prove challenging in terms of drilling and completion operations the company is very excited about the potential associated with the ayombero chuira la luna conventional carbonate resource play its substantial prospective resource base and the inventory of future potential drilling opportunities the three ayombero wells drilled to date have confirmed similar lithologies oil saturations and over

does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead in addition given that the value ratio based on the current price of oil as compared with natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalent of six to one utilizing a boe conversion ratio of 6 mcf 1 barrel would be misleading as an indication of value this press release contains certain oil and gas metrics including operating

the u s is waging a war against venezuela the bolivarian republic the war has already taken a very high toll death of 40 000 people in the country in 2017 2018 due to sanctions the most powerful economy in the world has imposed finds a study it is a genocide columbia university economics professor jeffrey sachs carried out the study the study report economic sanctions as collective punishment the case of venezuela said most of the impact of these sanctions has not been on the government but on the civilian population the report published by washington dc based the centre for economic and policy research cepr examines affect of the sanctions imposed by the u s after august 2017 on the lives of ordinary citizens of venezuela sachs professor of economics and director of the center for sustainable development at columbia university and his co author economist mark weisbrot co director at the center for economic and policy research cepr argue that these sanctions have caused and continue to cause harm and threaten venezuelans lives and well being 40 000 deaths in 2017 18 the report finds that the sanctions have inflicted and increasingly inflict very serious harm to human life and health including an estimated more than 40 000 deaths from 2017 2018 one result of the sanctions as described above is to deprive the venezuelan economy of many billions of dollars of foreign exchange needed to pay for essential and life saving imports the sanctions implemented in 2019 including the recognition of a parallel government accelerated this deprivation and also cut off venezuela from most of the international payments system thus ending much of the country s access to these essential imports including medicine and food even those that could normally be bought with available dollars there is no doubt that all of these sanctions since august 2017 have had severe impacts on human life and health according to the national survey on living conditions encovi by its acronym in spanish an annual survey of living conditions administered by three venezuelan universities there was a 31 percent increase in general mortality from 2017 to 2018 this would imply an increase of more than 40 000 deaths more than 300 000 people were estimated to be at risk because of lack of access to medicines or treatment this includes an estimated 80 000 people with hiv who have not had antiretroviral treatment since 2017 16 000 people who need dialysis 16 000 people with cancer and 4 million with diabetes and hypertension many of whom cannot obtain insulin or cardiovascular medicine these numbers by themselves virtually guarantee that the current sanctions which are much more severe than those implemented before this year are a death sentence for tens of thousands of venezuelans this is especially true if the projected 67 percent drop in oil revenue materializes in 2019 the accelerating economic collapse that current sanctions have locked in assures further impacts on health and premature deaths for example the increasing collapse of export revenue and therefore imports has also created massive public health problems in the areas of water and sanitation the electricity crisis has also affected hospitals and health care food imports have dropped sharply along with overall imports in 2018 they were estimated at just 2 46 billion as compared with 11 2 billion in 2013 they can be expected to plummet further in 2019 along with imports generally contributing to malnutrition and stunting in children the un finds the groups most vulnerable to the accelerating crisis include children and adolescents including many who can no longer attend school people who are in poverty or extreme poverty pregnant and nursing women older persons indigenous people people in need of protection women and adolescent girls at risk people with disabilities and people who identify as lesbian gay bisexual transgender or intersex collective punishment it said these sanctions would fit the definition of collective punishment of the civilian population as described in both the geneva and hague international conventions to which the us is a signatory the study report says the economists stressed that series of u s imposed sanctions have made it very hard for venezuelans to have access to food medicine and medical equipment the sanctions implemented in 2019 including the recognition of a parallel government cut off venezuela from most of the international payments system thus ending much of the country s access to these essential imports including medicine and food even those that could normally be bought with available money there is no doubt that all of these sanctions since august 2017 have had severe impacts on human life and health august 2017 sanctions on the sanctions imposed in august 2017 the report said the report said the us government imposed sanctions since august of 2017 have reduced the public s caloric intake increased disease and mortality for both adults and infants and displaced millions of venezuelans who fled the country as a result of the worsening economic depression and hyperinflation they exacerbated venezuela s economic crisis and made it nearly impossible to stabilize the economy contributing further to excess deaths the report said the sanctions prohibited the venezuelan government from borrowing in us financial markets this prevented the government from restructuring its foreign debt because any debt restructuring requires the issuance of new bonds in exchange for the existing debt thus these sanctions prevented the economy from recovering from a deep recession which had already taken a large toll on the population which along with the economy was more vulnerable to these sanctions and the ones that followed because of the economic crisis real gdp had already declined by about 24 7 percent from 2013 through 2016 and consumer price inflation for january to august 2017 was probably somewhere between 758 percent and 1 350 percent at an annual rate it said it is important to emphasize that nearly all of the foreign exchange that is needed to import medicine food medical equipment spare parts and equipment needed for electricity generation water systems or transportation is received by the venezuelan economy through the government s revenue from the export of oil thus any sanctions that reduce export earnings and therefore government revenue thereby reduce the imports of these essential and in many cases life saving goods the august 2017 sanctions adversely affected oil production in venezuela however following the august 2017 executive order oil production crashed falling at more than three times the rate of the previous twenty months this would be expected from the loss of credit and therefore the ability to cover maintenance and operations and carry out new investments necessary to maintain production levels this acceleration in the rate of decline of oil production would imply a loss of 6 billion in oil revenue over the ensuing year this by itself is an enormous loss of foreign exchange relative to the country s need for essential imports imports of food and medicine for 2018 were just 2 6 billion total imports of goods for 2018 were about 10 billion the loss of so many billions of dollars of foreign exchange and government revenues was very likely the main shock that pushed the economy from its high inflation when the august 2017 sanctions were implemented into the hyperinflation that followed other executive decisions made by the trump administration resulted in the closure of venezuelan accounts in financial institutions loss of access to credit and other financial restrictions that have had severe negative impacts on oil production as well as the economy january 2019 sanctions on the sanctions imposed in 2019 the report said the immediate impact of the january sanctions was to cut off venezuela from its largest oil market the united states which had bought 35 6 percent of venezuela s oil exports in 2018 or about 586 000 barrels per day on average in the week of march 15 us imports of venezuelan oil fell to zero for the first time and they remained at zero for another two weeks before rebounding to a fraction of their 2018 average it said because of these sanctions and other efforts venezuela s oil production declined by 130 000 barrels per day from january to february in the six months prior it was declining by an average of 20 500 barrels per day then in march it fell another 289 000 barrels per day for a total of 431 000 barrels per day this is an economically devastating 36 4 percent plunge in oil production just since the january sanctions this drop if maintained over the next year would cut another 6 8 billion from venezuela s available foreign exchange earnings this is about 21 percent of export earnings from 2018 however oil export revenues in 2019 are projected to fall by a cataclysmic and unprecedented 67 2 percent from 2018 because of the impact of tightening sanctions the january sanctions also froze many billions of dollars of venezuelan assets that could have been sold in order to maintain essential and life saving imports or to stabilize the economy these included most of the government s 9 billion in reserves that are in gold trade credits worth an estimated 3 4 billion and citgo with estimated net assets of 5 2 billion after the january sanctions and the recognition of guaidó as interim president which made him according to the trump administration and other governments recognizing the parallel government the legal owner of any funds transferred or goods bought by the venezuelan government venezuela s access to correspondent banks for international transactions was mostly wiped out this included access to necessary credits for imports of medicine food and other essential goods the sanctions have also contributed substantially to the length and economic damage of power outages including the severe electricity crises in march the report said all of these impacts disproportionately harmed the poorest and most vulnerable venezuelans even more severe and destructive than the broad economic sanctions of august 2017 were the sanctions imposed by executive order on january 28 2019 and subsequent executive orders this year and the recognition of a parallel government created a completely new set of financial and trade sanctions that are even more constricting than the executive orders themselves sanctions are illegal another important aspect highlighted in the report is that the us is breaking international law as well as violating the principles of the un by imposing sanctions they are illegal under international law and treaties which the us has signed and would appear to violate us law as well the economists wrote the report said the sanctions are illegal under international law and treaties which the us has signed and would appear to violate u s law as well the unilateral sanctions imposed by the trump administration are illegal under the charter of the organization of american states oas especially articles 19 and 20 of chapter iv they are also illegal under international human rights law as well as treaties signed by the united states the sanctions also violate us law each executive order since march 2015 declares that the united states is suffering from a national emergency because of the situation in venezuela this is required by us law in order to impose such sanctions and the national emergency is invoked under the 1976 national emergencies act this is the same law that president trump invoked in february 2019 when declaring a national emergency to circumvent congressional appropriation for funds to build a wall along the border with mexico the executive order also states as required by law that venezuela presents an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security of the united states there is no foundation in fact for either of these declarations there are many provisions in the charter that prohibit these sanctions but among the most clear and unambiguous are articles 19 and 20 of chapter iv article 19 says no state or group of states has the right to intervene directly or indirectly for any reason whatever in the internal or external affairs of any other state the foregoing principle prohibits not only armed force but also any other form of interference or attempted threat against the personality of the state or against its political economic and cultural elements article 20 says no state may use or encourage the use of coercive measures of an economic or political character in order to force the sovereign will of another state and obtain from it advantages of any kind the report said thus one of the most important impacts of the sanctions in terms of its effects on human life and health is to lock venezuela into a downward economic spiral for this reason it is important to note that when we look at for example the estimated more than 40 000 excess deaths that occurred just from 2017 to 2018 the counterfactual possibility in the absence of sanctions is not just zero excess deaths but actually a reduction in mortality and other improvements in health indicators that is because an economic recovery could have already begun in the absence of economic sanctions and conversely the death toll going forward this year if the sanctions remain in place is almost certainly going to be vastly higher than anything we have seen previously given the highly accelerated rate of decline of oil production and therefore the availability of essential imports and the accelerated decline of income per person spain to limit lopez s political activity imperialist camp backed venezuelan politician leopold lopez who has sought refuge in the spanish embassy in caracas will have his political activities restricted said spain s acting foreign minister spain will not permit its embassy to be converted in to a center of political activity by mr lopez or anyone else acting foreign minister josep borrell said spain s government acknowledged thursday that lopez who was illegally unlocked from house arrest to assist with an attempted coup d état on the government under president nicolas maduro tuesday cannot request the status of political asylum from venezuela because such a request must be made only within spanish territory lopez has not asked for political asylum because according to our legislation for that you must request it while on spanish territory borrell said adding that while lopez remains at the embassy there would be a limit to his political activity according to the venezuelan government lopez who has sought refuge in the spanish embassy cannot request political asylum as spain was not a signatory of the diplomatic asylum convention of caracas of 1954 us seeks meeting with russia to talk about venezuela russia s foreign minister sergei lavrov will hold a meeting with u s secretary of state mike pompeo next week in rovaniemi finland to discuss among other topics their countries differing approaches to the political situation in venezuela yes the meeting has been agreed on russian deputy foreign minister sergei ryabkov told the news agency tass brazil s vp says coup attempt premature hamilton mourao brazilian vice president has criticized the venezuelan opposition s failed efforts this week to convince the country s military to break with president maduro and join its uprising saying that the move may have been premature speaking to reporters mourao said that he did not know whether was afraid of being arrested or if some elements of the armed forces had promised some support but looking at it now we think it was not the best in separate interview with radio gaucha mourao a retired army general who has spent time in venezuela

by vicente morin aguado havana times the helms burton act has now been fully implemented 23 years after it was signed president trump lifted the waiver on titles iii and iv which relate to property confiscated by the budding cuban revolution which were later subject to foreign investment politicians plaintiffs defendants and journalists are all speculating on the real scope of this legislation which is why we have asked several experts for a somewhat medical examination of the cuban liberty and democratic solidarity libertad act we interviewed two economists paul michael meo and elias amor bravo in order to learn more about the possible repercussions of title iii of the helms burton act finally being implemented paul meo pm the direct impact of these new measures isn t very important the current situation in venezuela is a lot more important for cuba for example elias amor bravo eab the consequences will be felt in the long term for investments that have been operating on the island with assets that were once confiscated from their legitimate owners private schools and universities which are now public won t be subject to lawsuits as these kinds of institutions were exempt from foreign investment just like everything to do with the health or defense sectors were lawsuits need to be filed in us courts and i have a feeling that there won t be any immediate rulings in the meantime foreign companies will continue to operate in cuba pm foreign business owners who accepted high risks are now well established in the country i believe that they have prepared to deal with this situation ht even though the law targets cuba s totalitarian system it only works as it should in the us the judicial system linked to property is very complex in itself plus it doesn t respond to a party or government s political interests pm as a claimant i would tell my government thanks but no thanks because just filing a claim costs you us 6 500 then you have to pay lawyers and for recovering property deeds for example it will cost some 12 000 for a property worth 50 000 without taking its state of repair into consideration ht how far will the enthusiasm of these cuban americans take them after six decades pm immigration peaked many years ago later floods of migrants haven t been as successful in economic terms current surveys show that third generation cuban americans don t really want to return to cuba if the government were to change many years have passed which is why there won t be lots and lots of lawsuits ht nevertheless is there a starting premise for these claims eab we have the so called laws 890 and 891 which lists the names and social purposes of all the companies that were seized after october 13 1960 which you can read about here ht when rulings are made can we talk reliably about prices 60 years later the university of valencia professor recognizes that there isn t an easy answer given the parity between the usd and cuban peso in 1959 but he doesn t desist from giving us an answer eab we know about the usd in 1959 and its later evolution in us where there haven t been any traumatic economic events like there have been in cuba under these circumstances the average rate of inflation in the us between 1959 2019 has been 3 67 per year and the dollar has gone up 769 32 in this period which means that 1 usd in 1959 is the equivalent of 8 69 usd today that is to say a 500 usd monthly income in 1959 would be the equivalent of 4 345 usd in 2019 if we use the same math both of these figures would be relevant ht last but not least if some owners were to receive a favorable ruling money would be its name the cuban government has its law no 80 of 1996 to fall back on which declares the helms burton act and its dispositions to be void the europeans within the eu have their current blockade statute in force against the us law spanish lawyer jose maria vinals rubs salt in the wound the helms burton act will affect defendant investors in cuba who have property interests or bank accounts in the us which could be seized ht this is what the news has confirmed with carnival cruise lines now being sued while spanish hotel chain melia is waiting for the bad but not surprising news experts also see other non quantifiable effects which are still very real academic jaime sushlicki from the cuban center in florida summarizes some companies are going to get worried they will realize that they can t operate using these properties and will withdraw from cuba maybe others will enter some form of agreement with the former owners of these assets and anyone thinking about investing in cuba will now take a step back ht final diagnosis eab there s no doubt that the decision to do business in cuba which has been difficult and ridden with problems up until now because of a lot of redtape and government policies will now become a real nightmare pm the hardest thing though will be a new democratic government s efforts to clean deeds of military and state led industries or cooperatives and give these properties to the people good luck changing a fascist corporate system into modern social capitalism this is cuba s challenge in the future not the helms burton act interviewee s credentials paul michael meo 80 years old graduated from harvard in 1961 studied a masters at colorado university in 1969 and the technological institute of massachusetts 1971 he spent two decades working with the world bank as an economist supervisor and head of the latin american and southern asia departments research and programs elias amor bravo

the key sector rose 0 6 m m versus market expectations of a 1 2 rise the slight order increase in march is not least due to bulk orders the german economics ministry said stripping out volatile demand for big ticket items manufacturing orders would have registered another monthly decline the ministry added compared year over year order volumes dropped 6 0 note industrial activity in germany turned down in h2 2018 amid weaker foreign demand and partly reflecting temporary disruptions to production in the key automobile and chemical industries on the whole the order situation in the manufacturing

statements regarding expected outcome of pending litigation additionally during today s call we will discuss non gaap measures which we believe can be useful in evaluating our performance the presentation of this additional information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with gaap a reconciliation of these non gaap measures to their most directly comparable financial measure calculated under gaap can be found in our earnings release and in the appendix to this presentation i would now like to turn the call over to gary gary s michel chief executive officer thanks karina good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today this morning we announced first quarter results in line with our expectations delivering revenue and adjusted ebitda growth of 6 8 and 3 2 respectively despite facing anticipated headwinds from market growth rates shifts in mix and foreign exchange i m pleased with how our associates executed during the first quarter to reinvigorate growth deliver productivity and implement our facility rationalization and modernization plan we realized price in excess of cost inflation and delivered net cost productivity savings through deployment of our jeld wen excellence model we introduced new and innovative products to the market and deployed capital through opportunistic share repurchases and m a jeld wen is on track to deliver revenue growth and accelerate core margin expansion as we progress through the remainder of 2019 similar to last quarter our volume mix challenges were largely isolated through our u s windows canadian and australasian businesses however the impact of volume in these businesses was further aggravated by pockets of softer new construction demand and extreme winter weather despite these headwinds to our growth and profitability we maintain core adjusted ebitda margins in line with the first quarter of 2018 by remaining disciplined in our pricing strategy aggressively controlling costs and driving productivity throughout the enterprise as mentioned overall price cost was a tailwind in the quarter we realized a 4 pricing benefit in north america representing the highest rate of price realization in several years in north america improved pricing and cost management drove a 40 basis point increase in core margin while positive net productivity in both europe and australasia partially offset raw material inflation and volume mix headwinds during the quarter we announced and closed the acquisition of vpi quality windows supplementing jeld wen s existing organic growth initiatives by providing a platform for profitable growth in the mid rise multifamily and commercial market segments more on vpi shortly we also made good progress on our footprint rationalization and modernization plan executing projects across all 3 of our geographic segments during the first quarter as we previously communicated we re on track to realize savings from these projects beginning in the back half of 2019 on our way to our longer term targeted savings of 100 million given our trajectory in the first quarter and the visibility to core margin drivers for the remainder of the year i remain confident that we ll achieve our full year guidance please turn to page 5 for a brief summary of our financial results for the first quarter john will provide a more detailed view shortly but let me hit a few highlights net revenues for the quarter increased by 6 8 year over year driven primarily by a 12 contribution from acquisitions partially offset by a 4 impact from foreign exchange and a 1 decrease in core revenue net income decreased by 23 7 million to 16 6 million due to the nonrecurrence of onetime benefits in the first quarter of 2018 adjusted ebitda increased by 2 8 million during the quarter to 90 6 million in line with our expectations adjusted ebitda margins declined by 30 basis points year over year to 9 due to the dilutive impact of recent acquisitions and unfavorable foreign exchange offset by 40 basis points of core margin expansion in north america and flat core margins on a consolidated basis additionally operating cash flow improved by 37 3 million year over year through improved working capital utilization net leverage at quarter end was approximately 3 2x temporarily above our target range due to the acquisition of vpi and seasonal working capital build we repurchased approximately 940 000 shares during the quarter for 15 million we re intently focused on driving growth and margin expansion in our core operations and will remain disciplined by investing in high return organic projects like our rationalization and modernization programs and new product development on page 6 i m excited to introduce a number of new products we launched from around the world during the first quarter each of these products offer unique and innovative solutions including improved aesthetics and enhanced functionality creating greater value for the homeowner and reducing time to install for builders and contractors a few examples our new finishield technology for vinyl windows provides an exterior finish with improved energy control durability and consistency unmatched by traditional paint in australia we re extending our recent alumiere window series with new features and options to achieve a retro mix the siteline panoramic gliding door received a bimsmith best award at the international builders show it addresses the rising consumer demand for larger daylight openings our proprietary door operation technology bridges the price and performance gap between standard patio doors and entry level wall systems for the most part these products expand jeld wen s existing product offerings and will deliver incremental revenue and margin expansion over time there are more innovations to come and i look forward to sharing them with you in the coming quarters please turn the page 7 in addition to innovation we continue to invest in capabilities to further enhance our growth and reach we re pleased to welcome the engaged associates of vpi quality windows to the jeld wen family vpi s premier brand and product offering serving the mid rise multifamily and commercial markets coupled with jeld wen s national distribution footprint will provide meaningful revenue synergies significant growth potential exists in vpi s traditional west coast end markets and we believe that vpi s superior product performance and overall value proposition including near perfect historical on site water intrusion test results position these products for broad acceptance across north america the acquisition closed on march 29 and integration is progressing as planned before turning it over to john i ll provide a brief update on our end market outlook for 2019 in north america the first quarter played out as anticipated with softness in residential new construction driven by a slowdown in key housing indicators in late 2018 and offset by healthy demand in repair and remodel markets in europe we saw mixed results across our regional operating units in both new construction and repair and remodel end markets in australasia softening residential new construction markets driven primarily by tightening credit standards were partially offset by relative strength in repair and remodel for the remainder of the year we anticipate a modest acceleration in new construction demand in north america weighted toward the second half of the year many key influencers of residential new construction and repair and remodel demand have improved including mortgage rates home price appreciation wage rate growth employment and the age of existing housing stock we also believe that growth in household formations in excess of recent new construction activity sets the stage for sustained housing growth in the united states for europe we anticipate continued mix results that differ by product line channel and geography varying rates of economic growth across europe are likely to persist leading to mix demand for building products brexit remains an overhang with uncertain economic consequences in australasia we anticipate a further deterioration in residential new construction in the second half of the year due in large part to tightened credit standards partially offset by stable repair and remodel activity with that i ll turn it over to john linker to provide a detailed view of our financial results for the first quarter of 2019 john linker chief financial officer thanks gary and good morning everyone i ll start on slide 10 for the first quarter net revenues increased 6 8 to 1 0 billion the increase was driven primarily by the 12 contribution of our recent acquisitions partially offset by a 4 headwind from foreign currency and a 1 decrease in core revenues we reported net income of 16 6 million for the first quarter a decrease of 23 7 million versus prior year the decrease in net income was primarily driven by the nonrecurrence of a 20 8 million nonoperational gain and related 7 1 million tax benefit recognized in the prior year on shares held of a minority equity investment our effective tax rate was 38 4 in the first quarter an increase compared to prior year as well as higher than our expectations for the quarter and full year of 33 to 36 excluding the impact of the gilti provision of u s tax reform our normalized tax rate in the first quarter would have been approximately 30 diluted earnings per share was 0 16 a decrease of 0 21 compared to prior year due to the same drivers i mentioned impacting net income partially offset by a lower share count adjusted diluted earnings per share was 0 23 adjusted ebitda increased 3 2 to 90 6 million adjusted ebitda margins declined by 30 basis points in the quarter to 9 year over year consolidated ebitda margins declined due to the impact of foreign exchange and recent acquisitions however we did see sequential improvements in many areas of our business core ebitda margins excluding the impact of fx and m a were unchanged compared to prior year core margins improved in north america for the second consecutive quarter while europe core margins decreased primarily due to inflation slide 11 provides a detail of our revenue drivers for the quarter our consolidated core revenues decreased 1 in the first quarter we realized positive price of 2 that was offset by a 3 decline in volume and mix total revenue was up 6 8 primarily coming from our recent acquisitions we saw positive price realization across all of our segments for the first time since the second quarter of 2018 please move to slide 12 where i ll take you through the segment detail beginning with north america net revenues in north america for the first quarter increased 13 6 primarily due to a 15 contribution from the acquisition of abs core revenues declined by 1 comprised of a 4 pricing benefit which did not fully offset unfavorable volume mix north america volume headwinds continue to be the most pronounced in our windows and canada businesses while our door business saw volume growth in retail and company owned distribution partially offset by weaker performance in traditional distribution which was also a headwind to mix adjusted ebitda in north america increased by 13 8 to 53 5 million adjusted ebitda margins expanded 10 basis points to 9 5 a sequential improvement from the 10 basis points decrease in the fourth quarter of last year north america generated core adjusted ebitda margin expansion of 40 basis points that was mostly offset by the dilutive impact of the abs acquisition this is the second consecutive quarter of year over year core margin improvement in north america moving on to slide 13 net revenues in europe for the first quarter decreased slightly by 0 6 the decrease in net revenues was driven primarily by foreign currency the domoferm acquisition contributed 7 to segment net revenue that was more than offset by 8 headwind from foreign exchange excluding this impact from currency and acquisitions europe generated core revenue growth of 1 primarily from improved pricing adjusted ebitda in europe decreased 16 7 or 28 2 million adjusted ebitda margins decreased 180 basis points to 9 4 margins were impacted by 50 basis points of core margin compression primarily from inflation as well as the dilution from the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange and the domoferm acquisition on slide 14 net revenues in australasia for the first quarter decreased 0 9 the a l windows acquisitions contributed 10 to net revenues but was not enough to offset the impact from the combination of foreign exchange and market factors that resulted in lower volumes core revenues declined 2 primarily to the unfavorable volume mix impact of the continued softening of the australia residential new construction housing market we were pleased to see positive price benefit in australasia in the first quarter as this is an improvement from the previous quarter adjusted ebitda in australasia decreased 1 9 to 16 4 million adjusted ebitda margins contracted by 10 basis points to 11 3 due primarily to unfavorable foreign exchange core adjusted ebitda margins were flat in the first quarter as net cost productivity was offset by the deleveraging impact of unfavorable volume mix on page 15 cash flow from operations improved 37 3 million in the first quarter of 2019 to a use of 28 0 million from a use of 65 3 million in the same period a year ago we improved operating cash flow through more efficient working capital utilization our cash flow performance was in line with our expectations as a reminder our first quarter operating cash flows are typically negative due to the seasonality of our working capital cycle our capital expenditures increased 4 5 million in the first quarter compared to prior year the increase was in line with our expectations and outlook for the full year on the balance sheet we ended the first quarter with total net debt of 1 48 billion an increase of 118 million since december 31 2018 the increase in our net debt was driven primarily by the cash used to fund the vpi acquisition we closed during the first quarter and our seasonal operating cash flow usage our net leverage ratio was 3 2x at the upper end of our target range up from 2 9x at year end 2018 our balance sheet remains strong and our capital structure liquidity and free cash flow generation will provide us with the flexibility to reduce our net leverage ratio over time and fund our strategic initiatives now before turning it back to gary i ll comment on why we are well positioned to deliver on our commitment in 2019 we executed to our plan in the first quarter amid the challenging market backdrop the new construction housing market continues to provide mixed signals across our global end markets and while we feel good about the long term demand drivers in these market we have positioned ourselves to stay ahead of these near term challenges by aggressively managing our cost structure we expect core adjusted ebitda margin to accelerate in the second half of the year as a result of our already completed pricing actions improving but modest increases in volume mix our pipeline of jem productivity projects and our footprint rationalization program we have good visibility to each of these earnings drivers and therefore i believe we are well positioned to deliver on our 2019 commitments now i d like to turn it back over to gary to go through our latest 2019 outlook and provide you with closing comments gary s michel chief executive officer thank you john please turn to page 17 we maintain our original expectations for 2019 of consolidated revenue growth of 1 to 5 including the partial year contribution from our vpi acquisition core revenue growth will be driven by pricing actions and modest volume growth in north america in the second half of the year partially offset by moderate new construction contraction in australasia we ve increased the lower end of our outlook range for adjusted ebitda so that the range is now 475 million to 505 million which reflects the partial year contribution from the recent vpi acquisition for the remainder of the year we also reaffirm our original expectations for a full year core margin improvement of at least 40 basis points we estimate that we will generate approximately 27 of our full year adjusted ebitda in the second quarter year over year earnings growth in the second quarter will be limited by unfavorable foreign exchange and incremental sg a investments which are specific to the second quarter and not expected to recur in the remainder of the year finally i ll note that we ve had no significant updates on the steves litigation since our last call in february and due to the ongoing nature of the proceedings we will not be able to take any questions on this topic during the q a session with that i d like to open up the call for q a operator questions and answers operator operator instructions your first question comes from the line of truman patterson from wells fargo your line is open truman patterson wells fargo analyst hi good morning guys nice quarter just wanted to dig in to north america on the negative volume and product mix you guys mentioned that windows canada and weather were a bit of a headwind i thought windows it started to turn the corner could you guys just give us an update into what it ll take to turn the volume and mix from a headwind to a tailwind and if you re seeing any improvement post first quarter gary s michel chief executive officer thanks tru for the question yes so north america is slightly down on core volumes we saw it s hard to quantify the weather obviously but if you were to take out kind of that period of harsh winter weather the areas where we serve we would have seen growth we clearly would have seen growth in the quarter which is encouraging on the windows side it does take some time to win back that business we re seeing some real positive response to our windows business number one all the operational issues are well behind us so that s been a benefit for us as well as the products that we ve launched in that area some that we talked about this morning as well as the ones that we ve launched in the siteline area over the last call 1 5 years so we re starting to see some real positive movement there unfortunately it takes time for these projects to come to fruition plus to win back some of the shares that we ve lost we re feeling pretty good about it we like our chances and what we re hearing from customers is very very positive so i think the mix of good products good operational performance and the strong relations that we have in the channel will start to pay of for us here in the remainder of the year truman patterson wells fargo analyst okay okay looking at your jeld wen efficiency model initiatives the jem initiatives of 100 million in 2022 how should we think about the cadence of this unfolding is it pretty evenly each year and if so could you just give a little bit of an update on north america as i didn t see anything in the press release that there s much productivity gains in the first quarter at all gary s michel chief executive officer so the way we ve laid it out is we re still on track to see some benefit kind of in that 10 million range still in 2019 from the rationalization modernization program jem is a set of tools that we re deploying across the enterprise not just north america but across all of jeld wen these tools very some very basic around problem solving visual management and the like developing a cadence toward our productivity pipeline and the way that we measure that and each door that we program and manage each one of those we like where we are on the rationalization program during the quarter we ve started to see some movement there we ve made some moves already in some of the smaller plans but the way that it kind of lays out is early on we developed standard work we take that standard work and we deploy that across the businesses and then we start the consolidation and rationalization because of the issues that we had last 12 18 months ago we wanted to be overly cautious before we close down facilities or rationalize facilities we want to make sure that we have the new facilities up and running and capable of meeting production so that we don t risk any customer disruption we ve done that very very effectively like i said i feel really good with what the teams have done so far and we re on track to do that as you think about it going forward clearly maybe we re going a little bit slow to go fast later we ll start to see that accelerate accelerated benefit from both jem and the rationalization programs kind of starting next year and into the future we re still committed to the 100 million from our jem programs a 100 million from the rationalization and modernization programs moving toward that 50 ebitda target truman patterson wells fargo analyst okay so the jem initiatives kind of have a longer tail to them similar to the footprint rationalization are there any near term gains that you might be able to discuss with us john linker chief financial officer so truman let me just amplify a little bit so as gary mentioned couple calls ago we laid out 100 million target for the blocking and tackling jem initiative that s in the core plans that aren t being rationalized and then 100 million for the footprint rationalization program yes we mentioned in the first quarter yes there wasn t a lot of talk in the materials about productivity in north america and that s true i mean in a 5 headwind to volume mix it is difficult to extract a lot of labor productivity and so definitely in the first quarter europe and australasia performed better on the cost productivity side in terms of the phasing of kind of the productivity for north america and globally for the back half of the year yes we ve got good visibility from sort of a pipeline of projects that build up and go throughout the year both on the sourcing side in terms of material sourcing as well as in the core plans due to some automation investments we ve made and things like that so yes i think it s fair to say that there s good visibility to improving productivity in north america in the back half of the year it s not 1 or 2 big projects that s it s a lot of smaller initiatives that add up to that pipeline and give us visibility operator your next question comes from the line of tim wojs from baird your line is open tim wojs baird analyst hey guys good morning nice job maybe just gary maybe just to start off on price cost just given the stronger realization in the u s that you saw there may be some moderation in things like steel any change to how you re viewing price cost overall for the overall company for the year and then i guess if you look at europe and you look at australia is there any opportunities to accelerate the pricing there or is it just going to be tougher with the tougher volume backdrop john linker chief financial officer tim thank you so let s take the cost side of the equation first i would say as we look at sort of the full year we re still viewing inflation in both material and freight we do see some areas that should be on a year over year basis start to get a little bit more favorable particularly in europe there s some opportunities to start seeing some lower inflation so if i think about sort of where the material and freight inflation is across the globe right now certainly the highest is still in north america and europe and australia are sort of on the lower end so from where we sit today i would say material and freight inflation in the 1 5 1 to 1 5 for the full year we re not going to forecast price for the full year but it s fair to say based of the actions that we ve taken we would expect that the same type of price cost tailwind from the first quarter to continuing into the back half of the year on the pricing side specifically while we have most of the actions behind us in north america there s a in europe there s a few areas of our business that kind of contractually have april 1 effective dates on price increases and so we would start to see some of that inflation that hit us on margins in q1 in europe we would expect to start to see some relief from that as we get some price increases through in the effective april 1 in europe tim wojs baird analyst okay okay that s helpful and then as we think about just how the quarter may have turned in this might be more of a north america specific question but how did you see trends kind of through the quarter into q1 and then any commentary on how april s performed so far john linker chief financial officer yes i think largely the quarter played out as we expected from a in the first quarter in north america i mean yes we kind of newly had some volume headwinds going into the quarter in windows as we talked about in the last call that was not a trend we thought we could turn around in the in 1 quarter i think certainly the unexpected items were the weather piece of it i mean winter weather is always initially in q1 but this year it was extreme we had canada shutdown for a number of days some of our retail partners in north america were slower to take orders due to weather and even in europe we had in austria some pretty severe weather that shut us down for a couple of days so there were some surprises but that s part of the course that we got to execute around i d say as we start to think about q2 and where we are heading in the quarter without getting too specific on q2 volume trends i mean i think we re sort of we re certainly cautiously optimistic that we re going to see some see the trend turnaround in the second half of the year but probably still some of those volume mix headwinds are going to be with us during q2 as well tim wojs baird analyst okay okay great well thanks for the color and the time and i can look on q2 thanks john operator your next question comes from the line of michael rehaut from jpmorgan your line is open elad hillman jp morgan analyst this is elad on for mike i just wanted to look a little bit close on north america volume mix which is down 5 and you ve talked a little bit around the volume impact i was wondering how much of that relates to volume and mix and really take deeper in the mix issue i think you spoke about the mix shift continuing to lower margin retail business i was just wondering if that s accelerating and any actions you re looking to take to offset this headwind or bridge the gap between the retailer versus traditional business margins in doors gary s michel chief executive officer yes so as john said earlier with primarily where we got affected in and some of the softness in the first quarter was in kind of our what we call our traditional channel with the move toward the retail business there are kind of proxies a little bit as well for new home construction versus repair and replace so the repair and replace business and that retail proxy for that continue to be relatively strong and that s where we ve seen the kind of volume mix change we do expect as we said in the comments looking forward to the second half of the year residential new construction in that traditional channel really starting to pick back up and we expect to see that beat some favorable growth as well as creating some favorable mix for us elad hillman jp morgan analyst thanks that s helpful and then also on the progress from the footprint rationalization and understanding the considerable approach to start and also point to savings in the second half of 19 i just wanted to confirm if you re still on track to that 10 million to 15 million given the timing of how things are progressing gary s michel chief executive officer yes absolutely we re still on track we ve made some smaller location closures during the first quarter really across the entire enterprise in all 3 regions we re still on track the savings within the year will still happen the only difference between that in that range is really not that the projects aren t coming to fruition it s really just more about how fast we feel about taking out latent capacity so the projects are really solid we feel really really good about them well on our way on longer term track as well on the rationalization so still committed to making that happen elad hillman jp morgan analyst great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of reuben garner from seaport global securities your line is open reuben garner seaport global securities analyst thanks good morning everybody so you updated your ebitda range it looked like the revenue was the same can you go through the buckets of your revenue outlook maybe what s changed over the last few months and i guess walk through what your expectations are for volume price mix fx if you could john linker chief financial officer sure so yes we did roll in the acquisition of vpi which we get about 9 months of we had our revenue range was for the full year was 1 to 5 and given just how early in the year we are and just the relative small size of the vpi acquisition did not see a catalyst to move that 1 to 5 range in terms of revenue certainly i guess the big piece of the overall 1 to 5 is coming from the acquisition that we did last year so we had 1 quarter that we now anniversaried for abs a l and domoferm acquisitions which all contributed to first quarter and now we ll get a little bit here from vpi this year so that s certainly a big piece of the revenue growth we do have a fairly significant headwind from fx on the top line and the bottom line primarily weighted toward the first 2 quarters of the year fx i would say is probably in the range of a 2 plus headwind to revenue and so that would certainly be a drag in that 1 to 5 and then the remainder would be just the core revenue growth so we re negative here in the first quarter on core revenue by minus 1 and so we would expect to see that accelerate as we get into the back half of the year and as we progress and give you we ll get more visibility on kind of the pipeline and demand the next few quarters we ll certainly update the revenue guidance as it s merited and as we get closer reuben garner seaport global securities analyst okay and then your core ebitda margin expansion target for this year can you help us with maybe how it s going to look on the gross margin or and or the sg a line what s your expectations are for the next few quarters john linker chief financial officer sure so we mentioned in the comments that we reaffirmed the 40 basis points of core ebitda margin expansion in the full year again on a consolidated basis we ve got a headwind from fx and a headwind from some of the m a that we lapped in the first quarter that was dilutive so not all of that 40 bps drops to the bottom line i would say that the vast majority of that 40 basis points is going to be on the cost of goods sold gross profit side on the core business the price cost and the productivity we do have some investments that we re making in the business on it side and some other areas they re going to be a bit of a headwind to sg a but certainly i would put most of that 40 basis points as core margin on the gross margin line operator your next question comes from the line of matthew bouley from barclays your line is open matthew bouley barclays analyst good morning thank you for taking my questions i wanted to start out with a question on vpi it sounded like you re calling for revenue synergies i guess one are there cost synergies as well that you d be able to quantify and two just kind of more broadly i think you mentioned that vpi might be more of a platform for you in the multifamily commercial window space so just kind of any thoughts on how you guys would be thinking about further m a in that market gary s michel chief executive officer yes thanks for the question we really like what we saw at vpi the product portfolio their capabilities in that multifamily commercial space really really strong but they re very much indexed and most of their success has been in the on the west coast and even to that extent somewhat on the upper west we thought that they started some other expansion and toward the east with some really strong customer relationships and we thought that with our we do believe with our distribution their product and expertise in that area it s just a great match for us on the revenue side and the growth side it s an area that we ve been playing in and one that we had targeted for further expansion and growth so it just was a great match there for revenue on the cost side clearly there s commodities that we share and we re already starting to see some benefits from combining our their buy with what we already buy at jeld wen and seeing some commodity opportunities there as well so really good kind of down in the middle of the fairway type of acquisition one that expands our capabilities in commercial multifamily which is obviously a growing area in the market space and it combines the best of both companies matthew bouley barclays analyst all right thank you for that gary and then i wanted to ask about europe even highlighting this kind of negative mix shift for a couple quarters here sounded like channel and product mix so just any additional detail on what s playing out there if that s going to kind of persist here into the second quarter or if there s any other actions you might need to take around that gary s michel chief executive officer yes i think when you look at it it s kind of mixed results depending on the regions some up some down a little bit of mix between project business and our commercial and residential business so we re watching all of that very closely obviously watching the cost side of the equation as well operationally we re doing well in europe our products are well accepted we ve got some price there but we also have to be cautious that we manage that price in light of where the volumes are coming i know that we ve gone very specifically on what s up what s down but we re seeing our traditionally strong north business doing pretty well central europe s now seen a little bit of softness and of course the overhang from brexit continues particularly as we look at that repair and replace business in the u k matthew bouley barclays analyst right thanks for the detail operator the next question comes from the line of michael dahl from rbc capital markets your line is open mike dahl good morning actually mike eisen on for rbc following up on some of the commentary you both talked a good deal amount about 1q being in line with what you expected specifically in north america when i m thinking about the prior guide you gave core growth of 3 to 4 can you help us bridge the gap for the rest of the year and help us think of is there anything that you see coming whether it d be new business wins or reloading in some of the channels what s going on that helps you give you confidence in such a step up for rest of the year john linker chief financial officer mike good morning sure so i think as thinking about the core growth we ll have to follow up with you off line on that 3 to 4 core i don t recall that commentary for the full year i think 1 to 5 on a consolidated revenue basis is certainly what we re maintaining on a full year as we think about growth rates in north america specifically we ve got i think the windows business from gary already mentioned a lot of investment on the front end commercial side on trying to regain share and build a pipeline and as we looked at sort of what s in our pipeline both on the door and window side relative to both our external expectations as well as relative to the comps that we have to perform against in the back half of the year we feel good that we ll start to see some core volume in the back half and then again pricing we ve already taken those actions which contributes to the core revenue growth and feel like that s pretty known at this point based off what we ve already put in place and so that gives us some visibility to that core revenue negative 1 we had in the first quarter starting to improve probably in the q3 q4 time frame mike dahl got it that s helpful and then following up you had some commentary in the prepared remarks about different demand trends in your different end markets and distribution channels can you help us think about where you think inventory levels are across those different channels we ve heard a lot of commentaries over the last couple of weeks about destocking in certain channels and whether you think there s anything nuanced about it that could cause a better reaction or rebound as we look forward gary s michel chief executive officer i think from where we stand i don t know that there s been destocking from where we stand yes for most mostly what we re saying is pretty adequate inventory levels we re pretty well stocked going into the season certainly compared to where we would have been in past seasons that s been one of the knocks that got us into trouble so we re certainly prepared our channel partners seem to be prepared as we look at the indicators that we talked about before repair and replace particularly here in north america has remained to be a pretty strong business and one that we ve been able to benefit from the residential new construction while it s been a little bit choppy since fourth quarter and in the first quarter we do see those indicators trending positive and i think that ll be pulled through primarily through our traditional channel so i think we re adequately positioned with our channel partners i think we ll see kind of more direct revenue in line with those market dynamics mike dahl appreciate all the insight thank you operator your next question comes from the line of phil ng from jefferies your line is open phil ng jefferies analyst hey guys obviously impossible to predict but there s potentially a threat of new tariffs being implemented by the end of the week when you needed to implement additional price increases how confident are you with your guidance for i believe at least mutual price cost and how quickly could that impact your p l if this does tick john linker chief financial officer thanks good morning phil yes let s try when we gave guidance back in february for the full year we anticipated there would be some step up in tariffs later in the year obviously impossible to predict in this environment sort of exactly when and how much i would say at this point we have we took some pricing actions earlier in the year as noted we also the supply side have already started to look at alternative sources to supply outside of china for our spend prior for 2018 we were in the range of around 110 million purchases of raw materials from china and we really had already started to look to mitigate that through other solutions so i would say we re aware of what may go through on friday we re updating our guidance as of today at this point i feel like even if this 10 if the 25 goes through effective friday that we ll still be able to absorb that in our guidance range that we re affirming today through a variety of levers we have to pull phil ng jefferies analyst got it and that s really helpful color john and then i guess on the 100 million jem restructuring initiatives it s obviously a impressive number and it s going to ramp up going in the next year more fully but do you expect these efforts kind of impact top line and profitability the near term and how much of these savings do you expect to actually drop through to the bottom line accounting for any potential sales leakage or dyssynergies operator okay so let me start with that first no we do not expect that jem were to affect our top line negatively in fact quite the opposite as we improve cycle time improve our operational performance develop standard work and deploy that across the enterprise we would expect that to be a net positive toward our ability to grow so quite frankly it s the opposite when we think about jem the jeld wen excellence model that s called a truly business operating system which while we talked about it quite a bit here in terms of the productivity that it will generate it s an all encompassing business operating system that looks at standard work and how we do all the processes within the business so if you think about it we re deploying standard work and visual management in our finance and marketing department and sales departments as well so while that may not drop out clearly as what we call traditional productivity it certainly allows us to increase our cycle time and increase our market share going forward by serving our customers better phil ng jefferies analyst thanks a lot really appreciate the color operator your next question comes from the line of scott schrier from citi your line is open scott schrier citi analyst hi good morning so a little bit following up on that last question i think earlier in the call you had said that you expect about 10 million of realization in 19 and then if i look at your guidance at the midpoint for the year it implies roughly 33 operating leverage seems like will be about 18 without that 10 million and i know you ve gone through some of the price cost to mix headwinds and everything i m wondering how that operating leverage kind of falls into where you look at your fixed and variable cost structure and then if i think about what s bracketing the guidance on the assumptions what s in there at the higher end of the range and what s in there at the lower end of the range gary s michel chief executive officer okay so if you think about it i think it s great question a couple of things on the jem and productivity side that s a part of it right so we re driving obviously we ve got price that we ve been talking about price realization to be positive this year as opposed to drag last year we ve got productivity that we ve driven into the business regardless of the rationalization and modernization program we re driving productivity in all parts of our business so that we re driving that leverage the rationalization and modernization portion effective part of our business across the enterprise and across the segments but that s where we re investing in standard work new automation and it will ultimately be a little bit longer term but that s where the 10 million drops out the additional productivity the additional price you will see that shorter term and then in addition to that that 10 million that we ll see this year from the rationalization will then accelerate going forward toward that 100 million that we ll expect from the total rationalization by 2022 scott schrier citi analyst thanks and then another one on vpi you had spoken about the potential for expanding the business and it was already in progress can you speak to the timing and magnitude if any of whether it s incremental capex or an sg a that would be needed to really start to grow that business gary s michel chief executive officer we believe that when we look at the capabilities that exist within vpi certainly their expertise in that commercial and multifamily area we re able to leverage that across our existing coverage for the markets so be it through distribution that we already have through our sales resources and our architectural and commercial support capabilities that we currently have if we need to add resources as we grow i think there ll be incremental and they ll be part of what you would expect that would go along with the revenue but they wouldn t there s not a big huge investment that needs to go to supplement that capability i think a lot of it exists and then you ll just see we will see it as we grow that revenue base and we expand there will just be a normal incremental portion of the sg a that would be required to support that kind of sale john linker chief financial officer yes i would just add on i think we talked about on previous disclosure that the vpi acquisition would be accretive the company margin s going to be a little slow to start out this year with some integration costs and higher health benefits and things like that as we bring vpi into our plan so maybe not quite right off the bat that accretive but certainly as we get into the back half of the year and then into next year we d see that business being accretive to consolidated margins and as we go after those revenue synergies that gary mentioned and as we start to get the material cost synergies i would expect to see that start to accelerate so i wouldn t expect any headwind from sort of a sg a or capex to go after those synergies scott schrier citi analyst great thank you very much operator your next question comes from the line of keith hughes from suntrust your line is open judith merrick suntrust analyst this is actually judy in for keith most of our questions have been answered but just looking forward on what you re looking at for acquisitions would you expect them to be kind of similar to vpi and like a synergy and the cost synergy basis kind of similar to that or what s your outlook for that john linker chief financial officer so look we re going to strategic m a is the key piece of our future growth platform we feel like our future growth strategy with our global platform we ve got opportunities to look at bolt on m a kind of globally in all 3 of our geographic segments and bolt on to our existing business i d say right now in the short term leverage is a little higher it s above our target range and we re going to want to see visibility to that leverage coming down and so any m a activity here for the second half of this year is going to be fairly limited as we really work to execute on getting the core margins up integrate what we bought in the last 12 to 18 months which is pretty significant that said as we move forward leverage comes down gets through the back half of this year we think there s a great m a opportunity here for this business given our cash flow capability to really look at m a as a core competency but bolt ons that are similar to vpi right down in the middle of the fairway similar products but maybe slightly different end markets but also starting to think about adjacencies that would have synergies in our through distribution channel down the road so we think there is a great opportunity looking forward scott schrier citi analyst okay that s helpful thank you gary s michel chief executive officer you re welcome operator your next question comes from the line of john lovallo from bank of america your line is open peter galbo bank of america analyst thank guys this is actually pete galbo on for john john i just wanted to confirm to one of the earlier questions around tariffs i think last quarter you had said that if tariffs went to 25 it would be 12 million to 17 million potential hit is that incremental relative to the 10 or would that have been the kind of the total overall hit that you would have seen going from 0 to 25 john linker chief financial officer no that was all in sorry i got to speak back there i think that would be all in tariff expectation for the full year it was included in our recent original guidance peter galbo bank of america analyst got it okay okay and maybe just switching gears if you guys could talk about you had a number of new product introductions that you had mentioned john at the builder show you had mentioned kind of a potential to start looking at maybe some composite based windows and other products can you just give us any update there maybe advantages that you see from offering composites whether it s from a price point and maybe what you think the market opportunity could be in that material john linker chief financial officer so yes we did hopefully that feedback is not coming through and you ll my answer but we didn t launch a number of products at ibs went through a few of those in the prepared remarks we did tease out the composite we re working toward that and we ll be launching that product for the market for commercial production later in the year and we ll be giving a lot more information about the product at that time but we do think there s a real opportunity there with new materials innovation is going to be key not only in windows space but also for doors and we re seeing innovation that s really crossing the business globally so we re able to use these material innovations as well as product innovations across all 3 of our operating geographies and actually across windows and doors as well so we think the composite is a great example there we talked about finishield earlier as an alternative to vinyl which has some better capabilities there as well did you get that answer or was that peter galbo bank of america analyst no i did it came through sorry about that is there any way gary maybe just in north america to put out a potential total market opportunity for composite windows or is that something you guys are not willing to disclose at this point gary s michel chief executive officer yes we don t typically talk about that but as we get closer to the commercial launch we ll certainly give you some more commercial color on that probably later in the year judith merrick suntrust analyst got it okay thanks guys operator your next question comes from the line of steven ramsey from thompson research group your line is open steven ramsey good morning maybe you can talk a little bit about abs and is that a kind of an ongoing or permanent headwind to north america margins and as far as internal improvement initiatives go is abs a part of this john linker chief financial officer good morning so in terms of abs and some of the other value added distribution acquisition that we did also mmi which was done in late 17 we had indicated at the time those deals with done yes initially it s slightly dilutive to company margins but when you start to look at sort of the throughput the total throughput opportunity for us of for jeld wen of being able to sell our richer mix of our products both interior and exterior doors through those channels that we thought there was an opportunity to have the total margin benefit that the jeld wen going to be accretive over time and particularly as we look to take out cost so i d say in north america in q1 abs yes was slightly dilutive to segment margins in q1 but as we kind of look through the second half of this year and into next year as we drive in some of those revenue synergies and also taking some of the cost out through potential facility rationalization we would view the kind of total opportunity to jeld wen as being a accretive scenario steven ramsey got you so you re saying that thesis going in for purchasing those companies still holds john linker chief financial officer yes absolutely yes we re happy with those acquisition so far integration is on track and feel good about where we are steven ramsey great and then last question on q1 demand and sales i d be interested to hear in areas that were not weather impacted can you talk about how demand was and if possible to break that out by the new construction side and the repair remodel side thinking north america there gary s michel chief executive officer yes i don t think we ll break it down any further than we already have other than to say that like i said earlier core slightly down on revenue overall but we had we have the benefit of those areas that were impacted would have been growth we saw the mix piece much more of a repair and replace retail versus residential new construction we expect in the second half that to start flipping in the other direction steven ramsey great thank you operator there are no further questions at this time mr gary michel i turn the call back over to you gary s michel chief executive officer thanks a lot and thank you all for joining us today we do appreciate your interest in your questions i d like to leave you with a couple of thoughts i m real pleased with our sequential and sustained improvements that we ve demonstrated across many parts of our business over the last few quarters we delivered positive productivity for 2 quarters in a row and also maintained our service levels with our customers we achieved year over year core margin improvement for 2 consecutive quarters and price cost is now a tailwind as opposed to the headwind that it was for most of 2018 we re confident that we have improved our operational performance combined with new product innovation these will lead to an acceleration of core revenue growth additionally we continue to make the investments that are required to drive margin improvement in future quarters as we proceed toward our long term ebitda margin target of 15 this includes executing on our footprint rationalization and modernization plan and accelerating to deployment of jem tools across the organization we look forward to speaking with you all again at the end of quarter in a few months and provide another update on our progress

with brent d griffiths the ticker investors so far aren t buying what trump trade hawks are selling but the administration is challenging the wall street consensus that a major trade deal with china is still close at hand after a turbulent day in the market that ended with stocks paring early losses u s trade representative robert lighthizer and treasury secretary steven mnuchin stoked new fears that negotiations could unravel by accusing the chinese of backing away from earlier commitments to economic changes the market is already on edge a pair of sunday tweets from president trump threatening to ramp up tariffs on chinese imports sparked the monday morning sell off with the dow jones industrial average tumbling 471 points stocks recovered most of those losses the dow closed down 66 points when news broke that a chinese delegation still planned to travel to washington this week in hopes of finalizing a deal advertisement market watchers say investors are mostly concluding that the administration s tough talk amounts to bluster aimed at securing the best possible terms the president s tweets seemed to come out of nowhere nobody seemed to know what the president s rationale was and what it meant for talks later this week said david lafferty senior vice president and chief market strategist at natixis investment managers but the chinese are still coming and the market reflected that after a bad opening longer term this is a good indication of what we ve been saying this is the new normal in u s china trade relations research notes from big wall street firms reached similar conclusions goldman sachs economists for example placed the odds of a tariff escalation at just 40 percent after trump s sunday tweets from my colleague heather long dow is down 225 points why isn t it a worse as tariff man returns answer my inbox is full of wall street notes saying this is just a negotiating tactic goldman sachs gives it only a 40 chance that tariffs on china will jump to 25 by friday pic twitter com 8x5wggc2g2 heather long byheatherlong may 6 2019 and stephen myrow managing partner at policy research firm beacon policy advisors said monday afternoon that investors he talked to mostly concluded the president dialed up his rhetoric as a negotiating tactic right now the base case is he was blowing off steam myrow said but he added there is a legitimate risk that trump imposes the tariff increases and a market that has priced in a done deal hasn t appropriately accounted for the possibility advertisement mnuchin and lighthizer on monday brushed aside worries over the impact on the economy or financial markets of a talks collapse my colleagues david lynch and bob costa write mnuchin said stock market concerns were playing no role in the administration s strategy we know however that trump tracks the stock market impact of his ongoing faceoff with beijing and at least one bank is warning investors that a market now flirting with all time highs could prompt trump to conclude he has more leash to drive a harder bargain with the chinese thereby menacing the market s performance a bofa merrill lynch global research note on monday called trump s threat to jack up duties on 200 billion worth of imports from 10 to 25 percent the most significant escalation of the us china trade war to date and argued the soaring market has given him license advertisement markets the bank said could be in for a bumpy ride before a trade deal is reached long time no email you ve no doubt noticed this newsletter has been on an extended hiatus over the past few months so i wanted to offer a word about where i ve been for the last three and a half years i ve been battling bile duct cancer a rare and nasty disease with excellent medical care and good luck i won the first round against it in 2016 but it returned last year once again thanks to some brilliant medical care we managed to keep the disease contained to my liver in january i had a liver transplant a procedure that offers a very good shot at a cure the recovery was a little bumpier than expected but i m feeling much better and eager and excited to get back to bringing you the

administration expects to host chinese vice premier liu he and a chinese team for further talks in washington on thursday evening and friday my colleagues david and bob write but with the officials publicly underscoring weekend anti china broadside prospects for a deal this week as the administration had hoped for appear to be fading advertisement deal still possible this month a plugged in source emails with the view from china full resolution of trade agreement may slow by a week or two but intentions not changed from beijing side the popular view in china is decidedly darker my colleague anna fifield reports from beijing that on the chinese internet trump is a marvel supervillain who can wipe out half the universe with a snap of his fingers but in trump s case it s the chinese stock market he scorched with his threats to raise tariffs if beijing doesn t bend to his demands on trade trump s threats deepen gop trade rift the post s seung min kim and erica werner trump s threat to impose tariffs on 200 billion of chinese goods has further inflamed the relationship between him and senate republicans over trade as the gop lawmakers fight an increasingly losing battle to push trump away from his protectionist instincts senate majority whip john thune r s d who met with trump last week on the issue said monday evening he was worried about the potential impact of trump s latest threat against china and that other republicans were trying to make their case to the white house i don t think anybody is getting through on that issue at the moment said thune the no 2 senate republican we re going to keep trying advertisement bannon to trump don t compromise stephen k bannon trump s former chief strategist argues in a post op ed that it would be futile for the president to strike a deal with the chinese the trade deal under negotiation this month is not a deal between two similar systems seeking closer ties as its cheerleaders on wall street and in the media and academia argue rather this is a fundamental clash between two radically different economic models the president s best political option is not to surrender but rather to double down on the tariffs they have been highly effective in pressuring the chinese without harming the u s economy pillsbury trump is right to drive a harder bargain michael pillsbury a hudson institute scholar who advises the white house on china argues in a wsj op ed a big long term deal may not be possible it s hardly surprising that the long negotiated deal appears to be falling apart china has been busy in these final three weeks trying to weaken the deal that s beijing s modus operandi string the west along then renegotiate and take back earlier concessions from the gullible barbarians treasury secretary steven mnuchin on may 6 denied house democrats request to turn over president trump s tax returns video reuters mnuchin refuses to turn over trump s taxes mnuchin formally said the administration would refuse to release trump s tax returns which all but guarantees that house democrats and the white house are headed to a court battle advertisement my colleagues damian paletta and jeff stein report mnuchin in a letter to house ways and means committee chairman richard neal d mass said he had consulted with the justice department and that they had concluded that it would not be lawful for the trump administration to turn over the tax returns because of potential violations of privacy the administration s fight with congress centers on whether requesting six years worth of trump personal and some of his business related tax returns mnuchin told house democrats that the justice department will back up his decision in a published legal opinion as soon as practicable but as damian and jeff report a number of legal experts have said it would be unprecedented for mnuchin to refuse to turn over the tax returns as the power for lawmakers to seek the returns is written explicitly in a 1924 law advertisement neal responds i will consult with counsel and determine the appropriate response neal has been lambasted by some progressive groups for moving too slowly to jumpstart the process to obtain trump s returns but the massachusetts democrat has said the reason he has been so methodical is to justify a possible court fight market movers fed warns on corporate debt wsj s andrew ackerman the federal reserve identified rising sales of risky corporate debt as a top vulnerability facing the u s financial system according to a report released monday officials

public debate about the reserve bank is never too far away and went up a notch higher in the run up to south africa s may 2019 national elections the ruling african national congress said it intends to nationalise the central bank there is no hidden agenda there is no manga manga business president cyril ramaphosa told a parliamentary question and answer session in march 2019 the anc s push for nationalisation is supported by the economic freedom fighters the second largest opposition party in august 2018 the eff tabled the south african reserve bank amendment bill which seeks to make the state the sole owner of the bank it is still under consideration by the national assembly nationalisation is opposed by the democratic alliance the official opposition and several economists including reserve bank governor lesetja kganyago say the bank should remain independent yet others have argued nationalisation will not make much difference but what does it all mean there are many arguments many of them confusing in this factsheet we go back to the basics and answer nine key questions about the reserve bank 1 what is the south african reserve bank the reserve bank is the central bank of south africa it was established in 1921 to protect south africa s commercial banks after a rise in the gold price following world war i put them at risk it took over responsibility for holding gold and issuing bank notes the bank has since taken on a number of other duties and its mandate is protected by the south african constitution 2 what does the reserve bank do its main function is to protect the value of the rand south africa s currency the bank says a stable currency reduces uncertainty in the economy one way to protect a currency s value is by controlling inflation an overall increase in the price of goods and services commemorative banknotes launched by the south african reserve bank are seen in this july 2018 picture photo afp inflation is measured by defining a basket of goods and services that a typical person would buy the increase or decrease in the cost of that basket over time gives you the inflation rate a positive inflation rate means people have to pay more for the basket even though no extra items have been added it also leads to other distortions in an economy the reserve bank tries to control inflation by setting a target for price increases from one year to the next currently the inflation rate should range between 3 and 6 the bank tries to meet this target using policies such as setting the rate at which commercial banks can borrow money or requiring them to keep a cash reserve but why is a stable currency important it ensures that what i can load in my supermarket trolley this month can also be afforded next month or in six months from now without me having to adjust my budget charles wait professor emeritus in the economics department at nelson mandela university told africa check this is particularly important for people who can t increase their income when prices rise think of pensioners or those relying on social grants from the state a stable currency also helps businesses plan for the future with greater certainty there are less concerns about the prices of inputs and outputs or the cost of expanding activities wait said the same is true for the government when it draws up its medium term budget of costs for the next three financial years one complication in estimating costs in year three is the degree of inflation that is likely to occur between year one and two for example the budget presented to parliament in february 2019 was planned during 2018 but has to forecast until end of march 2022 an unstable currency would complicate this further wait explained 3 how does the bank function on a day to day basis the bank also provides some banking services to the central government and oversees the movement of currency between countries it is also the banker for commercial banks it provides banks with cash when there are cash shortages holds some of their cash reserves and supervises the south african banking system in general the reserve bank also issues banknotes and coins commercial banks then make these available to the public 4 is the reserve bank independent the bank enjoys a considerable degree of autonomy it says on its website its mandate and independence are guaranteed by the constitution which says the bank must perform its functions independently and without fear favour or prejudice the constitution is the highest law of south africa any changes to the constitution require support from two thirds of the national assembly and six out of nine delegations from the national council of provinces so changing the founding structure of the reserve bank would not be easy some people including the reserve bank governor believe this is rightly so a central bank has normally got a monopoly in producing the country s banknotes and coins wait said it holds the key to the printing press that key must be kept under a safe lock because if too much money is printed and put into circulation we can get a situation where too much money chases too few goods this could result in hyperinflation seen in zimbabwe and more recently venezuela this could especially be the case where a government not understanding the risks of inflation and overspending sees a country s central bank as a source of funding for its budget deficit a budget deficit is when a government expects to spend more money than it collects according to a guide to south african government budgets the sarb is legally restricted in its ability to bailout the government in cases of the latter s budget deficits when mboweni was the president of the sarb he spoke about the need to tighten these screws said wait at times of undesirably high levels of inflation this independence is essential for the bank to be able to carry out its constitutional mandate of protecting the value of the currency 5 who owns the reserve bank the bank is owned by about 750 private shareholders who together hold 2 million shares most shareholders are individuals but some shares belong to companies trusts provident funds and unions for example anglo american a multinational mining company and discovery a south african financial services group own 10 000 shares each the national library of south africa owns 200 and the nelson mandela children s fund owns 100 during the march 2019 parliamentary question and answer session ramaphosa expressed concern about the bank s external shareholders who live in various countries in the world the bank s latest shareholder index report shows that about 11 of its 2 million shares are foreign owned 6 who can buy shares anyone can buy shares over the counter the bank regularly publishes the price of its shares and the number of shares available as at 7 may 2019 shares were trading at r8 each there are currently 3 786 shares on offer to sell investors may not buy more than 10 000 shares each and a prescribed maximum yearly dividend has been set at 10 cents per share this means that even if an investor owns 10 000 shares the most they can make in a year is r1 000 7 what powers do shareholders have shareholders have the power to elect seven of 15 board members attend the annual ordinary meeting of shareholders at the bank approve the annual report on the state of the economy appoint external auditors shareholders do not have the power to influence monetary policy instruct the day to day management of the bank appoint executive board members these last three functions are carried out by the monetary policy committee the bank s governors and the south african president respectively 8 what other assets does the reserve bank have the bank is almost 100 years old in that time it has built up a portfolio of assets that include shares gold and foreign exchange reserves as at march 2019 these assets totalled r793 billion 9 what would nationalising the reserve bank mean nationalising the bank would make the government its sole owner according to ramaphosa this would confirm south africa s sovereignty prof jannie rossouw head of the school of economic and business sciences at wits university wrote in august 2018 that a change of ownership would not necessarily be a bad thing a large number of central banks have been nationalised since 1945 he told africa check so the world trend is in favour of nationalisation with shareholding becoming a rare exception disclosure jannie rossouw was previously employed by the reserve bank and owns shares in the bank there is a misperception that ownership would give the government control over the bank s monetary policy the shareholding structure and whether we nationalise or not will have no impact whatsoever on the constitutional mandate of the bank rossouw said prof andrè roux head of the futures studies programmes at the university of stellenbosch business school agreed shareholders actually have very limited rights he said so nationalising the reserve bank won t make much difference unless the constitution is changed which i think is very unlikely

hardball trade negotiations global week ahead the global week ahead is going to be dominated by u s china trade war headlines advertisement advertisement writing that seems stupid you clearly read and or heard about what happened on sunday the global risk markets and surely the chinese trade delegation were blindsided by a trump tweet just last week i could pluck this u s china trade negotiation quote for you u s china trade negotiations recommence on wednesday in washington it is thought to be plausible that a deal may be announced as soon as the end of next week and a xi trump summit could be held soon thereafter the usual people familiar with the negotiations have indicated that a deal is in the works to phase out some of the bilateral tariffs scotiabank advertisement advertisement that all went down the drain after a sunday tweet by president trump he went public with a long standing threat to lift tariffs on 200b of china imports to the us from 10 to 25 this is to happen on the coming friday is this a hardball negotiation tactic yes does it have the ability to work that s anyone s guess story continues here is what we got from president trump first thing on monday morning the united states has been losing for many years 600 to 800 billion dollars a year on trade with china we lose 500 billion dollars sorry we re not going to be doing that anymore next are five big reuters world market themes likely to dominate thinking of investors and traders in the global week ahead i force ranked them for equity markets 1 sell in may and go away in 2019 with cross asset volatility at record lows it s a great backdrop for investors to load up on risk reams have been written on the reasons for falling volatility but logic attributes it first to major central banks recent tilt back into dovishness and second to the global economy s tepid but steady expansion with few inflation surprises so low is cross asset volume that a gauge compiled by brokerage intl fcstone stands 3 6 standard deviations below the mean in other words it deems that a vol surge has less a 0 02 percent probability of occurring and with that has come willingness to go short safe assets such as gold or treasuries and on protective hedges such as the vix the latter is a measure of how much s p500 options are expected to fluctuate essentially a vol gauge outstanding shorts on vix futures have reached record highs cftc data shows surpassing the build up seen before last february s volmageddon blowup advertisement advertisement unsurprisingly some market watchers advise caution as volmageddon showed vol can spike spectacularly in a quiet market sometimes driven by just one unexpected data point after all if the old adage holds some people may be looking to sell in may and go away 2 big tech earnings in the u s and china forecast smashing results from facebook amazon and apple have laid to rest any short term worries about the so called faang group of tech titans google and netflix the other members of the cohort were less sweet but not disastrous hopes now are that asian big tech will confirm the comeback signals mid may is when china s baidu alibaba and tencent update us on their earnings advertisement advertisement for msci s global tech index net earnings revisions are at their strongest in over six months with 60 percent of it companies having reported so far almost 90 percent have beaten expectations according to ubs coming after a string of downgrades before march that s a relief however global tech earnings growth is expected to slow compared with 2018 but after two years of double digit growth a pullback may represent a return to normal rather than a worrying drop it s more than likely that growth hungry investors will return to backing big tech 3 the latest u s consumer and producer inflation numbers come out this month s fed meeting saw chairman jerome powell play down recent weakness in u s inflation as transitory and declare the policy stance appropriate his failure to give any hints that the central bank was weighing interest rate cuts disappointed the s p500 and pushed money markets to slash rate cut bets for this year to around 40 percent from over 60 percent it will also have earned powell the ire of president trump who has slammed the fed boss for not doing more to support the economy advertisement advertisement so is powell right in his view of inflation some recent indicators from first quarter growth to factory orders to productivity have been pretty strong the flip side is manufacturing is growing more slowly and inventories are building so we ll need to see whether consumer and producer inflation figures due may 9 and 10 confirm the inflation backdrop is indeed transient 4 watch out for a raft of global macro data this week data more important than usual these days as markets try to decide whether the green shoots cropping up in some places are the real deal take the eurozone growth was faster than expected in the first quarter after slumping in the second half of 2018 u s and chinese first quarter gdp surpassed expectations too while the bank of england has just raised growth forecasts for 2019 advertisement advertisement so will upcoming data u s and chinese trade numbers surprise to the upside as well germany releases industrial orders figures on tuesday and friday brings a raft of british data including first quarter gdp for sure one week of brighter data isn t enough to shift entrenched pessimism so while citi s economic surprise indexes for europe and united states have started ticking higher they remain in negative territory nor have brighter growth numbers managed to lift german 10 year bond yields much above zero percent yet but keep watching that data 5 australia and new zealand hold monetary policy meetings who will cut interest rates first adrian orr or philip lowe the reserve bank of australia run by lowe meets on may 7 followed by the reserve bank of new zealand headed by orr a day later both have the same story to tell low inflation strong labor markets and limited room to cut interest rates both economies have strong links with china where growth is slowing advertisement advertisement lowe has the added complication of a federal election in may orr will be dealing with a new monetary policy committee that now includes external members the rising aussie kiwi exchange rate suggests investors see a greater chance of a cut in new zealand if the rba which has held policy steady for 29 meetings cuts on tuesday the rbnz would have more reason to do so three other asian central banks also meet malaysia thailand and the philippines the last says rate cuts are inevitable but many expect the other two to deliver easing signals as well top zacks 1

executive officer john cappasola president and chief executive officer thank you steve we appreciate everyone joining us on the call today although our quarterly results were negatively impacted by unfavorable weather in california and throughout the west as well as the anticipated three week shift of the latin season we are encouraged by our recent second quarter trends which i will cover in a moment and we are reaffirming our full year guidance for the first quarter systemwide comparable restaurant sales decreased 0 1 franchisees again outpaced company operated restaurants growing 0 4 versus a decline of 0 6 at company operated restaurants average check growth at company operated restaurants was 4 9 including nearly 1 in menu mix growth driven by our mix two promotion and the return of our seasonal seafood promotion although transactions declined 5 5 we made progress on our portfolio optimization strategy which is designed to help grow auvs and stimulate new unit development by shifting our portfolio mix to 55 franchise by summer 2020 our company operated footprint will predominantly reflect strong auvs and restaurant margins in our core western markets plus a strategic presence in our emerging markets we expect this also to drive a sharpened operational focus and financial benefits including improved company auvs and restaurant margins reductions in recurring existing unit capital and reduced exposure to cost side inflation in california concentration during the first quarter in the los angeles area we refranchised 13 lower volume company operated restaurants to strong existing multiunit operators and acquired three high volume franchised restaurants to help better position all of these restaurants for auv growth we have also retained the cypress group a leading restaurant and franchise investment banking firm to manage the refranchising of company operated restaurants in four non core western markets the marketing process has commenced and is targeting new or existing franchise groups with proven restaurant operations capabilities and a strong consistent track record of new unit development who commit to continued brand growth in existing and or other markets additional development updates include opening four franchise restaurants and one company restaurant so far this year these 5 openings span 5 total states demonstrating the geographic breadth of our growth and an additional 9 restaurants are currently under construction which puts us in a good position to deliver our annual guidance of at least 25 new restaurants we also recently signed a three unit development agreement for southern brevard county in florida as we enter the second quarter our transaction initiatives are gaining traction including our digital transformation value evolution and menu innovation on the digital front our new app has now exceeded 500 000 registered users since launching last november we are excited about the long term potential this marketing platform has to drive guest frequency as it continues to scale and we are planning to expand its functionality to include mobile ordering for pickup or delivery this summer during the first quarter delivery through grub hub was enabled for substantially all company operated del taco locations and we plan to leverage a multiple dsp approach to maximize consumer demand by adding post mate and door dash later this year our second transaction driving initiative is enhancing our core value program this began late in the first quarter with the launch of our 4 00 5 00 6 00 fresh favs boxes these full meal deals include two or three entrees french fries and a drink and help address growing consumer demand for abundant value with price points and variety that further differentiate del taco from the competition fresh favs boxes were met with strong demand and mixed at approximately 6 with a typical margin percentage profile and they work in concert with buck and under and buck and change to expand our value offerings from a la carte items to bundle meal deals last but certainly not least we are using menu innovation to drive traffic in incremental del taco occasions with the exciting recent launch of the beyond taco and beyond avocado taco which are now available in all restaurants as guest demand for vegan and vegetarian options continues to grow we took the opportunity to partner with beyond meat an innovative leader in plant based proteins to be the first mexican qsr chain to develop a proprietary blend of seasoned 100 plant based protein a key objective as we developed our beyond taco strategy was competitive differentiation which we attacked on three fronts flavor variety and convenient value the team did a great job developing a proprietary and unique flavor profile that tastes incredibly similar to our current ground beef allowing us to broaden its appeal to not only attract vegans and vegetarians but also those looking for better for you options or to reduce red meat without sacrificing flavor next is variety our beyond ground protein can be substituted for any other protein or added on any menu item including burritos nachos bowls or salads this provides best in class variety to our guests and endless future product innovation opportunities for our culinary team and lastly convenient value the beyond tacos have a recommended 2 49 price point representing only 1 00 premium from our del taco this incredible value coupled with our convenient drive throughs makes our beyond tacos broadly accessible to maximize the launch of beyond we developed a dynamic combined solution strategy that leverages marketing and operational touchpoints to create real impact for our brand and our guests our operational efforts are paying off with early guest experience measurement survey results showing a high level of guest satisfaction for beyond tacos even higher than the very successful del taco following its launch the marketing team complemented our operational preparedness with a 360 degree plan including very targeted public relations and social media campaigns to drive buzz and excitement leading up to the launch these efforts generated over 728 million online and print media impressions through the first week including placements in usa today buzzfeed and over 70 television newscasts the advertising highlights that the future of tacos is here and available in all of our markets similar to our tests since launching 11 days ago we are very encouraged by increases in both check and traffic as this new product platform is bringing in many new or lapsed users and appealing to regular del taco guests who are all eager to sample our beyond taco offerings this has translated to a strong 6 product mix so far supporting the unique appeal of this product we believe the beyond platform will drive sales while further strengthening our qsr brand position and we see incredible future opportunity to expand this protein across our menu looking ahead we are encouraged by the sequential improvement in transaction trends which have helped to restore positive comparable restaurant sales thus far in the second quarter as we cycled the latin calendar shift and began to benefit from our transaction driving initiatives including our digital transformation and core value program enhancements more recently since the april 25 launch of beyond tacos our check and transaction same store sales trends have improved significantly which reflects favorably on our outlook particularly as prior year compares ease in the second half we are pleased to reaffirm our full year outlook and remain excited about all that is happening at del taco we remain confident that our digital value and menu innovation strategies will drive comparable restaurant sales growth that we will pair with effective margin management strategies and now steve will review our first quarter financials and annual guidance steven brake executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks john total first quarter revenue rose 1 5 to 114 2 million from 112 6 million in the year ago first quarter systemwide comparable restaurant sales decreased 0 1 and lapsed systemwide comparable restaurant sales of 3 7 during the first quarter of 2018 resulting in a two year increase of 3 6 first quarter company restaurant sales increased 0 8 to 105 9 million from 105 1 million in the year ago period this increase was driven by contributions from additional company operated stores as compared to the first quarter last year partially offset by a company operated comparable restaurant sales decline of 0 6 first quarter company comparable restaurant sales was comprised of a 4 9 increase in check including nearly 1 of positive menu mix offset by a 5 5 decline in transactions franchise revenue increased 7 2 year over year to 4 1 million from 3 8 million a year ago the increase was driven by additional franchise operated stores as compared to the first quarter last year including 13 restaurants that were refranchised during the first quarter as well as by franchise comparable restaurant sales growth of 0 4 turning to our expenses food and paper costs as a percentage of company restaurant sales decreased approximately 40 basis points year over year to 27 2 from 27 6 this was driven by menu price increases partially offset by modest food inflation of over 1 including increased distribution costs looking ahead we expect net food inflation of approximately 2 5 3 in each of the next three quarters and continue to expect annual 2019 food inflation of approximately 2 3 labor and related expenses as a percentage of company restaurant sales increased approximately 80 basis points to 33 9 from 33 1 this was driven by wage inflation from the recent 1 00 california minimum wage increase to 12 00 an hour partially offset by the impact of lower payroll taxes menu price increases and slight dollar and percentage reductions in group health insurance and worker s compensation occupancy and other operating expenses as a percentage of company restaurant sales increased by approximately 220 basis points to 23 1 from 20 9 last year this was driven by inflationary trends including increased insurance expense due to adverse general liability claims development coupled with the negative comparable restaurant sales which created deleverage as much of our operating expenses is fixed in nature in addition the adoption of the new lease accounting rules unfavorably impacted our occupancy and other operating expense and restaurant contribution margin by approximately 90 basis points based on this performance restaurant contribution was 16 8 million compared to 19 3 million in the prior year and restaurant contribution margins decreased approximately 260 basis points to 15 8 from 18 4 general and administrative expenses of 10 5 million up slightly from 10 4 million last year as a percentage of total revenue g a decreased by approximately 10 basis points year over year to 9 2 this decrease was driven by significantly reduced management incentive compensation mostly offset by general inflationary trends and increased stock based compensation expense adjusted ebitda of 12 1 million compared to 13 9 million last year as a percentage of total revenues adjusted ebitda decreased 180 basis points to 10 6 from 12 4 last year note these reductions include the unfavorable 0 7 million impact from the adoption of the new lease accounting standard depreciation and amortization expense was consistent at approximately 5 9 million each year reflecting a larger company operated restaurant base offset by the reclassification of our build to suit leases to occupancy and other operating expense under the new lease accounting rules as a percentage of total revenue depreciation and amortization declined 10 basis points to 5 2 interest expense was 1 8 million compared to 1 9 million last year the decrease was due to the reclassification of our build to suit leases to occupancy and other operating expense under the new lease accounting rules mostly offset by an increased one month libor rate and the higher average outstanding revolver balance compared to the first quarter of 2018 as of the end of the first quarter we had 154 million outstanding under our revolver and our applicable margin for libor loans remained at 1 75 income tax expense was approximately 0 6 million for an effective tax rate of 28 as compared to 1 2 million during the first quarter of 2018 for a year ago effective tax rate of 27 1 net income was 1 4 million or 0 04 per diluted share compared to 3 2 million or 0 08 per diluted share last year in addition we re reporting adjusted net income which excludes restaurant closure charges sublease income for closed restaurants and other income related to insurance proceeds adjusted net income in the quarter was 1 7 million or 0 04 per diluted share compared to 0 2 million or 0 08 per diluted share last year turning to our repurchase program covering common stock and warrants during the quarter we repurchased 270 874 shares of common stock at an average price of 10 30 per share and 840 255 warrants at an average price per warrant of 1 78 for an aggregate of 4 3 million at fiscal quarter end approximately 25 4 million remained under the 75 million authorization during the quarter we completed two sale lease backed transactions for net proceeds totaling approximately 10 million and we refranchised 13 los angeles area restaurants for net proceeds totaling 2 1 million we also acquired three los angeles area franchise restaurants for 3 1 million finally as john stated we are very pleased with the recent sales momentum and are reaffirming our fiscal 2019 guidance for the 52 week period ending december 31 2019 please refer to today s earnings release for the details on our outlook thank you for your interest in del taco we are now happy to answer any questions questions and answers operator at this time we will be conducting a question and answer session if you would like to ask a question please press 1 on your telephone keypad a confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue you may press 2 if you would like to remove your question from the queue for participants using speaker equipment it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the key one moment please while we pull for questions our first question comes from the line of greg badishkanian with citi please proceed with your question greg badishkanian citibank analyst hi guys this is actually spencer hennis on for greg so i just had a couple questions the first one was on the beyond meat offering there s been a lot of press around that can you just talk about the different types of customers that you re attracting with that offering and then are you happy with the supply that you currently have with that product given the seems like pretty high demand for it john cappasola president and chief executive officer yeah sure you know overall we feel great about the launch of beyond tacos the team s just done a wonderful job preparing the restaurants to provide a great experience with the product and overall experience with the brand and as expected we are seeing some new faces as well as a lot of trial among our existing guests so great opportunity here from a consumer standpoint i think generally this is the type of customer that is in qsr today and qsr just does not traditionally provide an m grade option and we feel like we can we feel like we can deliver on that for them from the value and a convenience standpoint and in regard to the supply we feel good about it we re kind of in line with our partner at beyond meat and we re monitoring it as we go but there s nothing that our plans haven t accounted for at this point greg badishkanian citibank analyst okay great and then on the refranchising you guys mentioned in the release that you ve made some progress on that can you talk about the interest you re getting for that from like owner operated buyers and then financial buyers how does that mix john cappasola president and chief executive officer yeah so it s early days we just really commenced and announced last week with cypress through a press release of course we have been getting some initial inquiries over the last couple of months since we talked about it at icr and on our earnings call from both internal and external so we ve been capturing those and we ll follow up i mean the main purpose of this obviously is growth and part of this process why we wanted to use the cypress group was to make sure that we approached it in a robust fashion so that we could find the right cultural fit for this brand that has great operational capabilities as well as the proven track record of growth and that is really the driver that kind of latter part is really the driver of what we believe will be the final kind of outcome here with this process so we re not in any hurry as we said we re looking to get this done by the summer of 2020 and we ll move through the process with the mindset of quality over quantity and kind of see where we re at here over the next few months greg badishkanian citibank analyst okay perfect thank you operator our next question comes from the line of peter saleh with btig please proceed with your question peter saleh btig analyst great thanks i m just wondering if you guys would elaborate a little bit on the quarter to date trends how should we be thinking about traffic i know you said it sequentially improved just any sort of guidance here would be helpful john cappasola president and chief executive officer yeah sure peter so we ve seen sequential improvements during q2 in traffic and same store sales obviously starting with the launch of fresh favs boxes which also by the way coincided with the favorable latin rollover so we had the unfavorable rollover in q1 and then favorable as we moved into the backend of q1 and into early q2 but nevertheless fresh fav boxes we saw some momentum coming out of that program and then we ve seen further acceleration recently with the launch of beyond tacos so we think overall these two initiatives as designed puts us just in a great position to compete more effectively for transactions immediately while we work to scale our digital platform via mobile app and delivery peter saleh btig analyst and then on the beyond tacos how much of this do you think is trial versus a more sustainable trend in terms of same store sales sorry go ahead john cappasola president and chief executive officer yeah i mean i think there s definitely excitement around the launch i mean we re 11 days in right now so there s a lot of excitement you know the media s kicked off the pr plan was great and the things that i can say about it thus far are that it s behaving very similar to what we saw in our test markets so the sales mix is in a similar ballpark i think we said on the last call that we were seeing incremental check and traffic from the program in our test markets we re seeing that in the early days of the launch thus far so i think all signs are pointing toward a very similar outcome that we saw in our test markets but clearly on a system program like this with a lot of buzz around beyond meat in particular we wanna just continue to execute really well and we ll see where it shakes out here over the next several weeks but early days we re pretty excited about the program peter saleh btig analyst and then just on the margin profile of the beyond tacos are they in line with the rest of the menu are they margin accretive margin dilutive how should we be thinking about that as well steven brake executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah peter the margin percentage after food is slightly lower than our overall normalized margin profile that said with the extra dollar per taco plus the upcharge if they add it into any other item the margin dollars flowing through from that transaction we re gonna be very very happy with so we see it as best a margin dollar driver without a doubt very modest percentage contraction perhaps depending on where the mix settles but as john said very happy with it and it s gonna be a nice driver for us as we move forward peter saleh btig analyst great thank you very much john cappasola president and chief executive officer you got it operator our next question comes from the line of craig bibb with cjs securities please proceed with your question craig bibb cjs securities analyst hey i guess i ll ask the same question in a different way you guys are very data driven in your management of the company admirably so can you give us i bet you know the percentage of beyond order ers that are new to your concept john cappasola president and chief executive officer yeah so it s early to be able to tell that craig i mean you know if i got your question right you re looking for the new users related to the beyond taco launch craig bibb cjs securities analyst yes john cappasola president and chief executive officer right okay yeah it s early days i mean anecdotally what we would tell you having a lot of the leadership team s been out in restaurants and we ve been talking to franchisees and talking to operators on regular calls and we continue to see and also get reports back that we as i said we re seeing new faces in the restaurants i mean we ve had stories even on social media of folks talking about having never been to del taco before and this giving them a reason to check out the brand so that was why we wanted to be really focused on the operational element walking into this program because we felt like we would see new faces or maybe some lapsed users and so it created an opportunity for our operations to do what they have done well with combined solutions and really keep those guests and get those guests coming back again tomorrow so that s our utter focus as we speak today is just continuing to maintain a high level of experience for those new guests coming in so probably have a bit more color on that as we move through time here but anecdotally it does feel like there are some new faces coming in craig bibb cjs securities analyst okay and then on the refranchising efforts in the quarter i know they were high volume units and low volume units but you bought three for 3 1 million and you sold 13 for 2 1 million i must be missing something john cappasola president and chief executive officer well certainly the three we bought we feel very happy with that transaction we don t disclose transaction multiples but we feel good about that acquisition being certainly earnings accretive in a nice baked in return investment from day one on selling the 13 you know we d said before that they were low volume 1 1 million auv or even inside that we don t have a lot of low volume units but those were and they have a much lower restaurant contribution margin think definitely single digit not dramatically above the 5 royalty that we re gonna receive going forward so not a lot of net ebitda was sold by the way we re now one area manager or area director lower than we would have been which is a significant g a save so the effective ebitda we sold just wasn t a big number and i ll just tell you that 2 1 million in net proceeds we feel good about that and we also believe we set these buyers up with stores that definitely have upside and we re looking forward to working with them to un tap that upside craig bibb cjs securities analyst okay on labor on a per operating week basis you did spectacular given the 1 00 increase in minimum wage how material was the offset from worker s comp and lower payroll tax steven brake executive vice president and chief financial officer in the first quarter worker s comp and health insurance were they were both down on dollars and percent not down a lot probably more notable for first quarter was we went over that futa f u t a federal unemployment tax kind of surcharge that we talked about in the fourth quarter that was retroactively eliminated last year so we were paying and rather accruing that tax first quarter a year ago as you know in the fourth quarter that ended up being reversed and was not paid because it went away so i d say that the favorability is lapsing that in this recent quarter definitely more significant than worker s comp and health insurance we probably lapsed about half of the dollar impact of that payroll tax going away the next couple quarters there ll be a lower amount that is favorable as we lapse in q2 and q3 then q4 we go over the reversal a year ago so there s a little bit of a cadence there that as we go forward we ll do a good job trying to illustrate how that s playing out craig bibb cjs securities analyst okay great thanks a lot steven brake executive vice president and chief financial officer you re welcome john cappasola president and chief executive officer okay thanks operator our next question comes from the line of nick setyan with wedbush securities please proceed with your question nick setyan wedbush securities analyst thank you it s great to hear that sequentially the trends have improved steve would you mind reminding us when your next pricing action might be and if they sort of upwards of 4 pricing is still the plan or potentially we could see a little bit more pricing as the year progresses steven brake executive vice president and chief financial officer sure so we have been in a cadence of making three pricing moves per year that would be very early spring summer and fall so far this year early spring we did take some price that resulted in us carrying just a hair over 4 during the first quarter there s also a early summer increase that has now been authorized so that will kick in as we approach summer that s gonna result in us carrying just again a hair over 4 during the second quarter then timing and what we re lapping will result in us carrying right about mid 3 during our third fiscal quarter as we get into fall naturally our fall price increase that has not yet been determined will give use the opportunity to hold that 3 5 potentially boost it back up as you know we take a very scientific approach as well as taking a look at the marketplace and competitor actions and the trends within our business so that s where we can talk about basically q1 is 4 q2 is 4 q3 will be about 3 5 and then fourth quarter to be determined but i d expect it to be at least in that 3 5 4 area in line with our guidance nick setyan wedbush securities analyst very helpful thank you john any updates on the grub hub partnership how that s going i don t know if you would be willing to share any percentage of sales type of information and also what the timing of the post mate and door dash rollout is that q3 is that q4 john cappasola president and chief executive officer yeah sure so we are feeling like we re on track with our rollout as i said nearly all of the company restaurants are on grub hub with pos integration and incidentally the franchisees are right behind so we ve got a lot of franchisees that are opting into the program now as well and i think roughly the numbers as of today were about 50 of the franchise restaurants are in the process are in some stage of rollout so we feel good about that as well with momentum building on that side of the house and you can plan that door dash and post mate will also be added with some pos integration later this year can t give you an exact timeframe right now it s just the nature of technology and getting technology up and running in our restaurants is we wanna make sure we do it right so my hope is that as we get through the summer months and into the early fall that that ll be happening in a lot of restaurants with both of those providers and that s certainly the aim but we also wanna hedge for things that just come about as you re implementing new technology so overall feel good about where we re at in regards to the performance as i said i think on the q4 call the overall average volume if you look at it on a per day per store basis is relatively low and part of that is that we just haven t implemented the full strategy just yet so we need to get all three of these dsps kicked in and we believe that the restaurants that are experiencing smaller demand are going to do nothing but improve as that really kicks in that said nick we are seeing some locations that are significantly outperforming and our multi dsp test also shows greater demand than the single dsp so the performance should continue to grow as we build awareness through marketing and add these additional dsps to optimize demand nick setyan wedbush securities analyst that makes sense especially with the market share post mate and door dash have in some of your markets and then just kinda last question on the margins as we kinda think about the back half steve we ve got a little bit more inflation in food costs we ve potentially got other op ex hit from the third party delivery rollouts labor we have another minimum wage increase so how are we thinking about getting to maybe the low end or the midpoint of the margin guidance is it just a function of where comps end up being for the rest of the year or are there other things in terms of operations that you guys are focused on to be able to get to those types of margins for the year steven brake executive vice president and chief financial officer it s a little bit of all the above i would say that kind of comp momentum certainly would be high on that list of what can put us in ideally a better position to have margin performance i shared the level of pricing that certainly what i shared means we re gonna be in that up to 4 area certainly which is elevated it goes a long way to protecting margins and enhancing margins and as you know if we can couple with that with continued menu mix which we ve had a nice long track record of doing the nice sequential improvement especially of late in traffic that s very exciting so i d say that comp equation is gonna play the heaviest role along with that and we talked about the food prep equipment that is now well in place in all our restaurants several months ago working with the operators to really do the best they can to streamline labor scheduling enhancements has also been an ongoing work in process lot of things going on in the food basket in terms of strategies looking at portion optimization packaging freight strategies a lot going on there probably to some degree that s baked in the guidance but just really that ongoing margin management focus is something that we remain very focused on nick setyan wedbush securities analyst perfect thank you very much steven brake executive vice president and chief financial officer you re welcome operator our next question comes from the line of jeremy hamblin with dougherty and company jeremy hamblin dougherty and company analyst thanks congrats guys on the improved results i wanted to just come back to the commentary around beyond taco here and traffic trends i just wanted to make sure i had this clear so prior to the launch of beyond taco it sounded like you had seen comps go back to positive quarter to date in q2 prior to the launch of bt is that correct john cappasola president and chief executive officer correct jeremy hamblin dougherty and company analyst okay and then in terms of what you said further from that on the traffic trends did you say traffic had returned to positive territory post bt launch john cappasola president and chief executive officer yeah so we didn t say we said that we d seen sequential momentum and then acceleration with beyond tacos trend we wanna be careful with it but i will say that we ve definitely seen some days of positive traffic here since the launch of beyond tacos but like i said earlier it is early days of the program lots of excitement and pr and i m sure you ve all been watching the social media and the presence that it s had out in the marketplace so we wanna be careful with that because there s a lot of momentum associated with it but we feel good that it s absolutely doing what it was supposed to do which is to bring in an incremental occasion and bring some new users to the business and drive some traffic so early days feel good about it jeremy hamblin dougherty and company analyst and then just one more on that product launch in terms of having a higher price point with slightly lower food margins you know in terms of you guys do big business on let s say taco tuesdays in terms of usage by your customers a little bit to the prior question of the type of customers coming in in terms of units moved when somebody s coming in are they buying the beyond tacos with the regular taco or just in terms of pattern are you seeing people just come for the beyond taco and if so are they because of the higher price point buying fewer units of that product than somebody who might come in and just say i m looking for five tacos john cappasola president and chief executive officer yeah it s a good question but it s jeremy it s really early on on the system launch of this so i d say it s definitely a mixture of both and you can imagine one of the reasons we wanted to make sure that the ingredient tasted very similar to our ground beef product which is in our tacos is because we do see a broader general market opportunity here beyond just vegans and vegetarians where folks are just simply looking to reduce red meat consumption and a lot of those folks are actually in qsr today so we wanna make sure that we re serving them well i think that could be a larger opportunity in the long run obviously but so a mixture of behavior when you look at a new user that s coming in for beyond tacos exclusively of course they re buying beyond tacos and maybe trying a few other things versus somebody that maybe comes in and has their del taco go tos whether it be a chicken taco or a del taco or a burrito they re like just mixing the beyond taco in and trying the beyond taco and probably finding that it tastes really similar to our existing del taco jeremy hamblin dougherty and company analyst got you thanks and then last one here coming back to delivery for a second so first what kind of contribution did delivery have to your total comp in q1 part one of the question and then second is what type of impact did it have i assume on the negative to occupancy and other operating expenses in q1 steven brake executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah jeremy i think as you guys know our goal is to get to a multiple dsp platform as soon as possible namely this year so really until we get the second and third dsp up and running it s really maximized driver coverage and maximize consumer demand it would be premature to give any granular details about sales contribution and or margin and cost side dynamics because we re still early days of one dsp it s certainly not a number on either front that would be material for me to wanna call out but encouragingly as we get to that second and third dsp when volume ramps up as we ve seen in our limited testing to date down the road i think we ll be in a position to give more color along the lines of what you asked about jeremy hamblin dougherty and company analyst okay so on that 200 almost 220 basis points of deleverage on that line item there wasn t anything that was material from delivery steven brake executive vice president and chief financial officer no jeremy hamblin dougherty and company analyst okay steven brake executive vice president and chief financial officer and remember we are jeremy hamblin dougherty and company analyst thank you and good luck steven brake executive vice president and chief financial officer and we re taking the 10 premium pricing to help manage that potential so that kind of goes into my assessment there as well jeremy hamblin dougherty and company analyst thank you john cappasola president and chief executive officer okay thanks operator once again if you would like to ask a question please press 1 on your telephone keypad once again if you would like to ask a question please press 1 on your telephone keypad our next question comes from the line of nichole miller with piper jaffray please proceed with your question nicole miller regan piper jaffray analyst good afternoon a couple quick questions on the beyond meats it s very interesting discussion it sounds like everybody s coming in the door so i m curious is this happening are these orders happening online and for delivery specifically as well and then just thinking about the derivative impact if a lot of these orders are coming in the store there s gotta be a halo on your freshness queues and maybe it s too early but is that something you could see push up guest satisfaction scores which tend to be a leading indicator for instore sales john cappasola president and chief executive officer yeah nicole so on the online versus instore i mean as you can imagine it s a majority transacting in the restaurants at this point because it s the biggest part of our business versus delivery and i haven t looked granularity down at what percent of beyond tacos are happening via delivery at this point but i imagine it s probably commensurate from the standpoint of the overall pie of what you would see breaking down in the restaurants i think the opportunity that we have here with this program is definitely to bring some put a spotlight on the del taco brand and make sure that folks know that we re a brand that can deliver a value oriented qsr position and that said a big part of this was making sure that when these guests are coming in they re walking away with high overall satisfaction and so far we re seeing some of that we are definitely seeing osat on the overall beyond tacos program outperform i mentioned in my prepared remarks that they re actually both of the tacos are outperforming the launch of the del taco from an overall satisfaction standpoint so good signs there that we re delivering and executing the product well to our guests and that s what it takes in the early days of a new incremental program like this we need to be able to prove that we can deliver it deliver it well and then consumer will come back again nicole miller regan piper jaffray analyst thank you and on that point of its selling well and the 6 i believe you said mix just on the math alone that could be low single digit positive impact to sales so two things i guess you re asking us to use prudence in terms of modeling that out because you don t know what s trial and awareness or permanent albeit the del taco was a permanent driver for quite some time of instore sales and then again just not to overlook or overshadow that before this you saw a positive momentum or an increase in momentum on the core business correct steven brake executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah that s correct we think certainly the fresh fav boxes as well as the down spat helped propel the sequential improvement that started as we got into the second quarter but without a doubt a nice acceleration in the last 11 days nicole miller regan piper jaffray analyst okay and just on the math i mean if 6 mix and it s all incremental this is a big impact right but just use prudence is that kind of the idea john cappasola president and chief executive officer yeah i wouldn t call it 100 incremental at this point because we know existing users are trading into the product right because that s the bigger general market opportunity i referenced certainly could it provide incremental frequency among an existing user absolutely it could now clearly when it s bringing in a new or lapsed user that s an incremental transaction and we don t have the depths with it just yet because it s 11 days in to be able to quantify the percentage that are completely new user incremental but on either side of the fence it s really something that can provide some traffic boost nicole miller regan piper jaffray analyst that s great thank you so much and then just on the refranchising efforts you bought in three stores was that packaged in with the stores you refranchised and a few that that buyer did not want or were these separate and are you working as the intermediary and then you ll refranchise those or are these part of your permanent collection steven brake executive vice president and chief financial officer so the 13 we ve sold were to three different existing franchisees who had a nice track record of performance and all those groups had bought other stores off of other franchisees so we felt great about those three separate transactions that laddered up to the 13 restaurants we sold the three we bought in was frankly a long term franchisee who was ready to retire and move on to other things in life so that was a totally separate transaction so we bought those three in in a very mature well run part of the southern california so we feel great about that being a permanent part of our portfolio moving forward both those transactions are really separate from the non core market refranchising effort that is certainly live in the market with cypress group as john said that s really all about getting new or existing folks to have interest in the brand that will stimulate growth into the future nicole miller regan piper jaffray analyst thank you steven brake executive vice president and chief financial officer you re welcome operator our next question comes from the line of steve anderson with maxim group please proceed with your question steve anderson maxim group analyst yes good afternoon i have a couple housekeeping questions first with regard to your other food commodities you know i ve noticed that looking at ground beef prices and actually beef in general has been going up how confident do you feel about maintaining your guidance even as beef prices start to go up and i have a follow up steven brake executive vice president and chief financial officer knowing what we know right now the 2 3 for the full year we feel good about as i said we re a little over 1 in q1 so q1 wasn t a terrible level inflation i did say the next three quarters we re looking at 2 5 3 so certainly some of the pressure you alluded to we are seeing in the marketplace not to mention that avocados are not in a great spot currently lettuce has had some challenges the proteins we remain focused on we do have some buys out on the calendar to give us some protection there across certainly chicken but also a number of our beef items we re also watching the asian swine fever quite closely as well so as we sit here today i think the guide s good but obviously we re gonna keep our eye on it steve anderson maxim group analyst okay and the follow up s really you mentioned higher insurance cost i saw a couple of your peers late last year that was an impact that lasted for a couple of quarters in some cases how confident do you feel that the higher insurance costs you saw in q1 won t be repeated in future quarters in terms of like claims steven brake executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so in the first quarter the challenge we had insurance was in occupancy another was our general liability insurance a portion of which is self insured so we had some customer claim situations develop adversely on us in the first quarter i believe that was fairly transitory as we get beyond the first quarter i think that should normalize back to a typical run rate the other insurance items we ve talked about from time to time worker s comp has continued to be a good guide for us with year over year reductions i d see that kinda normalizing as we go forward i don t see it as a opportunity or a threat and then health insurance we had a nice renewal this year and we should have a pretty good stable if not slightly favorable run rate on that insurance line this year as well so i think that should round out the insurance topics steve anderson maxim group analyst all right thank you steven brake executive vice president and chief financial officer you re welcome operator since there are no further questions left in the queue i would like to turn the call over back to mr cappasola for closing remarks john cappasola president and chief executive officer okay everyone thank you for your interest in del taco today and we look forward to sharing our progress on future calls have a great day operator this concludes today s teleconference you may now

most people expect that our signal of an impending reduction in world oil or coal production will be high prices looking at historical data for example this post and this post this is precisely the opposite of the correct price signal oil and coal supplies decline because prices fall too low for producers these producers make voluntary cutbacks because the prices they receive fall below their cost of production there often are supply gluts at the same time this strange situation arises because prices must be high enough for the producersat the same time that goods and services made by oil and other energy products are inexpensive enough for consumers to afford there is a two way battle taking place 1 prices producers require tend to rise over time because of depletion the easiest to extract portion of any resource such as oil coal copper or lithium tends to be removed first what is left tends to be deeper lower quality or otherwise more difficult to extract cheaply 2 prices consumers can afford for discretionary goods such as cell phones and automobiles tend to fall for a combination of reasons wages of many workers fall because of competition from lower cost labor in other countries some jobs are eliminated through the use of computers or robots young people are increasingly being required to pay for higher education beyond that which is provided free leaving many with loans to repay reducing their discretionary income changes to us healthcare law mostly starting january 1 2014 lead to required health insurance premiums while some citizens find cost savings in this approach healthy young people often experience cutbacks in discretionary income as a result rents and home prices keep rising faster than incomes when the discretionary income of the many non elite workers of the world falls they buy fewer finished goods and services finished goods and services are manufactured using commodities of many kinds including oil coal copper iron ore and fresh water when discretionary demand falls commodity prices tend to fall this is the problem we are encountering now it tends to cause the prices of many commodities to fall below the cost of production eventually producers decide to quit because production is no longer profitable this is the issue that leads to peak oil coal or copper if the affordability price clash mostly affects non elite workers does it matter when i talk about non elite workers i am talking about workers who are in the bottom 90 of the wage distribution elite workers will always have enough income for the necessities of life there are so many non elite workers in the world that they indeed do make a difference also the forces that adversely affect non elite workers tend to have several effects they tend to send a larger share of wages to elite workers as the economy becomes more complex and more specialized they tend to send more unearned income to elite workers through capital appreciation because elite workers can afford to buy shares of stock and expensive homes the wealthy spend their income differently from non elite workers non elite workers tend spend the bulk of their discretionary income on devices made using commodities such as cell phones and automobiles the wealthy are likely to spend their discretionary income in less energy intensive ways such as investing in shares of stock and buying services such as private college education for their children history shows that economies tend to collapse when wage and wealth disparity becomes too great collapse can take various forms including revolutions by the disgruntled underclass increased susceptibility to epidemics or the financial collapse of governments wars become more likely as one country tries to aid its citizens at the expense of citizens of other countries the world today seems to be approaching a crisis point with respect to wage and wealth disparity young people in particular are adversely affected figure 2 shows a chart indicating that wage disparity seems to be back to the level it was at the time of the great depression of the 1930s this was also a time of low commodity prices and gluts of food and oil gluts tend to occur because commodity prices rise to a level where devices made with these commodities such as cell phones and automobiles become too expensive for non elite workers to afford elite workers can still afford the devices but there are not enough elite workers to make up for the shortfall in non elite buyers of these devices so industrial output per capita tends to fall figure 3 shows the important role that the wages of non elite workers play in generating adequate demand if their wages are high enough they can buy enough goods and services made with commodities to keep commodity prices high with sufficiently high commodity prices production can continue why the peak in world oil production likely occurred in 2018 if we look at recent oil data we see a pattern of growing gluts in supply as indicated by the red bars in figure 4 even in the most recent week the week ending february 15 2019 after all of the cuts begun by opec and other oil exporters us crude oil stocks continue to build this is not the impact a person would expect if the production cuts are truly effective this is precisely the kind of signal we would expect if products made with oil and using oil in their operation are becoming increasingly unaffordable for the non elite workers of the world note that these bars are becoming more frequent and are occurring at lower prices this is the expected outcome of a clash between the falling discretionary income of non elite workers and the rising costs of oil producers when prices fall too low producers cut back production opec reports its view of the effect of recent production cutbacks in figure 5 given the nearly worldwide problem of falling affordability of goods by non elite workers we should not be surprised if the peaks in oil production in october and november 2018 ultimately prove to be the maximum production ever recorded in fact it seems quite likely that the year 2018 will prove to be the year with the highest ever oil production the cutback in production will appear to be voluntary once cutbacks start they will tend to feed upon themselves unless oil prices really spike following the cutbacks say to 90 per barrel exporting countries will find themselves worse off after the cutbacks for a combination of reasons the cutback in production will reduce the number of workers directly and indirectly employed by the oil industry their reduced spending will lead to a need for expanded government programs housing prices will fall in oil exporting countries this is likely to ultimately lead to debt defaults tax revenue that governments of oil exporters can collect on the smaller amount of oil will be lower even though the needs of the economy will be greater ultimately it seems likely that at least some governments of oil exporting countries will be overthrown depressing oil production further if the breakeven price for most opec members including necessary tax revenue was over 100 per barrel in 2014 it is hard to see how exporters can get along with much less today world coal production following a similar pattern to oil one thing that most people don t realize is that coal prices follow a very similar pattern to those of oil in figure 6 coal prices experience a major peak in 2008 followed by a lower peak in the 2011 period which peters out by 2013 prices recently are much lower than in the 2008 period or in the 2011 to 2013 period this pattern is very similar to the recent pattern in oil prices the similarity in the patterns of coal prices and oil prices makes perfect sense if prices of both oil and coal are based primarily on affordability and this affordability depends heavily on the wages of non elite workers when countries such as china ramp up their debt more non elite workers can be hired at higher wages these workers can make more computers automobiles steel ingots and many other goods they can also afford to buy more output of the world economy this ramped up demand tends to raise the prices of both coal and oil for many commodities china s demand represents close to half of the world demand china has become the world s number one manufacturer of goods china needs growing energy consumption to maintain its growth of manufactured goods because it takes energy to operate machines even computers it even takes energy to keep the lights on unfortunately with the recent lower prices for coal and oil china is experiencing lower production of both coal and oil figure 7 without growing energy supplies china cannot meet the world s growing need for manufactured goods the reason why china has recently reduced production of both coal and oil is the usual one the rising cost of production conflicts with the low prices available in the marketplace making production unprofitable for a growing share of producers how about china s total energy consumption do imports make up for china s lack of local production not really china is the world s largest importer of coal oil and natural gas it is also the number one user of wind and solar included in the tiny orange other renewables portion of the chart even with these huge additions to china s energy production its annual growth in the quantity of energy it consumes including imports has plummeted figure 9 china reports that its real gdp growth rate is still very high over 6 net of inflation but many observers are skeptical of this claim certainly going forward its coal and oil production cannot continue to decline or the economy will encounter huge problems the amount of goods china will be able to manufacture will fall as will the number of new homes it can build without continued growth china is likely to run into debt default problems china is such a large country that its problems can be expected to adversely affect the world economy as a whole figure 10 shows that china produces nearly half of the world s total coal if china s coal production declines world production is also likely to decline the only way to prop up coal production for either china or the rest of the world is higher prices indirectly coming from higher demand from non elite workers businesses can perhaps use rising debt to hire these non elite workers but if there is not a sufficient supply of buyers who can afford the additional goods and services made by these workers the final outcome will be debt defaults the fundamental problem is a physics problem the fundamental problem is that the economy grows for the same reason that hurricanes ecosystems stars and plants and animals grow they are dissipative structures that grow in the presence of energy flows in the case of hurricanes the energy comes from the heat in the warm ocean in the case of the economy the energy flows are of many different types including among others human energy energy of draft animals solar energy fossil fuels and wind energy one key characteristic of dissipative structures is that they are not permanent permanent growth in a finite system is not possible the laws of physics sets up the system in such a way that dissipative structures grow and eventually collapse over time new dissipative structures form each varying in a random way from previous dissipative structures those best adapted to the ever changing circumstances tend to last the longest this is the way that the evolution of economies takes place just as the evolution of plants and animals takes place one characteristic of economies is that physics determines how much energy is needed to manufacture and transport a particular product it also determines how much the mix of buyers can afford to pay for finished products using this energy thus physics determines the potential profitability of a particular manufacturing process with lower energy costs tending to make production more profitable as energy costs rise because of diminishing returns the system eventually reaches a point where it must collapse the cost of production rises so high relative to wages that many non elite workers cannot afford the finished goods and services made by the system the laws of physics also determine what wage distributions must look like given the availability of energy and other resources in general if there are not enough resources to go around some members of the economy tend to get frozen out by low wages in addition in a low energy per capita situation the energy that is available tends to rise to the top to the high earners of the economy somewhat like heating water transforms it to its gas phase steam which rises to the top with this structure even with a severe energy shortfall some members of the economy can be survivors with today s worldwide economy the survivors might be some humans and businesses within the world economy the system would need to start over building up smaller economies from pieces that managed to stay intact but the system as a whole would not die out unless the energy shortfall were to be severe modeling the world economy one issue with academic research today is that it tends to be divided into many academic silos researchers tend to know more and more about their own field but less and less about other fields that might be peripherally related for example economists tend not to keep up with the physics of self organizing networked systems geophysicists understand the physics that governs the extraction of fuels but they have no insight into the fact that the laws of physics might also affect prices and wage distributions without understanding the forces that are causing the results that are being observed it is very easy to create a model that is more misleading than helpful for example a simple model of the earth is the one each of us can see as we look around us the model shown in figure 11 is a flat map this is a perfectly good representation of what the earth looks like if a person is not concerned about what happens at a distance of course to extend the map out a person really needs to convert the model into a globe a globe is a very different model economic researchers tend to have some of the same modeling issues as illustrated by the flat map model economists favor fitting curves to past data to forecast the future patterns curve fitting tends not to be good for determining turning points when dealing with energy and other resources we are really interested in when a turning point will happen forcing production of energy products and resources of many kinds downward another model favored by economists is the standard two dimensional supply and demand model figure 12 this model ignores the special role that energy products play because of the operation of the laws of physics energy products as they work through the networked economy affect both the supply and demand of finished goods and services making the two dimensional model shown inappropriate with neither curve fitting or nor the standard supply and demand model sounding an alarm with respect to energy prices not being able to rise forever economists have tended to overlook this issue of course policymakers are happy to hear happily ever after endings few policymakers question the reasonableness of the models they do not consider the possibility that the falling discretionary income of non elite workers around the world might choke off demand for goods made with energy products even geophysicists who have looked at the problem tend to get the story only half right they understand underground physics but they tend not to understand that prices cannot rise indefinitely this is a different related issue also associated with the physics of the situation climate change is our biggest problem is a corollary to bad modeling if a person truly believes that energy prices can and will rise forever then it is an easy corollary to assume that all fossil fuels that we can identify within the earth s crust will eventually become extractable there are no limits except for the limits imposed by climate change of course if we are really hitting price limits here and now the situation is likely to be very different these price limits will cause a very near term decline in energy supply which we essentially have no control over financial systems are likely to collapse international trade will be scaled way back world population is likely to fall co2 levels will in time adjust to this radically changed world i showed earlier in how the peak oil story could be close but not quite right that the models used to prove that wind and solar can be helpful to the system greatly overstate their benefit to the system as a result we don t really have evidence that wind and solar are even helpful to the system consequently we really have two false models working together to give an illusion that we have a huge problem which is fixable if we just exert enough effort physics puts a cap on our efforts however the physics of the system makes the system collapse before policymakers can hope to even make a small fix the unfortunate problem is that policymakers are not really in charge the laws of physics are in charge energy and other resources are no longer inexpensive enough to extract to allow the system to work the proposed solutions wind and solar are not cheap enough to save the system either we can temporarily hide the problem with more debt indirect promises of future energy at lower interest rates but this does not fix the system conclusion many of the problems the world economy is facing today seem to be the result of reaching the limits of energy extraction very few researchers understand how a self organized networked economy really operates as a result the symptoms of economic health and economic illness have been confused it looks quite possible that we have reached both peak oil and peak coal approximately simultaneously this is a frightening situation because it could be an indication of collapse in the next few years this would likely be much worse than the depression of the 1930s of course even with these observations we do not know precisely what lies ahead somehow multicellular animals have lived on this earth for a very long time amazing coincidences have happened and may continue to happen allowing economies to flourish we humans do not have as much control over the current situation as we would like to think that we have fortunately we cannot rule out the possibility of more amazing coincidences perhaps even caused by a literal higher power behind the energy flows thus the result may be different from what our models seem to suggest gail e tverberg graduated from st olaf college in northfield minnesota in 1968 with a b s in mathematics she received a m s

information presented in accordance with gaap management uses additional measures known as non gaap financial measures in its evaluation of past performance and prospects for the future the primary additional measures used by management are earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization including our proportionate share of depreciation and amortization and gains and losses on significant asset sales of unconsolidated entities gains and losses on asset sales and asset impairments and gains on investments in unconsolidated entities adjusted for certain selected items impacting comparability adjusted ebitda and implied distributable cash flow dcf management believes that the presentation of such additional financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding our performance and results of operations because these measures when used to supplement related gaap financial measures i provide additional information about our core operating performance and ability to fund distributions to our unitholders through cash generated by our operations and ii provide investors with the same financial analytical framework upon which management bases financial operational compensation and planning budgeting decisions we also present these and additional non gaap financial measures including adjusted net income attributable to paa and basic and diluted adjusted net income per common unit as they are measures that investors rating agencies and debt holders have indicated are useful in assessing us and our results of operations these non gaap measures may exclude for example i charges for obligations that are expected to be settled with the issuance of equity instruments ii gains or losses on derivative instruments that are related to underlying activities in another period or the reversal of such adjustments from a prior period the mark to market related to our preferred distribution rate reset option gains and losses on derivatives that are related to investing activities such as the purchase of linefill and inventory valuation adjustments as applicable iii long term inventory costing adjustments iv items that are not indicative of our core operating results and business outlook and or v other items that we believe should be excluded in understanding our core operating performance these measures may further be

impacting comparability is material to the evaluation of our operating results and prospects although we present selected items impacting comparability that management considers in evaluating our performance you should also be aware that the items presented do not represent all items that affect comparability between the periods presented variations in our operating results are also caused by changes in volumes prices exchange rates mechanical interruptions acquisitions divestitures expansion projects and numerous other factors these types of variations may not be separately identified in

items impacting comparability 2 we use derivative instruments for risk management purposes and our related processes include specific identification of hedging instruments to an underlying hedged transaction although we identify an underlying transaction for each derivative instrument we enter into there may not be an accounting hedge relationship between the instrument and the underlying transaction in the course of evaluating our results of operations we identify the earnings that were recognized during the period related to derivative instruments for which the identified underlying transaction does not occur in the current period and exclude the related gains and losses in determining adjusted results in addition we exclude gains and losses on derivatives that are related to investing activities such as the purchase of linefill we also exclude the impact of corresponding inventory valuation adjustments as applicable as well as the mark to market adjustment related to our preferred distribution rate reset option 3 we carry crude oil and ngl inventory comprised of minimum working inventory requirements in third party assets and other working inventory that is needed for our commercial operations we consider this inventory necessary to conduct our operations and we intend to carry this inventory for the foreseeable future therefore we classify this inventory as long term on our balance sheet and do not hedge the inventory with derivative instruments similar to linefill in our own assets we treat the impact of changes in the average cost of the long term inventory that result from fluctuations in market prices and writedowns of such inventory that result from price declines as a selected item impacting comparability 4 we have certain agreements that require counterparties to deliver transport or throughput a minimum volume over an agreed upon period substantially all of such agreements were entered into with counterparties to economically support the return on our capital expenditure necessary to construct the related asset some of these agreements include make up rights if the minimum volume is not met we record a receivable from the counterparty in the period that services are provided or when the transaction occurs including amounts for deficiency obligations from counterparties associated with minimum volume commitments if a counterparty has a make up right associated with a deficiency we defer the revenue attributable to the counterparty s make up right and subsequently recognize the revenue at the earlier of when the deficiency volume is delivered or shipped when the make up right expires or when it is determined that the counterparty s ability to utilize the make up right is remote we include the impact of amounts billed to counterparties for their deficiency obligation net of applicable amounts subsequently recognized into revenue as a selected item impacting comparability we believe the inclusion of the contractually committed revenues associated with that period is meaningful to investors as the related asset has been constructed is standing ready to provide the committed service and the fixed operating costs are included in the current period results 5 our total equity indexed compensation expense includes expense associated with awards that will or may be settled in units and awards that will or may be settled in cash the awards that will or may be settled in units are included in our diluted net income per unit calculation when the applicable performance criteria have been met we consider the compensation expense associated with these awards as a selected item impacting comparability as the dilutive impact of the outstanding awards is included in our diluted net income per unit calculation and the majority of the awards are expected to be settled in units the portion of compensation expense associated with awards that are certain to be settled in cash is not considered a selected item

now turn the call over to vicki vicki please go ahead vicki hollub president and chief executive officer thank you jeff and good morning everyone i d like to start by recognizing that many would like to discuss our proposal to acquire anadarko which we will address but first i plan to cover the excellent results we achieved in the first quarter and reiterate that our commitment to our value proposition remains unchanged creating shareholder value continues to be our number one priority our integrated business is delivering outstanding results and we continue to be a leader in each area we operate we are dedicated to returning cash to our shareholders delivering industry leading returns and executing our strategy during the first quarter we did just that we returned 800 million through dividends and share repurchases driven by excellent results from all three of our business segments since 2002 we ve returned 34 billion of capital to our shareholders and our assets continue to generate free cash flow for future distributions in the permian basin our operational expertise and deep knowledge of the sub surface is unmatched and the well productivity that is clear we get more oil from our wells in the short and long term which generates high value and low development costs we are rapidly advancing our geo mechanical and flow unit modeling driving breakthroughs in completion design and well spacing and mitigating parent child impacts oxy has delivered 23 of the top 100 horizontal wells in the permian which is the most of any operator while as only drilling 4 of the total wells over the same time period we also continue to delineate our acreage and new benches for future development with outstanding results from five different benches in new mexico our leadership extends far beyond the permian we have a strong international reputation as a low cost operator maximizing the value of new and old fields and delivering major projects around the world on time and on budget over the last year we grew our position in oman the uae and colombia by a total of over 6 5 million gross acres and these assets will greatly enhance our value proposition for shareholders we recently implemented a new completion design in the middle east which is generating more oil and improving returns for oxy and our partners we re excited about the impact these breakthroughs will have on our future development plan our unique low carbon ventures business is also making progress on reducing our carbon footprint by advancing technologies and policies that support the capture and sequestration of anthropogenic co2 which will reduce carbon emissions while enhancing the economic development of our reserves we are currently working to advance the midwest industrial carbon capture strategy that can capture a significant amount of industrial emissions and reduce our total carbon impact through the use of this co2 in our eor operations this project will take partnership and advancement of technology but we are motivated and have begun engagement to help promote this opportunity we look forward to sharing more details on this project in the future we also plan to release our 2019 climate report this month which provides further details on the significant progress we ve made on our long term climate and sustainability strategy on slide five i want to highlight how our value proposition delivered leading return on and return of capital in 2018 our ability to achieve best in class returns through investing in our high quality assets was evident as we generated return on capital employed of 14 and cash return on capital employed at 27 both significantly higher than 2017 an upper quartile performance versus our peer group this was also the highest return on capital employed that we ve generated since 2011 in addition we have returned more than 3 6 billion to shareholders through our sector leading dividend and share repurchases no other company in our peer group has such a consistent record of providing a high return of capital to shareholders these achievements reflect our commitment to our sustainable value proposition the strength of our integrated business model the high quality of our assets and the incredible performance of our employees after we have finished our review of our first quarter we will discuss the acquisitions so now i ll turn the call to cedric cedric burgher chief financial officer and senior vice president thanks vicki for the first quarter we had reported earnings of 0 84 per diluted share as all three of our business segments continue to perform well despite a lower commodity price environment we are also pleased to report that we returned 800 million of cash to our shareholders in the first quarter through our dividend and share repurchases so overall a very strong quarter across the board oil gas core income increased in the first quarter compared to the prior quarter reflecting lower dd a rates as well as a positive mark to market adjustment on carbon dioxide purchase contracts partially offset by lower crude oil and ngl prices and lower sales volumes due to the timing of liftings total first quarter reported production of 719 000 boes per day exceeded guidance due to continued best in class execution and well productivity in permian resources which came in at the high end of guidance at 261 000 boes per day international production exceeded guidance at 298 000 boes per day driven by strong operational performance in oman as well as the oil price adjustment in our production sharing contracts oxychem exceeded guidance with earnings of 265 million for the first quarter earnings increased from the prior quarter primarily due to favorable feedstock costs such as ethylene and natural gas along with fees received under a pipeline easement agreement executed in the first quarter the increase in earnings was partially offset by lower realized caustic soda pricing in addition to production being curtailed at various oxychem facilities by a third party tank farm fire in deer park texas all oxychem facilities have resumed safe operations our midstream business also exceeded guidance with the first quarter income of 279 million primarily driven by a higher midland to meh differential and a lower than expected mark to market impact compared to the prior quarter the decrease in earnings reflected lower midland to meh differential which decreased from approximately 15 to 9 78 working capital changes included cash payments typical of the first quarter including property tax and fourth quarter accruals both oxychem and our marketing businesses also experienced a working capital draw as a result of a receivable build due to higher prices and volumes slide nine details our guidance for the second quarter and full year 2019 we are on track to deliver annual production growth of 9 to 11 while staying within our capital budget of 4 5 billion due to our outstanding proposal to acquire anadarko we have suspended our share repurchase program i will now turn the call back over to vicki vicki hollub president and chief executive officer thank you cedric now turning to our proposal as you have likely seen yesterday we delivered an updated proposal to the board of anadarko as well as announced a contingent agreement to sell anadarko s algeria ghana mozambique and south africa assets to total for 8 8 billion when we complete our proposed acquisition of anadarko but before we discuss the details of those announcements i d like to quickly recap recent events related to our proposal and situate yesterday s important updates in the proper context on april 24th we announced our superior proposal to acquire anadarko for 76 in cash and stock we continue to believe in the compelling financial and strategic merits of this deal which would enhance occidental s sustainable value proposition and benefit both companies shareholders on april 29th anadarko announced its board of directors had determined that occidental s april 24th proposal could reasonably be expected to result in a superior proposal and our two companies have since been engaged for that determination on april 30th we announced that berkshire hathaway has committed to invest a total of 10 billion in occidental contingent upon the completion of our proposed acquisition of anadarko we re thrilled to have berkshire hathaway s financial support for this transaction and believe it reaffirms what we have long believed that occidental is uniquely positioned to generate compelling value from anadarko s highly complementary asset portfolio this is committed acquisition financing that provides us with the ability to increase the cash component of our proposal in a more balance sheet friendly manner than issuing additional debt yesterday we announced an agreement with total to sell anadarko s africa assets contingent upon us completing our proposed acquisition of anadarko we re pleased to have secured this agreement with total as a fast tracks inaudible divestiture plan we previously outlined in connection with our proposal our agreement with total to sell these assets to a terrific company allows us to focus all of our integration efforts on the assets most valuable to oxy the almost 9 billion sale price funds a portion of the cash consideration to anadarko while delivering on the majority of our 10 billion to 15 billion of planned asset sales importantly this sale supports our expectations around synergies and we continue to expect to deliver 2 billion of annual cost synergies and 1 5 billion of annual capital reductions from the proposed acquisition of anadarko the financial support of berkshire hathaway as well as the agreement we announced with total also help us to delever our balance sheet while focusing our integration efforts on the assets that will provide the most value for us yesterday we also delivered a revised and significantly enhanced superior proposal to the board of anadarko to acquire the company for 76 per share with revised terms of 78 in cash and 22 in stock under the terms of the revised proposal anadarko shareholders would receive 59 in cash and 0 2934 shares of occidental stock per share of anadarko pro forma ownership of the combined company would be 84 legacy occidental shareholders and 16 legacy anadarko shareholders the increased cash portion of 59 per share provides significant and immediate value greater closing certainty and enhanced accretion this revised proposal represents a premium of approximately 23 to the 61 62 per share value of chevron s offer as of friday s market close our revised proposal does not require an occidental shareholder vote which has been cited as the explanation for anadarko s board s prior selection of chevron s 65 offer over our 76 offer changing the consideration mix to be cash heavy is more accretive to us and addresses the issue that anadarko focused on as their reason for taking the lower bid last time we firmly believe that occidental is uniquely positioned to create significant and sustainable growth and value from anadarko s assets we ve studied this opportunity for almost two years this is a key long term decision for us and we understand what a great opportunity this is for us and our shareholders we encourage anadarko s board to comply with their fiduciary obligations and except this compelling proposal for anadarko s shareholders we hope we can continue to execute this merger agreement without delay and proceed to bringing in this exciting combination to fruition we ll now open it up for your questions questions and answers operator thank you we will now begin the question and answer session operator instructions our first question today will come from brian singer of goldman sachs please go ahead brian singer goldman sachs analyst thank you and good morning vicki hollub president and chief executive officer good morning brian singer goldman sachs analyst my first question is with regards to the legacy assets in first quarter results first quarter capex was about 28 of full year guidance and the permian resources capex was about 30 of the annual budget can you run through your expectations for the capex trajectory for the remainder of the year and given higher oil prices what do you see as the potential to maintain spending run rates and raise the annual budget later in the year as was done in 2018 vicki hollub president and chief executive officer no our plan is to hold the budget where it is at 4 5 billion as we had mentioned i think in the last earnings call we are going to be coming under the year hot but we are going to be slowing down activity toward the end of the year to achieve our 4 5 billion capital budget brian singer goldman sachs analyst and can you talk a little bit more about how you see that or where you see that and is it fourth quarter specifically vicki hollub president and chief executive officer it would be a combination of third and fourth quarter and it will be mostly in the permian resources business brian singer goldman sachs analyst great thanks and then my follow up is one of the advantages highlighted in your letter to anadarko and in your comments for oxy s revised bid for anadarko is that it does not require a shareholder vote recognizing that the requirement for shareholder vote at 20 equity issuance threshold is a rule from the nyse how do you and the board weigh the benefits of the stronger bid as a result of no longer requiring a shareholder vote and the cost of capital that s come to achieve that relative to the board s corporate governance objectives vicki hollub president and chief executive officer well i can say that in the year and a half that we ve been engaged in making offers to anadarko we ve always made offers up to this point that required a shareholder vote so our objective in doing this was not at all to avoid the shareholder vote it was to ensure that we had a reasonable chance to make this happen we weren t playing on a level playing field we from a governance standpoint avoiding the shareholder vote is not something that we wanted to do but rather than increase our price we felt like it was in the best interest of our shareholders to hold our price where it is and as you have seen we put our last proposal in and even though it has an 11 differential our bid still after 12 days was not declared superior so from our standpoint we saw the two options is increase the share price or provide clarity of closing we felt like clarity of closing was the lower cost even with the berkshire financing because remember our yield is 5 already the incremental 3 of the berkshire funds for us was well worth it when we took into consideration what the upside of this deal was versus losing this opportunity that for two years we ve worked on we know the upside pretty well as you know this fits within our core experience and expertise so achieving the 2 billion in synergies is quite clear for us and when you take all of that into consideration we felt that our greater fiduciary responsibility from a governance standpoint for our shareholders was to make this deal happen brian singer goldman sachs analyst great thank you vicki hollub president and chief executive officer thank you operator the next question will come from josh silverstein of wolfe research please go ahead josh silverstein wolfe research analyst hi good morning guys i m just going to stick with the synergies since you ended there you highlighted the 3 5 billion number on the initial deal and i know why you re reiterating the views today how does the berkshire financing and additional debt needed to increase the cash offer not eat into that vicki hollub president and chief executive officer well the synergies that we have are an estimate we believe actually that we can exceed those they re a conservative estimate just based on what we re achieving today we haven t built in the upside and what we and we really haven t built much of the upside at all into the model that helped us to arrive at a 76 offer price we believe that the upside in these assets is far more than what we modeled but we re being conservative in what we see with respect to not only synergies but the incremental and recovery from these wells we ve built nothing into our model for the powder river and nothing for the mineral rights trend so and then very very very conservative for dj and delaware basin and for more specifics on each of the buckets i ll turn it over to cedric cedric burgher chief financial officer and senior vice president yeah josh cedric i d just add that we have updated we have two new investor decks out there today one for the earnings one for the revised proposal to acquiring anadarko and on slide 13 i d just point you to those cash flow per share and free cash flow per share estimates for 2020 and 2021 they include our updated our synergies of course but also the berkshire hathaway financing as well as the sale of the african assets so all of that s been updated as you can see this thing is very accretive even more accretive than the priority on a cash flow per share basis and on a free cash flow per share basis you can see this deal as very powerful from an economic and financial standpoint and so when we looked at things all things considered it was just part of a more holistic approach to looking at the deal what it took to get there versus losing it especially losing it for non financial reasons the optics of a vote and so on josh silverstein wolfe research analyst got it just on those points i mean you guys are obviously willing to go out and put another bid on the table without knowing what chevron s response would be it seems as if you re finding more upside in this transaction and more willing to go out and get this deal if i m reading that correctly vicki hollub president and chief executive officer we believe this to be transformational for oxy and it s very rare in fact generational when you see an opportunity like this come along where you can check every box that you want to check from a value standpoint it s accretive to cash flow as cedric just described tremendous asset base with a huge upside also it s got scale and it s got things i believe that haven t even been evaluated yet because anadarko has been busy doing working on the dj the delaware they begun working in the powder which i believe is going to be an upside and anadarko has incredible people too so we believe that the combination of their employees continuing to have the opportunity to work these assets and with the culture they have blending into our culture which we think is going to be fairly easy transition we think that there is tremendous upside and we ve identified what we feel comfortable with and see today but i think you re right there will be more and there are things we re excited about that we re just not quantifying it josh silverstein wolfe research analyst so there is more than just the permian basin here and i am guessing that s the reason why you aren t just going out and doing one to two permian consolidation transactions vicki hollub president and chief executive officer that s right it s much more than just the permian it s the amazing cash flow from the gulf of mexico that s going to fund help to fund additional return of cash to shareholders because both the dj the delaware are close to being free cash flow generating and then you have to build on that ultimately as we go along the power river position so we re really excited about it it gives us so much more flexibility and with what we can do with our dollars and the free cash flow josh silverstein wolfe research analyst great thanks guys vicki hollub president and chief executive officer thank you operator next question will come from devin mcdermott of morgan stanley please go ahead devin mcdermott morgan stanley analyst good morning thanks for taking my question vicki hollub president and chief executive officer good morning devin mcdermott morgan stanley analyst so first question i wanted to ask is just can we get a little bit more detail on the dialog and process that you ve had here with anadarko s board and specifically what the key areas of focus or concern are for them and what has or hasn t been addressed in latest proposal i understand the shareholder vote was the key one that has now been taken out but in your letter of the board you highlighted some others like the potential board seats that anadarko was asking so just wondering if you can talk a little bit more about what in your view has and hasn t been addressed and what some of the sticking points have been in the conversation so far vicki hollub president and chief executive officer well i think as we ve go along we went back and did some rehashing of some things that we had previously looked at and we got worked through all of that their management team with our management team has been very engaged we ve got it down to working just some of the details around employees and benefits programs making sure that we re making fair and equitable decisions for both sets of the employees in both companies so it s been a 12 day process and my concern is that as we were going along and discussing things that were not they were getting to the point where they weren t quite material that our proposal still wasn t deemed superior which is why we ve we yesterday submitted the increased cash offer devin mcdermott morgan stanley analyst got it thank you and then my follow ups on actually the balance sheet so one of the changes with the revised bid is there s a higher cash component and we now have the preferred equity as you noted from berkshire hathaway in the mix but the overall pro forma leverage with more cash does at least in our estimates look higher and you ve addressed that partially with i think attractive asset sale here of the africa portfolio can you just talk about how you re thinking about the balance sheet and delevering plan here and any dialog you may or may not have had with the rating agencies as part of this revised bid cedric burgher chief financial officer and senior vice president yeah this is cedric devin so certainly it s a higher cash bid so more leverage we have mitigated that through the two transactions we ve talked about the berkshire money and the african sale so if you look at the updated numbers 2021 we re still targeting a debt to ebitda of 2 times or less and that s with the accounting consolidation of the mlp excluding the mlp it s about 1 5 times debt to ebitda and that s in a 60 scenario at 50 if we were to go to 50 immediately then 2021 excluding the mlp would be just above 2 times and debt to ebitda excuse me so that is we think manageable not optimal and as we ve said all along we will be working hard to reduce our debt further below the 1 5 times target ultimately and we have had extensive dialog with all three of our credit rating agencies that is ongoing and we still feel confident that we will be investment grade devin mcdermott morgan stanley analyst got it thank you very much cedric burgher chief financial officer and senior vice president welcome operator the next question will come from phil gresh of jpmorgan please go ahead phil gresh jp morgan analyst yes good morning just i guess a follow up to the last question on the balance sheet cedric in the last call we had you talked about there being a lot of buyer interest in the asset sales inbound interest and so i guess i was just wondering now that you ve announced this transaction with total was that the main set of assets that you were referring to or do you feel like that there are other things you re working on in the queue that could get the balance sheet in better shape faster cedric burgher chief financial officer and senior vice president thanks good question that was a definitely the largest set of assets we were receiving inbounds on there are others and we certainly have a pipeline of other transactions we think we can execute and so we can continue to delever further and overachieve our asset sales targets vicki hollub president and chief executive officer i would just also reinforce that it s been really for us very very encouraging to see the offers and the interest coming in and the fact that we believe that we will far beat our the what we ve laid out to accomplish phil gresh jp morgan analyst okay and then just to clarify on the total deal is that deal is that a done deal no matter what as long as the anadarko deal closes i e there are no other contingencies and then secondarily cedric you mentioned the leverage metrics excluding western gas if you could clarify what it would require in order to de consolidate that if that were something you re interested in just mathematically what we need to be done vicki hollub president and chief executive officer first i ll start with the total question it is contingent only on the deal going through with anadarko and i will say we re really excited about that one because to total we ve partnered with them for a long time in the dolphin project we know them well and we know that they re going to be able to maximize the value out of the africa assets and get more than anybody else could we believe and so we re excited about that arrangement and we will continue working with total on other opportunities in the middle east and other areas cedric burgher chief financial officer and senior vice president okay and then with respect to western gas mlp consolidation they current anadarko currently owns about 55 of the mlp and because of the governance structure that s unique to mlps and this one in particular you could sell down to 20 and still have effective control again through the governance set up for that mlp so you would therefore in that instance if you sold down to even 20 you would still consolidate for sure if you sell down below 20 you still likely consolidate because again there s a lot of control mechanisms that trigger consolidation so not sure exactly where the line is it probably is close to zero if not zero ownership position in the mlp before you would de consolidate but if you think about it from a standpoint of legal liability and obligations that debt at the mlp is non recourse and so in some respects it s purely an accounting nuance in terms of the consolidation and who is responsible for the debt at the mlp phil gresh jp morgan analyst okay thank you operator the next question will come from pavel molchanov of raymond james please go ahead pavel molchanov raymond james analyst thanks for taking the question you noted that share buyback has been suspended is that a purely legal step for the duration of the uncertainty over the outcome of the current process or do you anticipate keeping the buyback suspended even after closing anadarko if that happens cedric burgher chief financial officer and senior vice president hi yes this is cedric again we think it s prudent to suspend the buyback now we ve actually done that for the last month or so a little longer once we felt that this transaction had a higher probability of happening and there was enough material information that wasn t yet public we thought it was prudent thing to do to suspend it so that was kind of the first gate secondly certainly if we close on the transaction we will be suspending the buyback our highest priority will be reducing debt and we won t be buying back shares until we get down to the debt targets that we ve established pavel molchanov raymond james analyst okay clear enough can i also ask about the carbon comments previously with obviously a much more simplified asset base you ve said that you want to be 100 carbon neutral will that target continue to apply to the greatly expanded and diversified production mix if in fact this deal happens vicki hollub president and chief executive officer that will continue to be our goal it could extend that out beyond where we had initially hoped to be but that s still our goal we think that we have the strategy that can accomplish that over time and we think it s really it s our responsibility to do all that we can do to make that happen and we re really excited about what our low carbon ventures team is doing the strategy that they re putting together it s not just going to impact our operations but they are actually in a position where they are influencing and helping others too so we believe that the extent of the benefit of what we re doing will go far beyond just our company pavel molchanov raymond james analyst all right appreciate it vicki hollub president and chief executive officer thank you operator the next question will come from leo mariani of keybanc please go ahead leo mariani keybanc analyst hi guys wanted to see if you can provide with more detail around the 2 billion of ongoing annual cost synergies here what we re really trying to get at is to whether or not there s maybe some breakdown as to how of that you might see in the permian versus the dj just want to get a sense of what those synergies maybe in the dj given that scenario that i don t think you guys have operated in before vicki hollub president and chief executive officer okay i ll start with this and then we ll give you a little more view of what the full synergy outlook looks for each of the buckets but the reason we say that is we over the past few years our team our sub surface teams working with our business units the combination of those hand in hand looking at how do we improve our performance in the shale play in general have made some key breakthroughs and i have to say it s all of our teams working together from the geophysicists petrophysicists geologists engineers and even a person that we brought over from a nasa contractor who helped us look at or make it a similarity or see a similarity between looking at composites and how they fracture in the aerospace industry with how we look at our sub surface all of that together and then applying data analytics has enabled us to we believe find a breakthrough and how we look at not only how fracturing works but what you should expect your flow unit to be and once you determine what you expect your flow unit to be then you can tailor your frac designs more appropriately for what you re seeing in the sub surface and then by tailoring it you can then optimize your profit and we have gotten to the point where we re not only having really good results but we are getting predictive with it and predictive where you have 3d seismic and you can look at your attribute analysis and make some judgments and assessments on what you expect to see that s similar to what you ve already have in your analytics database so when you look at that and you look at how we ve been able to do with 23 of the top 100 wells and using less proppant than the other wells in the top 100 they used 37 i think it s 34 or 37 more proppant so when you look at that what that means is you re basing this on physics you re basing it on the science it s not we re taking a little bit of the art out of fracing and completing shale plays and so when you can do that then based on the science you can take that and apply it to other areas and that and so it doesn t matter whether you re moving geographically or vertically within the well bore science works the same and so in the delaware basin we ve taken it and we blinded some wells and found that it s predictive capabilities are really pretty good and so we know that we can do it in other shale basins as well and i have to give a shout out to our sub surface teams they ve just done amazing jobs in the business unit and working with them to look at the possibilities and to try new things and to optimize as a team it s been amazing and i never expected us to see the continuing improvement that we ve seen year on year and we re still continuing you ve seen in the basin in some areas where the productivity improvements have plateaued they haven t with us they continue to increase again from 2017 to 2018 so i think we ll see the same kind of success in the dj now i ll go to cedric for a little bit more color around the rest of the synergies cedric burgher chief financial officer and senior vice president right thank you vicki just looking at slide 12 in the updated proposal deck that we put out this morning and the synergies haven t changed so the prior deck same slide but if you look at the four different categories of synergies we ve laid out the first one domestic capital operating efficiency that really is just getting anadarko well cost down to where we currently are primarily using our oxy drilling dynamics reducing drilling costs and the proppant loading reduction which reduces the completion costs so we are going to talk a little bit more about the drilling dynamics here in a second ken is with us to help on that front and so that s the first bucket there the second one procurement and supply chain we ve talked a lot about our aventine logistics hub and the savings we get there for ourselves again we can deploy that in the permian and that strategy we can play elsewhere but primarily we ve attributed savings in the permian plus our supply chain and oscar brown s here who heads up global supply and strategy for us he can address that a little further and then the last the third bucket there general overhead and corporate it s primarily people real estate and aircraft we have one corporate aircraft plus an employee shuttle to their four corporate airplanes and so we don t think we need all of those and we can reduce that along with obviously people and duplicate offices and real estate and then we ve talked about the capital reduction synergies as well as kind of a fourth bucket for you so now i ll turn it over to ken to talk about oxy drilling dynamics and the savings we ve achieved around the world there and then follow that with oscar on supply chain kenneth dillon senior vice president and president good morning first of all i d like to say we compete and partner with majors and independent oil companies all around the world so we can actually see how far ahead we are in drilling dynamics started in permian and rolled out around the world so we re very confident in the drilling and completion synergies working with the excellent anadarko engineers in each of their assets odd is basically a holistic approach to drilling it s a mechanical specific energy focus and we have our own equations which drive our software that we install in the rigs we have our own process and it s more like a social network of drilling rather than a data book and how to design wells we optimize bit design ourselves we designed stabilizers ourselves in real time based on the results of the last well and we use data analytics to make formation by formation improvements if you look since 2014 we ve worked together with international contractors altogether so halliburton schlumberger baker are all in the same room as we re drilling each individual well everyone has a chance to have input and the focus is in the best well not the best individual company performance we ve improved hes and we ve integrated and optimized the supply chain processes since 2014 we saved over 708 million internationally and we are very confident about making those synergies that we ve talked about in this proposal i d like to hand over now to oscar on supply chain oscar k brown senior vice president strategy business development and integrated supply thanks ken and i guess just stating the obvious we ll be doubling our purchase power at occidental with the combination with anadarko so that s a huge opportunity and will be maximizing our economies of scale in terms of purchasing power and then combining both companies best practices in procurement i ll just expand a little bit on cedric s comments on aventine in that model as certainly the aventine hub is only 40 miles from the heart of anadarko s delaware basin assets and so there s real there s lots of capacity still available at aventine for all the different services and products that are managed there so that it can a huge opportunity in terms of general logistics and if you look in the map on page 11 you can really see the sort of superhighway that s formed between the southern and the northern delaware or the pro forma position and you can see there may be opportunities to expand the aventine type model to other parts of the delaware basin in addition the combined purchasing power i think we both have contracts where the increase in purchasing power will help us in terms of our cost in terms of certain equipment rig rates octg et cetera so we believe there s great opportunities in supply chain to deliver the 600 million that s noted leo mariani keybanc analyst all right very very thorough answer from you folks around the synergies here just in terms of follow up i think cedric you clearly pointed out that leverage will increase at oxy post the deal and thank you for those sensitivities around the commodity prices is there any thought process to maybe hedge some volumes out over the next couple of years to maybe eliminate some of that cash flow uncertainty in the deal here cedric burgher chief financial officer and senior vice president it s certainly an option available to us we don t think it ll be necessary as you have already seen we re way ahead of schedule on what we can do to delever and so we have historically not been an advocate of hedging for a number of reasons but it is an option available to us to help reduce the risk if we feel like we need to fall back to that none of the things and none the numbers we presented you with include any hedging leo mariani keybanc analyst okay thank you vicki hollub president and chief executive officer i ll also point out that our chemicals business and our al hosn and dolphin provide and our psas in the middle east provide some form of hedging for us so we re quite confident that the cash flow in a lower price environment will be there leo mariani keybanc analyst yeah no doubt thank you vicki hollub president and chief executive officer thank you operator the next question will come from doug leggate of bank of america please go ahead doug leggate bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi good morning everybody i just got two quick ones i think just doing a follow up to phil s question earlier regarding western gas for those of us who ve covered andarko for a while anadarko have pretty much built out their midstream facilities so the control of that asset didn t really seem to be as strategic a requirement as it was in the cost so i m just curious given that you guys have inaudible retaining the takeaway rights while monetizing this field can you just give us a little bit more of a thought as to what you see is the strategic ownership requirement of west my follow up is just a quick one on the gulf of mexico obviously oxy had some interest in it long time ago but clearly anadarko is using that harvest cash i m just curious whether you see the role of that in your portfolio as to continue to harvest cash or if you might consider yourself as perhaps a consolidator there as well as much as you expect to be in the onshore i ll leave it there thank you vicki hollub president and chief executive officer i ll start with the first one on western gas as you ve rightly pointed out doug we don t really feel like we have to necessarily own infrastructure to take advantage of it we were quite fortunate that and by design actually selected the companies that we did for the sale of our midstream last year to two what we feel like a great management teams that are very well positioned to maximize the value of those assets and to work well with us and so we have a great relationship with them the same kind of thing would need to happen for western for us to divest of it because it s important that you re working with someone who has interests that are aligned with yours when you re talking about infrastructure so i wouldn t take that option off the table as with any of our infrastructure in place today we would be willing to consider the optimization monetization of that sooner rather than later depending on the potential buyer with respect to the gulf of mexico assets our strategy would be the same as anadarko s there and that is to just use that asset to generate cash it would not be to consolidate or extend the growth it s to maintain production flat and keep our cash flow flat and anadarko has done a great job doing that and they have a superior team working in the gulf of mexico today operator our next question will come from david deckelbaum of cowen please go ahead david deckelbaum cowen analyst good morning vicki cedric and team thanks for taking my questions i just wanted to confirm included in the assumptions on capital reduction the 1 5 billion was any of that capital allocated toward the african assets this is 1 5 billion stand alone post the african divestiture cedric burgher chief financial officer and senior vice president hi this is cedric yes it was there was some capital associated with the african assets that s now been removed so we re ahead of schedule on the capital reduction targets as well with that david deckelbaum cowen analyst so how much of that was included in the 1 5 billion are you saying there is still another 1 5 billion that remains in capital reduction after this sale cedric burgher chief financial officer and senior vice president no it is about 200 million so that leaves about 1 3 billion remaining david deckelbaum cowen analyst okay so there was nothing for mozambique included in there then cedric burgher chief financial officer and senior vice president that s about 200 million for the next year so a total of 400 million excuse me 200 million was ex mozambique and then 200 million with mozambique david deckelbaum cowen analyst okay i appreciate that and then just as a follow up i know pro forma you talked about the capital reduction and then slowing the combined growth rate down to 5 is that purely a function of trying to augment as much free cash as you can in the first couple of years just to delever more quickly and then if it s not the case would oxy stand alone be better suited growing at a lower rate cedric burgher chief financial officer and senior vice president so yeah good question we think that 5 is a very healthy growth rate it s very sustainable for many many many years and on a larger asset base this would obviously be transformational taking us up in terms of scale and size we think that s an appropriate growth rate and it certainly does help increased free cash flow so that we can delever more quickly and then stand alone we have also considered doing that as well as you know last year up until the middle of last year we were replacing a lot of cash flow that we had exited second tier basins in countries and replacing that organically rather than through m a we accomplished that plan in the middle of last year and then we were surprised with the qatar loss of the qatar cash flow and so we ve been replacing that as well so we ve been headed in that direction as well internally we just haven t yet announced that but i can tell you that s where we re headed fairly soon if we were to lose out on the anadarko deal david deckelbaum cowen analyst appreciate that thank you for the responses guys cedric burgher chief financial officer and senior vice president you bet operator and the final question will come from richard tullis of capital one securities please go ahead richard tullis capital one securities analyst sure thanks good morning everyone vicki in the past oxy has referenced about 3 000 drilling locations in the permian resources with breakevens below 50 oil how would the anadarko delaware basin properties generally rank within oxy s existing inventory on a rate of return basis vicki hollub president and chief executive officer i think that they would fit well within the top couple of tiers if you look at the as oscar had referenced slide 11 previously where it shows the portion of their acreage that is in between barilla draw in southeast new mexico there is some prime acreage in there and there s some certainly we believe quite a few tier 1 opportunities i think their inventory there we believe could be over 10 000 wells and we believe that it would be very very similar to our inventory and we expect that over time because of the lower cost that we can imply as a result of the entire trend our two areas with theirs we can further lower costs and infrastructure synergies so that will be able to move more wells down into the less than 50 breakeven category richard tullis capital one securities analyst thank you that s helpful and that just lastly not trying to jump ahead too much here i know there is more work to be done of course but how does this pending acquisition impact further permian acquisitions going forward that may materialize in the current environment that places more value on operational execution and free cash flow generation albeit they may be smaller in the future vicki hollub president and chief executive officer we will continue doing the very small asset trades that our teams do acreage swaps and things like that we would continue some bolt on where it makes sense but not of any size we will be looking at smaller bolt on acquisitions i would say that anything of any material acquisitions would be something that we would not do until we achieve our debt reduction targets richard tullis capital one securities analyst all right well thank you that s all from me cedric burgher chief financial officer and senior vice president i d like to add one thing that came up on a prior question just it s something we ve had offline i want to make sure we get it out there for everyone for the transaction with total it s about 8 8 billion in gross proceeds but after tax net proceeds from the transaction would be about 8 billion so about 800 million in tax and other costs operator and in the interest of time this will conclude our question and answer session at this time i d like to turn the conference back over to vicki hollub for any closing remarks vicki hollub president and chief executive officer i just want to say thank you all for your questions and for joining our call we re really excited about this opportunity and what it s going to mean for occidental and for the anadarko shareholders and ultimately for our shareholders appreciate it have a good day bye operator the conference is now concluded we thank you for attending today s presentation you may now disconnect your lines duration 53 minutes

trade talks this week take on an even greater significance now stamped with the knowledge of how the herd is responding to the latest break down in us sino relations traders will be hyper sensitive to good or bad trade talk news 1 stocks sell off in europe and the us global equities appear in pull back mode ignoring asia s solid enough day european and us stocks have tumbled the euro stoxx 50 shed 1 78 per cent overnight while the ftse100 dropped 1 63 per cent and the s p500 has given up 1 65 per cent it looks as though just when one assumed the latest trade war developments lacked true bite the conflicts potential consequences have reared their head in price action global stocks tumbled as trade tensions start to worry investors it sets up the australian market to fall sharply at the opening bell with futures pointing to a 48 point drop 2 trade war risk raises questions about fundamentals it s a part of why markets have behaved quite edgy overnight trade related news and its all important impact on market fundamentals has proven had to quantify and predict the last time trade tensions were this high commentators were wrangling with what the material impacts of the trade war would be would it derail global growth how big of an impact would it have on inflation what might it do to corporate earnings there were few sufficient answers to these quandaries and the trade problem seemed to disappear as us sino relations improved last year they ll return to the fore now with market participants no closer to and answer now than then 3 stocks sell off in the face of uncertainty those answers come with time and it s probably not the root of those questions necessarily causing the overnight sell off per se in the short term where the vagaries of the market are overanalysed and the day to day movements in the market are rationalized away a simple dose of uncertainty is all it takes to move sentiment from something bullish to something bearish the fact that market participants can t answer some of the bigger questions relating to the trade war is worse than if they d received uncomfortable answers to those questions faced with uncertainty traders overcompensate for the lack of information by removing risk and therefore assuming the worst 4 an overdue pullback hindsight is golden and of course it makes a genius out of us all but there were signs that the global equity rally has been getting long in the tooth anyway and with last night s relatively big sell off price action in us stocks is for now behaving as this is a healthy pull back rather than another correction
oxy earnings call for the period ending march 31 2019 occidental petroleum corp oxy 2 40 q1 2019 earnings call 8 00 a m et contents prepared remarks questions and answers call participants prepared

those expressed or implied in these statements as more fully described in our cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements on slide two our earnings press release the investor relations supplemental schedules and our non gaap to gaap reconciliations and the conference call presentation slides can be downloaded off our website at www oxy com i ll now turn the call over to vicki vicki please go ahead vicki hollub president and chief executive officer thank you jeff and good morning everyone i d like to start by recognizing that many would like to discuss our proposal to acquire anadarko which we will address but first i plan to cover the excellent results we achieved in the first quarter and reiterate that our commitment to our value proposition remains unchanged creating shareholder value continues to be our number one priority our integrated business is delivering outstanding results and we continue to be a leader in each area we operate we are dedicated to returning cash to our shareholders delivering industry leading returns and executing our strategy during the first quarter we did just that we returned 800 million through dividends and share repurchases driven by excellent results from all three of our business segments since 2002 we ve returned 34 billion of capital to our shareholders and our assets continue to generate free cash flow for future distributions in the permian basin our operational expertise and deep knowledge of the sub surface is unmatched and the well productivity that is clear we get more oil from our wells in the short and long term which generates high value and low development costs we are rapidly advancing our geo mechanical and flow unit modeling driving breakthroughs in completion design and well spacing and mitigating parent child impacts oxy has delivered 23 of the top 100 horizontal wells in the permian which is the most of any operator while as only drilling 4 of the total wells over the same time period we also continue to delineate our acreage and new benches for future development with outstanding results from five different benches in new mexico our leadership extends far beyond the permian we have a strong international reputation as a low cost operator maximizing the value of new and old fields and delivering major projects around the world on time and on budget over the last year we grew our position in oman the uae and colombia by a total of over 6 5 million gross acres and these assets will greatly enhance our value proposition for shareholders we recently implemented a new completion design in the middle east which is generating more oil and improving returns for oxy and our partners we re excited about the impact these breakthroughs will have on our future development plan our unique low carbon ventures business is also making progress on reducing our carbon footprint by advancing technologies and policies that support the capture and sequestration of anthropogenic co2 which will reduce carbon emissions while enhancing the economic development of our reserves we are currently working to advance the midwest industrial carbon capture strategy that can capture a significant amount of industrial emissions and reduce our total carbon impact through the use of this co2 in our eor operations this project will take partnership and advancement of technology but we are motivated and have begun engagement to help promote this opportunity we look forward to sharing more details on this project in the future we also plan to release our 2019 climate report this month which provides further details on the significant progress we ve made on our long term climate and sustainability strategy on slide five i want to highlight how our value proposition delivered leading return on and return of capital in 2018 our ability to achieve best in class returns through investing in our high quality assets was evident as we generated return on capital employed of 14 and cash return on capital employed at 27 both significantly higher than 2017 an upper quartile performance versus our peer group this was also the highest return on capital employed that we ve generated since 2011 in addition we have returned more than 3 6 billion to shareholders through our sector leading dividend and share repurchases no other company in our peer group has such a consistent record of providing a high return of capital to shareholders these achievements reflect our commitment to our sustainable value proposition the strength of our integrated business model the high quality of our assets and the incredible performance of our employees after we have finished our review of our first quarter we will discuss the acquisitions so now i ll turn the call to cedric cedric burgher chief financial officer and senior vice president thanks vicki for the first quarter we had reported earnings of 0 84 per diluted share as all three of our business segments continue to perform well despite a lower commodity price environment we are also pleased to report that we returned 800 million of cash to our shareholders in the first quarter through our dividend and share repurchases so overall a very strong quarter across the board oil gas core income increased in the first quarter compared to the prior quarter reflecting lower dd a rates as well as a positive mark to market adjustment on carbon dioxide purchase contracts partially offset by lower crude oil and ngl prices and lower sales volumes due to the timing of liftings total first quarter reported production of 719 000 boes per day exceeded guidance due to continued best in class execution and well productivity in permian resources which came in at the high end of guidance at 261 000 boes per day international production exceeded guidance at 298 000 boes per day driven by strong operational performance in oman as well as the oil price adjustment in our production sharing contracts oxychem exceeded guidance with earnings of 265 million for the first quarter earnings increased from the prior quarter primarily due to favorable feedstock costs such as ethylene and natural gas along with fees received under a pipeline easement agreement executed in the first quarter the increase in earnings was partially offset by lower realized caustic soda pricing in addition to production being curtailed at various oxychem facilities by a third party tank farm fire in deer park texas all oxychem facilities have resumed safe operations our midstream business also exceeded guidance with the first quarter income of 279 million primarily driven by a higher midland to meh differential and a lower than expected mark to market impact compared to the prior quarter the decrease in earnings reflected lower midland to meh differential which decreased from approximately 15 to 9 78 working capital changes included cash payments typical of the first quarter including property tax and fourth quarter accruals both oxychem and our marketing businesses also experienced a working capital draw as a result of a receivable build due to higher prices and volumes slide nine details our guidance for the second quarter and full year 2019 we are on track to deliver annual production growth of 9 to 11 while staying within our capital budget of 4 5 billion due to our outstanding proposal to acquire anadarko we have suspended our share repurchase program i will now turn the call back over to vicki vicki hollub president and chief executive officer thank you cedric now turning to our proposal as you have likely seen yesterday we delivered an updated proposal to the board of anadarko as well as announced a contingent agreement to sell anadarko s algeria ghana mozambique and south africa assets to total for 8 8 billion when we complete our proposed acquisition of anadarko but before we discuss the details of those announcements i d like to quickly recap recent events related to our proposal and situate yesterday s important updates in the proper context on april 24th we announced our superior proposal to acquire anadarko for 76 in cash and stock we continue to believe in the compelling financial and strategic merits of this deal which would enhance occidental s sustainable value proposition and benefit both companies shareholders on april 29th anadarko announced its board of directors had determined that occidental s april 24th proposal could reasonably be expected to result in a superior proposal and our two companies have since been engaged for that determination on april 30th we announced that berkshire hathaway has committed to invest a total of 10 billion in occidental contingent upon the completion of our proposed acquisition of anadarko we re thrilled to have berkshire hathaway s financial support for this transaction and believe it reaffirms what we have long believed that occidental is uniquely positioned to generate compelling value from anadarko s highly complementary asset portfolio this is committed acquisition financing that provides us with the ability to increase the cash component of our proposal in a more balance sheet friendly manner than issuing additional debt yesterday we announced an agreement with total to sell anadarko s africa assets contingent upon us completing our proposed acquisition of anadarko we re pleased to have secured this agreement with total as a fast tracks inaudible divestiture plan we previously outlined in connection with our proposal our agreement with total to sell these assets to a terrific company allows us to focus all of our integration efforts on the assets most valuable to oxy the almost 9 billion sale price funds a portion of the cash consideration to anadarko while delivering on the majority of our 10 billion to 15 billion of planned asset sales importantly this sale supports our expectations around synergies and we continue to expect to deliver 2 billion of annual cost synergies and 1 5 billion of annual capital reductions from the proposed acquisition of anadarko the financial support of berkshire hathaway as well as the agreement we announced with total also help us to delever our balance sheet while focusing our integration efforts on the assets that will provide the most value for us yesterday we also delivered a revised and significantly enhanced superior proposal to the board of anadarko to acquire the company for 76 per share with revised terms of 78 in cash and 22 in stock under the terms of the revised proposal anadarko shareholders would receive 59 in cash and 0 2934 shares of occidental stock per share of anadarko pro forma ownership of the combined company would be 84 legacy occidental shareholders and 16 legacy anadarko shareholders the increased cash portion of 59 per share provides significant and immediate value greater closing certainty and enhanced accretion this revised proposal represents a premium of approximately 23 to the 61 62 per share value of chevron s offer as of friday s market close our revised proposal does not require an occidental shareholder vote which has been cited as the explanation for anadarko s board s prior selection of chevron s 65 offer over our 76 offer changing the consideration mix to be cash heavy is more accretive to us and addresses the issue that anadarko focused on as their reason for taking the lower bid last time we firmly believe that occidental is uniquely positioned to create significant and sustainable growth and value from anadarko s assets we ve studied this opportunity for almost two years this is a key long term decision for us and we understand what a great opportunity this is for us and our shareholders we encourage anadarko s board to comply with their fiduciary obligations and except this compelling proposal for anadarko s shareholders we hope we can continue to execute this merger agreement without delay and proceed to bringing in this exciting combination to fruition we ll now open it up for your questions questions and answers operator thank you we will now begin the question and answer session operator instructions our first question today will come from brian singer of goldman sachs please go ahead brian singer goldman sachs analyst thank you and good morning vicki hollub president and chief executive officer good morning brian singer goldman sachs analyst my first question is with regards to the legacy assets in first quarter results first quarter capex was about 28 of full year guidance and the permian resources capex was about 30 of the annual budget can you run through your expectations for the capex trajectory for the remainder of the year and given higher oil prices what do you see as the potential to maintain spending run rates and raise the annual budget later in the year as was done in 2018 vicki hollub president and chief executive officer no our plan is to hold the budget where it is at 4 5 billion as we had mentioned i think in the last earnings call we are going to be coming under the year hot but we are going to be slowing down activity toward the end of the year to achieve our 4 5 billion capital budget brian singer goldman sachs analyst and can you talk a little bit more about how you see that or where you see that and is it fourth quarter specifically vicki hollub president and chief executive officer it would be a combination of third and fourth quarter and it will be mostly in the permian resources business brian singer goldman sachs analyst great thanks and then my follow up is one of the advantages highlighted in your letter to anadarko and in your comments for oxy s revised bid for anadarko is that it does not require a shareholder vote recognizing that the requirement for shareholder vote at 20 equity issuance threshold is a rule from the nyse how do you and the board weigh the benefits of the stronger bid as a result of no longer requiring a shareholder vote and the cost of capital that s come to achieve that relative to the board s corporate governance objectives vicki hollub president and chief executive officer well i can say that in the year and a half that we ve been engaged in making offers to anadarko we ve always made offers up to this point that required a shareholder vote so our objective in doing this was not at all to avoid the shareholder vote it was to ensure that we had a reasonable chance to make this happen we weren t playing on a level playing field we from a governance standpoint avoiding the shareholder vote is not something that we wanted to do but rather than increase our price we felt like it was in the best interest of our shareholders to hold our price where it is and as you have seen we put our last proposal in and even though it has an 11 differential our bid still after 12 days was not declared superior so from our standpoint we saw the two options is increase the share price or provide clarity of closing we felt like clarity of closing was the lower cost even with the berkshire financing because remember our yield is 5 already the incremental 3 of the berkshire funds for us was well worth it when we took into consideration what the upside of this deal was versus losing this opportunity that for two years we ve worked on we know the upside pretty well as you know this fits within our core experience and expertise so achieving the 2 billion in synergies is quite clear for us and when you take all of that into consideration we felt that our greater fiduciary responsibility from a governance standpoint for our shareholders was to make this deal happen brian singer goldman sachs analyst great thank you vicki hollub president and chief executive officer thank you operator the next question will come from josh silverstein of wolfe research please go ahead josh silverstein wolfe research analyst hi good morning guys i m just going to stick with the synergies since you ended there you highlighted the 3 5 billion number on the initial deal and i know why you re reiterating the views today how does the berkshire financing and additional debt needed to increase the cash offer not eat into that vicki hollub president and chief executive officer well the synergies that we have are an estimate we believe actually that we can exceed those they re a conservative estimate just based on what we re achieving today we haven t built in the upside and what we and we really haven t built much of the upside at all into the model that helped us to arrive at a 76 offer price we believe that the upside in these assets is far more than what we modeled but we re being conservative in what we see with respect to not only synergies but the incremental and recovery from these wells we ve built nothing into our model for the powder river and nothing for the mineral rights trend so and then very very very conservative for dj and delaware basin and for more specifics on each of the buckets i ll turn it over to cedric cedric burgher chief financial officer and senior vice president yeah josh cedric i d just add that we have updated we have two new investor decks out there today one for the earnings one for the revised proposal to acquiring anadarko and on slide 13 i d just point you to those cash flow per share and free cash flow per share estimates for 2020 and 2021 they include our updated our synergies of course but also the berkshire hathaway financing as well as the sale of the african assets so all of that s been updated as you can see this thing is very accretive even more accretive than the priority on a cash flow per share basis and on a free cash flow per share basis you can see this deal as very powerful from an economic and financial standpoint and so when we looked at things all things considered it was just part of a more holistic approach to looking at the deal what it took to get there versus losing it especially losing it for non financial reasons the optics of a vote and so on josh silverstein wolfe research analyst got it just on those points i mean you guys are obviously willing to go out and put another bid on the table without knowing what chevron s response would be it seems as if you re finding more upside in this transaction and more willing to go out and get this deal if i m reading that correctly vicki hollub president and chief executive officer we believe this to be transformational for oxy and it s very rare in fact generational when you see an opportunity like this come along where you can check every box that you want to check from a value standpoint it s accretive to cash flow as cedric just described tremendous asset base with a huge upside also it s got scale and it s got things i believe that haven t even been evaluated yet because anadarko has been busy doing working on the dj the delaware they begun working in the powder which i believe is going to be an upside and anadarko has incredible people too so we believe that the combination of their employees continuing to have the opportunity to work these assets and with the culture they have blending into our culture which we think is going to be fairly easy transition we think that there is tremendous upside and we ve identified what we feel comfortable with and see today but i think you re right there will be more and there are things we re excited about that we re just not quantifying it josh silverstein wolfe research analyst so there is more than just the permian basin here and i am guessing that s the reason why you aren t just going out and doing one to two permian consolidation transactions vicki hollub president and chief executive officer that s right it s much more than just the permian it s the amazing cash flow from the gulf of mexico that s going to fund help to fund additional return of cash to shareholders because both the dj the delaware are close to being free cash flow generating and then you have to build on that ultimately as we go along the power river position so we re really excited about it it gives us so much more flexibility and with what we can do with our dollars and the free cash flow josh silverstein wolfe research analyst great thanks guys vicki hollub president and chief executive officer thank you operator next question will come from devin mcdermott of morgan stanley please go ahead devin mcdermott morgan stanley analyst good morning thanks for taking my question vicki hollub president and chief executive officer good morning devin mcdermott morgan stanley analyst so first question i wanted to ask is just can we get a little bit more detail on the dialog and process that you ve had here with anadarko s board and specifically what the key areas of focus or concern are for them and what has or hasn t been addressed in latest proposal i understand the shareholder vote was the key one that has now been taken out but in your letter of the board you highlighted some others like the potential board seats that anadarko was asking so just wondering if you can talk a little bit more about what in your view has and hasn t been addressed and what some of the sticking points have been in the conversation so far vicki hollub president and chief executive officer well i think as we ve go along we went back and did some rehashing of some things that we had previously looked at and we got worked through all of that their management team with our management team has been very engaged we ve got it down to working just some of the details around employees and benefits programs making sure that we re making fair and equitable decisions for both sets of the employees in both companies so it s been a 12 day process and my concern is that as we were going along and discussing things that were not they were getting to the point where they weren t quite material that our proposal still wasn t deemed superior which is why we ve we yesterday submitted the increased cash offer devin mcdermott morgan stanley analyst got it thank you and then my follow ups on actually the balance sheet so one of the changes with the revised bid is there s a higher cash component and we now have the preferred equity as you noted from berkshire hathaway in the mix but the overall pro forma leverage with more cash does at least in our estimates look higher and you ve addressed that partially with i think attractive asset sale here of the africa portfolio can you just talk about how you re thinking about the balance sheet and delevering plan here and any dialog you may or may not have had with the rating agencies as part of this revised bid cedric burgher chief financial officer and senior vice president yeah this is cedric devin so certainly it s a higher cash bid so more leverage we have mitigated that through the two transactions we ve talked about the berkshire money and the african sale so if you look at the updated numbers 2021 we re still targeting a debt to ebitda of 2 times or less and that s with the accounting consolidation of the mlp excluding the mlp it s about 1 5 times debt to ebitda and that s in a 60 scenario at 50 if we were to go to 50 immediately then 2021 excluding the mlp would be just above 2 times and debt to ebitda excuse me so that is we think manageable not optimal and as we ve said all along we will be working hard to reduce our debt further below the 1 5 times target ultimately and we have had extensive dialog with all three of our credit rating agencies that is ongoing and we still feel confident that we will be investment grade devin mcdermott morgan stanley analyst got it thank you very much cedric burgher chief financial officer and senior vice president welcome operator the next question will come from phil gresh of jpmorgan please go ahead phil gresh jp morgan analyst yes good morning just i guess a follow up to the last question on the balance sheet cedric in the last call we had you talked about there being a lot of buyer interest in the asset sales inbound interest and so i guess i was just wondering now that you ve announced this transaction with total was that the main set of assets that you were referring to or do you feel like that there are other things you re working on in the queue that could get the balance sheet in better shape faster cedric burgher chief financial officer and senior vice president thanks good question that was a definitely the largest set of assets we were receiving inbounds on there are others and we certainly have a pipeline of other transactions we think we can execute and so we can continue to delever further and overachieve our asset sales targets vicki hollub president and chief executive officer i would just also reinforce that it s been really for us very very encouraging to see the offers and the interest coming in and the fact that we believe that we will far beat our the what we ve laid out to accomplish phil gresh jp morgan analyst okay and then just to clarify on the total deal is that deal is that a done deal no matter what as long as the anadarko deal closes i e there are no other contingencies and then secondarily cedric you mentioned the leverage metrics excluding western gas if you could clarify what it would require in order to de consolidate that if that were something you re interested in just mathematically what we need to be done vicki hollub president and chief executive officer first i ll start with the total question it is contingent only on the deal going through with anadarko and i will say we re really excited about that one because to total we ve partnered with them for a long time in the dolphin project we know them well and we know that they re going to be able to maximize the value out of the africa assets and get more than anybody else could we believe and so we re excited about that arrangement and we will continue working with total on other opportunities in the middle east and other areas cedric burgher chief financial officer and senior vice president okay and then with respect to western gas mlp consolidation they current anadarko currently owns about 55 of the mlp and because of the governance structure that s unique to mlps and this one in particular you could sell down to 20 and still have effective control again through the governance set up for that mlp so you would therefore in that instance if you sold down to even 20 you would still consolidate for sure if you sell down below 20 you still likely consolidate because again there s a lot of control mechanisms that trigger consolidation so not sure exactly where the line is it probably is close to zero if not zero ownership position in the mlp before you would de consolidate but if you think about it from a standpoint of legal liability and obligations that debt at the mlp is non recourse and so in some respects it s purely an accounting nuance in terms of the consolidation and who is responsible for the debt at the mlp phil gresh jp morgan analyst okay thank you operator the next question will come from pavel molchanov of raymond james please go ahead pavel molchanov raymond james analyst thanks for taking the question you noted that share buyback has been suspended is that a purely legal step for the duration of the uncertainty over the outcome of the current process or do you anticipate keeping the buyback suspended even after closing anadarko if that happens cedric burgher chief financial officer and senior vice president hi yes this is cedric again we think it s prudent to suspend the buyback now we ve actually done that for the last month or so a little longer once we felt that this transaction had a higher probability of happening and there was enough material information that wasn t yet public we thought it was prudent thing to do to suspend it so that was kind of the first gate secondly certainly if we close on the transaction we will be suspending the buyback our highest priority will be reducing debt and we won t be buying back shares until we get down to the debt targets that we ve established pavel molchanov raymond james analyst okay clear enough can i also ask about the carbon comments previously with obviously a much more simplified asset base you ve said that you want to be 100 carbon neutral will that target continue to apply to the greatly expanded and diversified production mix if in fact this deal happens vicki hollub president and chief executive officer that will continue to be our goal it could extend that out beyond where we had initially hoped to be but that s still our goal we think that we have the strategy that can accomplish that over time and we think it s really it s our responsibility to do all that we can do to make that happen and we re really excited about what our low carbon ventures team is doing the strategy that they re putting together it s not just going to impact our operations but they are actually in a position where they are influencing and helping others too so we believe that the extent of the benefit of what we re doing will go far beyond just our company pavel molchanov raymond james analyst all right appreciate it vicki hollub president and chief executive officer thank you operator the next question will come from leo mariani of keybanc please go ahead leo mariani keybanc analyst hi guys wanted to see if you can provide with more detail around the 2 billion of ongoing annual cost synergies here what we re really trying to get at is to whether or not there s maybe some breakdown as to how of that you might see in the permian versus the dj just want to get a sense of what those synergies maybe in the dj given that scenario that i don t think you guys have operated in before vicki hollub president and chief executive officer okay i ll start with this and then we ll give you a little more view of what the full synergy outlook looks for each of the buckets but the reason we say that is we over the past few years our team our sub surface teams working with our business units the combination of those hand in hand looking at how do we improve our performance in the shale play in general have made some key breakthroughs and i have to say it s all of our teams working together from the geophysicists petrophysicists geologists engineers and even a person that we brought over from a nasa contractor who helped us look at or make it a similarity or see a similarity between looking at composites and how they fracture in the aerospace industry with how we look at our sub surface all of that together and then applying data analytics has enabled us to we believe find a breakthrough and how we look at not only how fracturing works but what you should expect your flow unit to be and once you determine what you expect your flow unit to be then you can tailor your frac designs more appropriately for what you re seeing in the sub surface and then by tailoring it you can then optimize your profit and we have gotten to the point where we re not only having really good results but we are getting predictive with it and predictive where you have 3d seismic and you can look at your attribute analysis and make some judgments and assessments on what you expect to see that s similar to what you ve already have in your analytics database so when you look at that and you look at how we ve been able to do with 23 of the top 100 wells and using less proppant than the other wells in the top 100 they used 37 i think it s 34 or 37 more proppant so when you look at that what that means is you re basing this on physics you re basing it on the science it s not we re taking a little bit of the art out of fracing and completing shale plays and so when you can do that then based on the science you can take that and apply it to other areas and that and so it doesn t matter whether you re moving geographically or vertically within the well bore science works the same and so in the delaware basin we ve taken it and we blinded some wells and found that it s predictive capabilities are really pretty good and so we know that we can do it in other shale basins as well and i have to give a shout out to our sub surface teams they ve just done amazing jobs in the business unit and working with them to look at the possibilities and to try new things and to optimize as a team it s been amazing and i never expected us to see the continuing improvement that we ve seen year on year and we re still continuing you ve seen in the basin in some areas where the productivity improvements have plateaued they haven t with us they continue to increase again from 2017 to 2018 so i think we ll see the same kind of success in the dj now i ll go to cedric for a little bit more color around the rest of the synergies cedric burgher chief financial officer and senior vice president right thank you vicki just looking at slide 12 in the updated proposal deck that we put out this morning and the synergies haven t changed so the prior deck same slide but if you look at the four different categories of synergies we ve laid out the first one domestic capital operating efficiency that really is just getting anadarko well cost down to where we currently are primarily using our oxy drilling dynamics reducing drilling costs and the proppant loading reduction which reduces the completion costs so we are going to talk a little bit more about the drilling dynamics here in a second ken is with us to help on that front and so that s the first bucket there the second one procurement and supply chain we ve talked a lot about our aventine logistics hub and the savings we get there for ourselves again we can deploy that in the permian and that strategy we can play elsewhere but primarily we ve attributed savings in the permian plus our supply chain and oscar brown s here who heads up global supply and strategy for us he can address that a little further and then the last the third bucket there general overhead and corporate it s primarily people real estate and aircraft we have one corporate aircraft plus an employee shuttle to their four corporate airplanes and so we don t think we need all of those and we can reduce that along with obviously people and duplicate offices and real estate and then we ve talked about the capital reduction synergies as well as kind of a fourth bucket for you so now i ll turn it over to ken to talk about oxy drilling dynamics and the savings we ve achieved around the world there and then follow that with oscar on supply chain kenneth dillon senior vice president and president good morning first of all i d like to say we compete and partner with majors and independent oil companies all around the world so we can actually see how far ahead we are in drilling dynamics started in permian and rolled out around the world so we re very confident in the drilling and completion synergies working with the excellent anadarko engineers in each of their assets odd is basically a holistic approach to drilling it s a mechanical specific energy focus and we have our own equations which drive our software that we install in the rigs we have our own process and it s more like a social network of drilling rather than a data book and how to design wells we optimize bit design ourselves we designed stabilizers ourselves in real time based on the results of the last well and we use data analytics to make formation by formation improvements if you look since 2014 we ve worked together with international contractors altogether so halliburton schlumberger baker are all in the same room as we re drilling each individual well everyone has a chance to have input and the focus is in the best well not the best individual company performance we ve improved hes and we ve integrated and optimized the supply chain processes since 2014 we saved over 708 million internationally and we are very confident about making those synergies that we ve talked about in this proposal i d like to hand over now to oscar on supply chain oscar k brown senior vice president strategy business development and integrated supply thanks ken and i guess just stating the obvious we ll be doubling our purchase power at occidental with the combination with anadarko so that s a huge opportunity and will be maximizing our economies of scale in terms of purchasing power and then combining both companies best practices in procurement i ll just expand a little bit on cedric s comments on aventine in that model as certainly the aventine hub is only 40 miles from the heart of anadarko s delaware basin assets and so there s real there s lots of capacity still available at aventine for all the different services and products that are managed there so that it can a huge opportunity in terms of general logistics and if you look in the map on page 11 you can really see the sort of superhighway that s formed between the southern and the northern delaware or the pro forma position and you can see there may be opportunities to expand the aventine type model to other parts of the delaware basin in addition the combined purchasing power i think we both have contracts where the increase in purchasing power will help us in terms of our cost in terms of certain equipment rig rates octg et cetera so we believe there s great opportunities in supply chain to deliver the 600 million that s noted leo mariani keybanc analyst all right very very thorough answer from you folks around the synergies here just in terms of follow up i think cedric you clearly pointed out that leverage will increase at oxy post the deal and thank you for those sensitivities around the commodity prices is there any thought process to maybe hedge some volumes out over the next couple of years to maybe eliminate some of that cash flow uncertainty in the deal here cedric burgher chief financial officer and senior vice president it s certainly an option available to us we don t think it ll be necessary as you have already seen we re way ahead of schedule on what we can do to delever and so we have historically not been an advocate of hedging for a number of reasons but it is an option available to us to help reduce the risk if we feel like we need to fall back to that none of the things and none the numbers we presented you with include any hedging leo mariani keybanc analyst okay thank you vicki hollub president and chief executive officer i ll also point out that our chemicals business and our al hosn and dolphin provide and our psas in the middle east provide some form of hedging for us so we re quite confident that the cash flow in a lower price environment will be there leo mariani keybanc analyst yeah no doubt thank you vicki hollub president and chief executive officer thank you operator the next question will come from doug leggate of bank of america please go ahead doug leggate bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi good morning everybody i just got two quick ones i think just doing a follow up to phil s question earlier regarding western gas for those of us who ve covered andarko for a while anadarko have pretty much built out their midstream facilities so the control of that asset didn t really seem to be as strategic a requirement as it was in the cost so i m just curious given that you guys have inaudible retaining the takeaway rights while monetizing this field can you just give us a little bit more of a thought as to what you see is the strategic ownership requirement of west my follow up is just a quick one on the gulf of mexico obviously oxy had some interest in it long time ago but clearly anadarko is using that harvest cash i m just curious whether you see the role of that in your portfolio as to continue to harvest cash or if you might consider yourself as perhaps a consolidator there as well as much as you expect to be in the onshore i ll leave it there thank you vicki hollub president and chief executive officer i ll start with the first one on western gas as you ve rightly pointed out doug we don t really feel like we have to necessarily own infrastructure to take advantage of it we were quite fortunate that and by design actually selected the companies that we did for the sale of our midstream last year to two what we feel like a great management teams that are very well positioned to maximize the value of those assets and to work well with us and so we have a great relationship with them the same kind of thing would need to happen for western for us to divest of it because it s important that you re working with someone who has interests that are aligned with yours when you re talking about infrastructure so i wouldn t take that option off the table as with any of our infrastructure in place today we would be willing to consider the optimization monetization of that sooner rather than later depending on the potential buyer with respect to the gulf of mexico assets our strategy would be the same as anadarko s there and that is to just use that asset to generate cash it would not be to consolidate or extend the growth it s to maintain production flat and keep our cash flow flat and anadarko has done a great job doing that and they have a superior team working in the gulf of mexico today operator our next question will come from david deckelbaum of cowen please go ahead david deckelbaum cowen analyst good morning vicki cedric and team thanks for taking my questions i just wanted to confirm included in the assumptions on capital reduction the 1 5 billion was any of that capital allocated toward the african assets this is 1 5 billion stand alone post the african divestiture cedric burgher chief financial officer and senior vice president hi this is cedric yes it was there was some capital associated with the african assets that s now been removed so we re ahead of schedule on the capital reduction targets as well with that david deckelbaum cowen analyst so how much of that was included in the 1 5 billion are you saying there is still another 1 5 billion that remains in capital reduction after this sale cedric burgher chief financial officer and senior vice president no it is about 200 million so that leaves about 1 3 billion remaining david deckelbaum cowen analyst okay so there was nothing for mozambique included in there then cedric burgher chief financial officer and senior vice president that s about 200 million for the next year so a total of 400 million excuse me 200 million was ex mozambique and then 200 million with mozambique david deckelbaum cowen analyst okay i appreciate that and then just as a follow up i know pro forma you talked about the capital reduction and then slowing the combined growth rate down to 5 is that purely a function of trying to augment as much free cash as you can in the first couple of years just to delever more quickly and then if it s not the case would oxy stand alone be better suited growing at a lower rate cedric burgher chief financial officer and senior vice president so yeah good question we think that 5 is a very healthy growth rate it s very sustainable for many many many years and on a larger asset base this would obviously be transformational taking us up in terms of scale and size we think that s an appropriate growth rate and it certainly does help increased free cash flow so that we can delever more quickly and then stand alone we have also considered doing that as well as you know last year up until the middle of last year we were replacing a lot of cash flow that we had exited second tier basins in countries and replacing that organically rather than through m a we accomplished that plan in the middle of last year and then we were surprised with the qatar loss of the qatar cash flow and so we ve been replacing that as well so we ve been headed in that direction as well internally we just haven t yet announced that but i can tell you that s where we re headed fairly soon if we were to lose out on the anadarko deal david deckelbaum cowen analyst appreciate that thank you for the responses guys cedric burgher chief financial officer and senior vice president you bet operator and the final question will come from richard tullis of capital one securities please go ahead richard tullis capital one securities analyst sure thanks good morning everyone vicki in the past oxy has referenced about 3 000 drilling locations in the permian resources with breakevens below 50 oil how would the anadarko delaware basin properties generally rank within oxy s existing inventory on a rate of return basis vicki hollub president and chief executive officer i think that they would fit well within the top couple of tiers if you look at the as oscar had referenced slide 11 previously where it shows the portion of their acreage that is in between barilla draw in southeast new mexico there is some prime acreage in there and there s some certainly we believe quite a few tier 1 opportunities i think their inventory there we believe could be over 10 000 wells and we believe that it would be very very similar to our inventory and we expect that over time because of the lower cost that we can imply as a result of the entire trend our two areas with theirs we can further lower costs and infrastructure synergies so that will be able to move more wells down into the less than 50 breakeven category richard tullis capital one securities analyst thank you that s helpful and that just lastly not trying to jump ahead too much here i know there is more work to be done of course but how does this pending acquisition impact further permian acquisitions going forward that may materialize in the current environment that places more value on operational execution and free cash flow generation albeit they may be smaller in the future vicki hollub president and chief executive officer we will continue doing the very small asset trades that our teams do acreage swaps and things like that we would continue some bolt on where it makes sense but not of any size we will be looking at smaller bolt on acquisitions i would say that anything of any material acquisitions would be something that we would not do until we achieve our debt reduction targets richard tullis capital one securities analyst all right well thank you that s all from me cedric burgher chief financial officer and senior vice president i d like to add one thing that came up on a prior question just it s something we ve had offline i want to make sure we get it out there for everyone for the transaction with total it s about 8 8 billion in gross proceeds but after tax net proceeds from the transaction would be about 8 billion so about 800 million in tax and other costs operator and in the interest of time this will conclude our question and answer session at this time i d like to turn the conference back over to vicki hollub for any closing remarks vicki hollub president and chief executive officer i just want to say thank you all for your questions and for joining our call we re really excited about this opportunity and what it s going to mean for occidental and for the anadarko shareholders and ultimately for our shareholders appreciate it have a good day bye operator the conference is now concluded we thank you for attending today s presentation you may now disconnect your lines duration 53 minutes call participants jeff alvarez vice president of investor
