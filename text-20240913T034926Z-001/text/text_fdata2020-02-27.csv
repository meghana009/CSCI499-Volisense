andrew king mondi group chief executive officer designate said mondi delivered a robust performance in 2019 against a backdrop of challenging trading conditions with underlying ebitda of 1 658 million and roce of 19 8 a solid operational performance strong cost control and a good contribution from acquisitions and capital investment projects partially offset the effects of market pressures in a number of key pulp and paper grades our capital investment programme to deliver value accretive growth and enhance the ongoing cost competitiveness of our operations remains on track having commissioned the pulp mill rebuild at our ruzomberok mill slovakia in the second half of the year we are making good progress on the related investment in a new 300 000 tonne kraft top white machine at the same site and previously announced major capital investment projects at our syktyvkar russia and steti czech republic mills smaller expansionary projects underway at a number of our converting packaging operations will further enhance our production capabilities and product offering to customers we completed the simplification of our corporate structure from dual listed into a single holding company under mondi plc in july 2019 simplifying cash and dividend flows increasing transparency removing the complexity associated with the previous structure and enhancing our strategic flexibility offering sustainable packaging solutions has continued to be core to our strategy with our unique product portfolio and our ecosolutions approach we remain well positioned to support our customers in meeting their sustainability goals with packaging that is sustainable by design paper where possible plastic when useful looking ahead we remain confident in the structural growth drivers in the packaging sectors in which we operate heightened macro economic uncertainties are likely to continue to affect markets in the short term and while we are seeing indications of stability in pricing in certain segments we start the year with lower prices across our key paper grades input cost relief our ongoing profit improvement programmes and customer centric innovation initiatives and the benefits from our capital expenditure pipeline will continue to support our performance with our robust business model centred around our high quality cost advantaged asset base our culture of continuously driving performance and the strategic flexibility our strong cash generation and financial position bring we continue to look to the future with confidence group performance review delivering innovative sustainable packaging solutions for our customers was again a key focus in 2019 we are uniquely positioned as a manufacturer of paper but also flexible plastic packaging to create the best solutions for forward thinking consumer brands in collaboration with sustainable materials suppliers and recyclers during the year we centred our efforts on developing paper based packaging solutions to replace unnecessary plastic packaging helping our customers to achieve their own sustainability targets and reduce their environmental footprint paper based packaging is renewable and recyclable which means it is an optimal solution for many of today s applications when certain functionality barriers are required plastic based flexible packaging can deliver many benefits when manufactured used and disposed appropriately from reducing food waste through shelf life extension to resource efficiency underlying ebitda of 1 658 million was down 6 on the prior year strong performances from flexible packaging and engineered materials helped to mitigate the margin pressures seen in corrugated packaging and uncoated fine paper in the face of market driven price decreases group revenue was down 3 as a result of a combination of lower average selling prices and lower sales volumes in turn primarily due to longer planned maintenance shuts and restructuring initiatives input costs were generally higher year on year although we did see some cost relief in the second half of the year measured both on a sequential and year on year basis on average wood costs were higher in local currency terms we saw higher wood costs in russia south africa and northern europe while costs in some countries in central and eastern europe were lower due to favourable regional wood supply dynamics driven by chinese import policies average benchmark paper for recycling costs were down 21 on the prior year with the rate of decline accelerating in the second half of the year chemical costs were higher on average versus the prior year albeit we did see them coming down over the course of the year while energy costs were lower cash fixed costs were higher on average as a result of inflationary cost pressures and mill maintenance shut effects although again we saw a positive trend over the course of the year the impact of planned maintenance shuts on underlying ebitda in 2019 was around 150 million 2018 110 million based on prevailing market prices we estimate that the impact of planned maintenance shuts on underlying ebitda in 2020 will be around 100 million of which the first half year effect is estimated at around 55 million 2019 80 million currency movements had a net positive impact on underlying ebitda versus the comparable prior year period the negative impact of a weaker turkish lira on translation of our domestically focused turkish businesses was more than offset by the benefits to certain of our export orientated businesses of a stronger us dollar and weaker south african rand depreciation and amortisation charges were marginally lower during the period as the effects of acquisitions and our capital investment programme were more than offset by the impact of a revision in the estimated useful lives on certain fixed assets refer to note 2 of the condensed consolidated financial statements basic underlying earnings of 171 1 euro cents per share were down 10 compared to 2018 after taking the effect of special items into account basic earnings of 167 6 euro cents per share were down 1 compared to 2018 the group remains strongly cash generative with cash generated from operations of 1 635 million 2018 1 654 million the impact of lower underlying ebitda generation was mitigated by a net working capital inflow net debt at 31 december 2019 was down to 2 207 million 2018 2 220 million 1 3 times 2018 1 3 times net debt to 12 month trailing underlying ebitda despite capital investments of 757 million or around 187 of depreciation as we pursue our investment programme to continue to deliver value accretive growth our board has recommended payment of a final ordinary dividend of 55 72 euro cents per share

underlying ebitda was down 18 on the prior year to 583 million with lower average containerboard selling prices and the effects of longer planned maintenance shuts more than offsetting the full year contribution from the acquisition of powerflute finland completed in 2018 and a strong performance in the downstream corrugated solutions business performance in the year was further supported by enhanced value chain alignment and our ongoing profit improvement programme following sharp declines in the first half containerboard prices stabilised in the third quarter before some further price erosion towards the end of the year the magnitude of the decreases varied by grade average benchmark european prices for unbleached kraftliner were down 11 year on year while benchmark recycled containerboard prices were down around 18 year on year prices in the specialty grades of white top kraftliner and semi chemical fluting were down around 3 year on year encouragingly we saw a deceleration of customer de stocking and improvement in order books as we progressed through the second half and into the new year in response to these improved market conditions we are currently in discussions with customers around price increases for unbleached kraftliner and recycled containerboard corrugated solutions achieved 3 overall box volume growth with strong growth in central and eastern europe underpinned by good demand in fast moving consumer goods retail e commerce and specialised applications this was partly offset by weaker volumes in turkey the business benefited from lower input paper prices while it remained focused on further enhancing its product offering quality and service to customers and implementing continuous improvement initiatives to reduce conversion costs pleasingly corrugated solutions won three 2020 worldstar awards building on its success in winning twelve such awards in the prior two years proof of our ambition to continue delivering innovative solutions that best meet our customers needs input costs were on average stable year on year cash fixed costs were modestly higher driven by maintenance costs and inflationary cost pressures as part of our ongoing portfolio review accelerated by weaker domestic market conditions we shut a 65 000 tonne per annum recycled containerboard machine at our mill in tire kutsan turkey in the second quarter while continuing to operate the 75 000 tonne per annum machine on site planned maintenance shuts were completed during the first half of the year at syktyvkar powerflute and richards bay south africa and during the second half at swiecie poland a similar maintenance shut plan is scheduled for 2020 note the worldstar awards are open to packaging organisations from across the world the competition acknowledges the best ideas innovations and technologies in the market judges look for sustainable solutions to packaging challenges demonstration of enhanced user

the prior year to 543 million with higher average selling prices positive currency effects and good cost containment more than offsetting lower paper bags volumes kraft paper prices were on average up around 6 compared to the prior year as strong demand growth supported meaningful price increases during the second half of 2018 and into early 2019 like for like sales volumes were higher versus the prior year period with an improved product mix benefiting from the contribution of recently completed capital investment projects and our product development initiatives the drive to replace plastic carrier bags with paper based alternatives and consumer preferences for fibre based primary packaging continues to support good demand across our range of speciality kraft papers however slowing economic activity particularly in the construction related sectors in various export markets coupled with increased competition resulted in kraft paper price reductions in the second half and into early 2020 paper bags sales volumes were down on a like for like basis due to a combination of pricing discipline and weaker markets in particular in the middle east price increases were achieved in the early part of 2019 to compensate for higher paper input costs strong cost management and the benefit of rationalisation activities resulted in significant fixed cost savings during the period consumer flexibles made progress during the year benefiting from an improved product mix previously implemented restructuring initiatives and good cost control the business has been focused on innovating with customers and other stakeholders along the value chain to develop recyclable plastic flexible packaging solutions and increase recycled plastic content in new packaging further product development and commercialisation will be a focus in 2020 and beyond we are pleased flexible packaging won two 2020 worldstar awards for our strippouch and protector bag innovations input costs were stable year on year while cash fixed costs were higher due to inflationary cost pressures and the impact of maintenance shuts this was mitigated by our cost reduction programmes we continue to drive operational excellence initiatives to increase productivity and efficiency and reduce conversion costs during the year we reorganised our us and egyptian paper bag operations and streamlined production across our european network in early 2020 we announced the proposed closure of our two consumer flexibles plants in the uk due to the change in demand for the niche products produced at these sites leading to a special item charge estimated at over 10 million of which 4 million was recognised in 2019 all planned maintenance shuts at the kraft paper mills were completed in the second half of the year in 2020 the majority of planned maintenance shuts are again scheduled for the second half engineered materials million year ended 31 december 2019 year ended 31 december 2018 change

forward as a key product matures release liner made progress as it benefited from an improved product mix pricing discipline and good cost control extrusion solutions was impacted by lower like for

planned maintenance shuts and higher costs this was partially compensated for by ongoing profit improvement initiatives positive currency effects and a higher forestry fair value gain roce remains strong at 25 1 and margins robust at 25 3 uncoated fine paper sales volumes were lower mainly due to planned extended maintenance shuts and the closure of a small machine in merebank south africa in 2018 we continue to see ongoing structural decline in demand for uncoated fine paper in mature markets with demand in europe estimated to have declined around 5 in 2019 demand in russia and south africa was also softer during the year although we expect broadly flat demand in the medium term in these markets our superior cost position and emerging market exposures continue to provide us with competitive advantage average uncoated fine paper selling prices achieved by our european operations were flat year on year but down in the second half as a result of price pressures in european markets and a higher proportion of exports uncoated fine paper selling prices in russia and south africa were higher year on year offsetting domestic cost inflation average benchmark european bleached hardwood pulp prices were 13 lower than the prior year and 21 down in the second half compared to the first half encouragingly prices have stabilised in early 2020 notably in the key asian markets on an annualised basis and including the pulp sales in our packaging businesses we estimate the group s net long pulp position in 2020 will be around 400 000 tonnes we saw overall higher input costs most notably for wood and chemicals while fixed costs were higher due to domestic inflationary cost pressures and the impact of maintenance shuts partly compensated for by our ongoing cost reduction initiatives the forestry assets fair value is dependent on a variety of external factors over which we have limited control the most significant being the export price of timber the exchange rate and domestic input costs higher export prices and net volume increases during the period resulted in a forestry fair value gain of 71 million up 28 million on the prior year but with the second half gain 33 million below that recognised in the first half of 2019 based on current market conditions we would expect a significantly lower forestry fair value gain in 2020 compared with 2019 planned maintenance shuts at our syktyvkar and richards bay mills were completed during the first half of the year in the second half we completed a project related shut at ruzomberok and smaller planned maintenance shuts at our remaining operations in 2020 our syktyvkar and richards bay shuts are planned for the first half of the year while the remaining shuts are scheduled for the second half

items was nil 2018 34 million assuming a similar geographic profit mix and stable statutory tax rates we expect our effective tax rate in 2020 to remain around 23 cash flow cash generated from operations of 1 635 million 2018 1 654 million reflects the continued strong cash generating capability of the group working capital as a percentage of revenue was 13 1 in line with the prior year 13

million 2018 709 million driven by our major capital expenditure programme tax paid of 248 million 2018 248 million was in line with the prior year further outflows from financing activities included the payment of ordinary dividends of 396 million 2018 309 million and interest paid of 96 million 2018 73 million capital investments investing in our cost advantaged asset base to maintain and enhance our competitiveness is of particular importance for our pulp and paper operations where products are generally more standardised and relative cost competitiveness is a key value driver we focus on driving organic growth strengthening our cost competitiveness enhancing our product offering quality and service to customers and improving our environmental footprint our disciplined approach to investigating approving and executing capital projects is one of our key strengths and plays an important role in successfully delivering strong returns through the cycle during the year we benefited from the contribution of the steti mill modernisation project completed in late 2018 to replace the recovery boiler rebuild the fibre lines and debottleneck the existing packaging paper machines this project provides cost and energy efficiencies an improved environmental footprint and additional annual production of 90 000 tonnes of softwood market pulp and 55 000 tonnes of packaging paper once fully ramped up we have a focused capital expenditure project pipeline securing future organic growth the investment in a new 300 000 tonne per annum kraft top white machine and related pulp mill upgrade at ruzomberok is making good progress the pulp mill rebuild was successfully commissioned in the second half of 2019 while the kraft top white machine is expected to start up at the end of 2020 the project to convert a containerboard machine at steti to be fully dedicated to the production of speciality kraft paper with a mix of recycled and virgin fibre content for shopping bag applications is on track the investment is supported by the drive to replace plastic carrier bags with paper based alternatives and allows us to optimise productivity and efficiency at swiecie where this grade is currently produced the project will result in an additional 75 000 tonnes per annum of speciality kraft paper capacity while reducing our containerboard capacity by around 30 000 tonnes per annum start up is expected by the end of 2020 our investment programme to debottleneck production and avoid unplanned shuts at our syktyvkar mill is progressing well including various upgrades of the mill infrastructure fibre lines and pulp dryer and a new evaporation plant we are investing in the modernisation of our richards bay mill including upgrading the energy and chemical plants to improve reliability and avoid unplanned shutdowns we continue to invest in our packaging and engineered materials converting plants to grow with our customers enhance our product and service offering and reduce conversion costs our recently completed and planned major capital expenditure projects in the czech republic slovakia and russia are expected to increase our current saleable pulp and paper production by around 8 when in full operation over the past three years our major capital projects have cumulatively contributed an estimated 75 million of annual incremental operating profit the incremental operating profit contribution from capital investment projects in 2019 was around 30 million and we expect to generate a further 40 million in 2020 given the approved project pipeline our capital expenditure is expected to be in the range of 700 800 million in 2020 and 450 550 million in 2021 in the absence of any other major investment treasury and borrowings net debt at 31 december 2019 was 2 207 million down from 2 220 million at 31 december 2018 reflecting the strong cash generating capacity of our business while we continue to deliver on our capital investment programme the group s liquidity position remains robust at the end of the year 660 million of our 2 5 billion committed debt facilities were undrawn and the weighted average maturity of committed debt facilities was 3 2 years gearing at the same date was 33 5 and our net debt to 12 month trailing underlying ebitda ratio was 1 3 times well within our key financial covenant requirement of 3 5 times in february 2020 the group entered into an additional debt facility with a maturity of 18 months increasing the undrawn committed debt facilities available to the group by 250 million further strengthening the group s liquidity position the group s investment grade credit metrics were reaffirmed during the course of the year at bbb and baa1 for standard poor s and moody s investors service respectively underlying net finance costs of 104 million were 16 million higher than the previous year while the effective interest rate was stable at 4 2 2018 4 2 trailing 12 month average net debt of 2 243 million was higher 2018 1 979 million as a result of the special dividend paid to shareholders 484 million and acquisitions totalling 424 million completed during 2018 simplification of corporate structure at the end of july 2019 we completed the simplification of our corporate structure from a dual listed company structure into a single holding company under mondi plc the simplification we believe this has simplified cash and dividend flows increased transparency removed the complexity associated with the previous structure and enhanced strategic flexibility as a result of the simplification each mondi plc shareholder has the same voting and capital interests in the group as each mondi plc ordinary shareholder and mondi limited ordinary shareholder had under the dlc structure the simplification did not result in any changes to management operations locations activities or staffing levels of the group nor did it save for one off expenses to effect the simplification have any significant impact on the reported profits or net assets of the group dividend the board aims to offer shareholders long term ordinary dividend growth within a targeted dividend cover range of two to three times on average over the business cycle given our strong financial position and confidence in the future of the business the board has recommended an increase in the final ordinary dividend to 55 72 euro cents per share 2018 54 55 euro cents per share the final ordinary dividend together with the interim ordinary dividend of 27 28 euro cents per share paid on 20 september 2019 amount to a total ordinary dividend for the year of 83 0 euro cents per share an increase of 9 on the 2018 total ordinary dividend of 76 0 euro cents per share the final ordinary dividend is subject to the approval of the shareholders of mondi plc at the annual general meeting scheduled for 7 may 2020 and if approved is payable on 14 may 2020 to shareholders on the register on 3 april 2020 growing responsibly sustainability lies at the centre of our strategy to drive value accretive growth we believe that being part of the solution to global sustainability challenges will secure the long term success of our business and benefit our stakeholders the attention to sustainable packaging continues to gain momentum we have been making sustainable packaging products for our customers for over 50 years and we are pleased to see recent heightened awareness as a leading producer of paper and plastic based packaging we are uniquely positioned to help our customers transition to more sustainable packaging through our customer centric ecosolutions approach using paper where possible plastic when useful ensuring the safety of our people always comes first our employees and contractors work in potentially hazardous environments we embed clearly defined methodologies procedures and robust controls to ensure they and other people who have reason to be on mondi sites stay safe above all we look to develop a safety mind set across the group we sincerely regret two fatalities during 2019 in january a contractor lost his life conducting pile drilling activities at the construction site of our new paper machine in ruzomberok and in august a contractor was fatally injured during towing activities at our russian forestry operations we are also deeply saddened that a contractor died as a result of an incident during demolition activities at our syktyvkar mill in january 2020 thorough investigations are conducted after all incidents and action plans implemented to address root causes and prevent repeat incidents we continue to focus on the top fatal risks at each site implementing clearly defined methodologies procedures and robust controls to drive continuous improvement in safety across the business in 2019 we had 222 recordable cases 2018 262 which equates to a total recordable case rate trcr of 0 59 2018 0 68 representing a 13 reduction compared to 2018 and a 22 improvement against our 2015 baseline well ahead of our 2020 commitment to reduce trcr by 5 our growing responsibly model is the framework through which we respond to opportunities to address sustainability and societal challenges especially by contributing to the un sdgs and other global initiatives it enables us to demonstrate monitor and improve our sustainability performance across the value chain the model comprises 10 action areas which reflect the aspects of sustainability that are most relevant for us and our stakeholders within these action areas we have made 16 public commitments running to the end of 2020 in addition we have updated our science based climate commitment in line with the paris agreement to keep global temperature rise below 2 c our science based targets cover more than 95 of our total scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions including our energy sales we have committed to reduce scope 1 and 2 emissions 34 by 2025 and 72 by 2050 per tonne of saleable production against a 2014 baseline a number of our ongoing and recently completed major capital projects are expected to contribute to our sustainability commitments in particular reducing greenhouse gas emissions and waste as we continue to make progress in making our business less carbon intensive we are pleased our total greenhouse gas emissions per tonne of saleable production have declined to 0 71 a 15 5 reduction against the 2014 baseline the contribution of biomass based renewable energy to the total fuel consumption of our mills has increased from 59 in 2014 to 64 in 2019 in addition to climate change we continue working closely with wwf in the sixth year of our global partnership on key focus areas such as responsible fibre sourcing and water security our initiatives include water stewardship in south africa protection of intact forest landscapes in russia sustainable forest management and biodiversity we are helping to lead the transformation towards circular thinking through our collaboration with customers and multi stakeholder initiatives such as cepi s 4evergreen ceflex and the ellen macarthur foundation s new plastics economy initiative we signed up to the new plastics economy global commitment made by leading brand owners retailers and packaging companies in 2018 pledging to ensure 100 of plastic based packaging is reusable recyclable or compostable and a minimum of 25 of post consumer waste is incorporated across all our flexible packaging where food contact regulations allow by 2025 our focus is on developing innovative plastic packaging solutions that are in line with circular design principles and working with stakeholders across the value chain to address the current challenges we face in securing high quality recycled plastic input required to transition to a circular plastic economy we want to develop and inspire a diverse and inclusive workforce where opportunities for employment engagement promotion training and any other benefits are based on skills and ability during the year we initiated several programmes across our operations to attract retain and develop our people and we also made progress on our diversity and inclusion journey introducing conscious inclusion training designed to address unconscious bias and identify practical actions to create an inclusive work environment in 2019 we joined the growing community of businesses publicly demonstrating their commitment to gender equality in the workplace by signing the un women s empowerment principles the social economic and environmental health of local communities is important to our long term success during the year we supported local livelihoods and businesses to build strong proactive and transparent relationships with local stakeholders as part of our stakeholder engagement initiatives and to deepen the understanding of our relationship and impact on local communities we conducted in depth socio economic assessments in two of our mills during the year as we come to the end of our current sustainability commitment period we are working on our post 2020 commitments to build on our achievements and enable our future success coronavirus covid 19 outbreak we have considered and will continue to closely monitor the potential impact of covid 19 on our business we have not seen any impact on the group to date the group s direct exposure to china is limited with revenues in the country accounting for less than 1 of the total we continue to monitor its impact on global trade and the macro economic outlook outlook looking ahead we remain confident in the structural growth drivers in the packaging sectors in which we operate heightened macro economic uncertainties are likely to continue to affect markets in the short term and while we are seeing indications of stability in pricing in certain segments we start the year with lower prices across our key paper grades input cost relief our ongoing profit improvement programmes and customer centric innovation initiatives and the benefits from our capital expenditure pipeline will continue to support our performance with our robust business model centred around our high quality cost advantaged asset base our culture of continuously driving performance and the strategic flexibility our strong cash generation and financial position bring we continue to look to the future with confidence principal risks and uncertainties the board is responsible for the effectiveness of the group s risk management activities and internal control processes it has put procedures in place for identifying evaluating and managing the significant risks that the group faces in combination with the audit committee the board has conducted a robust assessment of the principal risks to which mondi is exposed and has reviewed emerging risks during the year the board is satisfied that the group has effective systems and controls in place to manage its key risks within the risk tolerance levels established risk management is by nature a dynamic and ongoing process our approach is flexible to ensure that it remains relevant at all levels of the business and dynamic to ensure we can be responsive to changing business conditions this is particularly important given the diversity of the group s locations markets and production processes our internal control environment is designed to safeguard the assets of the group and to provide reasonable assurance that the group s business objectives will be achieved the majority of the group s most significant risks are long term in nature and in general do not change significantly in the short term the assessment of principal risks is updated annually to reflect the developments in our strategic priorities and board discussions on emerging risks during the year we enhanced our understanding of the risks and implications related to climate change demand for sustainable packaging solutions including substitution of plastic packaging and the uk s exit from the european union we recognise investors and other stakeholders are seeking a better understanding of how companies are evaluating and responding to climate change related risks we have been evaluating the impact and reporting on these risks for a number of years and this year have included climate change related risk as a separate principal risk to provide further clarity on the key impacts on our business and our associated response as we start 2020 we are also closely monitoring the outbreak of covid 19 and the potential implications for our business strategic risks the industries and geographies in which we operate expose us to specific long term risks which are accepted by the board as a consequence of the group s chosen strategy and operating footprint we continue to monitor recent capacity announcements and demand developments how consumers are demanding more sustainable packaging the developments in the transition period after the uk ended its membership of the european union the stability of the eurozone the increasing prevalence of trade tariffs and economic sanctions and the potential impacts of the coronavirus outbreak furthermore while we continue to increase our understanding of climate change related risks and the impacts become clearer we will continue to improve our disclosures and develop our responses the executive committee and board monitor our exposure to these risks and evaluate investment decisions against our overall exposures so that our strategic capital investments and acquisitions take advantage of the opportunities arising from our deliberate exposure to such risks industry productive capacity plant utilisation levels are the main driver of profitability in paper mills new capacity additions are usually in large increments which influence market prices through their impact on the supply demand balance unless market growth exceeds capacity additions excess capacity may lead to lower selling prices in the markets where our converting plants operate investments in newer technology may lower operating costs and provide increased product functionality increasing competition and impacting margins our strategic focus on low cost production and innovation aims to achieve cost advantages and produce higher value added sustainable and responsibly produced products this is combined with our focus on growing markets and consistent investment in our existing asset base securing our competitiveness we monitor industry developments in terms of changes in capacity utilisation levels both short and long term as well as market trends and trade flows in our own product markets this helps us to establish target capacity utilisation levels in the short term and to evaluate capital investment projects in the long term we maintain strong relationships with machine suppliers to identify current market developments and technologies and we routinely review our asset portfolio and capacity utilisation levels to identify underperforming assets and take decisive action to drive performance product substitution global socio economic and demographic trends and changing consumption patterns including increased public awareness of sustainability and increasing customer purchasing power are driving changes in customers needs and attitudes and could affect the demand for mondi products the increased public and stakeholder focus on the impact of plastic based packaging on marine and terrestrial ecosystems has led to heightened environmental considerations changes in legislation and a shift in consumer attitudes towards packaging while this could create opportunities for the group there could also be a risk of substitution which may be to different solutions not produced by mondi meeting the same customer requirements factors that may positively or negatively impact the demand for our products include reduced weight of packaging materials electronic substitution of paper products increased use of recycled raw materials substitution of plastic packaging substitution of rigid plastic by flexible packaging increased demand for high quality printed material increased demand for paper based packaging certified and responsibly produced goods and changes in demand for specific material qualities such as recyclable biodegradable packaging our ability to meet changes in consumer demand depends on our capacity to correctly anticipate change and develop new products on a sustainable competitive and cost effective basis opportunities also exist for us to take market share from substitutes produced by our competitors our focus is on products enjoying positive substitution dynamics and growing regional markets we regularly monitor trends new developments and innovations in our product markets we conduct customer surveys to get a better insight into our customers needs our sustainability task force on ecosolutions collaborates across the organisation to identify and respond to sustainability requirements from suppliers customers and consumers it also monitors the current market trends and legislative developments around sustainability of our plastic based packaging as a member of the ellen macarthur foundation s new plastics economy initiative we collaborate with stakeholders across the plastic value chain our research and development pipeline ensures that our products remain cutting edge with added focus on sustainability properties e g recyclable compostable or biodegradable products sourced responsibly our broad range of converting products provides some protection from the effects of substitution between paper and plastic based packaging products fluctuations and variability in selling prices or gross margins the group operates in cyclical markets and fluctuations in our key packaging and paper prices or converting margins can have material profit and cash flow implications our selling prices are determined by changes in capacity and demand for our products which are in turn influenced by macroeconomic conditions competitive behaviour consumer spending preferences and inventory levels maintained by our customers changes in prices differ between products and geographic regions and the timing and magnitude of such changes have varied significantly over time gross margins in our downstream converting operations are impacted by fluctuations in key input costs which cannot be passed on to customers in all cases our strategic focus is on higher growth markets and products where we enjoy a competitive advantage through innovation proximity or production cost we continue to invest in our high quality cost advantaged asset base to ensure we maintain our competitive cost position we continue to further develop businesses in higher growth markets with better long term fundamentals our high levels of vertical integration reduce our exposure to price volatility of our key input costs in our downstream operations the focus is on passing through our main material costs to sales prices our financial policies and structures take the inherent price volatility of the markets in which we operate into consideration we regularly review and monitor the current market fundamentals market demand trends and market prices to evaluate price expectations in the short term but also to understand the long term trends we monitor our order intake to identify changing trends and developments in our own product markets country risk the group has operations across more than 30 countries with differing political economic and legal systems in some countries such systems are less predictable than in countries with more developed institutional structures political or economic upheaval inflation changes in laws protectionism nationalisation or expropriation of assets may have a material effect on our operations in those countries the current macroeconomic environment is impacted by a number of uncertainties including the effects of increased protectionism use of trade tariffs economic sanctions the stability of the eurozone the uncertainty over the outcome of agreements between the uk and the european union after the uk ended its membership of the european union and more recently the potential effects of the coronavirus outbreak in china covid 19 in south africa the group is subject to land claims and could face adverse land claims rulings in february 2018 a motion was passed in the national assembly in south africa for section 25 of the south african constitution to be reviewed and amended to allow government to expropriate land without compensation a process to have the south african constitution amended accordingly has started and is expected to be finalised in 2020 there could be other changes in legislation governing land ownership in south africa our geographic diversity and decentralised management structure utilising local resources in countries in which we operate reduce our exposure to any specific jurisdiction to mitigate the effect of country specific risks we structure our capital and debt in each country based on assessed risks and exposures we regularly review our sales strategies to mitigate export risk in countries with less predictable environments and where possible we obtain credit insurance the board has approved specific country risk premiums to be added to the required returns on investment projects in those countries where risks are deemed to be higher and new investments are subject to rigorous strategic and commercial evaluation where we have large operations in higher risk locations we maintain a permanent internal audit presence and operate asset protection units during the year further analysis has been undertaken to better understand the possible consequences of the uk s exit from the european union however the group s exposure to the uk is limited the group operates two flexible packaging plants in the uk which are expected to be closed in 2020 and exports containerboard and uncoated fine paper to the uk revenues from customers in the uk represent around 3 of the group s total the impact on trade flows between the uk and the european union continues to be monitored closely we are continuously assessing the risks analysing the supply chain and developing backup plans to manage any short term disruptions given the limited direct trading exposure of the group to the uk we do not expect brexit to materially impact our ability to continue normal business operations although the group operates one engineered materials plant in china and its overall direct exposure is limited with revenues in the country accounting for less than 1 of the group s revenue we continue to closely monitor the potential impact of the coronavirus outbreak in south africa the group has settled a number of land claims structured as sale and leaseback arrangements which provide a framework for settling future land claims and continues to work with other stakeholders to engage with government on land matters we actively monitor all countries and environments in which we operate regular formal and informal interaction with government officials local communities and business partners assists us to remain abreast of changes and new developments climate change related risk climate change has the potential to affect our business in various ways while these may not be severe in the short term we believe climate change related risks are likely to have a medium and long term impact on our business our manufacturing operations are energy intensive resulting in both scope 1 and scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions in addition fibre is the main raw material for our products and forests are an important carbon store with sustainably managed forests having the opportunity to support a circular bioeconomy customers and consumers are increasingly concerned about the consequences of climate change and are looking for solutions produced from renewable materials and reduced carbon footprints our climate change related risks relate to transition and physical risks and are described below governments and regulators are likely to take action to curb carbon emissions that may impact our business such as the introduction of carbon taxes for example the eu parliament recently declared a climate emergency and called on all eu countries to phase out all direct and indirect fossil fuel subsidies by 2020 in addition to encouraging an eu policy to reach climate neutrality as soon as possible and latest by 2050 in europe all of our pulp and paper mills fall under the eu emissions trading scheme eu ets and in south africa the government has committed to introduce a carbon tax in russia the strategy for the development of a low carbon economy is currently under development changes in precipitation patterns and extreme weather conditions such as floods storms droughts and fires may impact our plantations and the forests we source wood from and could result in fibre supply chain interruptions and higher fibre costs higher temperatures may also increase the vulnerability of forests to pests and disease increased severity of extreme weather events may also interrupt our operations in water scarce countries we may see an impact on our production process as a result of limited water availability we focus on measures to reduce our ghg emissions by improving our energy efficiency optimising the use of biomass based fuels in order to reduce our use of fossil based energy sources and to decrease carbon intensive energy sources such as coal we do this with a combination of capital investments and ongoing efficiency programmes we look to source our wood from diverse regions and forest types to mitigate the potential impacts of climate change on our wood supplies in particular in europe in south africa we continue to investigate and develop wood species which require less rainfall and are more resistant to pests and disease we monitor and measure our impact on climate change our reporting on ghg emissions and energy is independently assured and we have set science based targets for our scope 1 and scope 2 emissions we support wwf climate savers programme and the we mean business coalition which aims to catalyse business action and drive policy ambition to accelerate the zero carbon transition we are committed to adhering to internationally accepted recommendations such as those published by the financial stability board s task force on climate related financial disclosures tcfd to investigate and report on climate related risks and opportunities we will continue to investigate the financial implication of our mid and long term climate related risks and opportunities using the international energy agency s 2 c scenario and a business as usual scenario rcp8 5 financial risks we aim to maintain an appropriate capital structure and to conservatively manage our financial risk exposures in compliance with all laws and regulations despite ongoing short term currency volatility and increased scrutiny of the tax affairs of multinational companies our overall residual risk exposure remains similar to previous years reflecting our conservative approach to financial risk management capital structure a strong and stable financial position increases our flexibility and provides us with the ability to take advantage of strategic opportunities as they arise our ability to raise debt and or equity financing is significantly influenced by general economic conditions developments in credit markets equity market volatility and our credit rating failure to obtain financing at reasonable rates could prevent us from realising our strategy and have a negative impact on our competitive position we operate a central treasury function under a board approved treasury policy we target investment grade credit ratings and we have access to diverse sources of funding with varying maturities the majority of our external debt is issued centrally we use a blend of floating and fixed rate debt contracts to mitigate the interest rate risk we report regularly to the board on our treasury management policies our central treasury function monitors compliance with treasury policies at operating level and we engage external advisors to review the treasury function at regular intervals currency risk as a multinational group operating globally we are exposed to the effect of changes in foreign currency rates the impact of currency fluctuations affects us because of mismatches between the currencies in which our operating costs are incurred and those in which revenues are received key operating cost currencies that are not fully offset by local currency denominated revenues include the south african rand polish zloty swedish krona and czech koruna whilst the fluctuations in the us dollar russian rouble uk pound sterling and turkish lira can also have a material impact as our revenues in these currencies are greater than operating costs incurred additionally appreciation of the euro compared with the currencies of the other key paper producing regions or paper pricing currencies notably the us dollar reduces the competitiveness of mondi products in europe compared with imports from such key paper producing regions which can result in lower revenues and earnings balance sheet exposures and material forecasted capital expenditures are hedged upon identification we do not hedge our exposure to projected future sales or operating costs and our businesses respond to adverse currency fluctuations by increasing selling prices or increasing exports where competitiveness improves as operating currencies weaken entities also borrow in their local currencies to minimise translation risk we continuously monitor exchange rate movements and sensitivities and evaluate the impact of exchange variances on our results we regularly review our prices and monitor the import and export trade flows tax risk we operate in a number of countries all with different tax systems in addition the international tax environment is becoming more onerous requiring increasing transparency and reporting and in depth scrutiny of the tax affairs of multinational companies we make significant intragroup charges the basis for which is subject to review during tax audits we aim to manage our affairs conservatively and our operations are structured tax efficiently to take advantage of available incentives and exemptions we have dedicated tax resources throughout the group supported by a centralised group tax team arm s length principles are applied in the pricing of all intragroup transactions in accordance with organisation for economic cooperation and development guidelines the board has approved the group tax strategy and performs a formal review of the group s tax affairs at least annually we obtain external advisory opinions for all major tax projects such as acquisitions and restructuring activities and make use of external benchmarks where possible we regularly engage with external advisors to stay up to date with changes in tax legislation and tax practice operational risks a low residual risk tolerance is demonstrated through our focus on operational excellence investment in our people and commitment to the responsible use of resources our investments to improve our energy efficiency engineer out our most significant safety risks improve operating efficiencies and renew our equipment continue to reduce the likelihood of operational risk events however the potential impact of any such event remains unchanged cost and availability of raw materials access to sustainable sources of raw materials is essential to our operations the raw materials used by the group include significant amounts of wood pulp paper for recycling polymers and chemicals the prices for many of these raw materials generally fluctuate in correlation with global commodity cycles wood prices and availability may be adversely affected by reduced quantities of available wood supply that meet our standards for credibly certified or controlled wood increased frequency of severe weather events changes in rainfall or increased instances of pest and disease outbreaks and increasing use of wood as a biofuel we have access to our own sources of wood in russia and south africa and we purchase wood paper for recycling pulp and polymers to meet our needs in the balance of our operations where we source our raw materials in areas of weaker governance we may face potential social and environmental risks related to waste pollution poor safety and labour practices and human rights issues we are committed to acquiring our raw materials from sustainable responsible sources and avoiding the use of any controversial or illegal supply we are involved in multi stakeholder processes to address challenges in meeting the global demand for sustainable responsible fibre and we encourage legislation supporting the local collection of recycled materials sustainable management of our forestry operations is key in managing our overall social and environmental impact helping to protect ecosystems protect worker and community rights and to develop resilient landscapes we have multiple suppliers for each of our operations and our centralised procurement teams work closely with our operations in actively pursuing longer term agreements with strategic suppliers in europe we source our wood from diverse regions and forest types to mitigate the potential impacts of unforeseen events on our wood supplies we have developed a responsible procurement process to assess and evaluate the performance of our suppliers and their adherence to our code of conduct for suppliers supplier performance is evaluated through questionnaires and audits wood and pulp suppliers are assessed as part of our due diligence management system which addresses the main legal and sustainability risks we have built strong forestry management resources in russia and south africa to actively monitor and manage our wood resources in those countries we continue to certify our forests with credible external certifications in south africa we have tree improvement programmes in place which aim to produce stronger more robust hybrids that are better able to resist disturbances such as drought pests and diseases energy security and related input costs mondi is a significant consumer of electricity which is generated internally and purchased from external suppliers where we do not generate electricity from biomass and by products of our production processes we are dependent on external suppliers for raw materials such as gas oil and coal fossil based energy sources could pose a sustainability and regulatory risk to our energy security higher energy costs contribute significantly to increasing chemical fuel and transportation costs which are often difficult to pass on to customers as an energy intensive business operating globally and relying on global supply chains we face potential physical and regulatory risks we focus on improving the energy efficiency of our operations by investing in improvements to our energy profile and increased electricity self sufficiency including the use of renewable energy sources while reducing ongoing operating costs and carbon emission levels where we generate electricity surplus to our own requirements we may sell such surplus externally we also generate income from the sale of green energy credits in certain of our operations at prices determined in the open market we focus on optimising the use of biomass based fuels in order to reduce our use of fossil based energy sources and to decrease carbon intensive energy sources such as coal energy costs are closely monitored and benchmarked against external sources and we monitor our electricity usage carbon emission levels and use of renewable energy most of our larger operations have high levels of electricity self sufficiency we actively monitor the renewable energy market fundamentals and changes in legislation and maintain contact with local energy regulators we have undertaken detailed compliance assessments regarding industry emissions and energy efficiency directives to determine future investment requirements technical integrity of our operating assets we have five major mills which account for approximately 75 of our total pulp and paper production capacity and a significant engineered materials manufacturing facility in germany if operations at any of these key facilities are interrupted for any significant length of time it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or performance incidents such as fires explosions or large machinery breakdowns or the inability of our assets to perform the required function effectively and efficiently whilst protecting people business the environment and stakeholders could result in property damage loss of production reputational damage and or safety and environmental incidents we have established a central digital transformation function to drive operational efficiency through advanced analytics automation and robotics our capital investment programme supports the replacement of older equipment to improve both reliability and integrity and our proactive repair and maintenance strategy is designed to improve production reliability and minimise breakdown risks we conduct detailed risk assessments of our high priority equipment and have specific processes and procedures in place for the ongoing management and maintenance of such equipment our asset management and technical integrity management systems have contributed to a continuous improvement of our risk profile we continue to develop our asset management system to ensure best practices for maintenance procedures and we have a maintenance training programme for our employees benchmarking activities enable us to optimise our production throughout the organisation by learning from our best performing operations and to identify any emerging issues early we actively monitor all incidents and have a formal process which allows us to share lessons learned across our operations identify emerging issues conduct benchmarking and evaluate the effectiveness of our risk reduction activities we engage external experts to perform technical integrity assessments at our major sites and enhance our engineering and loss prevention competencies and capabilities our fire protection programme is supported by external experts and independent loss prevention audits and we take out property insurance cover for key risks environmental impact we operate in a sector where the environmental impact of our business can be high and we need to manage the associated risks our operations are water carbon and energy intensive consume materials such as fibre polymers metals and chemicals and generate emissions to air water and land we are the custodian of more than two million hectares of forested land we consider potential negative impacts on constrained resources and loss of biodiversity and ecosystems from our forestry and manufacturing operations we are subject to a wide range of international national and local environmental laws and regulations as well as the requirements of our customers and expectations of our broader stakeholders costs of continuing compliance potential restoration and clean up activities and increasing costs from the effects of emissions could have an adverse impact on our profitability we ensure that we are complying with all applicable environmental and health and safety requirements where we operate our own policies and procedures at or above local policy requirements are embedded in all our operations and are supported through the use of externally accredited environmental management systems we focus on a clean production philosophy to address the impact from emissions discharge and waste we manage our water resources responsibly to address risks related to water scarcity in some of our operations and to ensure equitable use of water resources among local stakeholders wherever we operate we emphasise the responsible management of forests and associated ecosystems and protect high conservation value areas we ensure that we manage our forests responsibly and implement measures to protect biodiversity we collaborate with customers and supply chain stakeholders to better understand the concerns related to the impact of plastics in the environment and to work together on scaleable meaningful solutions to address this our product design and innovation efforts focus on reducing the environmental impact of our products throughout their life cycle we monitor our environmental performance indicators and report our progress against our 2020 commitments with our ghg emissions independently assured to reasonable assurance level we monitor regulatory developments to ensure compliance with existing operating permits and perform seat socio economic assessment toolbox assessments and water impact assessments locally to better understand our local environmental footprint and stakeholder needs employee and contractor safety we operate large facilities often in remote locations incidents cause injury to our employees or contractors property damage lost production time and or harm to our reputation risks include fatalities serious injuries occupational diseases and substance and drug abuse to ensure the safety of our employees and contractors we apply safety management systems including amongst others risk assessments safety procedures and controls we have a goal of zero harm and aim to continuously advance our 24 hour safety mind set and safety culture of sending everybody home safely we continue with the project to engineer out the most significant risks in our operations supported by robust controls and procedures for operating those assets and conducting related tasks we have a permit to work methodology across the group to improve our safety performance we provide extensive training to ensure that performance standards and practice notes are communicated and understood and our incentives are impacted by the non achievement of safety milestones lag indicators as well as achievement of lead indicators we continually investigate and monitor incidents and major close calls and actively transfer learnings across our operations our task risk management methodology provides a practical approach to conducting pre task risk assessments and our focus is on better understanding the high risk tasks in our operations we apply externally accredited safety management systems and conduct regular audits of our operations to ensure our facilities remain fit for purpose attraction and retention of key skills and talent our success is driven by our people key to our long term success is attracting retaining recruiting and developing a skilled and committed workforce access to the right skills particularly management and technical skills is critical to support the performance and growth of our business operations in remote locations or highly competitive markets make attracting and retaining skilled employees challenging losing skills or failing to attract new talent to our business has the potential to undermine our ability to drive performance and deliver on our strategic objectives our culture and values play a key role in empowering and inspiring our people these are highlighted by various inspire programmes and collaboration initiatives throughout our operations we have a zero tolerance policy towards discrimination and we provide equal opportunities for all employees to attract skills and talent we are investing in employer branding we are engaged in fair and transparent recruitment practices and have diversity and inclusion labour and human rights policies in place we ensure competitive compensation levels through benchmarking and continue to support and invest in group wide as well as local training programmes we have implemented measures to monitor and manage succession planning staff turnover internal placements and training we perform 360 degree feedback at a management level and regularly conduct performance and development reviews at a local level we carry out a group wide employee survey approximately every two years through a confidential reporting hotline speakout employees can raise concerns about conduct that may be contrary to our values compliance risks we have a zero tolerance approach to compliance risks our strong culture and values emphasised in every part of our business with a focus on integrity honesty and transparency underpin our approach reputational risk non compliance with the legal and governance requirements and globally established responsible business conduct in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate and within our supply chain could expose us to significant risk if not actively managed failure to successfully manage relationships with our stakeholders could disrupt our operations and adversely impact the group s reputation these requirements include laws relating to the environment exports price controls taxation competition compliance data protection human rights and labour fines imposed by authorities for non compliance are severe and in some cases legislation can result in criminal sanction for entities and individuals found guilty areas of weaker governance also present the challenge of addressing potential human rights issues in our operations and supply chain the introduction of human rights legislation such as the uk modern slavery act 2015 has further highlighted the need to identify and address potential risks of child labour forced or bonded labour and human trafficking in our supply chain we operate a comprehensive training and compliance programme supported by self certification and reporting with personal sanction for failure to comply with group policies we engage with our stakeholders through formal and informal processes such as our seat assessment and community engagement plans we perform sustainable development risk assessments for our suppliers and have updated the code of conduct for suppliers our legal and governance compliance is supported by a centralised legal compliance team and is subject to regular internal audit review we have a confidential reporting hotline speakout enabling employees customers suppliers managers and other stakeholders to raise concerns about misconduct information technology risk many of our operations are dependent on the availability of it services and an extended interruption of such services may result in a plant shutdown and an inability to meet customer requirements cybercrime continues to increase and attempts are increasingly sophisticated with the consequences of successful attacks including compromised data financial fraud and system shutdowns we have a comprehensive it security policy approved by the board and we operate an extensive training and awareness programme for all our users the it infrastructure is regularly tested and verified and where possible we have redundancies in place our system landscape is based on well proven products we conduct regular threat assessments and utilise external providers to evaluate and review our security policies and procedures and we have cybercrime insurance in place going concern the directors have reviewed the group s budget considered the assumptions contained in the budget and reviewed and assessed the significant risks which may impact the group s performance in the near term this includes an evaluation of the current macroeconomic environment and reasonably possible changes in the group s trading performance the group s financial position cash flows liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the condensed consolidated financial statements the group s net debt at 31 december 2019 was 2 207 million 2018 2 220 million representing a gearing level of 33 5 2018 36 7 the group s net debt to 12 month trailing underlying ebitda at 31 december 2019 was 1 3 times well within the key financial covenant requirement of 3 5 times at 31 december 2019 the group had 660 million of undrawn committed debt facilities the group s debt facilities have maturity dates of between less than 1 year and 7 years with a weighted average maturity of 3 2 years in february 2020 the group entered into an additional debt facility with a maturity of 18 months increasing the undrawn committed debt facilities available to the group by 250 million based on our evaluation the board considered it appropriate

31 december 2019 1 basis of preparation these condensed consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 december 2019 comprise mondi plc and its subsidiaries referred to as the group and the group s share of the results and net assets of its associates and joint ventures on 9 may 2019 the group s shareholders approved the simplification of the corporate structure from a dual listed company dlc structure into a single holding company structure under mondi plc with effect from 26 july 2019 mondi plc became the holder of all the mondi limited ordinary shares while by other related actions the dlc arrangements were terminated prior to the simplification mondi limited and mondi plc operated under a dlc structure as a single economic entity and as such together with their respective subsidiaries were reported on a combined and consolidated basis as a single reporting entity post simplification the group is reported on a consolidated basis further detail is provided in note 11 the group s condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles of international financial reporting standards ifrs they have been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements of the group prepared in accordance with ifrs and ifrs interpretations committee ifrs ic interpretations as adopted by the european union eu and the financial pronouncements as issued by the financial reporting standards council the group complies with article 4 of the eu ias regulation and with those parts of the companies act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under ifrs the group s condensed consolidated financial statements do not contain sufficient information to comply with ifrs the condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis as discussed in the commentary under the heading going concern the financial information set out above does not constitute the company s statutory accounts for the years ended 31 december 2019 or 2018 but is derived from those accounts statutory accounts for 2018 have been delivered to the registrar of companies and those for 2019 will be delivered in due course the auditor has reported on those accounts its report was i unqualified ii did not include a reference to any matters to which the auditor drew attention by way of emphasis without qualifying its report and iii did not contain a statement under section 498 2 or 3 of the companies act 2006 copies of the unqualified auditor s report on the integrated report and financial statements 2019 are available for inspection at the registered office of mondi plc these condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis of accounting as modified by forestry assets and financial assets and financial liabilities held at fair value through profit and loss 2 accounting policies the same accounting policies and alternative performance measures apms methods of computation and presentation have been followed in the preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 december 2019 as were applied in the preparation of the group s annual financial statements for the year ended 31 december 2018 except as set out below a number of further amendments to ifrs became effective for the financial period beginning on 1 january 2019 but the group did not have to change its accounting policies or make material retrospective adjustments as a result of adopting these new amendments following its annual review of estimated useful economic lives as required under ias 16 property plant and equipment the group has revised the estimated useful economic lives for items of plant and equipment to a range from three years to 25 years previously from three years to 20 years effective from 1 january 2019 in accordance with ias 8 accounting policies changes in accounting estimates and errors the effect of the change in accounting estimate has been recognised prospectively in the condensed consolidated income statement simplification accounting note 11 with the effect of the simplification mondi limited became a wholly owned subsidiary of mondi plc and subsequently the stated capital of mondi limited is eliminated in the condensed consolidated statement of changes in equity the difference between the nominal value of new shares issued by mondi plc 23 million and the stated capital of mondi limited recorded within the group equity immediately prior to the simplification 431 million is recognised in the merger reserve within equity the simplification was accounted for outside the scope of ifrs 3 and consequently the carrying values of the assets and liabilities of mondi limited were not adjusted to fair value but continue to be reported under the same measurement principles as applied prior to the transaction transaction costs incurred to effect the simplification are charged as a financing special item in the condensed consolidated income statement except for costs incremental and directly attributable to the issuance of new shares of mondi plc which are debited directly to retained earnings within equity in accordance with ias 32 the simplification accounting is identified as a critical accounting judgement in terms of ias 1 due to the exceptional nature of the underlying transaction and the limited guidance available in ifrs in particular the judgement applied by management that the transaction does not represent a business combination and so assets and liabilities of the mondi limited group were not remeasured to their fair value as at the transaction date instead the assets and liabilities continued to be held at their previous carrying amounts alternative performance measures the group presents certain measures of financial performance position or cash flows in the condensed consolidated financial statements that are not defined or specified according to ifrs these measures referred to as apms are defined at the end of this document and where relevant reconciled to ifrs in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements and are prepared on a consistent basis for all periods presented 3 operating segments the group reorganised its business units to strengthen value chain integration

trump or sanders both will pile up the debt whether it s a democrat or a republican installed in the white house this november you can count on fiscal discipline going out the window neither the incumbent president donald j trump nor the leading democratic contender to replace him bernie sanders appears to give a hoot about shoveling more onto the enormous pile of debt that a few months ago shot past 23 trillion why does this matter because debt impedes economic growth and just like a business if a country isn t growing it s dying keep that in mind as we explain how the real problem with the us economy and what is driving gold prices ever higher is not the coronavirus though covid 19 is certainly making things worse but the 500 pound debt gorilla that is sitting on uncle sam s chest fattened by an all you can eat buffet of dollar denominated debt let s start with the financial news gold nears 1 700 a wild day on wall street monday paired a us stock market rout with tumbling us treasury yields as gold pushed to new heights a risk off mood that started building last week due to the spread of the coronavirus and what that means for economic growth continued to steer investors towards the safety of us government bonds and gold us equities slumped alongside stocks in europe and asia after finance ministers and central bankers over the weekend warned the virus poses significant downside risks to global growth us treasuries were a go to refuge with heavy buying pushing up bond prices and lowering yields the 10 year note slid to 1 377 its lowest since july 2016 the 2 year ell to 1 287 and the 30 year bond yield tumbled to 1 849 marketwatch reported bond prices and yields move in opposite directions the 10 year rate is important to watch having fallen below the bank of america s 1 4 tipping point when that happens there is a greater than 50 probability the federal reserve will cut interest rates back to 0 from their current 1 5 to 1 75 range a 1 4 rate also means a recession is likely according to the new york fed s recession probability indicator global pandemic concerns catalyzed an intuitive rotation out of risk assets and into safe havens to start the week bloomberg quoted ian lyngen bmo s head of u s rates in a note monday the most important number in the us treasury market has become the all time record low yield mark set in the aftermath of brexit if that level is breached look out below spot gold moved as high as 1 683 oz in early trading before settling back to 1 6757 14 at time of writing its best showing since feb 4 2013 according to the 10 year gold chart bulls have been firmly in control of prices since the second quarter 2019 when central banks around the world including the federal reserve began lowering interest rates to rejuvenate slowing economies from april 13 2019 to present spot gold has risen a whopping 38 while some are questioning gold s peculiar surge ie adam hamilton who evokes gold s sudden and devastating pullback in 2013 as a harbinger we at aoth are not it is perfectly natural for the coronavirus to be a short term catalyst for gold however we do not believe covid 19 is the only factor pushing gold higher minsky moment to understand the long term trend we need to go back to the thesis we presented last week on the coming minsky moment for gold many things can happen to cause instability in the global economy and a flight to safety including a worsening coronavirus a slowdown in shipping a denting of the largest economies the us china germany japan and in the worst of cases a war though that would be good for the military industrial complex or another global recession but these are just reactions symptoms of the disease which is paper money a global fiat currency system the uncontrolled printing of paper money has caused consumer debt business debt and government debt to reach out of control proportions and the country in the worst debt shape is the united states which also happens to have the world s reserve currency we know from previous articles that the united states cannot have the reserve currency and also have a low dollar the fact that commodities are priced in us dollars that the us treasury is the most popular non metalllic safe haven and because most international transactions are cleared in us dollars means the usd must remain strong but president trump doesn t seem to understand or care about this the triffin dilemma and has made his entire presidency about narrowing us trade deficits with other countries particularly china and bringing back us manufacturing jobs through a low dollar that makes exports cheaper and imports more expensive the us can t simply devalue it has the world s reserve currency and always in demand us treasuries so the only way to weaken its currency is to start a trade war and now a currency war where countries with cheaper currencies or industries that are out competing their us counterparts are targeted with tariffs to eliminate their competitive edge as we have seen there are repercussions from this aggressive stance china russia turkey and others are moving away from pricing trade in us dollars and have slowed or stopped their us treasury purchases central banks have been stocking up on gold instead of buying treasuries will the rest of the world follow and punt the us as the world s reserve currency we at aoth think so and we await gold s coming minsky moment but let s go further into this problem of mounting debt trump and debt what s wrong with a little debt if you re donald trump the answer is nothing at mar al lago the president recently blasted critics of rising federal spending under his watch who the hell cares about the budget we re going to have a country trump said during the lavish january fundraiser according to the washington post after three years of trump the deficit has risen by more than 16 and the national debt has increased by 3 trillion to over 23 trillion the committee for responsible federal budget a non partisan watchdog estimates that trump s spending will add 4 7 trillion to the debt through 2029 the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act will cost 1 9 trillion over the next decade according to the congressional budget office on top of the 1 4 trillion budget in december that boosted defense spending the post reportedly said president trump bragged about increasing the defense budget by 2 5 trillion an amount equal to several years of defense spending his 1 5 trillion tax cut blew up the federal deficit making the 2019 deficit near 1 trillion a 26 jump from the year before markets insider calculated this would be expected under a tax and spend democrat but trump is supposedly leading the gop the party of the fiscally prudent in 2016 trump campaigned on eliminating the federal deficit in 8 years something republicans railed against obama during his two terms business insider notes the hypocrisy of the republicans on the budget deficit reporting that in 2012 sen majority leader mitch mcconnell asked president obama to be the adult in the room in discussions about spending and debt with congressional leaders seven years later the two year budget deal struck last august raises spending by 320 billion and lifts the debt ceiling the legal limit on the amount of debt the federal government can have the spending bill is expected to add 1 7 trillion to the national debt over the next decade sanders and debt of course it s no different on the other side of the aisle in fact the democrats position on debt calls for outrageous amounts of spending modern monetary theory is a new way of approaching the us federal budget that is both unconventional and absurd it posits that rather than obsessing about how large the debt has grown over 23 trillion and the ongoing annual deficits that fuel debt we should focus on spending specifically how the government can target certain spending programs that will cause minimal inflation fiscal policy on steroids is according to its proponents to be the new engine of us growth and prosperity government is therefore given a free pass on spending because the only thing that we have to worry about with the national debt is inflation curb inflation and the debt can keep growing with no consequences this is because the us government can never run out of money it just keeps printing money because dollars are always in demand with the dollar being the reserve currency and commodities are traded in dollars modern monetary theory and the ideas of the democratic party s far left fit like hand and glove pleas for universal medical coverage free college tuition and a minimum 15 per hour wage can all be paid for by setting the money presses free read more at mmt is a spectacularly dem idea fans of the bizarre economic theory include bernie sanders stephanie kelton an economics professor who advised sanders 2016 presidential campaign and alexandria ocasio cortez the far leftest wingnut new york democrat who proposed that mmt become a vehicle for to pay for her green new deal a 14 page manifesto of climate change related spending costed at up to 1 trillion surely mmt will rise again in the democratic consciousness should sanders be nominated to run against trump on monday he unveiled a 10 year 1 5 trillion plan for universal childcare the vermont senator said the funds would guarantee child care through age 3 followed by free pre school education the program would be paid for by taxing individuals whose wealth exceeds 32 million the self proclaimed democratic socialist is currently the front runner in the democratic primaries to choose their candidate for president sanders also wants to implement a single payer medical system cancel student debt make public college education free hike the minimum wage to 15 per hour and strengthen labor rights it s hard to imagine any of these policies could be accomplished without adding prolifically to the national debt the problem with debt these days it s not easy to find a lot of critics of debt banks car dealerships credit card companies payday loan stores and the biggest debtor of them all the us government all encourage consumers to get out there and spend spend spend no surprise considering that the us consumer makes up 70 of gdp the new york times quoted a report by s p global stating that government debt around the world will hit 53 trillion this year wolf street wrote earlier this month that consumer debt including credit cards and personal loans but excluding mortgage debt jumped by 187 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019 an increase of 4 7 from q4 2018 to a record 4 2 trillion could interest rates under 2 have anything to do with this according to a piece on real investment advice excessive borrowing by companies households or governments lies at the root of almost every economic crisis of the past four decades from mexico to japan and from east asia to russia venezuela and argentina but it s not just countries but companies as well you don t have to look too far back to see companies like enron gm bear stearns lehman and a litany of others brought down by surging debt levels and simple greed households too have seen their fair share of debt burden related disaster from mortgages to credit cards to massive losses of personal wealth why do governments borrow to pay for its programs obviously including expensive health care and social spending priorities increasingly however governments are relying on debt to grow their economies the above mentioned article makes some interesting points about debt and economic growth it quotes the center on budget policy priorities saying that roughly 75 of every current tax dollar goes toward non productive spending such as welfare versus productive spending like large infrastructure projects the latter investments pay for themselves over time whereas non productive spending has a negative rate of return there is also evidence that increasing debts and deficits lead to neither stronger economic growth nor increased productivity this is because the higher the debt the more money is taken away from productive investments in order to pay interest on the rising debt since obama and trump began piling on debt it has taken an ever increasing amount of debt to generate 1 of economic growth the real investment advice piece reads for the 30 years from 1952 to 1982 the economic surplus fostered a rising economic growth rate which averaged roughly 8 during that period today with the economy expected to grow at just 2 over the long term the economic deficit has never been higher if you subtract the debt there has not been any organic economic growth since 1990 in sum if you want to grow the economy don t go into debt we ve lived under us dollar rule since 1944 but history shows us that all currencies have a shelf life as we wrote in the later united states empire history is marked by empire after empire that has over extended itself militarily the us is no different the roman and british empires were underpinned by strong militaries that both expanded territories and defended them the same can be said for other empires throughout history the akkadians vikings greeks gauls spanish portuguese and soviets to name a few all seized power by conquering or seizing other lands the united states since world war two has been the street cop on the global block occasionally challenged but never yet surpassed in economic nor military power world domination however comes at a heavy price to the national budget military spending is the main reason for the spiraling debt over the past few years as a line item it is second only to social security if special forces nuclear weapons and the va budgets were added to the military budget military spending would dwarf all other spending programs the missing moderate back to the 2020 presidential election we have a very curious race developing in that trump is a republican in name only considering his profligate spending sanders is not a true democrat either in the tradition of moderates like clinton and obama his idea of spending would well surpass trump s largesse the only difference between the two is that sanders has stated he plans to divert military spending into social spending imagine if sanders were to win the nomination and becomes the candidate to take on trump say with aoc or elizabeth warren one of two progressives as his running mate and then wins to become president and warren or aoc as vice president you think 23 trillion in debt is unworkable now consider how much debt these folks would pile up under the guise of modern monetary theory and unlimited money printing to guard against this happening the democratic party needs to take a defensive stance against sanders at the upcoming super tuesday when 1 379 of the 3 979 pledged delegates will be awarded to the eight candidates still left in the race sanders sen elizabeth warren south bend indiana mayor peter buttigieg former vice president joe biden minnesota sen amy klobuchar former new york mayor michael bloomberg hawaii congresswoman tulsi gabbard and billionaire donor liberal activist tom steyer that would mean the so called moderates including biden buttigieg klobuchar and bloomberg would unite behind one candidate bringing all their delegates into one camp to prevent sanders from winning a majority of delegates come super tuesday there is already talk on twitter of elizabeth warren dropping out of the race to help consolidate such efforts against sanders at aoth we will be watching very closely to see what happens on super tuesday march 3 it is our opinion that should sanders collect enough delegates by mid march that no one else can catch him the democrats are setting themselves up for a trump coronation in november sanders was unelectable to the american public in 2016 and nothing has changed since then other than for him to galvanize his current supporters a sanders versus trump election will be a fight for the mushy middle voter one in which we predict most will hold their nose and mark an x beside the donald conclusion gold is reacting to global flash points as it always does powering to within a few dollars of 1 700 an ounce prompting comparisons to the heady gold market of early 2013 before the crash while it s the spreading coronavirus catalyzing support for the yellow metal there is an underlying problem with the us economy that we think is keeping prices buoyant and that is debt trump wants a low dollar to fix the bulging us trade deficit and attract manufacturing investment so that he can claim while out stumping for re election that he s made america great again his plan isn t working though because the dollar is the reserve currency and demand for treasuries which also means demand for dollars is very strong amid the coronavirus scare and other global hot spots instead trump has used trade wars to weaponize the dollar even starting a currency war which is really a race to the bottom where the lowest currency loses there s no way america s competitors can win against the strong us dollar especially with the new currency rule that allows the commerce department to levy tariffs carte blanche on governments and individual companies sectors it sees as a trading threat eventually their only hope will be to dump the us dollar which is already on its way to losing reserve currency status that s option 1 if trump gets back in more of the same trade wars belligerent foreign policies abandonment of constitutional principles etc option 2 is bernie sanders unless things take a moderate turn over the next few weeks sanders the furthest left among the democratic field would take the united states in an even bolder direction debt wise than trump adherence to mmt all but guarantees a road to economic ruin as runaway spending leads to money printing inflation horrendous

us economy permanently addicted to zero interest rates in fed chair jerome powell s appearance before congress on february 11th formerly known as the humphrey hawkins testimony he asserted that the u s economy was in a very good place and there s nothing about this expansion that is unstable or unsustainable but compare powell s sophomoric declaration to what charlie munger vice chairman of berkshire hathaway and warren buffett s longtime right hand man had to say about the market and the economy i think there are lots of troubles coming there s too much wretched excess mr powell s comments rival in ignorance with that of former fed chair bernanke s claim that the sub prime mort crisis was contained that is until the great recession wiped out 50 of stock valuations and over 30 of the real estate market and of course don t forget about fed chairs yellen and powell s contention that their quantitative tightening program would be like watching paint dry and run harmlessly in the background on autopilot at least that was their belief until the junk bond market disintegrated and stocks went into freefall in the fall of 2018 therefore it should not be a surprise at all that the fed doesn t recognize the greatest financial bubble in history the worldwide bond market mania perhaps this is because central banks created it in the first place and therefore didn t want to take ownership of it mr powell also averred this gem in his latest testimony low rates are not really a choice anymore they are a fact of reality credit must be given here for finally admitting the truth albeit what was probably a slip of the tongue the fed is tacitly stating that keeping money at a virtually free rate is now a mandatory condition for perpetuating asset bubbles and preventing mass defaults on the record breaking level of corporate debt so how can hoping interest rates never rise back to normal be a condition that is either stable or sustainable jay powell must understand this is an untenable position to take and how stable can interest really be when the budget deficit for the first four months of fiscal 2020 has jumped to 389 2 billion that is an increase of 25 over last year the national debt is now an incredible 23 3 trillion it was just 9 1 trillion at the end of 2007 total household debt increased by 193 billion in q4 2019 and is now 14 15 trillion this marks 22 consecutive quarterly increases with total household debt now 1 5 trillion higher than 2007 that s the good news corporate debt has exploded by over 52 since the great recession and is at a record percentage of gdp total u s debt now stands at about 330 of gdp this ratio was 150 of the economy prior to severing the dollar s tether to gold in 1971 and the total market capitalization of stocks as a percentage of gdp has soared by 50 percentage points since june 2007 another all time record high but what else would you expect when returns on cash are losing value when subtracting inflation the only way these debt and asset bubbles are manageable is if interest rates are artificially held down close to zero percent by central banks otherwise the economy will collapse and cause the gdp denominator in these ratios to plunge just as all of the debt in the numerator remains in other words these debt ratios which are already daunting will become absolutely nightmarish an economy that must lug along this tremendous debt burden encumbers its ability to grow the fed believes the only way to keep the credit markets open and keep the economy growing is by constantly lowering borrowing costs however it is now running out of room to lower interest rates it only has 1 5 before it returns to zero and most of the major central banks around the world are already at zero therefore without another round of massive fiscal stimulus like we saw with trump s tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the prospects of continuing to hold a recession in abeyance much longer are dwindling by the day this is especially true given the appetite and ability to significantly cut taxes or increase spending while annual deficits are already north of 1 trillion 5 of gdp is greatly attenuated somehow mr powell finds solace in these scary facts he doesn t understand that this bond bubble is international and its bursting will wreak havoc across the globe for example the insolvent nation of greece which back in 2012 had its 10 year bond yielding a whopping 45 has now seen its benchmark yield retreat to an all time low of just 1 today in fact greece is now issuing 13 week debt with a negative yield this is especially concerning given that its debt gdp ratio has increased from 159 back in 2012 to 181 today mr powell should tremble while wondering what greek bond yields would yield if the ecb ended q e and stopped buying its debt he s unconcerned because the ecb boj and pboc are all caught in the same trammel of ensuring money is free forever i ll close with this piece of wisdom from robert kaplan president of the dallas fed in a paper he wrote about one year ago warning about the excesses in the corporate and government bond market an elevated level of corporate debt along with the high level of u s government debt is likely to mean that the u s economy is much more interest rate sensitive than it has been historically i would have graded mr kaplan s paper with a c for using the word likely instead of definitely when referring to the economy s addiction to low rates however ultimately he gets an f for not recognizing that it is in fact the fault of central bankers for getting caught in a trap of their own creation this is yet another admission by the fed that interest rates can never be allowed to increase our central bank has now announced it is on hold forever therefore it is not much longer before investors lose faith in fiat currencies maintaining their value and that is when the real crash will begin because a central can t fix an inflation problem by promising to create more inflation in the meantime each day that goes by the madness grows larger and the inevitable reconciliation process will become all the more severe michael pento produces the weekly podcast

garment workers are at risk of temporary suspensions if factories decided to shutdown due to lack of raw material supply post staff for nearly two decades the kingdom s gross domestic product recorded exceptional performance buoyed by foreign investment grant and robust exports but covid 19 and the partial loss of eba could put an end to the good times the economic chills following the outbreak of covid 19 has sent a shiver down the spines of southeast asian economies the effect of china s overarching influence in the region is so profound that countries like malaysia hong kong indonesia and singapore have drawn up stimulus plans to protect their economies from wider effects of the virus quoting british american economist linda yueh who once said when china sneezes the whole world catches a cold seems apt when summing up the current global economic predicament already affected by the announcement of a partial suspension of the eu s everything but arms eba scheme which takes effect in august cambodia is having to deal with the spillover effect of china s economic slowdown factory shutdowns as workers stay indoors to avoid infection and travel lockdowns in chinese cities are affecting supply chains to cambodia recent logistics data showed a 10 per cent fall in import export activities between the two countries including the shipment of rice to china and raw materials such as textile for garment manufacturing in cambodia this has resulted in temporary factory shutdowns suspensions or layoffs due to a shortage of raw material about five per cent of factories in cambodia could face fabric shortages by the second week of march and 10 per cent by the end of that month said ministry of labour and vocational training spokesman heng sour asserting that the phenomenon was not related to the eba on thursday sour said some 10 factories have filed for temporary suspension which could effectively affect the livelihood of some 3 000 workers garment factories in cambodia depend on china to supply raw materials once they place an order it takes these factories about 40 days to receive the fabric before chinese new year a lot of fabric was imported into the country but then factories in china closed they remain closed to this day he said china s economy is experiencing a rare case of simultaneous demand and supply shocks nomura research wrote in a note on february 17 because covid 19 in china is far worse than severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in terms of breadth and speed of infections the fear factor among its population is palpable people are shunning crowded places like shopping malls and restaurants crimping consumption which contributed nearly three fifth of china s gross domestic product in 2019 it said moody s expects a structural slowdown in asia s growth with heightened political risk and policy uncertainty that would constrain policy choices and limit the region s ability to respond to shocks which raises the likelihood of risks crystallising further asia s deepening integration with global financial systems increases the region s susceptibility to such capital flow reversals that can occur due to sudden changes in investor sentiment triggered by unexpected shocks such as the coronavirus outbreak citing international monetary fund data the global ratings agency showed that portfolio investment to 20 countries including cambodia fell sharply in 2018 whereas foreign direct investment in 2017 and 2018 tapered off for a nation that relies heavily on foreign direct investment and concessional loans for public infrastructure development the risk going forward is real particularly for foreign bank lending as it increases the borrowers vulnerabilities if the us dollar currency risks are unhedged to give an example in the first half of 2019 cambodia s concessional loan agreements with bilateral and multilateral development partners such as china france japan the asian development bank and world bank totalled 504 7 million equivalent to special drawing rights of 361 22 million nearly half of that was in us dollars data by the ministry of economy and finance also revealed growing year on year borrowings from china to 644 8 million as of december 31 2018 the figure rose 97 per cent from 327 2 million in 2017 by june 30 2019 chinese loans amounted to 90 9 million albeit fractionally lower than south korea s 126 6 million loan although moody s expects covid 19 to have a temporary impact on china s economy there is still a high level of uncertainty around the duration and intensity of the outbreak the risk of a contagion is tangible with effects in economic activities and financial markets in asia china s interconnectedness with global production chains means that a contagion will have a disruptive effect on supply chains due to production delays from factory closures and worker shortages the severity of which is only gradually becoming clear it said seemingly the ill effects of the virus has extended to the cambodia securities exchange which registered negative performance since the start of 2020 said its chief operating office ha jong weon year to date the index fell 16 5 per cent to close at 637 97 points on february 27 2020 amid sluggish trading the trading value of chinese investors has also dropped to 4 5 per cent on february 20 from 17 3 per cent in january this year he said it is learnt that companies with china related business activities such as grand twins international cambodia plc phnom penh autonomous port and sihanoukville autonomous port sported a downward trend it might not be a coincidence but the covid 19 outbreak must be linked to impact on the local stock market and global exchanges however as big businesses in china have recently announced to resume operations we hope it will restore trading activities and commerce ha added up to february 25 nearly 2 700 people had died due to covid 19 a majority of them within china with confirmed infections standing around 78 000 worldwide contrary to the action by most governments which repatriated their citizens from china at the early stages cambodia showed compassion to that country via a visit by prime minister hun sen to beijing to commiserate with president xi jinping he also advised the 23 cambodian students in wuhan to stay put and that they would be well cared for by the chinese authorities and the cambodian embassy in china both countries have shared a good relationship for decades data since 1994 showed that china has been the single largest investor in infrastructure and resource development including rubber and tourism last year investment approval recorded 9 4 billion of which china invested 2 8 billion followed by 912 6 million by hong kong and japan 298 8 million based on accumulated foreign direct investment stocks to date chinese investment has reached over 15 billion while two way trade has surpassed 6 billion trade wise eu takes the cup exports to the eu totalled 4 9 billion 5 3 billion or 45 per cent of overall exports in 2018 making it cambodia s main trading partner this figure doubled from 2 5 billion worth of exports in 2013 ministry of labour and vocational training spokesman heng sour heng chivoan also nearly 96 per cent of cambodian exports that entered the eu in 2018 benefitted from the eba scheme the second largest after bangladesh which also benefits from it but on february 12 the european commission ec notified that the partial withdrawal of some 20 per cent tariff on cambodian exports valued at around 1 1 billion will likely commence in august hitting more than 40 of its revenue generating products such as garments travel bags and sportswear the move might require cambodia to absorb 100 million in tax on the items ostensibly denting its savings still hun sen maintained that the kingdom would not be cowed by it adding that no appeal would be made against the ec s decision in lieu of the country s sovereignty but the unexpected economic storm is threatening to undo cambodia s nearly two decades record of achieving an average seven per cent year on year gross domestic product growth having beaten the asian financial crisis twice in 2018 the world bank called it the sixth fastest expanding economy globally at 7 6 per cent mostly driven by its garment sector this year however the kingdom expects a slight contraction to 6 5 per cent underpinned by the loss of the eba and the slowing chinese economy projections by the world bank and the asian development bank were not too far off to be fair the forecasts were made before any knowledge relating to the debilitating effects of covid 19 moody s investors service inc considered that and forecast a 5 5 per cent growth due to the eba shortfall and the adverse effects on tourism and consumption from covid 19 economist chheng kimlong sees that the economy would be vulnerable to covid 19 if its effects prolong and spread to its main sectors at the same time he warns that the impact of a partial withdrawal of the eba should not be ignored i won t say it is an economic crisis it is a major economic slowdown he opined at the time of writing government officials remain unclear of the impact of the virus to the economy in a recent event with a group of graduating teachers hun sen conceded that the economy will be hit hard by covid 19 he expects a revision in the gdp growth this year citing a 60 per cent drop in overall foreign tourists arrival to cambodia and up to 90 per cent fall in chinese visitors the saying with greater power comes greater responsibility best describes cambodia s current economic effects as all these comes with a price its reclassification as a lower middle income nation with gross national income per capita of 1 070 in 2015 would affect the availability of external support grant funding may be replaced by concessional loans while net overseas development assistance may fall as new disbursements are reduced or offset by loan amortisation according to a 2017 draft report entitled cambodia development finance assessment this means is that cambodia s gradual economic maturity can no longer buck global economic trends as is the case now on monday the government introduced a back to back fiscal stimulus plan to mitigate economic risks on top of a 3 billion allocation to cope with the eba loss the four point strategy includes one to cover 20 per cent of factory workers monthly wages to reduce the burden on employers who need to only pay 40 per cent of the wage therefore workers take home just 60 per cent of their wages or 120 instead of 190 if they are suspended the government is mulling a six to 12 months tax moratorium for worst hit factories and a four month tax relief for hotels and guesthouses in siem reap the plan could result in an apparent dip in tax revenue and reserves this year compared to 2019 when the state collected 2 8 billion in tax revenue which was up 23 2 per cent from 2018 there will likely be a modest fall year on year in tax collection correlating to the anticipated dip in the gdp although the tax department had an incredible start to the year with a spectacular collection level in january deterioration in the economic performance is expected not only in cambodia but globally it will result in a lower percentage gain but a higher nominal amount collected said tax expert anthony galliano on the impact of the four per cent stamp duty exemption on properties priced below 70 000 till january next year he believes it would be small as it only affects the low to middle income group this is the smallest piece of the real estate pie but he said it provides a tax stimulus for the largest population base of the market galliano finds that the government s measures to support the tourism garment and property sectors are impactful and timely but cautions that the longer term local and global effect of the covid 19 outbreak is relatively unknown as there is no cure yet and the spread has not been contained if the spread is brought under control expectations are that economic activity would return to normal if not the situation is unpredictable at this point he said
by matthew ehret for vt canada with monday s 1000 point stock market plunge the internet has been set ablaze with a discussion of a new crash looming on the horizon the fact that such a chain reaction collapse was only kept at bay due to massive liquidity injections by the federal reserve s overnight repo loans should not be ignored these injections which began in september 2019 have grown to over 100 billion per night all that to support the largest financial bubble in human history with global derivatives estimated at 1 2 quadrillion 20 times the global gdp sadly economic illiteracy is so pervasive among today s modern economists that the real reasons for this crisis have been entirely misdiagnosed with financial experts from cnn to forbes blaming the volatility on the spread of the coronavirus not the corona virus the real cause of the oncoming financial collapse as refreshing as it is to hear candid criticisms of the system s failure and even support for the restoration of glass steagall bank separation from presidential candidates like bernie sanders tulsi gabbard or even the lame elisabeth warren we find that in each case those candidates are on record supporting policies cooked up by the very same oligarchs they appear to despise in the form of the green new deal in spite of what many of its progressive proponents would wish such a global green reform would not only impose malthusian depopulation upon nation states globally were it accepted but would establish a the supranational authority of a technocratic managerial elite as enforcers of a de carbonization agenda due to the rampant lack of comprehension of how this crisis was created such that such idiotic proposals as green new deals are now seriously being suggested as remedies to our current ills a bit of history is in order some necessary background the money changers have fled from their high seats in the temple of our civilization we may now restore that temple to the ancient truths the measure of the restoration lies in the extent to which we apply social values more noble than mere monetary profit franklin delano roosevelt first inaugural address 1933 knowing that the money changers had only been able to create the great bubbles of the 1920s via their access to the deposits of the commercial banks franklin roosevelt made the core of his battle against the abuses of wall street centre around a 1933 legislation entitled glass steagall named after the two federally elected officials who led the reform with fdr this was a bill which forced the absolute separation of productive from speculative banking guaranteeing via the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic only those commercial banking assets associated with the productive economy but forcing any speculative losses arising from investment banking to be suffered by the gambler the striking success of this law inspired other countries around the world to establish similar bank separation alongside principles of capital budgeting public credit parity pricing and a commitment to scientific and technological development a dynamic had been created that would express the greatest hope for the world and the greatest fear for the financial empire occupying the city of london and wall street the death of john f kennedy ushered in a new age of pessimism and cultural irrationalism from which our society has never recovered the destruction of a long term vision as exemplified by the space program the st lawrence seaway and the new deal projects had resulted in a tendency within the population to increasingly look upon present pleasures as the only reality and future goods as the mystical expression of the sum of present pleasures in this new philosophical setting so alien in previous epochs money was permitted to act as a power unto itself for short term gains instead of serving the investments into the real productive wealth of society with this new paradigm shift into the now a new economic model was adopted to replace the industrial economic model which had proven itself in the years preceding and following world war ii the name for this system was post industrial monetarism this would be a system ushered in by richard nixon s announcement of the destruction of the fixed exchange rate bretton woods system and its replacement by the floating rate system of post 1971 fame during that same fateful year of 1971 another ominous event took place the formation of the rothschild inter alpha group of banks under the umbrella of the royal bank of scotland which today controls upwards of 70 of the global financial system the stated intention of this group would be found in the 1983 speech by lord jacob rothschild two broad types of giant institutions the worldwide financial service company and the international commercial bank with a global trading competence may converge to form the ultimate all powerful many headed financial conglomerate this policy demanded the destruction of the sovereign nation state system and the imposition of a new feudal structure of world governance through the age old scheme of controlling the money system on the one side and playing on the vices of credulous fools who by allowing their nations to be ruled by the belief that hedonistic market forces govern the world would seal their own children s doom all the while geopolitical structures foreign to the united states constitutional traditions were imposed by nests of oxford trained rhodes scholars and fabians who converted america into a global dumb giant enforcing a neo colonial program under a anglo us special relationship the dulles brothers mcgeorge bundy kissinger and bush all represent names that advanced this british directed plan throughout the 20th century london s big bang the great liberalization of world commerce began with a series of waves through the 1970s and moved into high gear with the interest rate hikes of federal reserve chairman paul volcker in 1980 82 the effects of which both annihilated much of the small and medium sized entrepreneurs opened the speculative gates into the savings and loan debacle and also helped cartelize mineral food and financial institutions into ever greater behemoths volcker himself described this process as the controlled disintegration of the us economy upon becoming fed chairman in 1978 the raising of interest rates to 20 21 not only shut down the lifeblood of much of the us economic base but also threw the third world into greater debt slavery as nations now had to pay usurious interest on us loans in 1986 the city of london announced the beginning of a new era of economic irrationalism with margaret thatcher s big bang deregulation this wave of liberalization took the world by storm as it swept aside the separation of commercial deposit and investment banking which had been the post world war cornerstone in ensuring that the will of private finance would never again hold more sway than the power of sovereign nation states after decades of chipping away at the structure of regulation that fdr s bold intervention into history had built the big bang set a precedent for similar financial de regulation into the universal banking model in other parts of the western world the derivative time bomb is set in september 1987 the 20 year foray into speculation resulted in a 23 collapse of the dow jones on october 19 1987 within hours of this crash international emergency meetings had been convened with former jp morgan tool alan greenspan introducing a solution which would have the future echoes of hyperinflation and fascism written all over it creative financial instruments was the orwellian name given to the new financial asset popularized by greenspan but otherwise known as derivatives new supercomputing technologies were increasingly used in this new venture not as the support for higher nation building practices and space exploration programs as their nasa origins intended but would rather become perverted to accommodate the creation of new complex formulas which could associate values to price differentials on securities and insured debts that could then be hedged on those very spot and futures markets made possible via the destruction of the bretton woods system in 1971 so while an exponentially self generating monster was created that could end nowhere but in a meltdown market confidence rallied back in force with the new flux of easy money the physical potential to sustain human life continued to plummet nafta the euro and the end of history it is no coincidence that within this period another deadly treaty was passed called the north american free trade agreement nafta with this agreement made law protective programs that had kept north american factories in the u s and canada were struck down allowing for the export of the lifeblood of highly skilled industrial workforce to mexico where skills were low technologies lower and salaries lower still with stripping of its productive assets north america became increasingly reliant on exporting cheap resources and services for its means of existence again the physical productive powers of society would collapse yet monetary profits in the ephemeral now would skyrocket this was replicated in europe with the creation of the maastricht treaty in 1992 establishing the euro by 1994 while the liberalization process of perestroika replicated this agenda in the former soviet union while some personalities gave this agenda the name end of history and others the new world order the effect was the same universal banking nafta euro integration and the creation of the derivative economy in a space of just several years would induce a cartelization of finance through newly legalized mergers and acquisitions at a rate never before seen the multitude of financial institutions that had existed in the early 1980s were absorbed into each other at great speed through the 1990s in true survival of the fittest fashion no matter what level of regulation were attempted under this new structure the degree of conflict of interest and private political power was uncontrollable as evidenced in the united states by the shutdown of any attempt by securities and exchange commission head brooksley born to fight the derivative cancer at its early stages by 1999 a politically castrated bill clinton found himself signing into law a treaty authored by then treasury secretary larry summers known as the gramm leach bliley act which would be the final nail in the coffin for the glass steagall separation of commercial and investment banking in the united states the new age of unregulated trading and creation of over the counter derivatives caused these strange financial instruments to grow from 60 trillion in 2000 to 600 trillion by 2008 the 2000 2008 frenzy with glass steagall now removed legitimate capital such as pension funds could be used to start a hedge to end all hedges billions were now poured into mortgage backed securities mbs a market that had been artificially plunged to record breaking interest rate lows of 1 2 for over a year by the us federal reserve making borrowing easy and the returns on the investments into the mbss obscene the obscenity swelled as the values of the houses skyrocketed far beyond the real values to the tune of one hundred thousand dollar homes selling for 5 6 times that price within the span of several years as long as no one assumed this growth was ab normal and the unpayable nature of the capital underlying the leveraged assets locked up in the now infamous sub primes and other illegitimate debt obligations was ignored then profits were supposed to just continue infinitely anyone who questioned this logic was considered a heretic by the latter day priesthood the stunning success of securitizing housing debts immediately induced a wave of sovereign wealth funds to come into prominence applying the same model that had been used in the case of mortgage backed securities mbs and collateralized debt obligations cdo to the debts of entire nations the securitizing of bundled packages of sovereign debts that could then be infinitely leveraged on the de regulated world markets would no longer be considered an act of national treason but the key to easy money conclusion this is the system which died in 2008 contrary to popular belief nothing was actually resolved for all the talk of an fdr revival under obama speculation wasn t actually regulated under the dodd frank act or the volker rule of 2010 no productive credit was created to grow the real economy under a national mission as was the case in 1933 1938 banks were not broken up while derivatives grew by 40 with the new bubble concentrated in the corporate household debt sector now collapsing during this time nation states continued to be stripped as austerity was rammed down the throats of nations it should be no surprise that in the midst of this despair a creative alliance was consolidated in defense of the interests of sovereign nation states and humanity at large led by the leadership of russia and china this leadership took the form of the china led belt and road initiative which has grown to embrace over 130 countries today and looking more and more like an asian led version of the new deal of the 1930s indeed china s capacity to unleash long term credit for thousands of international long term infrastructure projects was made possible by the fact that it was the only country on the globe which had not given up the principles of bank separation which were destroyed in every other nation very few western figures stood up to this self induced destruction over the decades but one notable exception here worth mentioning is the figure of the late american economist lyndon larouche 1922 2019 who not only resisted this process for over four decades but fought alongside the schiller institute to promote new silk road as early as 1996 with the 2016 brexit and election of president trump a new wave of nationalist spirit has become a fire which the technocrats have lost their capacity to snuff out increasingly the idea that nation states have a power over the private banking system has become revived and discussion for reforming the now dead trans atlantic system is increasingly shaped not by the calls for a new world order as sir kissinger would have liked but rather for a new silk road and a true new deal the eurasian nations are already firmly committed to this new system and if the west is to qualify morally to take part in this new epoch then the first step will be a return to a glass steagall about author matthew ehret is the editor in chief of the

speech by isabel schnabel member of the executive board of the ecb at the barclays international monetary policy forum we are currently living through times of tremendous challenges for the conduct of monetary policy although the actions of major central banks over the past few years have succeeded in easing financial conditions and thereby stabilising growth and inflation current and expected inflation rates remain stubbornly below target in spite of years of exceptional monetary policy support subdued price pressures have given rise to widespread scepticism about the ability of monetary policy to bring inflation back to target while it is widely accepted that central banks cannot fine tune inflation in the short term some now even doubt their ability to reach their objective in the medium term today i would like to speak to these concerns by shedding light on some factors that may impede a more forceful and rapid return of inflation to levels closer to 2 focusing on the euro area i will argue that the nature and properties of the shocks that have been hitting the euro area over the past few years require central banks to exercise more patience in reaching their inflation aim in particular when approaching the effective lower bound this implies that the medium term horizon over which the ecb pursues the sustainable alignment of inflation with its aim is considerably longer than in the past communication on the factors affecting the length of the medium term increases the public s understanding of the ecb s monetary policy thereby also reducing the risks of a destabilisation of inflation expectations a shock dependant monetary policy in calibrating monetary policy central banks typically distinguish between two broad types of shocks affecting the inflation outlook the first type is demand shocks which pull both output and inflation in the same direction the euro area sovereign debt crisis is a good example as credit conditions tightened in parts of the euro area both the public and private sector cut back sharply on spending thereby pushing down prices and wages such demand shocks typically call for determined policy action by acting swiftly and forcefully central banks minimise the adverse impact of a decline in consumption and investment on prices and wages supply shocks the second type are different as they typically pull inflation and output in opposite directions a sharp exogenous increase in oil prices for example pushes inflation up while harming growth and employment to minimise volatility in economic activity supply shocks therefore usually require a smoother and more protracted policy response the implication is that central banks generally choose to bring inflation back to their aim over horizons of different length the choice of the horizon in turn depends among other things on the nature size and persistence of the shocks hitting the economy as well as on the speed and scope of the transmission of monetary impulses to prices and wages which may vary with the use of different instruments supply side shocks typically imply longer horizons than demand side shocks and while central banks can usually afford to look through temporary shocks more persistent shocks that risk destabilising inflation expectations may require a shorter horizon i will come back to this later for the ecb this means that the length of the medium term which is an integral part of its definition of price stability will vary over time in reality of course economies are constantly hit by a wide variety of shocks and central banks often have only a limited understanding of the precise configuration of the forces pushing inflation in either direction which complicates the conduct of monetary policy over the past few weeks for example the dramatic events around the spread of the coronavirus have increased uncertainty about the global growth outlook and also the outlook for the euro area but very little is yet known about the potential medium term implications today i will focus on other more slow moving structural factors that may influence the transmission of monetary policy to inflation i will start from the question as to why inflation has not seen more persistent upward pressure despite years of exceptional monetary stimulus there are several competing hypotheses the first hypothesis is that unconventional policy instruments have been ineffective although we have not yet heard the final word on this topic in my opinion the available empirical evidence broadly dismisses this view the use of these instruments has substantially loosened financing conditions with beneficial effects for economic growth employment and inflation chart 1 unconventional policy instruments had considerable positive impact source ecb calculations notes the calculations are based on estimates by eurosystem experts and the estimates in rostagno et al 2019 the estimates of eurosystem experts are based on various modelling methods from purely structural models to time series models a second hypothesis is that economic slack may still be larger than conventional indicators suggest estimates by international organisations suggest that slack in the euro area has diminished measurably over the past few years and that by and large the output gap in the euro area has closed chart 2 a uncertainty over the remaining degree of economic slack euro area output gap in percent of potential output sources european commission imf oecdlast observations 2022 imf 2021 ec oecd alternative measures of the output gap paint a different picture however chart 2 b uncertainty over the remaining degree of economic slack euro area output gap in percent of potential output source jarocinski m and m lenza 2018 an inflation predicting measure of the output gap in the euro area journal of money credit and banking vol 50 6 pp 1189 1224 ecb staff for example have developed an indicator based on a large set of economic variables that outperforms other measures in its ability to forecast underlying inflation out of sample clearly this measure would point to continued substantial slack in the euro area economy but such indicators come with two caveats the first is that they reverse engineer that is inflation or the lack thereof is always and everywhere attributed to economic slack and the second caveat is that they are difficult to reconcile with both survey based and hard data based indicators of slack in the labour market which even point to growing signs of labour shortages chart 3 but growing signs of shortages in labour markets importantly improvements in the labour market have not been confined to headline unemployment over the past few years we have observed a marked decline in the number of discouraged workers and underemployed part time workers slide 3 left panel ecb estimates suggest that current broad labour market conditions do not differ much from those observed just before the outbreak of the global financial crisis the question then is why inflation remains so muted which brings me to the third hypothesis the view that other mostly supply side factors may currently be weighing on inflation phillips curve estimates by ecb staff visualise this idea chart 4 reduction of slack putting upward pressure on wages and prices these estimates which are based on a large number of economic activity indicators suggest that the erosion of economic slack the yellow bars has progressively contributed to pushing up both wages and prices at the same time however these estimates currently leave a large part of underlying inflation unexplained it is possible that these residuals reflect measurement errors for example regarding economic slack but they may also reflect at least in part other structural factors that are more difficult to identify and quantify one way to gauge the potential role of these factors is to analyse the wealth of available financial market data focusing on inflation expectations rather than actual inflation chart 5 a supply shocks likely contributed to decline in market based inflation expectations drivers of developments in the 10 year

equities exchange rates and inflation swaps to extract signals about the potential drivers of the cumulative changes in ten year inflation linked swaps since 2005 clearly according to this methodology a significant part of the decline in long term inflation expectations has been due to the weakening in aggregate demand the yellow area at the time of the sovereign debt crisis and again in 2018 on the back of the deterioration in the global growth outlook but you can also see that a substantial part of the cumulative decline in inflation expectations may be due to supply side factors indeed in the hypothetical absence of these supply side shocks ten year inflation linked swaps could currently be trading at levels much closer to 2 chart 5 b supply shocks likely contributed to decline in

latest observation 18 february 2020 in other words their effects are potentially meaningful in quantitative terms these shocks are likely to reflect a variety of structural factors which may differ as to how and to what extent they affect inflation over time collectively however they are likely to explain part of the protracted weakness in inflation i would like to discuss two such structural factors and their potential implications for the ecb s medium term horizon the first factor relates to changes in the energy sector in particular the pervasive effects of the shale oil revolution and changes to the transmission of oil price shocks and the second factor relates to the pricing behaviour of firms and their ability to buffer cost push shocks through changes in their profit margins the changing role of energy in inflation dynamics the rise in energy prices was a prime contributor to euro area hicp inflation before the outbreak of the global financial crisis chart 6 marked fall in the contribution of energy to headline inflation shares of the main hicp aggregates in average hicp inflation percentage source eurostat and ecb calculations it accounted on average for 23 of headline inflation in the ten years from 1999 to 2008 since then the contribution of energy has fallen to 14 on average and over the past five years the average contribution has dropped to zero so the measurable and persistent decline in the contribution of energy prices to inflation has been one major source of low inflation in recent years what is less clear however are the causes of the fall in the contribution of energy price inflation and whether the effects can be expected to persist in the future energy inflation has so far been predominantly driven by the price of oil which fluctuates in line with supply and demand for monetary policy the distinction between supply and demand matters much along the same lines i described before falling oil prices for example are often a symptom of a broader weakness in global aggregate demand in which case they send important signals for monetary policy in real time since about 2014 however model based analysis has suggested that the predominant source of the decline in oil prices is likely to reflect supply side factors chart 7 a overhang in oil inventories weighing on oil prices oil price decomposition cumulative contributions to changes in oil price since january 2010 oil price in usd per barrel source bloomberg haver analytics iea and ecb staff calculations notes the decomposition is derived from a monthly structural bvar model with sign restrictions the model decomposes the average brent spot oil price global oil production and global economic activity and identifies three shocks i aggregate demand shocks are identified by an increase in prices production and activity ii precautionary demand shocks are identified by an increase in prices and production and a decrease in activity iii supply shocks are identified by an increase in prices and a decrease in production and activity another way to see this is to consider the strong surge in oil inventories among oecd countries chart 7 b overhang in oil inventories weighing on oil prices oecd oil inventories and oil price lhs billion barrels rhs usd per barrel inverted sources bloomberg iea and ecb staff calculations latest observation jan 2020 spot and dec 2019 inventories oil inventories typically correlate closely and negatively with oil prices one of the key factors behind the rise in inventories was the initial decision by traditional oil producing economies to abandon production targets and hence to put downward pressure on oil prices in response to the unprecedented surge in shale oil production in the united states that took off at the beginning of the past decade over this period the united states has emerged as the largest oil producer in the world and it now accounts for nearly one fifth of total global oil output chart 8 a shale oil break even prices may anchor oil price expectations market share of major oil producers percent sources iea and ecb staff calculations latest observation january 2020 there are signs that the rise of the united states as a major oil producer may have fundamentally changed market expectations of the long run equilibrium price of oil over recent years we have observed an interesting correlation between future expected oil prices and the evolution of the break even price of shale oil producers i e the price above which it becomes profitable to exploit new sources of shale oil all else being equal market participants expect oil prices to converge towards the expected marginal cost of supply chart 8 b shale oil break even prices may anchor oil price expectations oil production break evens and long term oil price expectations usd per barrel sources dallas fed kansas fed and bloomberg notes dallas fed data is yearly kansas fed data is bi yearly latest observation january 2020 at face value this anchoring role of the break even price could suggest that investors consider the shale oil revolution to have structurally changed the elasticity of oil supply to demand fluctuations and hence to have put an effective ceiling on oil prices whether or not the oil supply has indeed become more elastic and may therefore permanently reduce the upside contribution of energy to headline inflation is ultimately an empirical question but more fundamentally changes in the oil market have been accompanied by equally far reaching changes in the use of oil as a production input over the past few decades technological advances and shifts in the energy and industry composition in advanced economies have gradually reduced the sensitivity of growth and hence underlying inflation to oil price increases for example between 1990 and 2018 global oil intensity total oil consumption per unit of gross domestic product fell by 25 chart 9 a global economy more resilient to oil price shocks oil intensity oil consumption mbd per gdp in constant prices sources iea haver analytics and ecb staff calculations latest observation 2018 ecb staff analysis suggests that as a result a supply induced increase in oil prices today causes global industrial production to contract by only around half as much as it did during the 1990s and 2000s chart 9 b global economy more resilient to oil price shocks response of global industrial production to oil supply shocks impulse responses to shock after 48 months median and 15th and 85th percentiles percentage points sources iea fred and ecb staff calculations notes the response is estimated using a svar with sign restrictions the oil supply shock is identified assuming that it lowers oil production and industrial production but raises the price of oil the responses are calibrated to a 10 percent shock to the price of oil the muted response of financial markets to the tensions in the middle east around the turn of the year would be consistent with these findings these trends could even intensify in the future in the course of the ongoing energy transition in the european union for example the objective is to further reduce energy consumption by one third by 2030 and to increase the use of renewable energy sources if successful this would further mitigate the pass through of potential oil price fluctuations to production and hence underlying inflation moreover if more fundamental progress is achieved in terms of energy storage the marginal cost of producing renewable energy may become considerably lower and more stable compared with the production of fossil fuels this could much more fundamentally transform the role of energy in affecting overall price dynamics taken together persistent supply shocks of this nature potentially pose a dilemma for monetary policy in the sense that improved energy efficiency and more stable oil prices have supported and continue to support consumption and investment but risk entrenching expectations of low inflation in this case central banks may no longer be able to afford to look through such shocks and may be forced to shorten the horizon over which inflation should be brought back to their aim this trade off is even more problematic in the vicinity of the effective lower bound for at least two reasons the first and most obvious is because policy space is reduced the second is that a more intense usage of non standard policy measures such as negative interest rates or asset purchases may shift the balance of the costs and benefits of providing an additional unit of monetary accommodation the implication of this is that today more than ever central banks need to have a solid understanding of how inflation expectations ultimately affect the inflation outlook and which expectations are at play this question is an integral part of the ecb s ongoing strategy review if for example market based inflation expectations prove to have only a marginal effect on actual inflation then the case for central banks acting on these measures is weakened substantially even if they signal rising discomfort about future inflationary pressures the role of profits in the transmission of monetary policy the second structural factor that i would like to discuss today relates to the role of profit margins in affecting inflation outcomes and the transmission of monetary policy it is well known that many firms routinely absorb short term fluctuations in demand exchange rates or production costs in their profit margins in the euro area for example there is substantial variation in profit margins over time chart 10 a variations in profit margins affect inflation dynamics gdp deflator and components annual percentage changes pp contributions sources eurostat and ecb calculations a model based assessment by ecb staff shows that demand shocks both domestic and foreign and changes in oil prices are prime sources of fluctuations in profit margins chart 10 b variations in profit margins affect inflation dynamics structural decomposition of unit profits deviations from mean in y o y terms and pp contributions sources ecb staff calculations hahn e 2019 a model based interpretation of the drivers of recent and projected euro area profit margin developments ecb mimeo notes historical decomposition of unit profit growth from a bvar model in which domestic and foreign demand shocks wage mark up shocks and oil supply shocks are identified via sign restrictions an issue that is less well understood however is whether this buffering role of profit margins has changed over time that is whether structural changes in the profitability of firms have increased or reduced the role of profits in affecting aggregate price dynamics my starting point for answering this question is the evolution of the profit share over time you can see that the profit share has increased substantially both in the euro area and the united states chart 11 a structural rise in profit share and number of highly profitable firms profit shares in the euro area and the united states percentages sources eurostat area wide model database oecd and ecb calculations notes the profit shares are calculated as the share of gross operating surplus over gross operating surplus plus compensation of employees gross operating surplus is corrected for the self employed in the euro area it has increased from an average level of 25 in the 1970s to 37 today and it has increased by even more than in the united states over this period this rise has not been sudden it has rather been a gradual and persistent increase that only came to a halt with the outbreak of the global financial crisis in 2008 macroeconomic data are often only a very crude proxy of net entrepreneurial income but microdata corroborate the view that aggregate profitability is likely to have increased structurally over time

calculation of profits all expenses are taken into account including material and labour costs as well as interest taxes and other operating expenses the micro data include non financial firms with at least 10 years in the panel and aggregate economy output coverage of 50 70 on average the between country weighting is done using gdp weights the share of euro area firms with very high profitability here measured as firms displaying a ratio of profits over revenues of greater than 5 has increased by around 10 percentage points to 42 since 1995 at the same time the share of firms with very low profitability has declined two broad competing hypotheses have been proposed in the literature to explain the rise in profits mainly for the case of the united states one is that growing profits are the result of the rise of highly productive superstar firms the other hypothesis which is less favourable is that a gradual decline in competition and increased regulation has protected rent seeking firms a more detailed discussion of these hypotheses is beyond the scope of my remarks today i will rather focus on what the rise in profits may imply for the pass through of monetary policy to inflation i see two broad repercussions the first is rather mechanical but quantitatively important rising profits imply a lower labour share so changes in labour costs have less direct impact on inflation than they did two or three decades ago the second and related implication is that higher profit margins provide a larger cushion for firms to absorb cost push shocks such as wage increases a staff analysis using the ecb s workhorse structural model the new area wide model supports the view that profit margins were and are being used to cushion emerging price pressures chart 12 profit

ecb s micro founded model for forecasting and policy analysis with a financial sector ecb working paper no 2200 since the introduction of the euro mark up shocks that is changes in profit margins green bars have never played a larger and more persistent role in mitigating upward pressure on inflation than they do today this does not mean that the pass through of changes in demand and production costs to final consumer prices is generally impaired rather it means that the lags with which they are transmitted may be longer and more variable recent ecb research has confirmed that there is a robust link between changes in labour costs and price inflation in the euro area but it also highlights that this link is state and shock dependant in an environment of weak demand for example firms tend to absorb cost push shocks by compressing their price mark ups the implication is that today as compared with the 1970s 1980s or 1990s the structural rise in profit margins allows firms to buffer shocks over a longer horizon the current resilience in underlying inflation despite the marked increase in wage growth may be less surprising in the light of these findings ecb research indeed confirms that the role of profits may have changed more fundamentally over time chart 13 changing the role of profits in absorbing wage shocks source hahn e 2019 how are wage developments passed through to prices in the euro area evidence from a bvar model applied economics published online 1 november 2019 notes the x axis refers to the quarters since the shock the magnitude of the shock is normalised to a 1 increase in compensation per employee over the first four quarters it is assumed that indirect taxes net of subsidies respond proportionally to real gdp such that this component does not contribute to the changes in the gdp deflator this research analyses the response of the gdp deflator for three different sub samples to a 1 increase in compensation per employee according to this research profits only started to take on a measurable buffering role over the past 20 years in the 1970s by contrast profits even slightly increased in the face of a labour cost push shock these changes may of course reflect a number of factors one factor could relate to the level of inflation because the secular decline in inflation over time may have reduced the perceived persistence of cost push shocks and thus have raised the willingness of firms to absorb these shocks through changes in profit margins another factor may relate to changes in the degree of competition digitalisation and growing price transparency through the internet may be increasingly limiting the ability of firms to pass through changes in costs to final consumer prices research shows for example that price levels on websites and physical stores are identical 72 of the time the point worth noting here however is that the marked secular rise in profits is likely to have expanded the room for manoeuvre of the rising share of very profitable firms to cope with such structural changes it could thus have contributed to the changing role of margins in the propagation of cost push shocks for central banks this means that the effects of monetary policy may at times take longer to show through in underlying inflation in particular in periods of elevated uncertainty it also means that profit margins may currently operate like a benign supply side shock they lift output but they suppress inflation chart 14 mark up shocks act like benign supply side shocks

a financial sector ecb working paper no 2200 and this supply side nature of changes in profit margins implies that the policy relevant horizon over which policymakers should steer inflation back to their aim is longer than it would have been in the absence of such structural changes similar to the effects of the shale oil revolution conclusion let me conclude the ecb aims to reach its inflation aim of below but close to 2 over the medium term how long the medium term is depends on various factors including the nature size and persistence of economic shocks the current highly accommodative monetary policy stance has succeeded in materially shortening the horizon over which inflation will return to levels closer to 2 current and expected inflation rates however remain well below target i have argued that at least two structural factors the changed role of energy inflation and the cushioning effect of higher profit margins have weighed on underlying price pressures such sizeable and persistent supply side shocks pose a dilemma for central banks on the one hand they call for a lengthening of the horizon over which the ecb should steer inflation back to its aim on the other hand central banks are limited in the extent to which they can ignore such shocks without risking a destabilisation of inflation expectations this trade off is particularly stark in the vicinity of the effective lower bound where attempting to further shorten the horizon by easing financial conditions carries the risk of shifting the balance of the costs and benefits of a highly accommodative monetary policy stance by increasing risks to financial stability in this environment it is imperative for central banks to have a solid understanding of the potential risks of second round effects which includes a thorough assessment of how and which inflation expectations affect actual inflation outcomes as well as of the side effects of unconventional monetary policy measures in particular as regards financial stability these efforts will be an important part of the ecb s ongoing strategy review thank you
the outlook for the global economy still recovering from a synchronized slowdown brought on in part by the u s china trade war is bleak according to a new report published by the economist intelligence unit on tuesday global growth is forecast to be just 2 9 percent in 2020 near a decades low the gloomy outlook a reverse from the uptick in growth expected just a few months ago has been brought on by renewed geopolitical uncertainty along with the emergence of the deadly coronavirus while a growth slowdown could be cushioned by ultra loose monetary policy among the world s major central banks the u s has historically low interest rates and a number of countries have negative rates it also may trigger new debt crises in emerging markets while limiting banks powers to respond to recession risks advertisement advertisement these are the five biggest threats that could endanger the global economy 1 u s iran conflict leads to a spike in global oil prices at the beginning of january president trump authorized a drone strike that killed iran s top security and intelligence commander gen qassim suleimani a serious escalation of washington s growing confrontation with tehran while both sides are reluctant to engage in a full out war nor does iran have the military or financial means to do so tensions between the two countries remain exponentially high complicating communication there s also increased risk that iran could launch a targeted attack against u s interests in the middle east advertisement advertisement as a result the economist intelligence unit wrote in the paper the risk of an unintended slide into an escalating military conflict cannot be ruled out according to the study there s a 25 percent chance the u s and iran will be dragged into a direct conventional war which would have devastating consequences for the global economy in particular a war would almost certainly force the strait of hormuz which roughly 20 percent of global oil supplies rely on could be closed for an extended period of time story continues 2 a trade war breaks out between the u s and the european union tensions between the u s and eu have remained strained since mid 2018 when the trump administration threatened to impose a 25 percent tariff on vehicles produced in europe while that particular threat seems to have receded the u s is currently at odds with france over the country s digital services tax which targets american tech companies including amazon apple and google what triggers an economic recession because the u s and china signed a partial trade deal it s likely that trump will turn his attention to europe this year according to the paper if the u s and eu are dragged into a trade war the impact on the global economy would be severe the report said it estimated there s a 25 percent chance of a trade war breaking out between the long time allies advertisement advertisement global growth would slow inflation would rise and consumer and business sentiment would drop it said 3 coronavirus takes a lasting toll on the global economy china the world s second largest economy has responded to a deadly outbreak of the coronavirus by all but halting its production of consumer goods like phones clothing and automobiles instituting mass quarantines in some cities and placing severe restrictions on an estimated 780 million people the verge reported multiple companies and countries are limiting travel to and from mainland china evacuating citizens and scaling back operations advertisement advertisement the virus has killed close to 3 000 people with more than 80 000 cases reported worldwide mostly in china how deadly is new coronavirus it s still too early to tell the global economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak is set to be more profound than that of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars a similar virus that spread from china in 2003 owing to the much larger role that china plays in the global economy today the report said whether or not it has a significant impact on the global economy however depends on the length of its duration fed says us economic risks easing but warns about coronavirus threat advertisement advertisement once china gets the disease under control it will likely introduce strong fiscal and monetary stimulus to engineer a recovery in economic expansion resulting in a rebound of growth worldwide the eiu estimated a 20 percent probability that the virus will not be contained in china until mid 2020 and a 5 percent chance it will remain uncontained beyond this year if it spreads further globally the eiu will adjust its global real gdp outlook below 2 5 percent this year 4 debt burdens cause a recession across emerging markets a decade of low interest rates has caused global debt levels to rise with external debt levels now significantly higher than they were in 2009 in some markets the level and risk profile of corporate debt has also risen particularly in the u s the report said as a result global growth prospects have become more vulnerable to a change in financial conditions such as changes in us interest rates or financial market risk appetite which could rapidly translate to higher funding costs for indebted countries the report said this occurred in 2018 when rising us interest rates and a strengthening us dollar against other currencies caused widespread currency volatility among emerging markets triggering currency crises and severe recessions in turkey and argentina advertisement advertisement 5 hong kong protests cause an exodus from asia s biggest financial center pro democracy protests began in hong kong during the summer over a now shelved bill that would have allowed the extradition of suspected criminals from hong kong to mainland china where the courts are controlled by the communist party the eiu forecast a distinct chance the protests flare up again if civil rights appear to be under attack and if tensions continue to rise there s a possibility that china could respond to the chaos and mounting pro independence sentiment in hong kong by suspending the one country two systems mode of governance hong kong a former british colony was returned to china in 1997 under an agreement known as one country two systems which allowed the city to retain a high degree of autonomy for 50 years the agreement expires in 2047 escalating unrest could lead to the deployment of the chinese army from the mainland raising the possibility of casualties advertisement advertisement either of these scenarios would cause serious and sudden economic dislocation and threaten hong kong s status as the world s third most important financial centre the report said they would result in a swift departure of the foreign talent that lubricates hong kong s economy and prompt many possibly most foreign businesses in hong kong to close or relocate to other asian cities such as singapore tokyo

of free cash flow is more consistent with that utilized by other companies in the industry year after year eog keeps getting better delivering record operating performance in 2019 significant capital efficiency improvements from strong well productivity and sustainable cost reductions allowed us to deliver higher production with less capital investment than we planned at the beginning of the year said william r bill thomas chairman and chief executive officer we did this while generating substantial free cash flow strengthening our financial position and increasing the dividend this was the third consecutive year since our transition to premium drilling that eog delivered double digit returns and production growth along with strong free cash flow 2020 capital plan the purpose of eog s annual capital program is to generate high returns on investment and increase the company s business value exploration and development expenditures for 2020 are expected to range from 6 3 billion to 6 7 billion including facilities and gathering processing and other expenditures and excluding acquisitions and non cash exchanges the disciplined capital program supports growth in crude oil production of 10 to 14 percent in 2020 and funds dividend payments with net cash from operating activities at less than 50 oil due to the decline in crude oil prices the 2020 capital plan allocates slightly less capital to growing oil production than in 2019 to continue to improve the company the 2020 plan allocates more capital than in 2019 to fund new high quality drilling potential and high return infrastructure to further lower eog s cost structure and environmental footprint with the benefit of sustainable cost reductions and operational efficiencies eog expects to complete approximately 800 net wells in 2020 compared with 750 net wells in 2019 activity will remain focused in eog s highest rate of return oil assets in the delaware basin eagle ford and rocky mountain area eog s 2020 capital plan reflects continued improvement in capital efficiency highlights the resiliency of our business model and ensures the capital program and dividend payments can be funded at a conservative oil price looking to the future our 2020 plan also invests in new high return drilling potential and infrastructure development to lower costs and further improve the company thomas said eog s sustainable competitive advantages already position us as one of the lowest cost oil producers in the global market and we are poised to extend our cost advantage well into the future dividend increase the board of directors declared a dividend of 0 375 per share on eog s common stock an increase of 30 percent the dividend will be payable april 30 2020 to stockholders of record as of april

as the cacophony of noise predicting economic implosion from the bloated fiscal deficit and public debt pile up is getting louder every day it is important to put the things into correct perspective for the benefit of everyone since the day the new government announced its tax reform package last november as part of its short term economic incentive package to revive a moribund economy many went to town with a doomsday scenario that the economy is going to implode they said the tax reform package is so big that it would suck out 1 1 5 percent gdp of revenue resulting in at least 6 5 percent fiscal deficit for 2019 but this same people forgot that even with the international monetary fund imf led revenue based fiscal consolidation brought only the opposite results to its desired intensions in fact the fiscal deficit rose during 2018 and 2019 the fiscal deficit in 2018 was 5 3 percent of gdp nowhere near the imf set target or the government s own target so what s all this noise the same lot also forgot that the imf prescribed revenue based fiscal consolidation programme had one big hole in it i e it killed the incentive for growth thanks to that tunnel vision sri lanka borrowed from the imf debt to gdp mantra sri lanka has seen its growth sputtering since 2017 and all indications were such that it would hit the bottom in 2019 the central bank recently projected that the economic growth for 2019 could not be better than 2 7 percent the most i e the lowest in two decades so one needs only common sense to realise that their standard prescription is losing efficiency and thereby its appeal and thus one can conclude that the imf bailout is a failed project this is perhaps why the new central bank governor prof w d lakshman recently said that the imf itself is rethinking its own policy based on the washington consensus damned if you do and damned if you don t one should not forget that the sri lankan economy was already in the icu when it was handed down to the rajapaksa administration on november 16 while this attempt is not to whitewash the record of the economic management during the 2005 2014 period it is certainly better than the total cock up during the five years that followed economic growth was half of what it used to be pre 2015 the per capita income was limping public debt was higher systematic risks had risen build up of weaker asset quality in the banking sector and weaknesses in certain sectors such as property emergence of sharp economic imbalances and the list goes on the most conspicuous was the absence of the economic actors consumers businesses and investors who had gone into near dormancy as they got punished from all fronts taxes interest rates and regulations hence something had to be done to give a lifeline to these sectors to help them return to normalcy lower taxes and interest rates moratorium for loans and relaxation of certain regulations are common tools at the disposal of every administration to make things work in the economy the new administration quite generously is using these to kick start the economy what more anyone could do in the short term of course there are so called structural reforms but they are more medium and long term and the effects will only be visible in the fourth and fifth years of the administration only if they start now one such area of structural reform is the reforming the perennially corrupt and inefficient public sector which no lesser authority than president gotabaya rajapaksa himself has taken an undertaking to clean it up also he has already announced reforms to many other sectors such as education healthcare agriculture and environment of course they are yet to be matched with the deeds but at least we now hear the right things there are daily attempts by various parties to portray the rajapaksa administration s tax reforms as a show of economic incompetence and a political play while the latter could be partly true because the government was few months away from a crucial general election the same could not be said of the former because tax cuts were on the cards for months and it is in their manifesto which the people gave a strong mandate to implement nobody could say they totally miscalculated the consequences given their track record in the earlier 10 year stint can there be a possibility to fail yes but should we hope and pray every day that they fail no if the answer is yes that s pure hypocrisy there were again attempts by some unscrupulous parties to depict the loan moratorium as something garnered to keep the bankers at gun point at the temple trees had these writers followed some of the stories in the business press during the final few weeks in december or had the patience to talk to any of the banking chiefs who were present during the meetings with the central bank and the government s economic team they would not have rushed to concoct false narratives of their imagination and mislead the public the same people have identified the initiative to train and recruit 100 000 youths in selected and productive areas of the economy in six months as a sin one writer had even made attempts to portray that the programme would be run by the military when no such decision had been taken to that effect so far which alternative is better leaving 100 000 youths unemployed and a heavy burden on the family society and finally the state or uplifting 100 000 individuals from the depths of economic malaise and thereby their families from economic marginalisation who will then be lifted out of poverty and entitlement culture this is nothing but a loathsome effort by the parties with vested interests to scuttle any progressive attempts which do not fall into their narratives and instil fear psychosis among people would they be silent if nothing was done no so damned if you do and damned if you don t demonising fiscal deficit whose purpose will it serve when asked if fiscal deficits are a good thing a typical economist would flat out say no and he would go on to demonise fiscal deficits but the context of the sri lankan economy is such or any other economy for that matter that it requires an initial nudge and that initial nudge most often should come from the government this is when the government needs to provide incentives to the economy by way of fiscal tax and monetary interest rates moratoriums and relaxed regulations measures ideally these stimuli should be provided to a few selected sectors identified as priority sectors by the government which have the ability to improve incomes of a large number of people according to economic analyst waruna singappuli these sectors are technology smes tourism port related sectors and human resource development by way of universities and other tertiary education while whether these are the right priority sectors and should there be more or less sectors could be later debated what is important is to have a few sectors identified where the government s fiscal and policy support should be forthcoming in the initial few years in this initial phase of the development journey the government will have to spend and support these sectors because not many foreign investors may be willing to take the risk on developing our human resources and then investing it will be the other way around investors will be attracted to where there are skills if sri lanka already has skilled labour and an institutional network which is well anchored by the state support there is nothing stopping investors choosing sri lanka as their preferred choice of investment destination in fact at this juncture sri lanka should priorities growth over being overly fixated on a fiscal deficit number which inhibits sri lanka from growing when growth is revived and sustained through the right mix of fiscal monetary and public policy growth itself will remedy the other associated issues such as fiscal deficit balance of payment and inequality because when incomes rise steady and faster a large number of people will be pulled out of poverty but this by no means growth at any cost correct and pragmatic public policy becomes key to avoid some of the excesses made by other developed countries on their development journey and upward social mobility of their people values do matter shared identity matters reciprocal obligations matter and purposive actions matter in fact investors will appreciate and be attracted to an economy with a steady growth of over 6 5 percent per annum and they are less worried about a fiscal deficit of about 6 5 percent of gdp or little higher for a period of about five years and it will be less harmful and in fact rewarding for the country too to have run with a mid single digit level fiscal deficit because the government has established the necessary soft and hard infrastructure required to maintain a sustained higher economic growth hence the growth comes with higher revenues for the government and it will help gradually to consolidate the budget in the long term but if the country decides to be fixated on a web of other issues without moving on with the pressing issues such as income enhancing policies then the fiscal deficit will be a waste in fact what these detractors precisely want is that entangle the state in a deep web of petty issues which make headlines daily so that they become preoccupied with these issues and the economy gets back seat then no amount of public sector salary increases and tax cuts just before an election would not resuscitate the economy nor will guarantee re election hence it is time for sri lanka to unshackle itself from the failed austerity policies and take a calculated risk to leapfrog it is a choice between meeting a tough 3 0 percent fiscal deficit target from day one which might appease the imf and investing to facilitate growth which will help upward social mobility of a large swaths of people who are otherwise eternally stuck in low income agriculture so what about debt problem sri lanka largely has a foreign currency debt problem and not a problem of domestic currency debt because the latter can be bridged through money printing money printing is not evil as some would like to depict the only thing is that such printed money should be spent for right things as explained above the federal reserve printed money and the european central bank prints money and so does the bank of japan when their respective economies needed support for nearly a decade after the global finance crisis the process known as quantitative easing interestingly sri lanka s foreign currency debt intake has annually gone in lockstep with an external current account deficit and foreign outflows from the government securities market the two figures are identical in 2015 according to a simple plan for sri lanka a book authored by singappuli in that year sri lanka s current account deficit was us 1 9 billion and the foreigners pulled out another us 1 1 billion worth of capital from government treasuries sri lanka s foreign borrowings in that year were at us 3 0 billion which nicely make up of the above two what does that tell you sri lanka will have to borrow externally as long as it imports hence sri lanka s foreign debt problem can be resolved through establishing sustained inflow of foreign currency via setting up firms in sri lanka which can generate foreign exchange earnings in other words businesses that can offer products and services to the export market this is important because the portfolio flows or the foreign investments into stocks and bonds are highly volatile and can cause diametrically opposite moves in their flows due to sheer geo political or economic events while sustainable high foreign direct investment flows every year cannot be guaranteed either how is this possible this is possible by way of positive foreign relations with world powers such as the us and china et al and negotiate with them with a clear aim for technology transfers and deeper market access to their markets while this is tricky and easier said than done this is not impossible the key is to go for the negotiations with these countries with a clear idea of what our interests are our interests are simple we need at least part of their companies to set up operations here which will naturally bring technology along with them and open up job opportunities for our frustrated youth and then finally to negotiate to have access to their or other new markets if we can get a few semiconductor manufacturers or at least part of their manufacturing to set up shop here or to get a few auto parts manufacturers to follow them this will not only bring in technology and jobs but also foreign direct investment the focus during these negotiations and foreign relations should be pure economic and commercial and not pure loans or infrastructure projects which will mire the country more in debt hence shouldn t this be our new approach to foreign relations which can make a whole new difference in the people s income and the structure of the economy so what s stopping us political will and attitude the writer can be reached through dilinainbusiness gmail com
against the grain of public opinion including the author s the bank of korea at 1 25 this morning in hindsight that may be no bad thing south korea is likely casting an eye to china hong kong and singapore s approach to mollifying the coronavirus slowdown that involves directly targeting sme s through cash hand outs tax cuts and cheap loans to tide over their working capital requirements and keep people in work the same approach applies to the man on the street as well with hong kong yesterday handing out hkd 10 000 to each resident and increasing income tax thresholds paul chan hong kong s financial secretary may in fact be my new favorite finance minister having frugally accumulated reserves for a rainy day like singapore mr chan enacted a form of quantitative easing at its purest in yesterday s budget although the government is not printing money it is handing it out via cheap credit to sme s and cash dollops into people s pockets the monetary transmission mechanism of quantitative easing since the gfc has proven woefully inadequate banks either hoard the cash or lend it to large corporations or via mortgages but certainly not to sme s ten years later asset prices are in space debt levels are higher than ever yields on savings are almost non existent no one feels more prosperous and income inequality is at record highs cutting rates to zero and printing electronic money in a classic monetary response to a global slowdown will be ineffective this time around as coronavirus infects the cogs that make up supply chains and consumer consumption working capital is the key in the world of the sme if you can t pay your bills at the end of the month you are done whether rates are at zero or ten per cent makes no difference to that equation president trump finally addressed the arrival of coronavirus on u s shores and the government s response to controlling its potential spread firstly pronouncing that the stock market sell off was mostly due to the possibility of a democrat winning november s election he then appointed vice president mike pence to oversee the coronavirus preparations neither inspired an already shaky north american market

relative safety of u s government bonds yields across the curve hit all time lows overnight as the markets also started pricing in at least two fed funds this year unfortunately if the cogs of small business start seizing in the u s the government s trillion dollar deficits leave it with precious little wriggle room to offset an sme shock nor will a couple of 25 basis point rate cuts make an iota of difference when the real story is all about cash flow that same sinking feeling is likely being felt in europe right now where rates are already zero the ecb is already quantitatively easing and there is ideological opposition to fiscal stimulus europe may well be staring at a deeper abyss should the coronavirus outbreak intensify globally having outsourced all the hard decisions and

appendix 7 definition of alternative performance indicators and reconciliation with ifrs the management process used by bureau veritas is based on a series of alternative performance indicators as presented below these indicators were defined for the purposes of preparing the group s budgets and internal and external reporting bureau veritas considers that these indicators provide additional useful information to financial statement users enabling them to better understand the group s performance especially its operating performance some of these indicators represent benchmarks in the testing inspection and certification tic business and are commonly used and tracked by the financial community these alternative performance indicators should be seen as a complement to ifrs compliant indicators and the resulting changes growth total revenue growth the total revenue growth percentage measures changes in consolidated revenue between the previous year and the current year total revenue growth has three components organic growth impact of changes in the scope of consolidation scope effect impact of changes in exchange rates currency effect organic growth the group internally monitors and publishes organic revenue growth which it considers to be more representative of the group s operating performance in each of its business sectors the main measure used to manage and track consolidated revenue growth is like for like or organic growth determining organic growth enables the group to monitor trends in its business excluding the impact of currency fluctuations which are outside of bureau veritas control as well as scope effects which concern new businesses or businesses that no longer form part of the group s existing activities organic growth is used to monitor the group s performance internally bureau veritas considers that organic growth provides management and investors with a more comprehensive understanding of its underlying operating performance and current business trends excluding the impact of acquisitions divestments outright divestments as well as the unplanned suspension of operations in the event of international sanctions for example and changes in exchange rates for businesses exposed to foreign exchange volatility which can mask underlying trends the group also considers that separately presenting organic revenue generated by its businesses provides management and investors with useful information on trends in its industrial businesses and enables a more direct comparison with other companies in its industry organic revenue growth represents the percentage of revenue growth presented at group level and for each business based on constant scope of consolidation and exchange rates over comparable periods constant scope of consolidation data are restated for the impact of changes in the scope of consolidation over a 12 month period constant exchange rates data for the current year are restated using exchange rates for the previous year scope effect to establish a meaningful comparison between reporting periods the impact of changes in the scope of consolidation is determined for acquisitions carried out in the current year by deducting from revenue for the current year revenue generated by the acquired businesses in the current year for acquisitions carried out in the previous year by deducting from revenue for the current year revenue generated by the acquired businesses in the months in the previous year in which they were not consolidated for disposals and divestments carried out in the current year by deducting from revenue for the previous year revenue generated by the disposed and divested businesses in the previous year in the months of the current year in which they were not part of the group for disposals and divestments carried out in the previous year by deducting from revenue for the previous year revenue generated by the disposed and divested businesses in the previous year prior to their disposal divestment currency effect the currency effect is calculated by translating revenue for the current year at the exchange rates for the previous year adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating margin adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating margin are key indicators used to measure the recurring performance of the business excluding material items that cannot be considered inherent to the group s underlying intrinsic performance owing to their unusual nature bureau veritas considers that these indicators presented at group level and for each business are more representative of the operating performance in its industry adjusted operating profit adjusted operating profit represents operating profit prior to adjustments for the following amortization of intangible assets resulting from acquisitions impairment of goodwill fees and costs on acquisitions of businesses contingent consideration on acquisitions of businesses gains and losses on disposals of businesses restructuring costs when an acquisition is carried out during the financial year the amortization of the related intangible assets is calculated on a time proportion basis since a measurement period of 12 months is allowed for determining the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities amortization of intangible assets in the year of acquisition may in some cases be based on a temporary measurement and be subject to minor adjustments in the subsequent reporting period once the definitive value of the intangible assets is known organic adjusted operating profit represents operating profit adjusted for scope and currency effects over comparable periods at constant scope of consolidation data are restated based on a 12 month period at constant exchange rates data for the current year are restated using exchange rates for the previous year the scope and currency effects are calculated using a similar approach to that used for revenue for each component of operating profit and adjusted operating profit adjusted operating margin adjusted operating margin expressed as a percentage represents adjusted operating profit divided by revenue adjusted operating margin can be presented on an organic basis or at constant exchange rates thereby in the latter case providing a view of the group s performance excluding the impact of currency fluctuations which are outside of bureau veritas control adjusted effective tax rate the effective tax rate etr represents income tax expense divided by the amount of pre tax profit the adjusted effective tax rate adjusted etr represents income tax expense adjusted for the tax effect on adjustment items divided by pre tax profit before taking into account the adjustment items see adjusted operating profit definition adjusted net profit adjusted attributable net profit adjusted attributable net profit is defined as attributable net profit adjusted for adjustment items see adjusted operating profit definition and for the tax effect on adjustment items adjusted attributable net profit excludes non controlling interests in adjustment items and only concerns continuing operations adjusted attributable net profit can be presented at constant exchange rates thereby providing a view of the group s performance excluding the impact of currency fluctuations which are outside of bureau veritas control the currency effect is calculated by translating the various income statement items for the current year at the exchange rates for the previous year adjusted attributable net profit per share adjusted attributable net profit per share adjusted eps or earnings per share is defined as adjusted attributable net profit divided by the weighted average number of shares in the period free cash flow free cash flow

its financial results for the three months and year ended december 31 2019 we posted strong results for both project adjusted ebitda and cash from operating activities in 2019 exceeding our guidance said james j moore jr president and ceo of atlantic power market conditions supply demand and power prices are poor nevertheless atlantic power had a good year of progress on business fundamentals including a reduction in our leverage ratio to 3 8 times from 4 5 times a year ago which we expect to improve further in the next couple of years an upgrade to our credit rating by s p an extension of the maturity date and a reduction in the pricing of our term loan solid contributions by the five projects we acquired ownership interests in over the last two years for a total investment of 45

allocate capital to additional debt reduction more share buybacks and when price to value is compelling continued external growth as well 1 the company has not provided guidance for project income or net income because of the difficulty of making accurate forecasts and projections without unreasonable efforts with respect to certain highly variable components of these comparable gaap metrics including changes in the fair value of derivative instruments and foreign exchange gains or losses these factors which generally do not affect cash flow are not included in project adjusted ebitda

explanation and a reconciliation of project adjusted ebitda as used in this news release to project income loss discussion of financial results recent accounting developments new business segments in the fourth quarter of 2019 the company revised its reportable business segments to better align with how the projects are managed and their performance evaluated following recent acquisitions ppa expirations and project decommissioning the new segments are solid fuel biomass and coal natural gas hydroelectric and corporate a schedule of project income loss and project adjusted ebitda by segment for the three months and year ended december 31 2019 and the comparable 2018 periods can be found on page 14 of this release impairment in the fourth quarter of 2019 the company recorded a 49 2 million impairment of its equity investment in chambers and a 5 8 million long lived asset impairment at calstock both projects are in the solid fuel segment total impairment expense of 55 0 million is included in project income although it is not included in project adjusted ebitda the company reviewed chambers and determined that there had been a decline in value that was other than temporary factors considered in that determination included the continued decline in forward power curves since the previous impairment recorded in 2017 a challenging re contracting environment and a low probability of the plant operating as a merchant facility the company reviewed calstock for potential impairment consistent with its policy of evaluating those projects for which the ppa is expiring within six months and determined the plant was unlikely to operate past the expiration date of the ppa in june 2020 because of the uncertainty of the ability to re contract the project the fair value of calstock was determined solely on the cash flows remaining under the ppa cadillac insurance recovery as previously disclosed the cadillac plant which is in the company s solid fuel segment was extensively damaged in a steam turbine overspeed event and subsequent fire in september 2019 and has been out of service since the incident the company has insurance coverage that it believes will be adequate to cover the cost of repairs and lost profits business interruption losses during the outage in the fourth quarter of 2019 the company received 11 3 million from its insurers in payment of its initial claim net of a 1 million property deductible the payment was not allocated between property insurance and business interruption insurance the company applied the entire 11 3 million to its 24 3 million insurance receivable the 11 3 million is included in cash flows from investing activities the cost of repairs to the plant which totaled 5 1 million as of december 31 2019 is included in capital expenditures a component of cash flows from investing activities the company estimates that approximately 2 0 million of the 11 3 million represents recovery of business interruption losses subsequent to the 45 day deductible insurance recoveries related to business interruption losses are accounted for as a gain contingency and will not be recorded as income until final payment is made by the company s insurers and the claim is settled which will occur only after the plant is returned to service assuming that cadillac is returned to service and the claim is settled in 2020 the outage should not have a net impact on project adjusted ebitda for the year three months ended december 31 2019 project income loss net income loss and project adjusted ebitda project loss in the fourth quarter of 2019 was 33 4 million as compared to project income of 20 1 million in the year ago period impairment expense in 2019 of 55 0 million accounted for most of the adverse change revenues declined approximately 4 5 million as the impact of the cadillac outage no revenue and reduced operations at williams lake more than offset revenue increases at curtis palmer higher water flows and allendale and dorchester both acquired in the third quarter project income for cadillac was 3 4 million lower than the year ago period on the positive side the san diego projects improved by 3 6 million from the year ago period when the company recorded an increase in its estimate of the asset retirement obligation williams lake allendale and dorchester are in the solid fuel segment curtis palmer is in the hydroelectric segment and the san diego projects are in the natural gas segment net loss attributable to atlantic power corporation in the fourth quarter of 2019 was 65 3 million as compared to net income of 24 7 million in the year ago period impairment expense accounted for 55 0 million of the decrease the 2019 period included a 4 8 million foreign exchange loss whereas the prior period included a 13 7 million foreign exchange gain the foreign exchange loss was related to the revaluation of debt denominated in canadian dollars the canadian dollar appreciated from september 30 2019 to december 31 2019 other adverse factors included a decrease in the fair value of the convertible debenture conversion option and an increase in income tax expense project adjusted ebitda in the fourth quarter of 2019 declined to 42 9 million from 46 6 million in the year ago period cadillac project adjusted ebitda declined 3 8 million which included a 3 4 million impact related to the outage 1 4 million during the 45 day deductible period and 2 0 million of business interruption losses incurred subsequently the company expects to recover the 2 0 million later in 2020 assuming the insurance claim is settled in 2020 williams lake project adjusted ebitda declined 2 4 million due to reduced operations due to low fuel inventory following the expiration of the short term contract in september 2019 in the hydroelectric segment both mamquam and moresby lake experienced modest decreases in project adjusted ebitda on the positive side project adjusted ebitda from curtis palmer increased 1 4 million due to higher water flows generation increased 14 from the fourth quarter of 2018 nipigon project adjusted ebitda increased 1 3 million primarily due to a capacity rate escalation under the ppa the acquisitions of allendale and dorchester and equity interests in craven and grayling contributed 0 7 million and oxnard and frederickson had modest increases in project adjusted ebitda nipigon oxnard and frederickson are in the natural gas segment while craven and grayling are in the solid fuel segment cash flow cash provided by operating activities in the fourth quarter of 2019 was 40 2 million which was in line with the 39 7 million in the year ago period positive variances included receipt of a tax refund that reduced cash taxes versus the prior period and a favorable working capital comparison these were partially offset by lower project adjusted ebitda and a reduction in distributions from unconsolidated affiliates in 2018 orlando received the september distribution in october in 2019 chambers repaid project debt during the quarter and thus the distribution was reduced as compared to 2018 cash provided by investing activities in the fourth quarter of 2019 was 6 3 million as compared to a 0 1 million use of cash in the year ago period the increase was primarily attributable to the receipt of 11 3 million of insurance proceeds related to the cadillac fire partially offset by higher capital expenditures including 5 1 million related to cadillac repairs cash used in financing activities in the fourth quarter of 2019 was 23 7 million a decrease from 27 1 million in the year ago period cash used for common share repurchases declined 2 6 million from the year ago period and project debt repayment was 0 8 million lower year ended december 31 2019 results for project income and net income loss were adversely affected by the impairment expense recorded in 2019 project adjusted ebitda increased from 2018 and was above expectations primarily because of a 27 increase in generation at curtis palmer driven by higher water flows cash provided by operating activities also increased but to a lesser degree than project adjusted ebitda because changes in working capital had a larger positive impact on operating cash flow in 2018 than in 2019 project income net income loss and project adjusted ebitda project income in 2019 was 46 8 million versus 88 2 million in 2018 project revenues declined 0 7 million as increases at curtis palmer allendale and dorchester both acquired in july 2019 and tunis restarted operations in october 2018 were offset by decreases at williams lake short term contract extension and reduced operations the san diego projects shut down in february 2018 cadillac outage following the september 2019 fire and morris tunis and morris are in the natural gas segment the decline in project income was primarily due to the 55 0 million impairment recorded in 2019 an 11 1 million adverse change in the fair value of derivative instruments and the non recurrence of the 6 7 million remeasurement gain on the consolidation of koma kulshan in the hydroelectric segment in 2018 these negative variances were partially offset by lower depreciation expense of 19 2 million mostly at nipigon where the ppa intangible asset was fully amortized in 2018 and the san diego projects and lower operation and maintenance expense of 8 0 million at manchief which had a gas turbine overhaul in 2018 the san diego projects which were shut down in 2018 and tunis which incurred start up expenses in 2018 partially offset by increases related to the acquisition of allendale and dorchester manchief is in the natural gas segment net loss attributable to atlantic power corporation in 2019 was 42 6 million versus net income of 36 8 million in 2018 the adverse change of 79 4 million was the result of the 55 0 million impairment expense and other factors reducing project income as described above an 11 9 million foreign exchange loss versus a 22 8 million foreign exchange gain in 2018 and a 9 6 million increase in income tax expense the foreign exchange loss was related to the revaluation of debt denominated in canadian dollars the canadian dollar appreciated from december 31 2018 to december 31 2019 these negative variances were partially offset by an 8 7 million reduction in interest expense in 2019 due to lower debt balances and a lower rate on the company s credit facilities project adjusted ebitda in 2019 of 196 1 million increased 11 0 million from 185 1 million in 2018 the increase was primarily driven by curtis palmer 11 5 million manchief 7 4 million and tunis 7 1 million for reasons previously described other positive drivers included the acquisitions of allendale and dorchester and equity interests in craven and grayling 2 4 million frederickson 2 1 million due to higher dispatch and lower maintenance expense and modest increases at several other projects these increases were partially offset by decreases at williams lake 9 0 million due to the short term contract extension and reduced operations cadillac 4 0 million mostly due to the 3 4 million impact of the outage following the september 2019 fire chambers 2 4 million due to lower energy and steam demand and lower excess energy pricing mamquam 2 2 million due to lower water flows and oxnard 2 1 million due to an increase in gas prices and higher operating expense cash flow cash provided by operating activities in 2019 of 144 7 million increased 7 2 million from 137 5 million in 2018 the increase was primarily due to the 11 0 million increase in project adjusted ebitda and a 3 7 million reduction in cash interest payments due to lower debt balances and a lower rate on the company s credit facilities these positive variances were partially offset by a 4 8 million adverse impact from changes in working capital and 2 1 million of lower distributions from unconsolidated affiliates cash used in investing activities in 2019 of 21 7 million increased from 17 0 million in 2018 primarily due to the acquisitions of allendale and dorchester and equity interests in craven and grayling in 2019 total 27 3 million net of cash acquired as compared to the acquisition of koma kulshan and a deposit on the biomass plant acquisition in 2018 total 15 4 million capital expenditures increased by 5 5 million primarily for cadillac repairs 5 1 million these increases in use of cash were partially offset by 11 3 million of insurance proceeds received in 2019 related to the cadillac fire cash used in financing activities

196 5 million an increase of 15 3 million from 181 2 million at september 30 2019 this increase was primarily attributable to a 17 6 million increase in cash at the parent to 48 8 million the company considers approximately 42 million to be discretionary cash available for general corporate purposes the higher level of cash at the parent was the result of discretionary cash flow after debt

28 7 million the company also paid a 2 6 million deposit for allendale and dorchester in 2018 for a total investment of 31 3 million 2020 guidance the company has not provided guidance for project income or net income because of the difficulty of making accurate forecasts and projections without unreasonable efforts with respect to certain highly variable components of these comparable gaap metrics including changes in the fair value of derivative instruments and foreign exchange gains or losses these factors which generally do not affect cash flow are not included in project adjusted ebitda the company has initiated guidance for 2020 project adjusted ebitda in the range of 175 million to 190 million which is the same as its initial guidance for 2019 actual 2019 results of 196 1 million exceeded guidance primarily due to strong water flows at curtis palmer generation was 26 above the historical average and the acquisitions of allendale and dorchester and equity interests in craven and grayling guidance for 2020 assumes a return to average water flows for curtis palmer which accounts for most of the anticipated year over year decline in project adjusted ebitda scheduled ppa expirations at oxnard and calstock in may and june of this year respectively and a planned hot gas path inspection at morris also contribute to the decline these negative variances are expected to be partially offset by a full year contribution by the acquired biomass projects and modest increases at several other projects the company s 2020 guidance assumes that cadillac is returned to service later this year and that the company records to revenues and project adjusted ebitda those insurance recoveries related to business interruption table 3 provides a bridge of the company s 2020 project adjusted ebitda guidance to an estimate of 2020 cash provided by operating activities for purposes of providing this bridge to a cash flow measure the impact of changes in working capital is assumed to be nil the decline in 2020 estimated cash provided by operating activities to a range of 100 million to 115 million from the 2019 level of 144 7 million is largely attributable to lower expected project adjusted ebitda the working capital assumption discussed above versus a favorable contribution in 2019 modestly higher project debt repayment at chambers captured in the adjustment for equity method projects and higher decommissioning outlays for the san diego projects majority of the cash outlays occurring in 2020 rather than in 2019 atlantic power corporation table 3 bridge of 2020

operational updates cadillac status the september 2019 fire resulted in extensive damage to the turbine generator and other components in that area of the plant the plant is expected to remain out of service while repairs are completed the company has sourced the necessary replacement equipment and is currently targeting a return of the plant to service in the third quarter of this year williams lake operations the company returned the williams lake plant to operation in mid december which was slightly earlier than planned under the terms of the energy purchase agreement with bc hydro that became effective last october the plant will not operate during the months of may june and july during that period the company expects to undertake significant maintenance including a replacement of the cooling tower which will be expensed the company remains focused on fuel procurement and is currently building supply through a variety of existing and new sources fuel availability remains challenging although fuel costs to date have been in line with the company s expectations considering planned maintenance expenditures and expected run time for the plant the company continues to estimate that project adjusted ebitda in 2020 will be approximately breakeven decommissioning of san diego projects the company recently signed a contract for the demolition of the three project sites in san diego naval station naval training center and north island the work is expected to begin shortly and require approximately six months to be completed the current estimate for the cost of decommissioning these projects is 6 6 million of which 1 5 million has been incurred to date including 1 0 million incurred in 2019 in 2018 and 2019 the company realized a total of 1 8 million of salvage proceeds the cash outlay required in 2020 to complete the work is estimated to be approximately 4 million decommissioning expenditures are not included in project adjusted ebitda maintenance and capex in the fourth quarter of 2019 the company incurred 7 3 million of maintenance expense and 1 5 million of capital expenditures for the full year maintenance expense totaled 23 8 million and capital expenditures totaled 2 3 million these figures exclude the capital expenditures for repairs and replacement of equipment at cadillac of 5 1 million all incurred in the fourth quarter these expenditures are expected to be covered by the company s insurance excluding the deductible for 2020 the company is projecting maintenance expense of 32 8 million and capital expenditures of approximately 4 0 million excluding cadillac higher expected maintenance expense in 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily reflects planned outages at morris and williams lake and the full year impact of the acquired projects all of these figures include the company s proportional share of maintenance expenses and capital expenditures at equity method investments commercial updates 2020 ppa expirations the company has two projects with ppas that are scheduled to expire in 2020 oxnard california the ppa with southern california edison will expire in may 2020 to date the project has not been selected in various solicitations by the utility customer for its resource needs in 2021 and beyond the company is continuing to pursue other potential offtake structures for the project potentially on a short term basis in 2019 oxnard generated a breakeven level of project adjusted ebitda which was 2 1 million lower than in 2018 due to higher gas prices and higher operating expense calstock ontario the ppa with the ontario electricity financial corporation will expire in june 2020 although the company continues to engage with the relevant parties at this time the company does not expect the plant to continue operating past the expiration date of the ppa in 2019 calstock generated 5 2 million of project adjusted ebitda as noted in 2019 the company recorded a long lived asset impairment charge at calstock of 5 8 million which is not included in project adjusted ebitda financial results by project a schedule of project income loss project adjusted ebitda and cash

read part one i mentioned this week s stock market adjustment in part one by way of introducing the idea the subject of this editorial series a chairlift to heaven the decline continued yesterday with the dow falling another half percent i ve been stuck on a chairlift on occasion momentarily you re happily riding up and up watching the skiers dodging the trees below when suddenly the chairlift grinds to a halt and there you are gently swinging in space 30 feet above the ground wondering who was having trouble getting on or off the chairlift how long it will be before you start moving again you re pretty sure it s only a temporary delay you re not too worried but what if it s not temporary what if the machine is broken how long would you be left hanging there getting colder and colder before a rescue crew could arrive would you take a chance and jump 30 feet to the ground you look down and mentally calculate your chances we all watched the machine known as the growth economy come to a grinding halt between december 2007 and june 2009 during the great recession a generally unpleasant period of time often regarded as the second worst economic downturn in modern us history most analysts seem to blame the crisis mainly on greedy bankers and mortgage lenders making billions of dollars in profit by issuing fraudulent mortgages to millions of unqualified borrowers instead of going to jail the bankers were bailed out by us taxpayers many of the victims meanwhile are still homeless living in cars or paying exorbitant rents for substandard housing or so i ve heard who was responsible for this global debacle has anyone stepped up and apologized if so i haven t heard about it but as america has climbed slowly out of the bomb crater many people have been delighted to claim credit for the improved economy when president trump took office in january 2017 he inherited an economy in its eighth year of economic expansion the reported growth has continued into the winter of 2020 making it the longest period of sustained economic growth in us history dating back to the 1850s the growth hasn t been terribly dramatic but steady so how s the middle class doing we know that the rich are getting richer and i guess that s what they do best but the middle class maybe they re on the wrong chairlift back in 1964 when lyndon johnson was president the average and thus middle class american wage was about 2 50 per hour as of january 2020 the federal reserve bank pegged the average hourly wage at 23 87 the steady increase in the average wage seemingly had no relationship at all to the economic policies of the republican or democratic administrations holding fort in washington dc with those various administrations shown at the bottom of the chart but that s not the whole story the value of the dollar has changed since 1964 due to inflation and other factors and the average worker no longer works 40 hours a week more like 34 hours on average so the take home pay has changed the folks at advisorprespectives com published some charts like the one above two weeks ago and one of those charts shows the average middle class worker s wage when adjusted for inflation and for the fewer average number of hours worked according to their data the average american worker is earning about 11 percent less than he or she was making in the early 1970s and about the same as an adjusted number as he or she was making in 1964 once again the presidential administrations are shown at the bottom of the chart and once again there s no obvious correlation between democratic or republican administrations and the economic fate of the middle class historically speaking the lower class worker was earning less money in 2013 than in 1979 adjusted for inflation according to the economic policy institute like 5 less not exactly an economy anyone should be bragging about perhaps when looked at from a certain perspective but things could be worse of course and they certainly are in some areas of the us and in some other countries but maybe things are looking up for example in china in spite of an ongoing trade war a september 2019 article on the cnbc website written by reporter evelyn cheng china s giant middle class is still growing and companies from walmart to start ups are trying to cash in suggests that the economic chairlifts in that asian nation are carrying more and more people up and up into the middle class it s all a bet on the chinese middle class a consumer force mckinsey analysis predicts could reach 550 million in three years that s more than one and a half times the entire us population today american consumer giants and a slew of chinese companies are now angling for a piece of the largest middle class market in the world meanwhile back at home in the us the middle class appears to be riding downhill the same thing seems to be going on in europe according to data released last year by the paris based organization for economic cooperation and development inflation adjusted disposable incomes for the global middle class have not grown since the middle of last decade while incomes for the top 10 are hitting new highs some media reports refer to the shrinking of the american middle class the middle classes are getting squeezed particularly hard by the rising costs of education health care and housing the oecd writes college costs are up in the us and elsewhere homes are much more expensive relative to incomes so how about that big colorado department of transportation cdot project scheduled for this summer in the center of downtown pagosa springs i mentioned that project briefly in part one yesterday and suggested that it sounds like an unpleasant development for travelers local residents and perhaps especially downtown businesses it s easy to understand why cdot needs to do this project eventually they ve been talking about it for almost a decade after determining that the large culverts that carry the flow of mccabe creek are in poor shape and additionally would not handle a large flood event successfully and we also note that highway 160 is the only major east west highway running through this part of southwest colorado sounds like a responsible course of action even after a decade of delay and what we re talking about here is responsibility read part three

fourth quarter 2019 capital expenditures of approximately 69 million were down 41 as expected from third quarter 2019 s level of 116 million this reduction reflects the completion of the extensive

negatively impacted in 2019 by downtime from electric submersible pump esp failures in acordionero and the temporary shut in of several wells in acordionero with high gas oil ratios the esp failure rate has significantly declined following the completion of the acordionero central processing facility expansion in second half 2019 the water injection facilities and gas to power turbines continue operating with increasing reliability in fourth quarter 2019 there were 3 esp failures in october 3 in november and only 1 in december this significant improvement in esp performance is a result of increased power reliability and increased reservoir pressure due to the substantial ramp up in water injection at acordionero starting in mid 2019 the increase in water injection in mid 2019 has significantly reduced gas production in acordionero from a high of 18 million cubic feet per day mmcfd down to the current 8 mmcfd all of which is either consumed to generate power or re injected into

message to shareholders gary guidry president and chief executive officer of gran tierra commented 2019 was both an exciting and challenging year for gran tierra throughout the course of the second half of 2019 we accomplished the full implementation and growth of our waterflood in the acordionero field which is forecast to generate approximately 1 2 billion of free cash flow 3 over the next five years and has a december 31 2019 before tax 2p npv10 of 1 8 billion our four core assets are all under waterflood at different stages of maturity and are forecast to generate significant free cash flow 3 for the next several years our main challenge was a delay in the expansion of the production facilities in acordionero which temporarily impacted this field s oil production rate we have learned a number of operational lessons that will be applied to future projects during 2020 we are deploying an integrated plan for free cash flow 6 growth from our key producing areas including a disciplined approach to leveraging our world class exploration portfolio we are reducing our 2020 capital program to a new range of 175 to 195 million as a prudent response to the drop in world oil prices and widening differentials during 2020 to date our 2020 capital budget is a balanced returns focused program which prioritizes free cash flow 6 generation and returns over the rate of development and production growth we plan to prioritize debt reduction with our free cash flow 6 we see material potential in our world class exploration portfolio located in highly prospective geological basins in colombia and ecuador we have budgeted a measured yet robust high impact exploration campaign mostly directed at our large landholdings in the putumayo basin of colombia and oriente basin of ecuador our 2020 plans are also aligned with gran tierra s beyond compliance policy which focuses on our commitments to environmental social and governance excellence when there are

operating expenses increased to 11 14 per boe compared with 8 49 per boe in 2018 primarily as a result of higher power generation and rental costs with the commissioning of the expanded production facilities and the gas to power project in acordionero both total operating costs and per boe operating costs are expected to decrease in 2020 workover expenses increased to 3 22 per boe compared with

transportation expenses decreased by 28 to 1 60 per boe in 2019 from 2 21 per boe in 2018 due to a higher percentage of volumes being sold at the wellhead where transportation is netted against sales

estimated quantities and net present value of reserves business strategy plans and objectives for future operations capital spending plans and those statements preceded by followed by or that otherwise include the words believe expect anticipate forecast budget will estimate target project plan should guidance strives or similar expressions are forward looking statements such forward looking statements include but are not limited to the company s expectations capital program repayment of borrowings under the credit facility future sources of funding for capital expenditures and guidance including for certain future production estimates forecast prices five year expected free cash flow expected future net cash provided by operating activities net debt capital expenditures and certain associated metrics the company s strategies the company s goals on reforestation and flaring the company s plans to benefit the environment or communities in which it operates and the company s operations including planned operations and oil production statements relating to reserves are also deemed to be forward looking statements as they involve the implied assessment based on certain estimates and assumptions including that the reserves described can be profitably produced in the future the forward looking statements contained in this press release reflect several material factors and expectations and assumptions of gran tierra including without limitation that gran tierra will continue to conduct its operations in a manner consistent with its current expectations the accuracy of testing and production results and seismic data pricing and cost estimates including with respect to commodity pricing and exchange rates rig availability the risk profile of planned exploration activities the effects of drilling down dip the effects of waterflood and multi stage fracture stimulation operations the extent and effect of delivery disruptions and the general continuance of current or where applicable assumed operational regulatory and industry conditions including in areas of potential expansion and the ability of gran tierra to execute its current business and operational plans in the manner currently planned gran tierra believes the material factors expectations and assumptions reflected in the forward looking statements are reasonable at this time but no assurance can be given that these factors expectations and assumptions will prove to be correct among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward looking statements in this press release are prices and markets for oil and natural gas are unpredictable and tend to fluctuate significantly gran tierra s operations are located in south america and unexpected problems can arise due to guerrilla activity or local blockades technical difficulties and operational difficulties may arise which impact the production transport or sale of our products geographic political and weather conditions can impact the production transport or sale of gran tierra s products the ability of gran tierra to execute its business plan the risk that unexpected delays and difficulties in developing currently owned properties may occur the ability to replace reserves and production and develop and manage reserves on an economically viable basis the timely receipt of regulatory or other required approvals for our operating activities the failure of exploratory drilling to result in commercial wells unexpected delays due to the limited availability of drilling equipment and personnel the risk that current global economic health and credit market conditions may impact oil prices and oil consumption more than gran tierra currently predicts which could cause gran tierra to further modify its strategy and capital spending program and the risk factors detailed from time to time in gran tierra s periodic reports filed with the securities and exchange commission including without limitation under the caption risk factors in gran tierra s annual report on form 10 k for the year ended december 31 2019 filed february 26 2020 and its other filings with the sec these filings are available on the sec website at and on sedar at www sedar com although the current guidance capital spending program and long term strategy of gran tierra are based upon the current expectations of the management of gran tierra should any one of a number of issues arise gran tierra may find it necessary to alter its business strategy and or capital spending program and there can be no assurance as at the date of this press release as to how those funds may be reallocated or strategy changed and how that would impact gran tierra s results of operations and financial position forecasts and expectations that cover multi year time horizons or are associated with 2p reserves inherently involve increased risks and actual results may differ materially all forward looking statements included in this press release are made as of the date of this press release and the fact that this press release remains available does not constitute a representation by gran tierra that gran tierra believes these forward looking statements continue to be true as of any subsequent date actual results may vary materially from the expected results expressed in forward looking statements gran tierra disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise except as expressly required by applicable securities laws gran tierra s forward looking statements are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement the estimates of

considered to be future oriented financial information or a financial outlook for the purposes of applicable canadian securities laws financial outlook and future oriented financial information contained in this press release about prospective financial performance financial position or cash flows are based on assumptions about future events including economic conditions and proposed courses of action based on management s assessment of the relevant information currently available and to become available in the future in particular this press release contains projected operational and financial information for 2020 and the next five years these projections contain forward looking statements and are based on a number of material assumptions and factors set out above actual results may differ significantly from the projections presented herein these projections may also be considered to contain future oriented financial information or a financial outlook the actual results of gran tierra s operations for any period will likely vary from the amounts set forth in these projections and such variations may be material see above for a discussion of the risks that could cause actual results to vary the future oriented financial information and financial outlooks contained in this press release have been approved by management as of the date of this press release readers are cautioned that any such financial outlook and future oriented financial information contained herein should not be used for purposes other than those for which it is disclosed herein the company and its management believe that the prospective operational and financial information has been prepared on a reasonable basis reflecting management s best estimates and judgments and represent to the best of management s knowledge and opinion the company s expected course of action however because this information is highly subjective it should not be relied on as necessarily indicative of future results non gaap measures this press release includes non gaap financial measures as further described herein these non gaap measures do not have a standardized meaning under gaap investors are cautioned that these measures should not be construed as alternatives to net loss or other measures of financial performance as determined in accordance with gaap gran tierra s method of calculating these measures may differ from other companies and accordingly they may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies each non gaap financial measure is presented along with the corresponding gaap measure so as not to imply that more emphasis should be placed on the non gaap measure before tax and after tax free cash flow are non gaap terms and are called before tax and after tax net revenue in the gte mcdaniel reserves report respectively the non gaap term of before tax free cash flow and free cash flow after development expenditures and taxes over the next five years reconciles to the nearest gaap term of oil and gas sales which is called sales revenue in the gte mcdaniel reserves report before tax net revenue is calculated by mcdaniel by subtracting total royalties operating costs future development capital and abandonment and reclamation costs from sales revenue after tax free cash flow is calculated by mcdaniel by subtracting future taxes from before tax net revenue refer to future net revenue in this press release for the applicable reconciliation gran tierra is unable to provide a quantitative reconciliation of free cash flow after development expenditures taxes interest and g a costs over the next five years to its most directly comparable forward looking gaap measure because management cannot reliably predict certain of the necessary components of such forward looking gaap measure gran tierra is also unable to provide forward looking oil and gas sales the gaap measures most directly comparable to such measures of free cash flow due to the impracticality of quantifying certain components required by gaap as a result of the inherent volatility in the value of certain financial instruments held by the company and the inability to quantify the effectiveness of commodity price derivatives used to manage the variability in cash flows associated with the forecast sale of its oil production and changes in commodity prices refer to oil and gas metrics in this press release for a description of how this non gaap measure is calculated management uses free cash flow as a measure of the company s ability to fund its exploration

information on form 51 101f1 dated effective as at december 31 2019 which includes disclosure of its oil and gas reserves and other oil and gas information in accordance with ni 51 101 forming the basis of this press release is available on sedar at www sedar com estimates of net present value and future net revenue contained herein do not necessarily represent fair market value of reserves estimates of reserves and future net revenue for individual properties may not reflect the same level of confidence as estimates of reserves and future net revenue for all properties due to the effect of aggregation there is no assurance that the forecast price and cost assumptions applied by mcdaniel in evaluating gran tierra s reserves and future net revenue will be attained and variances could be material see gran tierra s press release dated january 28 2020 for a summary of the price forecasts employed by mcdaniel in the gte mcdaniel reserves report and other information regarding the disclosed future net revenue all evaluations of future net revenue contained in the gte mcdaniel reserves report are after the deduction of royalties operating costs development costs production costs and abandonment and reclamation costs but before consideration of indirect costs such as administrative overhead and other miscellaneous expenses it should not be assumed that the estimates of future net revenues presented in this press release represent the fair market value of the reserves there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of crude oil and natural gas reserves and the future cash flows attributed to such reserves the reserve and associated cash flow information set forth in the gte mcdaniel reserves report are estimates only and there is no guarantee that the estimated reserves will be recovered actual reserves may be greater than or less than the estimates provided therein boes have been converted on the basis of six thousand cubic feet mcf natural gas to 1 bbl of oil boes may be misleading particularly if used in isolation a boe conversion ratio of 6 mcf 1 bbl is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead in addition given that the value ratio based on the current price of oil as compared with natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalent of six to one utilizing a boe conversion ratio of 6 mcf 1 bbl would be misleading as an indication of value references to a formation where evidence of hydrocarbons has been encountered is not necessarily an indicator that hydrocarbons will be recoverable in commercial quantities or in any estimated volume gran tierra s reported production is a mix of light crude oil and medium and heavy crude oil for which there is not a precise breakdown since the company s oil sales volumes typically represent blends of more than one type of crude oil well test results should be considered as preliminary and not necessarily indicative of long term performance or of ultimate recovery well log interpretations indicating oil and gas accumulations are not necessarily indicative of future production or ultimate recovery if it is indicated that a pressure transient analysis or well test interpretation has not been carried out any data disclosed in that respect should be considered preliminary until such analysis has been completed references to thickness of oil pay or of a formation where evidence of hydrocarbons has been encountered is not necessarily an indicator that hydrocarbons will be recoverable in commercial quantities or in any estimated volume future net revenue future net revenue reflects mcdaniel s forecast of revenue estimated using forecast prices

which do not have standardized meanings or standard methods of calculation and therefore such measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies and should not be used to make comparisons such metrics have been included herein to provide readers with additional measures to evaluate the company s performance however such measures are not reliable indicators of the future performance of the company and future performance may not compare to the performance in previous periods before tax and after tax free cash flow are non gaap terms and are called before tax and after tax net revenue in the gte mcdaniel reserves report respectively the non gaap term of before tax free cash flow reconciles to the nearest gaap term of oil and gas sales which is called sales revenue in the gte mcdaniel reserves report before tax net revenue is calculated by mcdaniel by subtracting total royalties operating costs future development capital abandonment and reclamation costs from sales revenue after tax free cash flow is calculated by mcdaniel by subtracting future taxes from before tax net revenue refer to future net revenue in this press release for the applicable reconciliation management uses free cash flow as a measure of the company s ability to fund its exploration program nav per share is calculated as npv discounted at 10 before or after tax as applicable minus estimated net debt divided by the number of shares of gran tierra s common stock issued and outstanding management uses nav per share as a measure of the relative change of gran tierra s net asset value over its outstanding common stock over a period of time operating netback and cash netback are calculated as described in this press release management believes that operating netback and cash netback are useful supplemental measures for the reasons described in this press release reserves per share is calculated as reserves in the referenced category divided by the number of shares of gran tierra s common stock issued and outstanding as at december 31 management uses this measure to determine the relative change of its reserve base over its outstanding common stock over a period of time reserves replacement is calculated as reserves in the referenced category divided by estimated referenced production management uses this measure to determine the relative change

fourth quarter earnings of 145 million and record full year earnings of 1 5 billion a 61 percent decrease and 17 percent increase respectively over the same periods in the prior year fourth quarter and full year earnings were impacted positively by higher gross profit in both pipelines and facilities from new assets placed into service and negatively by an impairment charge of 300 million 220 million net of tax on pembina s convertible preferred interest in ruby pipeline the impairment charge was the result of an assessment triggered by upcoming contract expirations in a business environment in the rockies basin that remains challenged fourth quarter earnings also were positively impacted by the contribution from new assets included in the acquisition of kinder morgan canada and the u s portion of the cochin pipeline system the kinder acquisition higher margins in the crude marketing business and the impact of ifrs 16 leases ifrs 16 quarterly earnings were negatively impacted by unrealized losses on commodity related derivatives due to contracts maturing in the period and increasing forward prices for crude and ngl compared to contract positions as well a decrease in deferred tax expense was partially offset by an increase in current tax expense earnings for the full year also were positively impacted by an increase in facilities gross profit as a result of higher propane and butane terminalling revenue as well as a deferred tax recovery primarily due to the reduction in the alberta income tax rate offset by higher current tax expense marketing new ventures gross profit decreased largely due to lower share of profit in aux sable following a decrease in propane pricing and higher depreciation expense following the adoption of ifrs 16 and record

have much to celebrate with this milestone from rather humble beginnings as a single pipeline in alberta with 31 people and an enterprise value of 20 million pembina has grown into one of canada s largest companies today we are nearly 3 000 people strong with an enterprise value in excess of 40 billion as proud as we are about the past our stakeholders are more interested in the future the keys to our success to date our unwavering commitment to long term value creation rather than chasing trends or fads combined with solid core values and consideration of all stakeholders will continue to propel us to new successes furthermore we have put forth a number of financial rules or guardrails which are our commitment to continue to grow both the depth and breadth of our value chain in a disciplined way this approach results in greater synergy value added service and diversification this is the pembina way and it will not change from a financial perspective a number of new records were set in 2019 earnings in 2019 of 1 5 billion were 17 percent higher than the previous year record adjusted ebitda of 3 1 billion exceeded the high end of our guidance range and our 2019 adjusted cash flow per share of 4 36 was another all time high in 2019 we placed in excess of 600 million of projects safely and successfully into service including duvernay ii burstall ethane storage as well as other infrastructure at our redwater complex furthermore we are excited about the 1 2 billion of additional fee based projects which are expected to enter service in 2020 with these new projects coming online in conjunction with the contribution from the kinder acquisition assets we anticipate generating 2020 adjusted ebitda of between 3 25 and 3 55 billion the most significant single event this year was the 4 25 billion kinder acquisition at our 2019 investor day we talked about our focus on getting better not just bigger and this acquisition clearly make us better the majority of the assets we acquired are already directly connected to our system the edmonton terminals connect our pipeline systems with the major trunkline third party export pipelines based on their location and connectivity these assets sit at the nexus of the canadian oil market and are essentially impossible to replicate by owning these assets pembina gains another premium franchise thereby enhancing the longevity and stability of our earnings stream in addition in the current political and regulatory environment pipe in the ground and particularly cross border pipelines possess considerable scarcity value the cochin pipeline which transports premium condensate from the u s midwest to fort saskatchewan alberta offers access to another condensate supply basin is connected to pembina s canadian diluent hub and strengthens our existing condensate franchise finally the assets we acquired have considerable upside by overlaying pembina s exiting commercial models in addition to the strategic benefits the acquisition also has a positive financial impact enhancing the diversification in our business and providing opportunities for future growth these assets are predominantly supported by long term fee for service take or pay contracts which are underpinned by strong investment grade counterparties enhancing pembina s financial guardrails we have identified meaningful financial upside available from a portfolio of small capital projects and the integration of the acquired assets within pembina s existing businesses over the next five years we expect to realize additional annual adjusted ebitda of 100 million a roughly 30 percent increase with only modest capital spending as we look to the future we are excited about our continued progress in accessing global markets in early 2019 we took a major step forward with the approval of the integrated propane dehydrogenation pdh plant and polypropylene pp upgrading facility pdh pp facility through our 50 percent owned joint venture entity canada kuwait petrochemical limited partnership ckpc this project is true to our strategy of trying to do more with the hydrocarbon molecules we touch and leverages our position as the largest supplier of propane in western canada more recently we were pleased to announce that we have executed a lump sum engineering procurement and construction epc contract relating to the construction of the pdh plant with this contract we have locked in approximately 60 percent of the cost of the pdh pp facility thus far reflecting our disciplined and prudent approach to spending in addition to advancing our petrochemical facility we also are very excited about our prince rupert terminal this project is important as it represents our first export facility demand for propane export capacity was significant and we were pleased to approve an expansion of this export terminal increasing capacity to approximately 40 mbpd we are entering a new decade with significant momentum and abundant growth opportunities in fact some of the hardest decisions we must make are what projects are we not going to pursue our continued focus on being better and not just bigger in addition to our financial guardrails and strategic investment criteria based on long term thinking will remain our guiding principles for future growth ensuring we continue to create long term sustainable value

democratic presidential front runner bernie sanders is pledging to spend big and fund it all with new taxes drawing flak from rivals and analysts who say his budget numbers don t add up but bond investors say they don t really need to and more and more economists are inclined to agree it s never been cheaper for the u s government to borrow money in the past few days as sanders fended off the how will you pay for it questions about his plans for universal health and childcare yields on 10 year and 30 year treasuries were hitting all time lows fear of the coronavirus is driving the latest plunge yet interest rates have broadly been in decline for about 40 years even as the national debt has lately headed in the opposite direction that s forced a big rethink among economists they used to fret about the shortfalls that result when government spending exceeds revenue they sound much more relaxed nowadays that s the worry modern monetary theory an unorthodox new school of economics can claim to have been ahead of that curve putting too big a demand on resources and causing inflation that s the worry about deficit spending said randall wray a senior scholar at the levy economics institute and one of mmt s founders but we don t have any inflation pressures now that used to be a lonely argument but it s becoming less so mainstream economists like larry summers and paul krugman have been critical of mmt and of sanders expensive plans but they agree that public debt ranks way down america s list of problems bond markets have been unfazed as deficits widened toward 1 trillion almost 5 of gross domestic product under president donald trump likely pushing federal debt held by the public above 80 of gdp this year i don t think we can learn that much from debt ratios for advanced countries what matters more is the market s expectations of inflation said kallum pickering senior economist at berenberg in london and those seem to be pretty low for now that could change if a democratic president piled more deficit spending on top of trump s fiscal taps if we turn on the fiscal taps through debt financing as long as the politics doesn t overwhelm the economic fundamentals bond yields should gradually rise from here said pickering but he expects any increase to be modest by past standards mmt s core argument is that countries like america which borrow in their own currencies can t go broke until inflation kicks in or threatens to they don t need to match every dollar of outlays by raising an equal amount of taxes and they can control borrowing costs via central banks sanders has one of mmt s leading lights on his team stephanie kelton a professor at stony brook university in new york whose forthcoming book is titled the deficit myth has advised on both his presidential runs after sanders hired her to work on the senate budget committee still sanders who aims to spend federal cash on a scale unprecedented in recent u s history isn t framing his plans quite the way mmt would he says he ll find revenue to pay for them all medicare for all on its own would cost an estimated 47 trillion over a decade according to sanders that would be about 17 of gdp based on government projections it would be less than the u s is forecast to spend on health with its current public private system allowing sanders to argue that his plan would save dollars as well as lives but the money would shift onto the government s books late monday sanders published funding proposals including new taxes on households businesses financial transactions and personal wealth democratic rivals said the numbers fell short of covering the whole bill amplifying a case they d already been making get comfortable in tuesday night s candidate debate michael bloomberg said that we just cannot afford some of this stuff people talk about and amy klobuchar said of sanders plans the math does not add up disclaimer michael bloomberg is seeking the democratic presidential nomination he is the founder and majority owner of bloomberg lp the parent company of bloomberg news some of our opponents who are good people are struggling to tell you how in god s name they re going to pay for anything joe biden told supporters in november democrats need to get more comfortable with talking about how to rein in deficits and debt pete buttigieg said in new hampshire this month in november whoever gets the nomination will be up against a president who s taken the opposite approach trump has seemed comfortable expanding public debt and he s gotten an economic boost as a result the u s is running kind of reagan era deficits right now trump s economic adviser larry kudlow said this week i don t think that interferes with growth whatsoever waves of lending by using the budget to juice an economy that had already been growing for years something not attempted in the u s since the 1960s trump broke with orthodoxy but there are signs he ll run a more fiscally conservative campaign in november trump s budget proposal to congress this month though it has little chance of getting passed promised spending cuts almost across the board kudlow said he s staggered by the scale of sanders tax and spend plans this stuff is so far to the left it does amount to socialism he said on cnbc step back from the 2020 fray and another reason for bigger deficits under both parties comes into view according to james galbraith a professor of economics at the university of texas before the 2008 crash private debt was driving the u s economy credit to households and businesses expanded for decades until it stalled that s when public borrowing stepped in to fill the gap just as it had in japan a decade earlier since the early 1980s fiscal policy was withdrawn from the field except in a major emergency and the economy grew on waves of bank lending said galbraith whose father john kenneth galbraith was one of america s most famous economists and served under four democratic administrations from franklin delano roosevelt to lyndon johnson take that away and you ve got to have other things driving the economy creating wages and jobs said galbraith and this is going to show up in the budget on the fiscal side

and oilfield asset management formerly guardian tubular management services and lined tubing products automotive and industrial formerly petrochemical and industrial connection systems including dsg canusa heat shrinkable tubing products and shawflex wire and cable products 1 1 fourth quarter highlights and outlook despite several challenges in the fourth quarter of 2019 that negatively impacted revenues adjusted ebitda1 for the quarter was in line with expectations these results reflect lower demand for products and services related to north america drilling and completions due to the annual seasonal slowdown and year end budget exhaustion the results were also negatively impacted by a quality issue on an offshore product at our channelview facility which resulted in rework costs of 7 3 million and the delay of other revenue from the disruption of the event the company has successfully identified the root cause of the issue and is completing the rework the event has been fully addressed to the satisfaction of the customer and mitigation action has been taken to prevent future events on the positive side demand was solid in the quarter for our retail fuel composite tanks and wire and cable products the pipeline and pipe services segment revenues were negatively impacted in the current quarter primarily due to lower demand for the company s products and services in the us land market the us land operators continued focus on capital discipline and delays in land transmission line projects has resulted in a decline for the company s small diameter pipe coating services and call out and project related girth weld inspection services north american pipe coating activity was also impacted by the quality issue at our channelview facility in addition lower pipe coating activity was experienced in the latin america and asia pacific regions partially offset by higher activity in the emar region the composite systems segment experienced lower revenues in the current quarter for composite pipe products and tubular management services due to the lower demand in the us land market and the continued weakness in western canada although demand for its composite tank products for the retail fuel and water markets remains solid the integration of the acquired zcl composites business continued as planned during the quarter and the company has achieved 95 of the 8 million annualized run rate cost synergies targeted by the end of the first quarter 2020 synergies have been realized through the integration of functional experience within the composites systems segment leveraging back office services and realizing operating and procurement efficiencies while still in the early stages the company continues to make progress on expanding the addressable market for composite tanks by the improvement of distribution channels linking discrete components into combined systems of composite pipe and tank development of an integration approach to grow the water market and leveraging the company s global footprint to extend the reach of tank technology the automotive and industrial segment performed as expected with the annual seasonal slowdown which impacted demand for its heat shrink tubing products particularly in automotive and continued solid demand for its wire and cable products in north america 1 ebitda and adjusted ebitda are non gaap measures and do not have standardized meanings under gaap and are not necessarily comparable to similar measures provided by other companies see section 6 0 reconciliation of non gaap measures for further details and a reconciliation of ebitda and adjusted ebitda order backlog the company s order backlog consists of firm customer orders only and represents the revenue the company expects to realize on booked orders over the succeeding twelve months the company reports the twelve month billable backlog because it provides a leading indicator of significant changes in consolidated revenue the order backlog of 513 million as at december 31 2019 was slightly higher than the 509 million as at september 30 2019 this increase is primarily due to pipe coating project wins moving from bid to backlog offset by revenue generated in the quarter from backlog orders the current backlog does not include secured orders to be executed beyond twelve months which is also in line with the prior quarter due to the recent announcements of project awards in addition to the backlog the company closely monitors its bidding activity which represents bids provided to customers with firm pricing and terms and conditions against a defined scope the value of outstanding firm bids is over 1 0 billion as at december 31 2019 in line with the 1 0 billion as at september 30 2019 included in the firm bid but not in the backlog are unsanctioned conditional awards between engineering procurement construction epc companies and shawcor for a scope of work that is estimated at over 240 million in revenue beyond 2019 a similar level as reported in the previous quarter the company is also working with customers on several other projects where budgetary estimates are provided at an earlier stage than bids to assist the customers in preparing their feasibility studies or to consider different potential execution options on projects the budgetary estimates at the end of the fourth quarter were 1 7 billion in line with the previous quarter although the timing of these projects is uncertain the company s bid and budgetary figures represent a diverse portfolio of opportunities to sustain and build the backlog in 2020 and beyond outlook the primary driver of demand for the company s products and services is the level of industry activity and investment in energy and infrastructure for resource development storage and transportation around the globe this investment in infrastructure is driven by economic activity to engineer replace maintain and rehabilitate infrastructure that is at or beyond its useful design life replace production due to reservoir depletion requirements for advanced technologies and non corrosive materials the need to address geopolitical challenges which are affecting several important producing regions and increased global demand for gas and greener alternatives specifically lng development the company continues to expect annual operating results for 2020 will be higher than 2019 results reflecting a return in stable demand for our products and services in the north america upstream and midstream markets higher pipe coating activity from orders secured to date and expected success in winning new awards in the coming quarters and solid demand for our non commodity based businesses of retail fuel composite tanks and automotive and industrial products the company expects the improvement to be staggered over the year with the second half of the year expected to deliver the majority of the growth due to continued softness experienced in us land at the start of 2020 the delay of revenue related to the quality issue at our channelview facility and the cost of preparing for contracted work the company expects results in the first quarter of 2020 could be significantly lower than in the fourth quarter of 2019 the company believes its diversified portfolio of products and services should mitigate some of these headwinds and continues to have confidence that it will secure additional project awards in the coming months to grow backlog for the second half of 2020 and into 2021 pipeline and pipe services segment the demand for the pipeline and pipe services segment is heavily tied to the spending programs of exploration and production operators in north america and international and offshore markets in the u s land market demand for our small diameter coating and girth weld inspection services is expected to remain volatile in 2020 as operators continue to focus on capital discipline and due to regulatory delays on us transmission line projects in western canada the company continues to expect demand will be limited due to lack of off take capacity and new pipeline infrastructure projects the company continues to see positive signs that the international and offshore markets are poised for growth based on the continued level of current bids outstanding and the success the company has experienced in securing work with epc companies conditional on final investment decision fid the company believes that there is a strong likelihood of projects being sanctioned in the near term that together with already booked work will allow the delivery of stronger results in the second half of 2020 and into 2021 in the near term project activity in the first quarter of 2020 is ramping up at our channelview texas indonesia and norway facilities and preparations have begun to restart our facilities in scotland uae and brazil for the execution of booked orders in the second quarter the company remains confident that decisions made to maintain pipe coating capabilities and its strategic efforts to position itself as the partner of choice with epc s in the pursuit of several projects were prudent and will deliver stronger results in 2020 and beyond although the exact timing of when projects are sanctioned is difficult to predict the company believes that there is still a strong likelihood that some of these projects will be sanctioned in the near term and it is well positioned to win additional work which will enable the pipe coating business to deliver positive annual results in 2020 composite systems segment market demand for composite pipe products in north america is closely tied to well completions while demand for octg pipe inspection and refurbishment services is more aligned with drilling activity in western canada similar to the pipeline and pipe services segment the oil and gas related businesses of the composite systems segment are expected to experience continued volatility in us land and limited growth in western canada the company believes its efforts to expand the composite spoolable portfolio into larger diameters and into international markets will mitigate some of this short term volatility in us land the demand for composite tank products is delinked from the dynamics of the oil and gas markets and is expected to remain solid throughout 2020 retail fuel market demand for underground storage tanks will remain strong in 2020 supported by north america commercial and convenience store construction and will experience the normal seasonal profile of lower revenues in the first quarter the company continues to focus on expanding its addressable market in the water storage treatment tanks and early signs are encouraging in this area automotive and industrial segment the automotive and industrial segment businesses continue to deliver stable revenue and operating income supported by the stable european and north american industrial markets and despite some softening of automotive markets these markets generally follow gdp activity however the segment continues to be well positioned to capture the growing trend of electronic content in automobiles with specified sealing insulating and customized application equipment systems for tier 1 assembly customers and the expected increased spending on nuclear facility refurbishment the company expects demand drivers for automotive and industrial related products to be solid for the full year 2020 however some short term volatility is expected due to the impact of the coronavirus in the first quarter results are expected to be driven by growth in global automotive market share demand for integrated systems and increases in electronic content and electric

arkema s paris ake board of directors met on 26 february 2020 to approve the group s consolidated financial statements for 2019 commenting on the year s results chairman and ceo thierry le hénaff highlighted the following points after a record year in 2018 we experienced a more difficult economic climate in 2019 marked by downturns in some markets such as the automotive and electronics sectors as well as a general lack of visibility in this context the group s performance remained at a high level and its resilience compared favorably with the sector average i would like to sincerely thank all our employees for their efforts and their ongoing commitment beyond those very solid financial results the group continued its strategy of strengthening its specialty 1 businesses by carrying out high quality bolt on acquisitions and capacity increases for high value added products and stepping up its innovation drive in high performance materials the group has also recently defined an ambitious climate plan to contain global warning to well below 2 c outlook for 2020 in 2020 in an economic environment that is likely to remain volatile arkema aims to achieve an ebitda comparable with the 2019 level excluding the impact of covid 19 for the full year the group s results should be driven by ebitda growth of around 10 for bostik whilst advanced materials should be broadly stable and fluorogases should decline the contribution between the two halves should be more balanced than last year uncertainty persists concerning the evolution of covid 19 the group estimates its impact on ebitda at the end of february at around 20 million _______________ 1 the group distinguishes between intermediate businesses corresponding to the pmma fluorogases and acrylics business lines and specialty businesses 2019 key figures in millions of euros 2019 2018 yoy change sales 8 738 8 816 0 9 ebitda 1 457 1 474 1 2 ebitda margin 16 7 16 7 recurring operating income rebit 926 1 026 9 7

applies ifrs 16 leases the income statement balance sheet and cash flow statement items for 2019 include the impacts of ifrs 16 which are detailed in the group s financial statements appended to this press release the comparative figures for 2018 have not been restated 2019 business performance at 8 738 million sales were down 0 9 year on year in an uncertain and less favorable macroeconomic context and a tense geopolitical environment marked notably by trade wars the scope effect of 1 8 mainly corresponds to the acquisition of arrmaz in the high performance materials division although positive in high performance materials 3 6 the price effect was a negative 2 3 for the group due to a sharp drop in propylene prices for the coating solutions division and challenging market conditions for fluorogases volumes were down 2 4 during the year with notably much lower demand in high performance materials in the transportation oil gas and consumer electronics sectors which overshadowed robust growth in certain niche segments such as batteries and 3d printing the 2 0 positive currency effect was essentially attributable to the appreciation of the us dollar against the euro the group continued to re balance its geographical footprint in 2019 with total sales for the year breaking down as 36 for europe 32 for north america and 32 for asia and the rest of the world comparable with the record high reached in 2018 ebitda for the year amounted to 1 457 million in a challenging environment demonstrating the quality of the group s portfolio this performance was driven by the strong increase in specialty businesses 72 of group sales thanks notably to solid growth for bostik and thiochemicals the benefits of the group s innovation and partnerships in composites batteries and additive manufacturing the positive impact of lower raw materials prices as well as the contribution of arrmaz in line with our expectations the intermediate businesses were down year on year impacted in particular by the strong decline of fluorogases compared with last year s historically high level the ebitda figure also includes a positive 56 million impact linked to the application of ifrs 16 at 16 7 ebitda margin was stable year on year at a high level consequently recurring operating income rebit amounted to 926 million representing a rebit margin of 10 6 including recurring depreciation and amortization of 531 million up 83 million the financial result represented a net expense of 116 million up 15 million on 2018 the year on year change is mainly due to the unfavorable interest rate effect on the portion of the group s debt swapped into us dollars the refinancing in december 2019 at favorable market conditions of the 480 million senior notes maturing in april 2020 should lead to a positive impact of around 10 million on the financial result in 2020 excluding non recurring items the tax rate amounted to 19 of rebit unchanged from 2018 in 2020 the tax rate excluding non recurring items should amount to around 20 of rebit consequently adjusted net income totaled 625 million for the year representing 8 20 per share cash flow and net debt at 31 december 2019 arkema s free cash flow rose strongly and reached 667 million in 2019 from 499 million the previous year this included a cash inflow linked to working capital mainly due to tight management and a slowdown in activity in a context of lower raw materials costs at 13 8 the ratio of working capital to annual sales remained at an excellent level at 31 december 2019 and close to the 2018 figure of 13 4 in line with the group s guidance for 2019 recurring and exceptional capital expenditure for the year came to 607 million including 96 million of exceptional capital expenditure mainly corresponding to the doubling of capacity of the thiochemicals unit in kerteh in malaysia and the specialty polyamides project in asia recurring capital expenditure was 511 million close to the 2018 level and represented 5 8 of group sales exceptional capital expenditure should reach around 200 million in 2020 with the ramp up of the specialty polyamides project in singapore consequently arkema expects to invest some 700 million in recurring and exceptional capital expenditure in 2020 the ebitda to cash conversion rate was 52 in 2019 exceeding the group s target of 35 portfolio management operations represented a net cash outflow of 729 million and includes arkema s acquisitions of arrmaz and lambson in performance additives prochimir in adhesives an equity interest in carbon and jurong s stake in taixing sunke chemicals cash flow from financing activities represented a net inflow of 64 million in 2019 this figure primarily includes 499 million in total net proceeds from a bond issue 38 million net cost for the partial refinancing of hybrid bonds with a nominal amount of 400 million and the payment of a 2 50 per share dividend for 2018 representing an aggregate payout of 190 million the cost of share buybacks was 34 million in 2019 and interest paid on the residual 300 million of hybrid bonds issued in october 2014 amounted to 15 million at end december 2019 net debt stood at 1 631 million versus 1 006 million at 31 december 2018 representing a gearing of 31 and 1 1x 2019 ebitda in accordance with ifrs these figures exclude the hybrid bonds in line with the group s dividend policy the board of directors has decided to propose at the annual general meeting of 19 may 2020 an increase in the dividend of 8 to 2 70 per share from 2 50 for 2018 representing a payout ratio of 33 of adjusted net income versus 26 for 2018 this decision reflects the confidence of the board of directors in the group s development prospects and solid cash flow

performance materials division amounted to 4 065 million up 2 4 on 2018 this performance was driven by a positive 3 6 price effect positive in all of the division s business lines and mainly reflecting the group s actions to increase sales prices and optimize the product mix the positive 3 5 scope effect primarily stemmed from the consolidation of arrmaz as of 1 july and to a lesser extent the bolt on acquisitions of lambson and prochimir in the fourth quarter in a challenging macroeconomic environment volumes fell 6 6 they were mainly impacted by a marked slowdown in the transportation oil gas and consumer electronics sectors as well as by the inventory adjustments of our customers all of which overshadowed strong demand in the batteries and 3d printing segments the currency effect added 1 9 to the division s sales ebitda of the high performance materials division was up 2 2 year on year to 654 million the increase was driven by the impact of price increases the shift in the product mix towards higher added value applications the contribution from acquisitions in line with our expectations and a more favorable raw materials environment in particular adhesives delivered a remarkable performance with ebitda up in the high teens in 2019 the division s ebitda margin was stable at 16 1 advanced materials resisted well with an ebitda margin of close to 20 despite a sharp decrease in volumes while bostik reported a strong improvement with an ebitda margin of around 13 industrial specialties 29 of total group sales in millions of euros 2019 2018 yoy

514 million with a negative 7 3 price effect and a 1 5 decrease in volumes against a high basis of comparison in 2018 these price and volume effects mainly reflect challenging market conditions in 2019 for fluorogases and to a lesser extent normalization in the mma pmma chain the currency effect was a positive 1 9 at 621 million the division s ebitda was down on the excellent performance delivered in 2018 675 million ebitda for fluorogases was strongly penalized by illegal hfc imports into europe which weighed on the prices and volumes of this activity for mma pmma the impact of the normalization of market conditions was mitigated by its strong integration the benefits of our innovation and the favorable evolution of certain raw materials over the full year the division s ebitda was supported by the very good performance of thiochemicals and the growth of hydrogen peroxide the division s ebitda margin of 24 7 remained very high and close to last year s level 25 0 coating

the start up of the clear lake acrylic acid reactor and in asia during the first nine months of the year the negative 7 0 price effect mechanically reflected lower propylene prices the scope effect was a positive 0 7 corresponding to arkema s acquisition of jurong s stake in taixing sunke chemicals the two companies joint venture that produces acrylic monomers in china the currency effect added 2 4 to sales the division s ebitda rose 8 6 year on year to 264 million driven mainly by improved unit margins in downstream businesses in a favorable raw materials environment however market conditions were more difficult for acrylic monomers in the fourth quarter in a context of low seasonality over the year as a whole the ebitda margin expanded to 12 4 from 11 5 in 2018 key figures for

continuing to weigh heavily on demand volumes declined by 5 3 reflecting the ongoing slowdown in the transportation oil gas and consumer electronics markets as well as a high basis of comparison with fourth quarter 2018 for the coating solutions division the negative 5 4 price effect mainly results from lower propylene prices for acrylic monomers and ongoing very tough market conditions for fluorogases which overshadowed the continuing positive price dynamic in high performance materials 1 9 positive price effect the 2 4 positive scope effect corresponds mainly to the consolidation of arrmaz in the performance additives business line the currency effect added 1 3 to sales primarily reflecting the appreciation of the us dollar against the euro in a less favorable operating environment relative to last year the month of december was also marked in france by the significant nation wide pension reform strikes which continued in january 2020 in this context group ebitda rose to 295 million 287 million in 4q 2018 this reflected growth for specialty businesses and more favorable raw materials prices ebitda margin rose to 14 4 13 0 in fourth quarter 2018 sales in the high performance materials division rose 1 3 year on year to 991 million fueled by a 5 4 positive scope effect arising from the consolidation of arrmaz prochimir and lambson despite continued solid momentum for batteries and 3d printing volumes declined by 7 6 due to ongoing weaker demand in the transportation oil gas and consumer electronics sectors as well as the inventory adjustments of some customers the 1 9 positive price effect reflects the impact of our pricing actions and product mix optimization particularly in adhesives at 140 million the division s ebitda was up year on year and includes the impact of the strikes in france which was rather limited in the quarter this performance was driven in particular by arrmaz s contribution and bostik s continued growth in line with its performance in the first nine months of the year industrial specialties sales totaled 593 million down 13 2 year on year at constant exchange rates the decline was 14 2 primarily stemming from a 10 3 negative price effect which was largely attributable to market conditions in fluorogases this activity weighed on the division s ebitda which came in at 133 million down 5 0 on fourth quarter 2018 overshadowing the solid performance of other business lines sales for the coating solutions division totaled 464 million down 13 9 on fourth quarter 2018 the decrease in propylene prices had a strong impact on the overall price effect which came in at a negative 12 6 whereas volumes were only 2 8 lower than the high comparison basis of fourth quarter 2018 in a context of low seasonality also marked by the strikes in france that began in december the division s ebitda amounted to 36 million 44 million in fourth quarter 2018 as improved unit margins in downstream businesses did not fully offset more challenging market conditions for upstream businesses post balance sheet events on 3 january 2020 arkema completed the acquisition of lip bygningsartikler as lip the danish leader in tile adhesives waterproofing systems and floor preparation solutions with annual sales of around 30 million in addition taking advantage of favorable market conditions on 21 january 2020 arkema carried out a 300 million issue of perpetual hybrid bonds these bonds carry a coupon of 1 5 until the first call date six years after their issue following its previous hybrid refinancing operation in june 2019 by issuing these new bonds the group thus acquires the possibility to refinance the remaining 300 million portion of its outstanding hybrid bonds with a 4 75 coupon and a first call date in october 2020 the covid 19 epidemic which started in january 2020 in china has led to a number of disruptions for the group quarantined personnel and transportation restrictions in china have impacted the

fourth quarter earnings of 145 million and record full year earnings of 1 5 billion a 61 percent decrease and 17 percent increase respectively over the same periods in the prior year fourth quarter and full year earnings were impacted positively by higher gross profit in both pipelines and facilities from new assets placed into service and negatively by an impairment charge of 300 million 220 million net of tax on pembina s convertible preferred interest in ruby pipeline the impairment charge was the result of an assessment triggered by upcoming contract expirations in a business environment in the rockies basin that remains challenged fourth quarter earnings also were positively impacted by the contribution from new assets included in the acquisition of kinder morgan canada and the u s portion of the cochin pipeline system the kinder acquisition higher margins in the crude marketing business and the impact of ifrs 16 leases ifrs 16 quarterly earnings were negatively impacted by unrealized losses on commodity related derivatives due to contracts maturing in the period and increasing forward prices for crude and ngl compared to contract positions as well a decrease in deferred tax expense was partially offset by an increase in current tax expense earnings for the full year also were positively impacted by an increase in facilities gross profit as a result of higher propane and butane terminalling revenue as well as a deferred tax recovery primarily due to the reduction in the alberta income tax rate offset by higher current tax expense marketing new ventures gross profit decreased largely due to lower share of profit in aux sable following a decrease in propane pricing and higher depreciation expense following the adoption of ifrs 16 and record

over the same periods in 2018 fourth quarter and annual adjusted ebitda increases were due to new assets placed into service in pipelines and facilities the adoption of ifrs 16 and the contribution from new assets acquired in the kinder acquisition the fourth quarter also was positively impacted by higher margins on crude in marketing new ventures partially offset by lower propane margins decreasing the contribution from aux sable and the narrower chicago aeco natural gas differential impacting alliance pipeline full year adjusted ebitda was also positively impacted by a realized gain on commodity related derivatives the recognition of variable revenues related to capital recoveries and increased terminalling and storage revenues partially offset by decreased ngl and crude market

prior year divisional highlights pipelines reported adjusted ebitda for the fourth quarter of 467 million and 1 854 million for the full year which represents 12 percent and nine percent increases respectively compared to the same periods of 2018 the quarter was positively impacted by higher revenue from new assets placed into service contribution from the kinder acquisition assets higher tolls on aegs timing difference in the recognition of deferred revenue and the end of the third party force majeure outage impacting vantage pipeline partially offset by a lower contribution from alliance pipeline higher operating expenses and higher general and administrative expense the full year increase was largely due to the same items impacting the fourth quarter combined with an increase due to the recognition of variable revenue and prior year recoveries in the oil sands and heavy oil assets pipelines volumes of 2 667 mboe d in the fourth quarter and 2 566 mboe d for the full year represent a five percent and two percent increase respectively compared to the same periods of 2018 volumes were impacted by new assets placed into service and higher interruptible volumes on ruby pipeline

have much to celebrate with this milestone from rather humble beginnings as a single pipeline in alberta with 31 people and an enterprise value of 20 million pembina has grown into one of canada s largest companies today we are nearly 3 000 people strong with an enterprise value in excess of 40 billion as proud as we are about the past our stakeholders are more interested in the future the keys to our success to date our unwavering commitment to long term value creation rather than chasing trends or fads combined with solid core values and consideration of all stakeholders will continue to propel us to new successes furthermore we have put forth a number of financial rules or guardrails which are our commitment to continue to grow both the depth and breadth of our value chain in a disciplined way this approach results in greater synergy value added service and diversification this is the pembina way and it will not change from a financial perspective a number of new records were set in 2019 earnings in 2019 of 1 5 billion were 17 percent higher than the previous year record adjusted ebitda of 3 1 billion exceeded the high end of our guidance range and our 2019 adjusted cash flow per share of 4 36 was another all time high in 2019 we placed in excess of 600 million of projects safely and successfully into service including duvernay ii burstall ethane storage as well as other infrastructure at our redwater complex furthermore we are excited about the 1 2 billion of additional fee based projects which are expected to enter service in 2020 with these new projects coming online in conjunction with the contribution from the kinder acquisition assets we anticipate generating 2020 adjusted ebitda of between 3 25 and 3 55 billion the most significant single event this year was the 4 25 billion kinder acquisition at our 2019 investor day we talked about our focus on getting better not just bigger and this acquisition clearly make us better the majority of the assets we acquired are already directly connected to our system the edmonton terminals connect our pipeline systems with the major trunkline third party export pipelines based on their location and connectivity these assets sit at the nexus of the canadian oil market and are essentially impossible to replicate by owning these assets pembina gains another premium franchise thereby enhancing the longevity and stability of our earnings stream in addition in the current political and regulatory environment pipe in the ground and particularly cross border pipelines possess considerable scarcity value the cochin pipeline which transports premium condensate from the u s midwest to fort saskatchewan alberta offers access to another condensate supply basin is connected to pembina s canadian diluent hub and strengthens our existing condensate franchise finally the assets we acquired have considerable upside by overlaying pembina s exiting commercial models in addition to the strategic benefits the acquisition also has a positive financial impact enhancing the diversification in our business and providing opportunities for future growth these assets are predominantly supported by long term fee for service take or pay contracts which are underpinned by strong investment grade counterparties enhancing pembina s financial guardrails we have identified meaningful financial upside available from a portfolio of small capital projects and the integration of the acquired assets within pembina s existing businesses over the next five years we expect to realize additional annual adjusted ebitda of 100 million a roughly 30 percent increase with only modest capital spending as we look to the future we are excited about our continued progress in accessing global markets in early 2019 we took a major step forward with the approval of the integrated propane dehydrogenation pdh plant and polypropylene pp upgrading facility pdh pp facility through our 50 percent owned joint venture entity canada kuwait petrochemical limited partnership ckpc this project is true to our strategy of trying to do more with the hydrocarbon molecules we touch and leverages our position as the largest supplier of propane in western canada more recently we were pleased to announce that we have executed a lump sum engineering procurement and construction epc contract relating to the construction of the pdh plant with this contract we have locked in approximately 60 percent of the cost of the pdh pp facility thus far reflecting our disciplined and prudent approach to spending in addition to advancing our petrochemical facility we also are very excited about our prince rupert terminal this project is important as it represents our first export facility demand for propane export capacity was significant and we were pleased to approve an expansion of this export terminal increasing capacity to approximately 40 mbpd we are entering a new decade with significant momentum and abundant growth opportunities in fact some of the hardest decisions we must make are what projects are we not going to pursue our continued focus on being better and not just bigger in addition to our financial guardrails and strategic investment criteria based on long term thinking will remain our guiding principles for future growth ensuring we continue to create long term sustainable value

fourth quarter 2019 capital expenditures of approximately 69 million were down 41 as expected from third quarter 2019 s level of 116 million this reduction reflects the completion of the extensive

negatively impacted in 2019 by downtime from electric submersible pump esp failures in acordionero and the temporary shut in of several wells in acordionero with high gas oil ratios the esp failure rate has significantly declined following the completion of the acordionero central processing facility expansion in second half 2019 the water injection facilities and gas to power turbines continue operating with increasing reliability in fourth quarter 2019 there were 3 esp failures in october 3 in november and only 1 in december this significant improvement in esp performance is a result of increased power reliability and increased reservoir pressure due to the substantial ramp up in water injection at acordionero starting in mid 2019 the increase in water injection in mid 2019 has significantly reduced gas production in acordionero from a high of 18 million cubic feet per day mmcfd down to the current 8 mmcfd all of which is either consumed to generate power or re injected into

message to shareholders gary guidry president and chief executive officer of gran tierra commented 2019 was both an exciting and challenging year for gran tierra throughout the course of the second half of 2019 we accomplished the full implementation and growth of our waterflood in the acordionero field which is forecast to generate approximately 1 2 billion of free cash flow 3 over the next five years and has a december 31 2019 before tax 2p npv10 of 1 8 billion our four core assets are all under waterflood at different stages of maturity and are forecast to generate significant free cash flow 3 for the next several years our main challenge was a delay in the expansion of the production facilities in acordionero which temporarily impacted this field s oil production rate we have learned a number of operational lessons that will be applied to future projects during 2020 we are deploying an integrated plan for free cash flow 6 growth from our key producing areas including a disciplined approach to leveraging our world class exploration portfolio we are reducing our 2020 capital program to a new range of 175 to 195 million as a prudent response to the drop in world oil prices and widening differentials during 2020 to date our 2020 capital budget is a balanced returns focused program which prioritizes free cash flow 6 generation and returns over the rate of development and production growth we plan to prioritize debt reduction with our free cash flow 6 we see material potential in our world class exploration portfolio located in highly prospective geological basins in colombia and ecuador we have budgeted a measured yet robust high impact exploration campaign mostly directed at our large landholdings in the putumayo basin of colombia and oriente basin of ecuador our 2020 plans are also aligned with gran tierra s beyond compliance policy which focuses on our commitments to environmental social and governance excellence when there are

operating expenses increased to 11 14 per boe compared with 8 49 per boe in 2018 primarily as a result of higher power generation and rental costs with the commissioning of the expanded production facilities and the gas to power project in acordionero both total operating costs and per boe operating costs are expected to decrease in 2020 workover expenses increased to 3 22 per boe compared with

transportation expenses decreased by 28 to 1 60 per boe in 2019 from 2 21 per boe in 2018 due to a higher percentage of volumes being sold at the wellhead where transportation is netted against sales

estimated quantities and net present value of reserves business strategy plans and objectives for future operations capital spending plans and those statements preceded by followed by or that otherwise include the words believe expect anticipate forecast budget will estimate target project plan should guidance strives or similar expressions are forward looking statements such forward looking statements include but are not limited to the company s expectations capital program repayment of borrowings under the credit facility future sources of funding for capital expenditures and guidance including for certain future production estimates forecast prices five year expected free cash flow expected future net cash provided by operating activities net debt capital expenditures and certain associated metrics the company s strategies the company s goals on reforestation and flaring the company s plans to benefit the environment or communities in which it operates and the company s operations including planned operations and oil production statements relating to reserves are also deemed to be forward looking statements as they involve the implied assessment based on certain estimates and assumptions including that the reserves described can be profitably produced in the future the forward looking statements contained in this press release reflect several material factors and expectations and assumptions of gran tierra including without limitation that gran tierra will continue to conduct its operations in a manner consistent with its current expectations the accuracy of testing and production results and seismic data pricing and cost estimates including with respect to commodity pricing and exchange rates rig availability the risk profile of planned exploration activities the effects of drilling down dip the effects of waterflood and multi stage fracture stimulation operations the extent and effect of delivery disruptions and the general continuance of current or where applicable assumed operational regulatory and industry conditions including in areas of potential expansion and the ability of gran tierra to execute its current business and operational plans in the manner currently planned gran tierra believes the material factors expectations and assumptions reflected in the forward looking statements are reasonable at this time but no assurance can be given that these factors expectations and assumptions will prove to be correct among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward looking statements in this press release are prices and markets for oil and natural gas are unpredictable and tend to fluctuate significantly gran tierra s operations are located in south america and unexpected problems can arise due to guerrilla activity or local blockades technical difficulties and operational difficulties may arise which impact the production transport or sale of our products geographic political and weather conditions can impact the production transport or sale of gran tierra s products the ability of gran tierra to execute its business plan the risk that unexpected delays and difficulties in developing currently owned properties may occur the ability to replace reserves and production and develop and manage reserves on an economically viable basis the timely receipt of regulatory or other required approvals for our operating activities the failure of exploratory drilling to result in commercial wells unexpected delays due to the limited availability of drilling equipment and personnel the risk that current global economic health and credit market conditions may impact oil prices and oil consumption more than gran tierra currently predicts which could cause gran tierra to further modify its strategy and capital spending program and the risk factors detailed from time to time in gran tierra s periodic reports filed with the securities and exchange commission including without limitation under the caption risk factors in gran tierra s annual report on form 10 k for the year ended december 31 2019 filed february 26 2020 and its other filings with the sec these filings are available on the sec website at and on sedar at www sedar com although the current guidance capital spending program and long term strategy of gran tierra are based upon the current expectations of the management of gran tierra should any one of a number of issues arise gran tierra may find it necessary to alter its business strategy and or capital spending program and there can be no assurance as at the date of this press release as to how those funds may be reallocated or strategy changed and how that would impact gran tierra s results of operations and financial position forecasts and expectations that cover multi year time horizons or are associated with 2p reserves inherently involve increased risks and actual results may differ materially all forward looking statements included in this press release are made as of the date of this press release and the fact that this press release remains available does not constitute a representation by gran tierra that gran tierra believes these forward looking statements continue to be true as of any subsequent date actual results may vary materially from the expected results expressed in forward looking statements gran tierra disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise except as expressly required by applicable securities laws gran tierra s forward looking statements are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement the estimates of

considered to be future oriented financial information or a financial outlook for the purposes of applicable canadian securities laws financial outlook and future oriented financial information contained in this press release about prospective financial performance financial position or cash flows are based on assumptions about future events including economic conditions and proposed courses of action based on management s assessment of the relevant information currently available and to become available in the future in particular this press release contains projected operational and financial information for 2020 and the next five years these projections contain forward looking statements and are based on a number of material assumptions and factors set out above actual results may differ significantly from the projections presented herein these projections may also be considered to contain future oriented financial information or a financial outlook the actual results of gran tierra s operations for any period will likely vary from the amounts set forth in these projections and such variations may be material see above for a discussion of the risks that could cause actual results to vary the future oriented financial information and financial outlooks contained in this press release have been approved by management as of the date of this press release readers are cautioned that any such financial outlook and future oriented financial information contained herein should not be used for purposes other than those for which it is disclosed herein the company and its management believe that the prospective operational and financial information has been prepared on a reasonable basis reflecting management s best estimates and judgments and represent to the best of management s knowledge and opinion the company s expected course of action however because this information is highly subjective it should not be relied on as necessarily indicative of future results non gaap measures this press release includes non gaap financial measures as further described herein these non gaap measures do not have a standardized meaning under gaap investors are cautioned that these measures should not be construed as alternatives to net loss or other measures of financial performance as determined in accordance with gaap gran tierra s method of calculating these measures may differ from other companies and accordingly they may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies each non gaap financial measure is presented along with the corresponding gaap measure so as not to imply that more emphasis should be placed on the non gaap measure before tax and after tax free cash flow are non gaap terms and are called before tax and after tax net revenue in the gte mcdaniel reserves report respectively the non gaap term of before tax free cash flow and free cash flow after development expenditures and taxes over the next five years reconciles to the nearest gaap term of oil and gas sales which is called sales revenue in the gte mcdaniel reserves report before tax net revenue is calculated by mcdaniel by subtracting total royalties operating costs future development capital and abandonment and reclamation costs from sales revenue after tax free cash flow is calculated by mcdaniel by subtracting future taxes from before tax net revenue refer to future net revenue in this press release for the applicable reconciliation gran tierra is unable to provide a quantitative reconciliation of free cash flow after development expenditures taxes interest and g a costs over the next five years to its most directly comparable forward looking gaap measure because management cannot reliably predict certain of the necessary components of such forward looking gaap measure gran tierra is also unable to provide forward looking oil and gas sales the gaap measures most directly comparable to such measures of free cash flow due to the impracticality of quantifying certain components required by gaap as a result of the inherent volatility in the value of certain financial instruments held by the company and the inability to quantify the effectiveness of commodity price derivatives used to manage the variability in cash flows associated with the forecast sale of its oil production and changes in commodity prices refer to oil and gas metrics in this press release for a description of how this non gaap measure is calculated management uses free cash flow as a measure of the company s ability to fund its exploration

information on form 51 101f1 dated effective as at december 31 2019 which includes disclosure of its oil and gas reserves and other oil and gas information in accordance with ni 51 101 forming the basis of this press release is available on sedar at www sedar com estimates of net present value and future net revenue contained herein do not necessarily represent fair market value of reserves estimates of reserves and future net revenue for individual properties may not reflect the same level of confidence as estimates of reserves and future net revenue for all properties due to the effect of aggregation there is no assurance that the forecast price and cost assumptions applied by mcdaniel in evaluating gran tierra s reserves and future net revenue will be attained and variances could be material see gran tierra s press release dated january 28 2020 for a summary of the price forecasts employed by mcdaniel in the gte mcdaniel reserves report and other information regarding the disclosed future net revenue all evaluations of future net revenue contained in the gte mcdaniel reserves report are after the deduction of royalties operating costs development costs production costs and abandonment and reclamation costs but before consideration of indirect costs such as administrative overhead and other miscellaneous expenses it should not be assumed that the estimates of future net revenues presented in this press release represent the fair market value of the reserves there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of crude oil and natural gas reserves and the future cash flows attributed to such reserves the reserve and associated cash flow information set forth in the gte mcdaniel reserves report are estimates only and there is no guarantee that the estimated reserves will be recovered actual reserves may be greater than or less than the estimates provided therein boes have been converted on the basis of six thousand cubic feet mcf natural gas to 1 bbl of oil boes may be misleading particularly if used in isolation a boe conversion ratio of 6 mcf 1 bbl is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead in addition given that the value ratio based on the current price of oil as compared with natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalent of six to one utilizing a boe conversion ratio of 6 mcf 1 bbl would be misleading as an indication of value references to a formation where evidence of hydrocarbons has been encountered is not necessarily an indicator that hydrocarbons will be recoverable in commercial quantities or in any estimated volume gran tierra s reported production is a mix of light crude oil and medium and heavy crude oil for which there is not a precise breakdown since the company s oil sales volumes typically represent blends of more than one type of crude oil well test results should be considered as preliminary and not necessarily indicative of long term performance or of ultimate recovery well log interpretations indicating oil and gas accumulations are not necessarily indicative of future production or ultimate recovery if it is indicated that a pressure transient analysis or well test interpretation has not been carried out any data disclosed in that respect should be considered preliminary until such analysis has been completed references to thickness of oil pay or of a formation where evidence of hydrocarbons has been encountered is not necessarily an indicator that hydrocarbons will be recoverable in commercial quantities or in any estimated volume future net revenue future net revenue reflects mcdaniel s forecast of revenue estimated using forecast prices

which do not have standardized meanings or standard methods of calculation and therefore such measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies and should not be used to make comparisons such metrics have been included herein to provide readers with additional measures to evaluate the company s performance however such measures are not reliable indicators of the future performance of the company and future performance may not compare to the performance in previous periods before tax and after tax free cash flow are non gaap terms and are called before tax and after tax net revenue in the gte mcdaniel reserves report respectively the non gaap term of before tax free cash flow reconciles to the nearest gaap term of oil and gas sales which is called sales revenue in the gte mcdaniel reserves report before tax net revenue is calculated by mcdaniel by subtracting total royalties operating costs future development capital abandonment and reclamation costs from sales revenue after tax free cash flow is calculated by mcdaniel by subtracting future taxes from before tax net revenue refer to future net revenue in this press release for the applicable reconciliation management uses free cash flow as a measure of the company s ability to fund its exploration program nav per share is calculated as npv discounted at 10 before or after tax as applicable minus estimated net debt divided by the number of shares of gran tierra s common stock issued and outstanding management uses nav per share as a measure of the relative change of gran tierra s net asset value over its outstanding common stock over a period of time operating netback and cash netback are calculated as described in this press release management believes that operating netback and cash netback are useful supplemental measures for the reasons described in this press release reserves per share is calculated as reserves in the referenced category divided by the number of shares of gran tierra s common stock issued and outstanding as at december 31 management uses this measure to determine the relative change of its reserve base over its outstanding common stock over a period of time reserves replacement is calculated as reserves in the referenced category divided by estimated referenced production management uses this measure to determine the relative change of its reserves base over a period of time disclosure of reserve information and cautionary note to u s investors unless expressly stated otherwise all estimates of proved probable and possible reserves and related future net revenue disclosed in this press release have been prepared in accordance with ni 51 101 estimates of reserves and future net revenue made in accordance with ni 51 101

operational highlights fourth quarter earnings of 145 million and record full year earnings of 1 5 billion a 61 percent decrease and 17 percent increase respectively over the same periods in the prior year fourth quarter and full year earnings were impacted positively by higher gross profit in both pipelines and facilities from new assets placed into service and negatively by an impairment charge of 300 million 220 million net of tax on pembina s convertible preferred interest in ruby pipeline the impairment charge was the result of an assessment triggered by upcoming contract expirations in a business environment in the rockies basin that remains challenged fourth quarter earnings also were positively impacted by the contribution from new assets included in the acquisition of kinder morgan canada and the u s portion of the cochin pipeline system the kinder acquisition higher margins in the crude marketing business and the impact of ifrs 16 leases ifrs 16 quarterly earnings were negatively impacted by unrealized losses on commodity related derivatives due to contracts maturing in the period and increasing forward prices for crude and ngl compared to contract positions as well a decrease in deferred tax expense was partially offset by an increase in current tax expense earnings for the full year also were positively impacted by an increase in facilities gross profit as a result of higher propane and butane terminalling revenue as well as a deferred tax recovery primarily due to the reduction in the alberta income tax rate offset by higher current tax expense marketing new ventures gross profit decreased largely due to lower share of profit in aux sable following a decrease in propane pricing and higher depreciation expense following the adoption of ifrs 16 and

over the same periods in 2018 fourth quarter and annual adjusted ebitda increases were due to new assets placed into service in pipelines and facilities the adoption of ifrs 16 and the contribution from new assets acquired in the kinder acquisition the fourth quarter also was positively impacted by higher margins on crude in marketing new ventures partially offset by lower propane margins decreasing the contribution from aux sable and the narrower chicago aeco natural gas differential impacting alliance pipeline full year adjusted ebitda was also positively impacted by a realized gain on commodity related derivatives the recognition of variable revenues related to capital recoveries and increased terminalling and storage revenues partially offset by decreased ngl and crude market prices in marketing new ventures and full year record adjusted ebitda of a 10 and eight percent increase respectively over the same periods in 2018 fourth quarter and annual adjusted ebitda increases

prior year divisional highlights pipelines reported adjusted ebitda for the fourth quarter of 467 million and 1 854 million for the full year which represents 12 percent and nine percent increases respectively compared to the same periods of 2018 the quarter was positively impacted by higher revenue from new assets placed into service contribution from the kinder acquisition assets higher tolls on aegs timing difference in the recognition of deferred revenue and the end of the third party force majeure outage impacting vantage pipeline partially offset by a lower contribution from alliance pipeline higher operating expenses and higher general and administrative expense the full year increase was largely due to the same items impacting the fourth quarter combined with an increase due to the recognition of variable revenue and prior year recoveries in the oil sands and heavy oil assets pipelines volumes of 2 667 mboe d in the fourth quarter and 2 566 mboe d for the full year represent a five percent and two percent increase respectively compared to the same periods of 2018 volumes were impacted by new assets placed into service and higher interruptible volumes on ruby pipeline

have much to celebrate with this milestone from rather humble beginnings as a single pipeline in alberta with 31 people and an enterprise value of 20 million pembina has grown into one of canada s largest companies today we are nearly 3 000 people strong with an enterprise value in excess of 40 billion as proud as we are about the past our stakeholders are more interested in the future the keys to our success to date our unwavering commitment to long term value creation rather than chasing trends or fads combined with solid core values and consideration of all stakeholders will continue to propel us to new successes furthermore we have put forth a number of financial rules or guardrails which are our commitment to continue to grow both the depth and breadth of our value chain in a disciplined way this approach results in greater synergy value added service and diversification this is the pembina way and it will not change from a financial perspective a number of new records were set in 2019 earnings in 2019 of 1 5 billion were 17 percent higher than the previous year record adjusted ebitda of 3 1 billion exceeded the high end of our guidance range and our 2019 adjusted cash flow per share of 4 36 was another all time high in 2019 we placed in excess of 600 million of projects safely and successfully into service including duvernay ii burstall ethane storage as well as other infrastructure at our redwater complex furthermore we are excited about the 1 2 billion of additional fee based projects which are expected to enter service in 2020 with these new projects coming online in conjunction with the contribution from the kinder acquisition assets we anticipate generating 2020 adjusted ebitda of between 3 25 and 3 55 billion the most significant single event this year was the 4 25 billion kinder acquisition at our 2019 investor day we talked about our focus on getting better not just bigger and this acquisition clearly make us better the majority of the assets we acquired are already directly connected to our system the edmonton terminals connect our pipeline systems with the major trunkline third party export pipelines based on their location and connectivity these assets sit at the nexus of the canadian oil market and are essentially impossible to replicate by owning these assets pembina gains another premium franchise thereby enhancing the longevity and stability of our earnings stream in addition in the current political and regulatory environment pipe in the ground and particularly cross border pipelines possess considerable scarcity value the cochin pipeline which transports premium condensate from the u s midwest to fort saskatchewan alberta offers access to another condensate supply basin is connected to pembina s canadian diluent hub and strengthens our existing condensate franchise finally the assets we acquired have considerable upside by overlaying pembina s exiting commercial models in addition to the strategic benefits the acquisition also has a positive financial impact enhancing the diversification in our business and providing opportunities for future growth these assets are predominantly supported by long term fee for service take or pay contracts which are underpinned by strong investment grade counterparties enhancing pembina s financial guardrails we have identified meaningful financial upside available from a portfolio of small capital projects and the integration of the acquired assets within pembina s existing businesses over the next five years we expect to realize additional annual adjusted ebitda of 100 million a roughly 30 percent increase with only modest capital spending as we look to the future we are excited about our continued progress in accessing global markets in early 2019 we took a major step forward with the approval of the integrated propane dehydrogenation pdh plant and polypropylene pp upgrading facility pdh pp facility through our 50 percent owned joint venture entity canada kuwait petrochemical limited partnership ckpc this project is true to our strategy of trying to do more with the hydrocarbon molecules we touch and leverages our position as the largest supplier of propane in western canada more recently we were pleased to announce that we have executed a lump sum engineering procurement and construction epc contract relating to the construction of the pdh plant with this contract we have locked in approximately 60 percent of the cost of the pdh pp facility thus far reflecting our disciplined and prudent approach to spending in addition to advancing our petrochemical facility we also are very excited about our prince rupert terminal this project is important as it represents our first export facility demand for propane export capacity was significant and we were pleased to approve an expansion of this export terminal increasing capacity to approximately 40 mbpd we are entering a new decade with significant momentum and abundant growth opportunities in fact some of the hardest decisions we must make are what projects are we not going to pursue our continued focus on being better and not just bigger in addition to our financial guardrails and strategic investment criteria based on long term thinking will remain our guiding principles for future growth ensuring we continue to create long term sustainable value

the full year represent a five percent decrease and eight percent increase respectively compared to the same periods in 2018 volumes for the fourth quarter were negatively impacted by lower supply volumes at redwater combined with higher butane sales made in the fourth quarter of 2018 partially offset by increased volumes at aux sable volumes for the full year were positively impacted by increased ngl sales volumes primarily driven by higher butane volumes partially offset by lower ethane volumes at aux sable executive overview this past year pembina marked its 65th anniversary and we have much to celebrate with this milestone from rather humble beginnings as a single pipeline in alberta with 31 people and an enterprise value of 20 million pembina has grown into one of canada s largest companies today we are nearly 3 000 people strong with an enterprise value in excess of 40 billion as proud as we are about the past our stakeholders are more interested in the future the keys to our success to date our unwavering commitment to long term value creation rather than chasing trends or fads combined with solid core values and consideration of all stakeholders will continue to propel us to new successes furthermore we have put forth a number of financial rules or guardrails which are our commitment to continue to grow both the depth and breadth of our value chain in a disciplined way this approach results in greater synergy value added service and diversification this is the pembina way and it will not change from a financial perspective a number of new records were set in 2019 earnings in 2019 of 1 5 billion were 17 percent higher than the previous year record adjusted ebitda of 3 1 billion exceeded the high end of our guidance range and our 2019 adjusted cash flow per share of 4 36 was another all time high in 2019 we placed in excess of 600 million of projects safely and successfully into service including duvernay ii burstall ethane storage as well as other infrastructure at our redwater complex furthermore we are excited about the 1 2 billion of additional fee based projects which are expected to enter service in 2020 with these new projects coming online in conjunction with the contribution from the kinder acquisition assets we anticipate generating 2020 adjusted ebitda of between 3 25 and 3 55 billion the most significant single event this year was the 4 25 billion kinder acquisition at our 2019 investor day we talked about our focus on getting better not just bigger and this acquisition clearly make us better the majority of the assets we acquired are already directly connected to our system the edmonton terminals connect our pipeline systems with the major trunkline third party export pipelines based on their location and connectivity these assets sit at the nexus of the canadian oil market and are essentially impossible to replicate by owning these assets pembina gains another premium franchise thereby enhancing the longevity and stability of our earnings stream in addition in the current political and regulatory environment pipe in the ground and particularly cross border pipelines possess considerable scarcity value the cochin pipeline which transports premium condensate from the u s midwest to fort saskatchewan alberta offers access to another condensate supply basin is connected to pembina s canadian diluent hub and strengthens our existing condensate franchise finally the assets we acquired have considerable upside by overlaying pembina s exiting commercial models in addition to the strategic benefits the acquisition also has a positive financial impact enhancing the diversification in our business and providing opportunities for future growth these assets are predominantly supported by long term fee for service take or pay contracts which are underpinned by strong investment grade counterparties enhancing pembina s financial guardrails we have identified meaningful financial upside available from a portfolio of small capital projects and the integration of the acquired assets within pembina s existing businesses over the next five years we expect to realize additional annual adjusted ebitda of 100 million a roughly 30 percent increase with only modest capital spending as we look to the future we are excited about our continued progress in accessing global markets in early 2019 we took a major step forward with the approval of the integrated propane dehydrogenation pdh plant and polypropylene pp upgrading facility pdh pp facility through our 50 percent owned joint venture entity canada kuwait petrochemical limited partnership ckpc this project is true to our strategy of trying to do more with the hydrocarbon molecules we touch and leverages our position as the largest supplier of propane in western canada more recently we were pleased to announce that we have executed a lump sum engineering procurement and construction epc contract relating to the construction of the pdh plant with this contract we have locked in approximately 60 percent of the cost of the pdh pp facility thus far reflecting our disciplined and prudent approach to spending in addition to advancing our petrochemical facility we also are very excited about our prince rupert terminal this project is important as it represents our first export facility demand for propane export capacity was significant and we were pleased to approve an expansion of this export terminal increasing capacity to approximately 40 mbpd we are entering a new decade with significant momentum and abundant growth opportunities in fact some of the hardest decisions we must make are what projects are we not going to pursue our continued focus on being better and not just bigger in addition to our financial guardrails and strategic investment criteria based on long term thinking will remain our guiding principles for future growth ensuring we continue to create long term sustainable value

have much to celebrate with this milestone from rather humble beginnings as a single pipeline in alberta with 31 people and an enterprise value of 20 million pembina has grown into one of canada s largest companies today we are nearly 3 000 people strong with an enterprise value in excess of 40 billion as proud as we are about the past our stakeholders are more interested in the future the keys to our success to date our unwavering commitment to long term value creation rather than chasing trends or fads combined with solid core values and consideration of all stakeholders will continue to propel us to new successes furthermore we have put forth a number of financial rules or guardrails which are our commitment to continue to grow both the depth and breadth of our value chain in a disciplined way this approach results in greater synergy value added service and diversification this is the pembina way and it will not change from a financial perspective a number of new records were set in 2019 earnings in 2019 of 1 5 billion were 17 percent higher than the previous year record adjusted ebitda of 3 1 billion exceeded the high end of our guidance range and our 2019 adjusted cash flow per share of 4 36 was another all time high in 2019 we placed in excess of 600 million of projects safely and successfully into service including duvernay ii burstall ethane storage as well as other infrastructure at our redwater complex furthermore we are excited about the 1 2 billion of additional fee based projects which are expected to enter service in 2020 with these new projects coming online in conjunction with the contribution from the kinder acquisition assets we anticipate generating 2020 adjusted ebitda of between 3 25 and 3 55 billion the most significant single event this year was the 4 25 billion kinder acquisition at our 2019 investor day we talked about our focus on getting better not just bigger and this acquisition clearly make us better the majority of the assets we acquired are already directly connected to our system the edmonton terminals connect our pipeline systems with the major trunkline third party export pipelines based on their location and connectivity these assets sit at the nexus of the canadian oil market and are essentially impossible to replicate by owning these assets pembina gains another premium franchise thereby enhancing the longevity and stability of our earnings stream in addition in the current political and regulatory environment pipe in the ground and particularly cross border pipelines possess considerable scarcity value the cochin pipeline which transports premium condensate from the u s midwest to fort saskatchewan alberta offers access to another condensate supply basin is connected to pembina s canadian diluent hub and strengthens our existing condensate franchise finally the assets we acquired have considerable upside by overlaying pembina s exiting commercial models in addition to the strategic benefits the acquisition also has a positive financial impact enhancing the diversification in our business and providing opportunities for future growth these assets are predominantly supported by long term fee for service take or pay contracts which are underpinned by strong investment grade counterparties enhancing pembina s financial guardrails we have identified meaningful financial upside available from a portfolio of small capital projects and the integration of the acquired assets within pembina s existing businesses over the next five years we expect to realize additional annual adjusted ebitda of 100 million a roughly 30 percent increase with only modest capital spending as we look to the future we are excited about our continued progress in accessing global markets in early 2019 we took a major step forward with the approval of the integrated propane dehydrogenation pdh plant and polypropylene pp upgrading facility pdh pp facility through our 50 percent owned joint venture entity canada kuwait petrochemical limited partnership ckpc this project is true to our strategy of trying to do more with the hydrocarbon molecules we touch and leverages our position as the largest supplier of propane in western canada more recently we were pleased to announce that we have executed a lump sum engineering procurement and construction epc contract relating to the construction of the pdh plant with this contract we have locked in approximately 60 percent of the cost of the pdh pp facility thus far reflecting our disciplined and prudent approach to spending in addition to advancing our petrochemical facility we also are very excited about our prince rupert terminal this project is important as it represents our first export facility demand for propane export capacity was significant and we were pleased to approve an expansion of this export terminal increasing capacity to approximately 40 mbpd we are entering a new decade with significant momentum and abundant growth opportunities in fact some of the hardest decisions we must make are what projects are we not going to pursue our continued focus on being better and not just bigger in addition to our financial guardrails and strategic investment criteria based on long term thinking will remain our guiding principles for future growth ensuring we continue to create long term sustainable value

from operating activities assuming working capital changes are nil in the range of 100 million to 115 million atlantic power corporation nyse at tsx atp atlantic power or the company today reported its financial results for the three months and year ended december 31 2019 we posted strong results for both project adjusted ebitda and cash from operating activities in 2019 exceeding our guidance said james j moore jr president and ceo of atlantic power market conditions supply demand and power prices are poor nevertheless atlantic power had a good year of progress on business fundamentals including a reduction in our leverage ratio to 3 8 times from 4 5 times a year ago which we expect to improve further in the next couple of years an upgrade to our credit rating by s p an extension of the maturity date and a reduction in the pricing of our term loan solid contributions by the five projects we acquired ownership interests in over the last two years for a total investment of 45 million and steady operating results from existing projects we also had some successes on ppa extensions we have significant liquidity relative to the size of the company and good prospects to allocate capital to additional debt reduction more share buybacks and when price to value is compelling continued external growth as well 1 the company has not provided guidance for project income or net income because of the difficulty of making accurate forecasts and projections without unreasonable efforts with respect to certain highly variable components of these comparable gaap metrics including changes in the fair value of derivative instruments and foreign exchange gains or losses these factors which generally do not affect cash flow are not included in project adjusted ebitda

explanation and a reconciliation of project adjusted ebitda as used in this news release to project income loss discussion of financial results recent accounting developments new business segments in the fourth quarter of 2019 the company revised its reportable business segments to better align with how the projects are managed and their performance evaluated following recent acquisitions ppa expirations and project decommissioning the new segments are solid fuel biomass and coal natural gas hydroelectric and corporate a schedule of project income loss and project adjusted ebitda by segment for the three months and year ended december 31 2019 and the comparable 2018 periods can be found on page 14 of this release impairment in the fourth quarter of 2019 the company recorded a 49 2 million impairment of its equity investment in chambers and a 5 8 million long lived asset impairment at calstock both projects are in the solid fuel segment total impairment expense of 55 0 million is included in project income although it is not included in project adjusted ebitda the company reviewed chambers and determined that there had been a decline in value that was other than temporary factors considered in that determination included the continued decline in forward power curves since the previous impairment recorded in 2017 a challenging re contracting environment and a low probability of the plant operating as a merchant facility the company reviewed calstock for potential impairment consistent with its policy of evaluating those projects for which the ppa is expiring within six months and determined the plant was unlikely to operate past the expiration date of the ppa in june 2020 because of the uncertainty of the ability to re contract the project the fair value of calstock was determined solely on the cash flows remaining under the ppa cadillac insurance recovery as previously disclosed the cadillac plant which is in the company s solid fuel segment was extensively damaged in a steam turbine overspeed event and subsequent fire in september 2019 and has been out of service since the incident the company has insurance coverage that it believes will be adequate to cover the cost of repairs and lost profits business interruption losses during the outage in the fourth quarter of 2019 the company received 11 3 million from its insurers in payment of its initial claim net of a 1 million property deductible the payment was not allocated between property insurance and business interruption insurance the company applied the entire 11 3 million to its 24 3 million insurance receivable the 11 3 million is included in cash flows from investing activities the cost of repairs to the plant which totaled 5 1 million as of december 31 2019 is included in capital expenditures a component of cash flows from investing activities the company estimates that approximately 2 0 million of the 11 3 million represents recovery of business interruption losses subsequent to the 45 day deductible insurance recoveries related to business interruption losses are accounted for as a gain contingency and will not be recorded as income until final payment is made by the company s insurers and the claim is settled which will occur only after the plant is returned to service assuming that cadillac is returned to service and the claim is settled in 2020 the outage should not have a net impact on project adjusted ebitda for the year three months ended december 31 2019 project income loss net income loss and project adjusted ebitda project loss in the fourth quarter of 2019 was 33 4 million as compared to project income of 20 1 million in the year ago period impairment expense in 2019 of 55 0 million accounted for most of the adverse change revenues declined approximately 4 5 million as the impact of the cadillac outage no revenue and reduced operations at williams lake more than offset revenue increases at curtis palmer higher water flows and allendale and dorchester both acquired in the third quarter project income for cadillac was 3 4 million lower than the year ago period on the positive side the san diego projects improved by 3 6 million from the year ago period when the company recorded an increase in its estimate of the asset retirement obligation williams lake allendale and dorchester are in the solid fuel segment curtis palmer is in the hydroelectric segment and the san diego projects are in the natural gas segment net loss attributable to atlantic power corporation in the fourth quarter of 2019 was 65 3 million as compared to net income of 24 7 million in the year ago period impairment expense accounted for 55 0 million of the decrease the 2019 period included a 4 8 million foreign exchange loss whereas the prior period included a 13 7 million foreign exchange gain the foreign exchange loss was related to the revaluation of debt denominated in canadian dollars the canadian dollar appreciated from september 30 2019 to december 31 2019 other adverse factors included a decrease in the fair value of the convertible debenture conversion option and an increase in income tax expense project adjusted ebitda in the fourth quarter of 2019 declined to 42 9 million from 46 6 million in the year ago period cadillac project adjusted ebitda declined 3 8 million which included a 3 4 million impact related to the outage 1 4 million during the 45 day deductible period and 2 0 million of business interruption losses incurred subsequently the company expects to recover the 2 0 million later in 2020 assuming the insurance claim is settled in 2020 williams lake project adjusted ebitda declined 2 4 million due to reduced operations due to low fuel inventory following the expiration of the short term contract in september 2019 in the hydroelectric segment both mamquam and moresby lake experienced modest decreases in project adjusted ebitda on the positive side project adjusted ebitda from curtis palmer increased 1 4 million due to higher water flows generation increased 14 from the fourth quarter of 2018 nipigon project adjusted ebitda increased 1 3 million primarily due to a capacity rate escalation under the ppa the acquisitions of allendale and dorchester and equity interests in craven and grayling contributed 0 7 million and oxnard and frederickson had modest increases in project adjusted ebitda nipigon oxnard and frederickson are in the natural gas segment while craven and grayling are in the solid fuel segment cash flow cash provided by operating activities in the fourth quarter of 2019 was 40 2 million which was in line with the 39 7 million in the year ago period positive variances included receipt of a tax refund that reduced cash taxes versus the prior period and a favorable working capital comparison these were partially offset by lower project adjusted ebitda and a reduction in distributions from unconsolidated affiliates in 2018 orlando received the september distribution in october in 2019 chambers repaid project debt during the quarter and thus the distribution was reduced as compared to 2018 cash provided by investing activities in the fourth quarter of 2019 was 6 3 million as compared to a 0 1 million use of cash in the year ago period the increase was primarily attributable to the receipt of 11 3 million of insurance proceeds related to the cadillac fire partially offset by higher capital expenditures including 5 1 million related to cadillac repairs cash used in financing activities in the fourth quarter of 2019 was 23 7 million a decrease from 27 1 million in the year ago period cash used for common share repurchases declined 2 6 million from the year ago period and project debt repayment was 0 8 million lower year ended december 31 2019 results for project income and net income loss were adversely affected by the impairment expense recorded in 2019 project adjusted ebitda increased from 2018 and was above expectations primarily because of a 27 increase in generation at curtis palmer driven by higher water flows cash provided by operating activities also increased but to a lesser degree than project adjusted ebitda because changes in working capital had a larger positive impact on operating cash flow in 2018 than in 2019 project income net income loss and project adjusted ebitda project income in 2019 was 46 8 million versus 88 2 million in 2018 project revenues declined 0 7 million as increases at curtis palmer allendale and dorchester both acquired in july 2019 and tunis restarted operations in october 2018 were offset by decreases at williams lake short term contract extension and reduced operations the san diego projects shut down in february 2018 cadillac outage following the september 2019 fire and morris tunis and morris are in the natural gas segment the decline in project income was primarily due to the 55 0 million impairment recorded in 2019 an 11 1 million adverse change in the fair value of derivative instruments and the non recurrence of the 6 7 million remeasurement gain on the consolidation of koma kulshan in the hydroelectric segment in 2018 these negative variances were partially offset by lower depreciation expense of 19 2 million mostly at nipigon where the ppa intangible asset was fully amortized in 2018 and the san diego projects and lower operation and maintenance expense of 8 0 million at manchief which had a gas turbine overhaul in 2018 the san diego projects which were shut down in 2018 and tunis which incurred start up expenses in 2018 partially offset by increases related to the acquisition of allendale and dorchester manchief is in the natural gas segment net loss attributable to atlantic power corporation in 2019 was 42 6 million versus net income of 36 8 million in 2018 the adverse change of 79 4 million was the result of the 55 0 million impairment expense and other factors reducing project income as described above an 11 9 million foreign exchange loss versus a 22 8 million foreign exchange gain in 2018 and a 9 6 million increase in income tax expense the foreign exchange loss was related to the revaluation of debt denominated in canadian dollars the canadian dollar appreciated from december 31 2018 to december 31 2019 these negative variances were partially offset by an 8 7 million reduction in interest expense in 2019 due to lower debt balances and a lower rate on the company s credit facilities project adjusted ebitda in 2019 of 196 1 million increased 11 0 million from 185 1 million in 2018 the increase was primarily driven by curtis palmer 11 5 million manchief 7 4 million and tunis 7 1 million for reasons previously described other positive drivers included the acquisitions of allendale and dorchester and equity interests in craven and grayling 2 4 million frederickson 2 1 million due to higher dispatch and lower maintenance expense and modest increases at several other projects these increases were partially offset by decreases at williams lake 9 0 million due to the short term contract extension and reduced operations cadillac 4 0 million mostly due to the 3 4 million impact of the outage following the september 2019 fire chambers 2 4 million due to lower energy and steam demand and lower excess energy pricing mamquam 2 2 million due to lower water flows and oxnard 2 1 million due to an increase in gas prices and higher operating expense cash flow cash provided by operating activities in 2019 of 144 7 million increased 7 2 million from 137 5 million in 2018 the increase was primarily due to the 11 0 million increase in project adjusted ebitda and a 3 7 million reduction in cash interest payments due to lower debt balances and a lower rate on the company s credit facilities these positive variances were partially offset by a 4 8 million adverse impact from changes in working capital and 2 1 million of lower distributions from unconsolidated affiliates cash used in investing activities in 2019 of 21 7 million increased from 17 0 million in 2018 primarily due to the acquisitions of allendale and dorchester and equity interests in craven and grayling in 2019 total 27 3 million net of cash acquired as compared to the acquisition of koma kulshan and a deposit on the biomass plant acquisition in 2018 total 15 4 million capital expenditures increased by 5 5 million primarily for cadillac repairs 5 1 million these increases in use of cash were partially offset by 11 3 million of insurance proceeds received in 2019 related to the cadillac fire cash used in financing activities

196 5 million an increase of 15 3 million from 181 2 million at september 30 2019 this increase was primarily attributable to a 17 6 million increase in cash at the parent to 48 8 million the company considers approximately 42 million to be discretionary cash available for general corporate purposes the higher level of cash at the parent was the result of discretionary cash flow after debt repayment capital expenditures and payment of preferred dividends in the fourth quarter of 2019 parent cash does not include the 11 3 million recovered to date under the company s insurance policies

28 7 million the company also paid a 2 6 million deposit for allendale and dorchester in 2018 for a total investment of 31 3 million 2020 guidance the company has not provided guidance for project income or net income because of the difficulty of making accurate forecasts and projections without unreasonable efforts with respect to certain highly variable components of these comparable gaap metrics including changes in the fair value of derivative instruments and foreign exchange gains or losses these factors which generally do not affect cash flow are not included in project adjusted ebitda the company has initiated guidance for 2020 project adjusted ebitda in the range of 175 million to 190 million which is the same as its initial guidance for 2019 actual 2019 results of 196 1 million exceeded guidance primarily due to strong water flows at curtis palmer generation was 26 above the historical average and the acquisitions of allendale and dorchester and equity interests in craven and grayling guidance for 2020 assumes a return to average water flows for curtis palmer which accounts for most of the anticipated year over year decline in project adjusted ebitda scheduled ppa expirations at oxnard and calstock in may and june of this year respectively and a planned hot gas path inspection at morris also contribute to the decline these negative variances are expected to be partially offset by a full year contribution by the acquired biomass projects and modest increases at several other projects the company s 2020 guidance assumes that cadillac is returned to service later this year and that the company records to revenues and project adjusted ebitda those insurance recoveries related to business interruption table 3 provides a bridge of the company s 2020 project adjusted ebitda guidance to an estimate of 2020 cash provided by operating activities for purposes of providing this bridge to a cash flow measure the impact of changes in working capital is assumed to be nil the decline in 2020 estimated cash provided by operating activities to a range of 100 million to 115 million from the 2019 level of 144 7 million is largely attributable to lower expected project adjusted ebitda the working capital assumption discussed above versus a favorable contribution in 2019 modestly higher project debt repayment at chambers captured in the adjustment for equity method projects and higher decommissioning outlays for the san diego projects majority of the cash outlays occurring in 2020 rather than in 2019 atlantic power corporation table 3 bridge of 2020

operational updates cadillac status the september 2019 fire resulted in extensive damage to the turbine generator and other components in that area of the plant the plant is expected to remain out of service while repairs are completed the company has sourced the necessary replacement equipment and is currently targeting a return of the plant to service in the third quarter of this year williams lake operations the company returned the williams lake plant to operation in mid december which was slightly earlier than planned under the terms of the energy purchase agreement with bc hydro that became effective last october the plant will not operate during the months of may june and july during that period the company expects to undertake significant maintenance including a replacement of the cooling tower which will be expensed the company remains focused on fuel procurement and is currently building supply through a variety of existing and new sources fuel availability remains challenging although fuel costs to date have been in line with the company s expectations considering planned maintenance expenditures and expected run time for the plant the company continues to estimate that project adjusted ebitda in 2020 will be approximately breakeven decommissioning of san diego projects the company recently signed a contract for the demolition of the three project sites in san diego naval station naval training center and north island the work is expected to begin shortly and require approximately six months to be completed the current estimate for the cost of decommissioning these projects is 6 6 million of which 1 5 million has been incurred to date including 1 0 million incurred in 2019 in 2018 and 2019 the company realized a total of 1 8 million of salvage proceeds the cash outlay required in 2020 to complete the work is estimated to be approximately 4 million decommissioning expenditures are not included in project adjusted ebitda maintenance and capex in the fourth quarter of 2019 the company incurred 7 3 million of maintenance expense and 1 5 million of capital expenditures for the full year maintenance expense totaled 23 8 million and capital expenditures totaled 2 3 million these figures exclude the capital expenditures for repairs and replacement of equipment at cadillac of 5 1 million all incurred in the fourth quarter these expenditures are expected to be covered by the company s insurance excluding the deductible for 2020 the company is projecting maintenance expense of 32 8 million and capital expenditures of approximately 4 0 million excluding cadillac higher expected maintenance expense in 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily reflects planned outages at morris and williams lake and the full year impact of the acquired projects all of these figures include the company s proportional share of maintenance expenses and capital expenditures at equity method investments commercial updates 2020 ppa expirations the company has two projects with ppas that are scheduled to expire in 2020 oxnard california the ppa with southern california edison will expire in may 2020 to date the project has not been selected in various solicitations by the utility customer for its resource needs in 2021 and beyond the company is continuing to pursue other potential offtake structures for the project potentially on a short term basis in 2019 oxnard generated a breakeven level of project adjusted ebitda which was 2 1 million lower than in 2018 due to higher gas prices and higher operating expense calstock ontario the ppa with the ontario electricity financial corporation will expire in june 2020 although the company continues to engage with the relevant parties at this time the company does not expect the plant to continue operating past the expiration date of the ppa in 2019 calstock generated 5 2 million of project adjusted ebitda as noted in 2019 the company recorded a long lived asset impairment charge at calstock of 5 8 million which is not included in project adjusted ebitda financial results by project a schedule of project income loss project adjusted ebitda and cash

lending rates in ukraine are several times higher than those in european countries nbu deputy chairman dmytro solohub sat down with unian to tell about the reasons for such pricing by banks the likelihood of cheaper loans and the impact of the coronavirus epidemic on the national economy ukrainian authorities speak of the need to accelerate economic growth with the ambitious goal of rising 40 in five years it is clear that the existing annual gdp growth rate of about 3 is negligible for a tangible improvement in the well being of ukrainian citizens in order for new jobs to emerge in ukraine and wages and social standards to actually increase the pace must be at least twice as high the ukrainian economy needs large scale financial injections to accelerate foreign investors are not in a hurry to invest money in our country due to the investment climate which is not enough favorable therefore the only hope for accelerating growth is bank lending which last year declined in almost all segments except consumer lending how does lending affect the economy suppose a young family has got a mortgage loan to buy an apartment in this case in addition to meeting the needs of the individual family the income will be received and taxes will be paid by the developer and the creditor bank or if an entrepreneur gets a loan to open a coffee shop this will allow them to get income and pay taxes for themselves and their employees if a large company repairs its equipment using credit money it will be able to increase production and revenues and again pay more taxes and so the circle goes видео дня meanwhile there aren t many willing to get loans in ukraine as they are too costly even after a rather significant decrease in rates by banks last year average rates for businesses are about 15 per annum for mortgages about 20 for consumer lending about 33 per annum comparing these rates with those of neighboring european countries ukrainian borrowers overpay on loans three to five times to find out why lending rates in ukraine are still so high if they can decline to an acceptable level and whether there will be any significant impact on the national economy by the global coronavirus epidemic unian spoke with dmitro solohub deputy governor of the national bank of ukraine when will lending rates in ukraine be reduced to the level of european countries is it even possible lending rates depend on the value of the deposits and the margin margin in turn consists of various components including the cost of funding cost of risk to the bank and administrative costs there are two main components deposit rates and cost of risk the deposit rate is always determined by the inflation rate in the country the overall macroeconomic stability for example if there is more than ten percent inflation in the country the deposit rate may not be five percent in eastern europe and the european union deposit rates are very low as inflation is low too the second component is the cost of risk which depends among other things on the state of the judiciary when a bank lends it immediately imposes a certain probability of default due to the many years of the negative experience of unsuccessful recovery of debts from borrowers who would re issue collateral and evade paying off debt the cost of risk remains high in ukraine a normal and effective judicial system is observed in the eu countries and banks understand that if a loan is not repaid by the borrower there is collateral there s court and a bankruptcy proceeding through which the loan can be repaid thus the reduction of credit rates in ukraine depends on the reduction of inflation and the transformation of the judicial system and above all the value of resources is important because without it loans will not fall in price how many years of stably low inflation will it take to cut lending rates significantly we have already stabilized inflation at a low level of around five percent but this is still higher than that of the eu as our economy is growing faster if the economy grows faster it generates higher inflation this is a normal situation ukraine is currently undergoing changes that are already behind in developed european countries with stable low inflation in the next two to four years one can expect a decrease in deposit rates probably up to six seven percent and on loans to a single level the average cost of resources for banks is already unambiguous as apart from retail deposits there are current customer accounts and corporate deposits at which rates are lower the cost of resources will continue to decline when the nbu s discount rate is seven percent and inflation is five percent the rates will obviously be lower than they are now why did the national bank choose a five percent inflation target perhaps to stimulate lending it is necessary to reduce it for example to two percent it is necessary to choose an indicator that corresponds to the situation in the ukrainian economy choose not the level we want but the optimum indicator most countries in the world that have a successful history of declining inflation have reached two to three percent ukraine will follow this path but it is too early to lower the target after the previous goal was only one year old the economy is undergoing structural changes that began in 2015 2016 last year s revaluation of the hryvnia became the first such episode in the history of ukraine economy options are changing these trends need to be analyzed and early steps avoided it is possible to revise the target in the future but i cannot say exactly when it will be if there is low inflation in the world it is clear that in two or three to four years we will reach the target but only if inflation in the country remains at a stable low level and in the presence of normal rates of economic growth at present the target is similar to that in turkey but their actual inflation is much higher in some post soviet countries georgia armenia russia the target is lower the national bank recently announced a new instrument for stimulating lending the interest rate swap what is the essence of this tool and how will it help banks bank deposits generally have a maturity of up to one year while loans have two to three years or more when a bank lends it fixes the rate for several years but deposit rates can change several times during this period therefore banks are exposed to interest rate risk which impedes long term lending an interest rate swap will allow banks to set a rate and avoid interest rate risk bids have been declining so far but this trend may change declining inflation is behind us and we are entering a different period what can be done to encourage customers to place deposits for longer this is a matter of macroeconomic stability confidence in the banking system gradually the terms of deposits are extended but it should be noted that a swap and floating rate are standard market instruments in the world there are also no ten year deposits in other countries they are mainly placed for one to two years can you comment on the situation on the government bonds market where the volume of placement fell significantly and after a long decline the rates increased this is a matter for the ministry of finance but in my opinion this is a normal market situation the market goes through different phases high rates change low and vice versa the market is looking for balance similar processes occur in the foreign exchange market the rate is moving in different directions volumes are changing it is a standard market process driven by supply and demand regarding the pressing isseu the coronavirus the nbu has repeatedly stated that this situation will not have a significant impact on the ukrainian economy but for example there was a statement about the daily loss of russia s economy due to this factor of about a billion rubles as in russia china is our country s largest trading partner how much is our economy losing if we analyze the ukrainian currency market we still do not see any effect there has been a fall in the global financial markets but they have already played down for example the profitability of ukrainian eurobonds has declined again after growth prices for ukrainian imports have declined substantially for example oil has fallen ten percent since the beginning of the year at the same time export prices have declined slightly there is also no effect on demand indicators ukrainian exporters supplying products to china have not reduced their revenue there were some problems with logistics but now they are solved more than half of our exports to china are grain food and meal demand for these products has not decreased either from china or the world market in my opinion this situation had a short term effect there may be some impact in the future but globally we do not see any problems for the ukrainian economy the international monetary fund s mission is currently operating in kyiv what are the expectations of this mission will we finally get a new program or is it an intermediate stage of dialogue this is the usual standard dialogue with the imf all program parameters are clear the previous steps that ukraine is expecting from the fund to announce a new cooperation program are approved by the board of directors we are working in this direction during the visit of the imf mission to kyiv representatives of the fund met with a number of government agencies including the nbu during the meeting with representatives of the fund at the nbu we discussed the usual issues economic growth inflation dynamics monetary policy the state of the banking system there were no new questions in the imf we have no questions at all the national bank pursues monetary policy goals as you know at the technical level an agreement has already been reached on an extended three year funding program ukraine has complied with most of the imf requirements for the new program and work on the steps that have not yet been completed has almost come to an end olha hordienko

article the dow jones industrial average sank nearly 1 200 points thursday deepening a weeklong global market rout caused by worries that the coronavirus outbreak will wreak havoc on the global economy the s p 500 has now plunged 12 from the all time high it set just a week ago that puts the index in what market watchers call a correction which analysts have said was long overdue in this bull market which is the longest in history it was the worst one day drop for the market since 2011 and stocks are now headed for their worst week since october 2008 during the global financial crisis the losses extended a slide in stocks that has wiped out the solid gains major indexes posted early this year investors came into 2020 feeling confident that the federal reserve would keep interest rates at low levels and the u s china trade war posed less of a threat to company profits after the two sides reached a preliminary agreement in january the virus outbreak has upended that rosy scenario as economists lower their expectations for economic growth and companies warn of a hit to their business this is a market that s being driven completely by fear said elaine stokes portfolio manager at loomis sayles with market movements following the classic characteristics of a fear trade stocks are down commodities are down and bonds are up bond prices soared again sending the yield on the 10 year treasury to another record low when yields fall it s a sign that investors are feeling less confident about the strength of the economy going forward more and more companies are warning that the outbreak will hurt their profits microsoft warned that the outbreak had interrupted its supply lines following a similar warning last week from apple crocs also fell sharply after saying its results would be hurt energy stocks fell sharply as the price of oil dropped 3 4 stokes said the swoon reminded her of the market s reaction following the sept 11 2001 terrorist attacks eventually we re going to get to a place where this fear it s something that we get used to living with the same way we got used to living with the threat of living with terrorism she said but right now people don t know how or when we re going to get there and what people do in that situation is to retrench the virus has now infected more than 82 000 people globally and is worrying governments with its rapid spread beyond the epicenter of china japan will close schools nationwide to help control the spread of the new virus saudi arabia banned foreign pilgrims from entering the kingdom to visit islam s holiest sites italy has become the center of the outbreak in europe with the spread threatening the financial and industrial centers of that nation at their heart stock prices rise and fall with the profits that companies make and wall street s expectations for profit growth are sliding away apple and microsoft two of the world s biggest companies have already said their sales this quarter will feel the economic effects of the virus goldman sachs on thursday said earnings for companies in the s p 500 index might not grow at all this year after predicting earlier that they would grow 5 5 strategist david kostin also cut his growth forecast for earnings next year besides a sharply weaker chinese economy in the first quarter of this year he sees lower demand for u s exporters disruptions to supply chains and general uncertainty eating away at earnings growth such cuts are even more impactful now because stocks are already trading at high levels relative to their earnings raising the risk before the virus worries exploded investors had been pushing stocks higher on expectations that strong profit growth was set to resume for companies the s p 500 was recently trading at its most expensive level relative to its expected earnings per share since the dot com bubble was deflating in 2002 according to factset if profit growth doesn t ramp up this year that makes a highly priced stock market even more vulnerable goldman sach s kostin said the s p 500 could fall to 2 900 in the near term which would be a nearly 7 drop from wednesday s close before rebounding to 3 400 by the end of the year traders are growing increasingly certain that the federal reserve will be forced to cut interest rates to protect the economy and soon they re pricing in a nearly two in three probability of a cut at the fed s next meeting in march just a day before they were calling for only a one in three chance according to cme group a handful of companies have managed to gain ground in the latest rout of stocks medical teleconferencing company teladoc surged 15 7 and 3m which counts surgical masks among its many products rose 0 8 the market s sharp drop this week partly reflects increasing fears among many economists that the u s and global economies could take a bigger hit from the coronavirus than they previously thought earlier assumptions that the impact would largely be contained in china and would temporarily disrupt manufacturing supply chains have been overtaken by concerns that as the virus spreads more people in numerous countries will stay home either voluntarily or under quarantine vacations could be canceled restaurant meals skipped and fewer shopping trips taken a global recession is likely if covid 19 becomes a pandemic and the odds of that are uncomfortably high and rising with infections surging in italy and korea said mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics the market rout will also likely weaken americans confidence in the economy analysts say even among those who don t own shares such volatility can worry people about their own companies and job security in addition americans that do own stocks feel less wealthy both of those trends can combine to discourage consumer spending and slow growth market roundup the s p 500 fell 137 63 points or 4 4 to 2 978 76 the dow fell 1 190 95 points or 4 4 to 25 766 64 the

fourth quarters of 2019 and 2018 and the full year 2019 and 2018 moving to slide 3 it s now my pleasure to turn the call over to jeff quinn jeff jeff quinn chairman and chief executive officer thanks brennen good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today before diving into the financials i want to take just a brief moment to reflect on last year on 2019 2019 marked a transformative year for tronox with the close of the cristal acquisition through which we formed the world s largest vertically integrated tio2 producer now with nine pigment plants and eight mineral sands facilities across six continents we operate with an unmatched global footprint that footprint allows us to continue to grow with our customers as they grow anywhere in the world and continue to benefit from our alignment with customers who are growing faster than the overall market the success of our bespoke win win margin stability initiative has enhanced the stability of our topline relative to historic industry patterns this stability is reflected in our global average tio2 selling price which remained essentially level on a sequential basis across 2019 we over delivered on our 2019 synergy target and are increasing our synergy targets for 2020 through 2022 as we discover additional and increased value added opportunities in the new tronox which i ll cover in more detail in a couple of slides we returned approximately 315 million to shareholders in 2019 through share repurchases and our regular dividend and made a 100 million discretionary debt payment we ve maintained a relentless focus on safety and enhanced our commitment to sustainability including the appointment of our chief sustainability officer to manage our esg initiatives of course none of this would be possible without our employees investing in and developing our people is a key focus area of mine to this end we ve renewed our employee development initiatives including improving diversity and inclusion 2019 was an accomplished year at tronox despite a challenging macroeconomic environment we believe we are well situated to create value for our shareholders as we move forward now turning to the next slide i ll walk you through the financial highlights for the year our financial performance in 2019 was driven by strong execution on the many operating and commercial initiatives that were within our control such as delivering synergies through our accelerated acquisition integration program optimizing our global vertically integrated footprint managing our cost structure and wisely allocating capital despite macroeconomic challenges our adjusted ebitda margin remained strong at 23 and we generated free cash flow of 214 million i am happy to report that the synergies from the cristal transaction continue to exceed our targets we achieved total acquisition synergies of 89 million through december exceeding our investor day target by 44 million and our third quarter increased target by 24 million given our outperformance we are increasing our synergy targets once again which i ll review in more detail in a moment global tio2 volumes and average selling price remained relatively stable across 2019 with volumes down 2 and pricing down 5 on an fx adjusted basis owing to the success of our win win commercial margin stability programs we saw a slight pickup in zircon in the fourth quarter due to shipment timing and some restocking in india and china while demand overall remains soft and prices declined in the second half of 2019 this high value co product continues to deliver strong profitability and margin enhancement however the weak back half of the year resulted in us entering 2020 at a lower starting point this and a slight further decline we have experienced in the start of 2020 is reflected in our guidance that tim will discuss in a few minutes we maintain a disciplined approach to capital allocation returning 315 million to shareholders as i mentioned through the share repurchase and our dividend and made the 100 million discretionary debt payment our global team is moving forward in 2020 together as one new tronox we remain focused on execution and delivery of our vertical integration strategy which is creating an enterprise that displays greater stability in financial performance and cash generation throughout the cycle we will continue to manage what we can control achieving the increased synergy targets investing in our business through well conceived well executed high return projects deleveraging the balance sheet and returning capital to the shareholders through an increased dividend we believe 2019 evidenced the capabilities that we have as an organization and we look forward to continue to demonstrate those on a full year basis in 2020 now i d like to turn to slide 5 to discuss the synergies in more detail you ll recall this as the slide we have been using to track our progress since our investor day through the end of the fourth quarter we achieved total synergies of 89 million of which 47 million was actually reflected in our 2019 ebitda slightly over half of this figure is sg a related savings with the balance coming from additional realized feedstock benefits from our integrated footprint and pigment related supply chain benefits 22 million of the achieved synergies will be reflected in ebitda in future quarters this figure reflects feedstock and other money related supply chain synergies achieved and on our balance sheet which we will see in the p l in future quarters and 20 million are other cash synergies not reflected in ebitda consisting of interest and tax savings the increased target for 2019 set during our third quarter earnings call was 65 million which was exceeded by 24 million given our continued strong performance and delivery synergies we are increasing our 2020 target to 190 million our 2021 target to 275 million and our 2022 target to 325 million these new targets represent a significant increase over the targets we originally said on investor day which were increased from the original estimates at the time of the acquisition every day we find additional value creating opportunities in the new tronox and we are excited to continue to go through on these opportunities i ll now turn the call over to john romano our chief commercial officer who will report on our commercial performance and the trends we are seeing in the global markets john john romano chief commercial and strategy officer thanks jeff and good morning moving to slide 6 first the year on year comparison which as brennen said focuses on the pro forma numbers to give you a clear understanding of our commercial performance and the trends in our markets with revenue of 693 million was 5 lower than a year ago tio2 pigment sales of 544 million were 1 lower sales volumes increased 3 while selling prices were 4 lower on a local currency basis on a u s dollar basis selling prices were 5 lower as fx translation primarily in the euro was a 6 million headwind on revenue the sales volume increase reflects the continued strength in north america offset by the completion of destocking in europe and asia inventories across regions across the value chain largely appear to be at normal levels today the reason for the lower year on year average tio2 selling price is once again primarily a prior year issue due to cristal s commercial approach in 2018 and we will see this carry forward to the first quarter as price harmonization was completed in q2 shortly after we closed the acquisition as we ve discussed as you ll see in the sequential comparison our global average selling prices once again have remained essentially stable as they did in each sequential comparison in 2019 moving to zircon sales of 71 million were 34 lower than a year ago sales volumes were 29 lower when compared to q4 2018 which was one of our strongest quarters on record as well as softer market conditions primarily in china with the continued impacts of the trade war environmental regulations and generally slower growth selling prices were 6 lower primarily due to increased competitive activity from lower quality zircon products which had a negative impact on product mix and price however that decline was back end loaded in the third and fourth quarters and has impacted our starting point in 2020 our sales of standard grade zircon products versus premium grade continued to run at a higher rate in q4 and in feedstock and other products sales of 78 million increased 10 on higher cp slag sales now moving to slide 7 for the sequential comparison versus the third quarter revenue of 693 million was down 10 from the prior quarter on lower tio2 and feedstock and other sales volumes partially offset by higher zircon sales tio2 pigment sales of 544 million were 10 lower compared to 603 million sales volumes were 9 lower within the seasonally typical range for q4 and selling prices were 1 lower on a local currency basis and a u s dollar basis moving to zircon sales of 71 million increased 4 from the previous quarter sales volumes were 7 higher due to some restocking in india and china and the timing of zircon shipments from q3 to q4 as we discussed on the last earnings call zircon continues to deliver strong profitability and margin enhancement for tronox we are still forecasting volumes to recover in the second half of the year and the medium to long term fundamentals for zircon remain positive and finally feedstock and other product sales of 78 million decreased 20 driven by lower sales of cp slag and pig iron now moving to the next slide i d like to comment on our outlook for the tio2 market as i ve mentioned previously this last cycle has been the longest demand contraction in my 30 plus years in tio2 we are cautiously optimistic that the contraction is showing signs of a reversal we are seeing early signs of stabilization indicating a general market recovery back in may we introduced a slide outlining the data we track which we believe has served as a good leading indicator of the tio2 market conditions we ve updated the chart which is what you see on this page the bars on this slide represent changes in the trailing three month moving average of total reported imports of tio2 pigment from net importing countries in asia pacific we found that this data set has historically served as a proxy for asia pacific demand and a leading indicator for global tio2 demand using this latest data as you can see we re seeing an uptick in demand which we haven t seen in the last 17 months we are encouraged by the trends we re seeing in both the data and the market including an earlier than normal uptick in demand in europe in q1 we re cautiously optimistic about the current outlook and still believe demand will continue to increase over and above the normal seasonal increase as we approach the second half of the year as we ve mentioned previously given the current supply demand fundamentals of tio2 even a modest rebound in macroeconomic conditions should result in a recovery in tio2 demand and tronox is well positioned to capitalize on recovery given our sales mix is balanced across the world one of the key factors we re currently monitoring is covid 19 and the impact it will have on our sales in both tio2 and zircon at this point it s still too early to determine the full impact of that outbreaks may have on the markets that we serve the short term effects have been modestly positive as we ve seen a slight increase in orders coming in from europe and asia there remains however uncertainty in the medium to long term we will continue to monitor the situation day by day but believe that our global network of assets and our vertically integrated business model we are well positioned to respond to changing market conditions as they develop and with that i ll now turn the call over to jf for a review of our operating performance and profitability for the quarter jf jf turgeon chief operating officer thanks john and good morning everyone moving to slide 9 let s first review the year on year pro forma adjust ebitda comparison adjust ebitda of 156 million was 28 lower than pro forma adjust ebitda of the year ago quarter as john discussed lower tio2 selling price related to legacy cristal commercial approach in 2018 and lower zircon volume were the primary commercial driver additionally we were met with higher production costs including general inflation higher ore costs and normal seasonal maintenance in our integrated operation partially offsetting this factor was favorable foreign exchange on costs primarily the south african rand and the australian dollar in addition synergy contribute an improvement to ebitda of 25 million we are very pleased with the synergy delivery to date as jeff outlined we continue to find additional value add opportunity from the combination driving the increased target we previously mentioned and the benefit are coming from true cost saving grounding opportunity to use feedstock across our network to benefit our operation and realize significant cost savings in our supply chain in 2020 we will continue to realize incremental saving in these area and start to see additional operational synergy such as improving the cost position and quality of our product produced at yanbu utilizing this practice across our operations and reducing costs at legacy cristal plant such as brazil on the last point we are already seeing cost reduction out of brazil this year and are excited about the additional opportunity the team has identified which we will start to realize in the remainder of 2020 delivering the synergy is only one part of our operational excellence program our global team is relentlessly driving to lower our cost per tonne across all our operations increasing product quality optimizing our global footprint and most importantly continually improving our safety performance on our journey to zero as we call this initiative within tronox moving to the sequential comparison adjust ebitda of 156 million decreased 15 from 184 million driven primarily by seasonally normal lower tio2 sales volume lower feedstock and other sales volume and the absence in the fourth quarter of the one off time integrated margins benefit realized in the second and third quarter synergy contribute 10 million to ebitda compared to q3 i am pleased with our fourth quarter result and look forward to what we can deliver in 2020 before turning the call over i would like to discuss the impact covid 19 has had on our operation in china with the acquisition of cristal we had to our footprint the 46 000 tonne sulfate plant in fuzhou in jiangxi province which is over a five hour drive from wuhan where the covid 19 outbreak originate the safety and welfare of our employees has remained our top priority through this uncertain time to that end and in cooperation with the local authority we shut down our operation at fuji for 22 days around the chinese new year holiday this had less than a 2 million impact on our ebitda in addition there has been no impact of covid 19 on our global supply chain to date we have had no case of the outbreak at our site we safely resume operation on february 18 and have been fully operational since february 23 we are grateful to the team in china and their safe management of the plant through this uncertain time we will continue to closely monitor the safety of our employee and work with the local government to ensure the operation of our plant comply with regulation with that i thank you i look forward to continuing to report on our progress in next quarter call and i ll turn the call over to tim carlson for a review of our financial position tim tim carlson chief financial officer thanks jf moving to slide 10 and starting with our balance sheet we ended the year with total debt of 3 billion and net debt of 2 7 billion given our strong free cash flow we made a 100 million discretionary debt repayment on our term loan in december our liquidity was 648 million comprised of cash and cash equivalents and 302 million and 346 million available under revolving credit agreements in addition we ended the year with 9 million of restricted cash our net leverage was four times on a pro forma trailing 12 month basis we continue to target a net leverage ratio of two times to three times which we are targeting to achieve by the end of 2021 consistent with the guidance given at investor day our capital allocation policy remains unchanged we continue to prioritize disciplined capital spending on high return projects and on deleveraging capital expenditures in the fourth quarter were 58 million compared to our depreciation depletion and amortization expense of 75 million in 2019 our cash capital expenditures were 198 million slightly below our guided range of 200 million to 215 million approximately one third of our capital was focused on increasing our ebitda per tonne and the remaining two third was on maintenance esg and other projects our depreciation and amortization expense was 280 million in line with our guided range of 280 million to 290 million both figures are quoted on an as reported basis regarding returning capital to shareowners we returned 315 million in 2019 through the repurchase of approximately 21 5 million shares and our regular dividend payments as jeff mentioned we will be increasing our quarterly dividend by 56 which results in an annual dividend of 0 28 per share reflecting our confidence in the consistently strong cash generation capability of our vertically integrated business model across cycles regarding our 2020 outlook while global macroeconomic conditions remain uncertain and considering the near term softness in the zircon market we remain confident in our ability to deliver the commitments within our control for the full year 2020 we expect to achieve revenue of 3 billion to 3 3 billion adjusted ebitda of 700 million to 800 million adjusted diluted eps at 0 55 to 1 10 free cash flow of over 200 million capital expenditures of 260 million to 290 million and we re targeting our net leverage at three times by the end of 2021 before returning the call back to jeff i d like to take a moment to thank our global finance team for their dedication and efforts to account for and report on the cristal acquisition we re still finalizing our purchase accounting analysis and disclosures and we ll take advantage of the 15 calendar day extension to file our 10 k which will be on or before march 16 with that i d like to turn the call back over to jeff to add additional color to our outlook and key focus areas for 2020 jeff jeff quinn chairman and chief executive officer thanks tim the numbers that tim just walk you through represent our current outlook balancing global macroeconomic uncertainty and near term softness in zircon with the beginning of an uptick in the tio2 sector and our confidence in our ability to deliver our increased synergy targets at the midpoint our guidance range for adjusted ebitda represents a 10 increase over 2019 pro forma results reflecting the macro conditions and market dynamics we face coming out of the back half of 2019 and our expectations for an uptick in the back half of 2020 just as a reminder a 100 a tonne increase in average pigment selling prices has a 20 million to 25 million ebitda impact for quarter and 100 per tonne increase in zircon prices has an approximately 4 million to 5 million ebitda impact in the quarter so there is significant leverage in our system to an improved pricing environment our guidance also reflects an estimated 30 million ebitda impact of the ongoing furnace reline at kzn which will take one of our five furnaces offline for approximately 95 days the financial impact includes the expense of the reline and the fixed cost impact from the feedstock and pigment business advancing this reline to this quarter we ll have a positive effect on the availability of feedstocks in future quarters as feedstocks continue to tighten and pigment prices likely increase our guidance also reflects what we are seeing in terms of cost inflation and the current tight feedstock market while due to our vertical integration the impact of rising feedstocks on us is muted compared to our peers it does have some impact free cash flow of over 200 million reflects our plans to invest 275 million in high return capital projects during the upcoming year through our disciplined capital allocation program consistent with what we ve laid out previously this level of free cash flow will also provide funds for deleveraging which will continue to be a key priority our guidance range factors in the known impacts of covid 19 including the short term shutdown of our fuzhou plant that jf discussed and the near term positive effects john outlined however it does not fully account for the unknown we remain somewhat cautious as we are unable at this time to precisely quantify the potential impacts of this situation on our 2020 results the situation in which we continue to diligently monitor changes daily it really is a case of balancing the potential effects on the micro environment that is the tio2 industry dynamics with any potential macro effects on global gdp however based on what we know at this time we do not see this situation as a significant headwind for the year but in any event as john said we believe our global network of assets and vertically integrated business model positions us to respond quickly and as needed to changing market conditions as they develop clearly economic and global macro uncertainty remain as we have entered 2020 but we believe that the outlook for the tio2 market is strong as we emerge from a prolonged but shallow industry trough we have seen the beginning of an uptick in volumes and believe that historically this has been a precursor to an improving price environment due to our competitive advantage of a vertical integration through a global footprint we are confident that we will continue to outperform our industry peers in terms of ebitda margin and free cash flow generation irrespective of the economic environment we believe 2020 will be a year where we deliver industry leading financial performance take a number of strategic actions to prepare us for the future all while remaining committed to safety and sustainable development with that we d now like to open up the call for your questions kevin questions answers operator our first question comes from frank mitsch fermium research unknown speaker it s susan for frank the first question i had on the synergy increases could you guys just elaborate more and within which areas you guys are seeing those increases jf turgeon chief operating officer look it s basically some of the work that we did last year that will start to generate on the best practice transfer so obviously combining chlorination know how of tronox with legacy cristal there was some trick if i could use that term from operator of one business that had to be transferred to the operator of the other business and those takes time and obviously the synergy on supply chain the synergy on moving our additional feedstock to the new asset that we quickly react and we will continue to get more out of those quick reaction but the best practice transfer is really where we will start to eat the advantage this year tim carlson chief financial officer it s tim and to follow on that when we made our targets for synergies we actually risk adjusted them and as we get into the activities we re more and more comfortable in terms of where we re ending up in terms of cost reductions across the system whether it be sg a and operations in very very little on volume unknown speaker great and then as a follow up i know you guys touched on the early supply demand the impact you guys are seeing from a coronavirus but could you guys just elaborate a bit more on industry supply tightening in the region and what you guys are seeing on the demand side as well john romano chief commercial and strategy officer yes this is john romano so from the standpoint of supply demand and inventory as i mentioned earlier inventory we believe is where it should be for this time of year so i d say at seasonal norms and the uptick that we talked about as a result of covid 19 was just a short term impact we saw volumes picking up as we entered the first quarter at least a month before covid actually took hold so what we re seeing is an effect as i mentioned on slide i think it was slide no 8 where we saw the recovery from a 17 month downturn we re starting to see a good indicator that demand has returned and supply demand is in a position where as jeff mentioned we re likely to start working toward looking at upsides on pricing as we enter this second half of the year jeff quinn chairman and chief executive officer but clearly from what we ve seen from customer inquiries and just anecdotally from storage on the ground this has impacted chinese supply unknown speaker got it thanks you guys operator our next question comes from duffy fischer with barclays duffy fischer barclays analyst good morning fellows first i got this done on zircon because it s the market at least i don t spend as much time on is tio2 so volume down big prices hung in well like on like so can you talk about when you look at your footprint because you talked about mix shift being a little bit negative but just like on like how much are prices down from the peak of the last couple of years and then if you did like a 10 year look back where are prices for your products today versus maybe a normalized number in the last 10 years john romano chief commercial and strategy officer if you look at the last 10 years includes a spike which is not i would say something that will be duplicated prices were in the 2 400 range so the 6 down is really from about where we peaked somewhere in the 50 and 60 range and when we look at how we re moving into the first quarter of 2020 the guidance we provided had some additional price erosion factored into the first quarter so from a demand perspective first half and second half were going to be kind of flipped from where it was last year so it s kind of a tale of two years where the first year continue to be a bit slower and as we move into the second half of the year we re planning for a recovery duffy fischer barclays analyst ok and then if you hit the midpoint of your capex this year the 275 million roughly how would that break down just regular maintenance versus efficiency projects versus kind of true growth in volume tim carlson chief financial officer hey duffy it s tim of the 275 million our maintenance and safety capital ranges anywhere from 100 million to 125 million we ve got capital in the plan for continuing cost reduction in terms of driving the ebitda per tonne and then we ve got some additional capital in our plan from mine extension that we ll be doing in australia associated with leveraging our vertical integration benefits duffy fischer barclays analyst great thank you guys operator our next question comes from john mcnulty with bmo capital markets john mcnulty bmo capital markets analyst good morning thanks for taking my question so with regard to the what looks like an early uptick in the supply demand balance i guess like what are you seeing in terms of demand for some of the margin stability initiatives that you ve put out there have you seen a notable increase yet in customers looking to lock in or is that something that s maybe more on the comp john romano chief commercial and strategy officer yes jeff this is john romano so from margin stability again it played a significant role i think in our profitability in the last 18 months and with regards to customers interest in that program it continues to accelerate and when we think about across segments regions it s not just north america where we re getting traction on that it s also in the other regions of the world including paper plastic and coatings john mcnulty bmo capital markets analyst got it and then with regard to the free cash flow guidance so the 200 million that you re or the 200 million plus that you re looking for in 2020 so assuming that you can hit that even at the bottom of your range i guess in terms of ebitda range if you come in at the high end is it as simple as you re going to come in closer to 300 million number or are there levers that you re pulling in that kind of downside scenario that you wouldn t necessarily pull as you re looking toward the higher end of that range like how should we think about the cash flow variance tim carlson chief financial officer hey john it s tim excellent question there are a couple of levers that we can pull but you re spot on in terms of we come in the higher end of the range we ll have a direct impact in terms of increase in our free cash flow we continue to work our balance sheet in terms of optimizing working capital we do have a 50 million to 70 million working capital burn in that cash flow forecast we hope to minimize that but at the same point in time if there are opportunities where we see incremental spend that we can do to increase ebitda per tonne by taking costs out of assistant we may increase a little bit of capital spend in that regard john mcnulty bmo capital markets analyst great thanks very much for the color thanks jeff operator our next question comes from jim sheehan with suntrust robinson pete osterland suntrust robinson humphrey analyst good morning this is pete osterland on for jim can you comment on the pricing environment for titanium based ores and the magnitude of cost inflation you expect in 2020 for the ores that you do not jf turgeon chief operating officer so pete it s jf we are in 2020 75 vertically integrated so we think that we re the best position versus our competitor for digesting those price increase look if you look at different product that we use in our pigment plant rutile is the one that has increased the most and it s more than a double digit increase that we have experienced on price of rutile because look it s a product that is in high demand and it s rare i mean there is not that much available in the world flag and fr is also very tight as a market and we have seen significant price increase in that front and even ilmenite as recently as what we have seen out of china the ilmenite price has jumped because of the covid 19 and look it s obviously positive for the whole tio2 side of the business because margin specifically in china are very tight and as soon as their feedstock increase tio2 has to increase to match those so that would be my comment on feedstock pete osterland suntrust robinson humphrey analyst and then you spoke about deleveraging as a priority but given where shares are currently valued would you consider share repurchases as well as the use of cash during 2020 jeff quinn chairman and chief executive officer yes i mean jim we always allocate sort of between those three priorities we ve talked about but deleveraging remains first and foremost among those so we will look aggressively at that and then the high return projects we have and then maybe look at share repurchases but i would think that in those priorities are sort of in that relative order tim carlson chief financial officer and jim it s tim as a follow on we do have some limitations on share repurchase as a result of our nol limitations operator our next question comes from jeff zekauskas with jp morgan jeff zekauskas j p morgan analyst thanks very much since you are a titanium dioxide producer in china are your prices going up already given the raw material inflation do you want to sell to the domestic market do you want to sell to the export market how do you see the world from the point of view of your china operation john romano chief commercial and strategy officer hi jeff it s john so on both those questions as far as how we re going to sell and how we ve been looking at selling the chinese material out of our plant in fuzhou we ve been looking at optimizing that margin whether we sell in china or maybe take some of that product and move it to higher margin areas with respect to pricing in china we have seen prices move up and that was before covid 19 actually took hold so we started raising that price in china early in january and have gone through an implementation process so we re seeing pricing move now to jf s point a few minutes ago this whole panzhihua feedstock supply constraint is having a significant impact on company s ability to actually procure or at a price that s not inflated significantly and with lower percentages of tio2 by two tonnes to get a tonne of pigment so for a variety of reasons i think we re optimistic around where pricing is going for china jeff zekauskas j p morgan analyst ok and then for my follow up on slide 9 you have your ebitda bridges and on the left hand part of the slide you indicated that there were 45 million in higher production costs year over year i was wondering why that was the case and then on the right hand side of the slide it says there was an absence of integration margin benefit of 20 million sequentially in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter and i was wondering what that was can you clarify those two red downward bars jeff quinn chairman and chief executive officer sure jf jf turgeon chief operating officer jeff i will start you have to realize that in q4 18 the business was owned by someone who was about to sell the business and i d say that in legacy cristal plant maintenance was not at the level that it should have been and q4 is always the quarter where we try to do more maintenance and put the asset in a good condition to operate as we took control q4 was the quarter where we had time to assess what needed to be done and we probably did a little bit more than less on that front and that s obviously come at a cost and that s an increase in cost and that s i d say one of the important component tim you want to add tim carlson chief financial officer jeff as it relates to the absence of the integration margin benefits just as a reminder in q3 q4 of 2018 we made a decision to stop selling feedstocks to the open market and as a result of putting that feedstock on our balance sheet and not selling into the open market all of the profit in our south african operation our australian feedstock operations that we would normally have realized by selling the procured product third parties when we sold it internally to our pigment plants we actually had to capture that incremental profit on our balance sheet and we put about 40 million to 50 million of profit on our balance sheet in q4 and q1 and you ll probably remember if you look back at those calls it was actually quite a bit of headwind and then we realized in q2 and q3 of this year as we manufacture the pigment and sold the pigment with that ore in it we realized the profit from that product and as a result it s really just a shift of timing of margin benefit from q4 q1 to q2 and q3 jeff quinn chairman and chief executive officer that s both ends of a onetime thing that we shouldn t see as we go forward jeff zekauskas j p morgan analyst so if i understand what you said to me just now your inventory costs in the fourth quarter were higher than they were in the third quarter tim carlson chief financial officer no not exactly jeff what happened was all of the profit that we would normally have realized in q4 and q1 of last year as a result of selling to third parties we sold internally so that profit actually went on to the balance sheet and that low cost inventory flowed through just from a timing standpoint from q4 q1 into q2 and q3 so as jeff mentioned it was pretty just a onetime benefit and the shift to profit between those four quarters jeff zekauskas j p morgan analyst ok great thank you so much operator next question comes from vincent andrews with morgan stanley steve haynes morgan stanley analyst this is actually steve haynes for vincent just wanted to ask a question on zircon can you help us think about how much ebitda was actually generated from zircon in 2019 and what s kind of assumed at the high end and the low end of your guidance in 2020 tim carlson chief financial officer so we haven t disclosed publicly ebitda from zircon but zircon does generate higher contribution margins than tio2 north of 50 so any degradation in terms of zircon volume does have a significant impact on our overall ebitda steve haynes morgan stanley analyst ok and then maybe just a quick follow up on the working capital because i thought and maybe i misheard that you guys are going to have a headwind in 2020 but it looks like there is a pretty significant tailwind in 2019 so was there a timing benefit in 2019 that s reversing in 2020 or could you just help us bridge the two pieces tim carlson chief financial officer yes it s really a mix of working capital the team did a phenomenal job in the fourth quarter as it relates to dso and dpo where we re getting hurt a bit in 2020 is around the inventory levels inventory levels are building a bit just given the recovery that john talked about we see them reversing and declining again in q3 and q4 but obviously any acceleration in terms of that recovery would reduce our inventory balances and drive significantly more free cash jeff quinn chairman and chief executive officer it s normal for us to build inventory in q1 and q4 operator next question comes from josh spector with ubs unknown speaker this is you mentioned you re seeing early uptick in demand in europe can you just provide a little bit more color what end markets you re seeing this uptick and specifically which markets are the strongest and then you also talked about back integration can you just remind us when your feedstock contracts roll off jeff quinn chairman and chief executive officer yes so on the uptick in europe i d say it s largely across all segments it s not focused in one particular area and as we exited the in 2019 we had started to see the effects of the destocking being complete and the order book started to improve moving into january and so we ve got pretty good visibility as i mentioned before our order book is a good indicator on what we re seeing and the numbers that we re looking at right now that go out past the first quarter would support this uptick that we re referring to most of that is not on the back of covid 19 jf turgeon chief operating officer and matt on the back integration we still have contracts that we have to honor in 2020 but by 2021 will be out of all our commitment unknown speaker that s helpful thank you so much operator our next question comes from roger spitz with bank of america roger spitz bank of america merrill lynch analyst thanks very much would you be interested in giving the ebitda guidance for the first quarter of 20 jf turgeon chief operating officer no roger i don t think that s something that we re prepared to do i think we have a lot of moving dynamics in the marketplace right now and as we ve said we re cautiously optimistic about what we see as what we believe is an uptick and then we have obviously offsetting that the one time issue with the furnace reline at kzn so we look at this business over a longer term longer periods and really don t think it s appropriate to start separating into quarter roger spitz bank of america merrill lynch analyst that s fine and can you say what the cash expenses to obtain this 2020 synergies that are not in capex that are instead otherwise in your free cash flow guidance tim carlson chief financial officer it s going to be minimal 5 million or 6 million roger spitz bank of america merrill lynch analyst ok the chinese tile industry is back to work or they can t get to work because of coronavirus can you comment on the demand on chinese john romano chief commercial and strategy officer yes so look the majority i would say of our customers and again there our customers customers are starting the process back up as j f mentioned our plant is now back up and running since the 22nd or 23rd of this month so we re starting to see that process of restarting plants but they re not all up and running at this particular stage but again as we look at our sales of zircon in the first quarter q3 to q4 19 we were up 7 and we re seeing numbers that are very similar to that in q1 not up 7 but in line with q4 roger spitz bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it thank you very much operator our next question comes from brian lalli with barclays brian lalli barclays analyst maybe first just on a housekeeping item on the ebitda outlook and synergies i just want to make sure we re thinking about this correctly on a year over year basis and correct me if i m wrong on any of this but if i take the 681 million of pro forma ebitda and then you add the 22 million of basically future savings that were realized and enacted in 2019 is that a right starting point that we would then have the 100 million improvement on from a synergy basis i appreciate that maybe that 190 million doesn t have all of it in the ebitda number specifically and again i know there are a lot of pieces moving around furnace relines zircon pricing would love to maybe summarize some of the key puts and takes on the 700 million to 800 million outlook if that s possible and then i have a follow up thanks tim carlson chief financial officer hey brian it s tim the components of the ebitda in 2019 we had 47 million that hit our ebitda line we had another 22 million associated with synergies in our pigment plants in our mineral sands operations that capitalized to inventory and the remaining 20 million in interest and taxes and some miscellaneous items that 22 million in the synergies we realize in our pigment plants in our mineral sands operations they roll into the p l and the pigment plants in two to three months and they rolled through mineral sands in the pigment plants in a matter of probably five or six months so there is always going to be a component as we flow through the year that s going to be onto the balance sheet in terms of incremental synergies but i would expect that 22 to decline a tad in 2020 then increase again in 21 as we ramp some additional synergy items on the bottom of that page we ve actually tried to identify for the investors the amount of ebitda that we re actually expecting to achieve in our calendar year for the p l and you can see that s 140 million in 2020 brian lalli barclays analyst got it i appreciate that i actually missed the bottom line so i apologize and then tim maybe just as a follow up again i appreciate the comments around priorities for capital allocation and continued debt repayment is it fair are you still thinking about the 2 5 billion gross debt as the target so basically another 500 million of debt reduction sort of in front of us over the next two years given the 21 target is that the right way to think about it tim carlson chief financial officer absolutely brian brian lalli barclays analyst ok great i appreciate the confirmation thanks guys operator thank you our next question comes from jeff zekauskas with jpmorgan jeff zekauskas j p morgan analyst thanks very much you may have answered this in 2020 when you extract an incremental i don t know 90 million in cost savings or 100 million on a run rate basis how much will that cost you and how much will it cost you incrementally versus in 2019 i mean what are the cash outlays that s what i mean by cost tim carlson chief financial officer the cash outlays as it relates to sg a and some of the miscellaneous synergies will be pretty much flat year on year and the capital needed to achieve those synergies are within the 275 million that we ve outlined jeff zekauskas j p morgan analyst right and so how much capital will be spent on that in 2020 tim carlson chief financial officer my guess jf correct me if i m wrong of the 275 million maybe 15 million to 20 million jeff zekauskas j p morgan analyst it s a good number jeff quinn chairman and chief executive officer yes and what happens jeff obviously a lot of the sg a synergies you re able to deliver early have cash cost but some of the things in best practices and some of those things that we re now starting to see impact really don t have a significant cash cost but you start to get more and more benefit from those as you move forward jeff zekauskas j p morgan analyst ok and then lastly are you seeing any new china chloride based tio2 coming into the global markets jeff quinn chairman and chief executive officer there s been nothing more than what has already been announced i mean obviously there is companies that are continuing to work on perfecting that technology including lomon but there s been no significant announcements in china recently jeff zekauskas j p morgan analyst do you feel it in the market that is is it being shipped at higher rates in the market jeff quinn chairman and chief executive officer no quite honestly we don t operator and i m not showing any further questions at this time i d like to turn the call back to jeff quinn for closing remarks jeff quinn chairman and chief executive officer thank you well i just want to thank you for your time today we are optimistic on the outlook for the tio2 sector as we move forward we continue to focus on execution of the things that we can control and we continue to be very focused on delivering industry leading financial performance irrespective of whatever the macro economic conditions we face so thank you very much and we look forward to talking to you on our first quarter call in a few months operator duration 57

valle as we started doing in 2019 we will double down on operational excellence and focus on markets products and solutions that will yield higher margins across our key verticals in 2020 as initiated in 2019 the company continues to work to control costs optimize its working capital management and steer a disciplined capital allocation policy outlook for 2020 recent developments related to the coronavirus outbreak have significantly increased uncertainty around economic growth that could negatively impact some of our key markets assuming no major disruption in the global economy the company

its efforts to drive operational excellence and deliver superior operational and financial performance consolidated financial information revenues in q4 2019 revenues totaled 1 6 billion down 53

2018 we registered the full annual effect of the mark to market valuation of the put option granted to netafim s minority shareholders in connection with the netafim acquisition while in 2019 the effect was recorded on a quarterly basis in 2019 overall costs increased 12 million or 4 as compared to 2018 the increase was mainly due to the adoption of ifrs 16 which impacted net interest expenses as well as higher bank commissions related to the renewal of orbia s 1 5 billion revolving credit facility and netafim s refinancing of its bank loan these increased costs were partially offset by a decrease in foreign exchange losses taxes in q4 2019 income tax charges were 62 million as compared to 5 million in q4 2018 resulting in an effective tax rate of 68 driven by the appreciation of the mexican peso over the us dollar and due to higher fiscal profits generated by inflation in mexico in 2019 overall income tax charges amounted to 206 million as compared to 195 million in 2018 this resulted in an effective tax rate of 39 driven by the appreciation of the mexican peso over the us dollar as well as by the repatriation of dividends as cited in the q3 2019 report consolidated net majority income loss net majority income in q4 2019 decreased 34 million as compared to a 32 million decrease in q4 2018 yielding a 2 million loss mainly affected by the one time effects and the

yves here i suspect a lot of uk readers will be more inclined to argue like richard north that johnson is moving the uk towards a a singapore on the thames or what richard murphy calls the freeports model which leave the hollowed out former industrial areas in even more desperate shape this was murphy s take nothing i have yet seen so starkly states what brexit is all about for johnson the first objective of brexit is to place greater controls on labour the intention is to ensure that by controlling free movement labour itself can be controlled and so too can its price be kept at rates the government would desire and that is low of course and his second objective is to create freeports he will claim that these are all about creating regulation free hubs for enterprise this is completely untrue there is no evidence that regulation free ports have ever generated work wealth much employment or free market enterprise come to that this is unsurprising that is not what freeports are about at all freeports are instead about permitting the free movement of capital beyond the control of the state and without the imposition of any taxes quite bizarrely given that freeports are effectively declared to be outside the country that creates them one of the major objectives johnson has for brexit is to carve whole chunks of the uk out of the control he claims to have just taken back and to pass it over to the free loaders who frequent freeports to understand how freeports really work i suggest watching this video i know it s not in english but it s good and explains how the geneva freeport works to handle diamonds gold armaments fine art and rare wines all beyond the control of authorities and all beyond the reach of tax the aim of freeports is to undermine the state it achieves this by suspending the law freeports permit illicit activity they permit wealth to be accumulated in secret that wealth is beyond the reach of tax research suggests that much of that wealth is also shielded by anonymous offshore shell companies that disguise the ownership of an asset even if it can be located the object is to ensure wealth can accumulate without constraint this is the paradox that johnson revealed in his video he wants to control and constrain people he will use that power to oppress not just those who want to come to the uk but also of course those who wish to leave the uk as well the market in labour will be constrained people will suffer as a result at the same time the market in illicit wealth will be liberated to traffic at will the cost will be to us all in lost tax revenue increased inequality and the undermining of the rule of law additional jobs will be few and far between and let s not for a moment pretend that any freeport activity supports markets creating ring fences always creates unlevel playing fields that will always by definition and in practice undermine effective markets so there is nothing in this policy that is about wealth creation it is all about wealth expropriation and extraction this is what brexit was for and johnson admitted it last night one day people will realise in addition readers liked this minority reading at consortium news on the labour general election wipeout which contended that labour s share of the vote wasn t shabby but it got killed on seats due to the rise of the snp and not losses to tories the subhead is post election commentary speaks of corbyn s party achieving its worst result since 1935 alexander mercouris shows why that is a serious misrepresentation by marshall auerback a market analyst and commentator produced by economy for all a project of the independent media institute call him an upper class etonian twit if you like but the reality is that boris johnson not donald trump might be the 21st century s first genuine blue collar conservative since becoming prime minister johnson has represented a profound break from the prevailing market fundamentalist ideology of the past 40 years in terms of both his rhetoric and more importantly his actions his policies evoke a 1970s style economic corporatism much derided by margaret thatcher or in more historic terms a reversion to a kinder gentler form of one nation conservatism in the words of uk born u s residing pundit andrew sullivan the core of johnson s ideology is an appeal to the working poor and aspiring middle classes tough on immigration and crime but much more generous in spending on hospitals and schools and science is it for real recall that this was also the promised policy formula that helped elect donald trump president in 2016 but which he hasn t implemented while in office by contrast johnson s actions suggest a more serious intent which could have long lasting consequences for british politics and beyond the center left of europe and the u s ignores this phenomenon at its collective peril to caricature johnson as a british trump is a lazy narrative that grossly mischaracterizes what he has done already during his comparatively short tenure leading the united kingdom when donald trump first entered the white house his then chief domestic policy adviser steve bannon pushed the president to raise taxes on the wealthy and embark on a big program of infrastructure reconstruction to consolidate his political gains with white working class voters who provided him with his margin of victory in 2016 of course we now know that trump rejected this advice as the president hewed instead to paul ryan s austerity politics attacking existing health care plans and government social welfare programs all the while promoting corporate tax reform where the benefits skewed heavily toward the top tier similarly on infrastructure trump has done nothing and so far as immigration policy goes his signature proposal to build a wall has been a case of sound and fury signifying nothing trump and the gop accordingly paid the price in the midterm elections of 2018 one of the biggest congressional wipeouts over the past half century perhaps johnson is mindful of this in his victory speech he acknowledged that voters in the traditional labor heartlands merely lent their votes to him and that more needed to be done to consolidate their long term support with that in mind he has already backed off his party s original plan to cut corporate taxes by 2 percent so that his government could spend more on voters priorities including the state funded national health service on health care johnson s conservative party is farther to the left of most of the democrats now running for president other than bernie sanders let alone trump and the gop on infrastructure johnson has greenlit approval for the construction of a high speed train line to the midlands and northern england a 130 billion venture that many have derided as a wasteful money pit but which the pm views as a crucial means of regenerating these depressed regions outside the home counties as a transport concept the high speed 2 hs2 benefits might be marginal huge expenditure and big dividends to builders in reality light rail is all the uk probably needs but the proposal was symbolically important of course and the amounts approved represent something well beyond tokenism as the project constitutes one of the largest infrastructure spends of its kind anywhere in the world at the same time johnson has been able to culturally connect with voters in the post industrial midlands and northern england who wanted nothing to do with labor s woke identity politics historic indifference to their deep often unstated misgivings about where the country and its culture were going was often dismissed as racism much as hillary clinton derided a large chunk of trump supporters in 2016 as a rel nofollow basket of deplorables even on immigration where we see echoes of trump and the charges of racism have become most pronounced it should be acknowledged that johnson s prioritization of a skills based immigration policy is not inherently restrictionist in fact both canada and australia the models for his new immigration policy have high net immigration rates unlike margaret thatcher or ronald reagan the new british pm s goal is not to roll back the frontiers of the state but rather to use it to mitigate inequality by enhancing middle and working class wage growth arrest the stagnation of dying communities and above all else reassert the primacy of the nation state as the central organizing foundation for society as opposed to subsuming it into a larger supranational political grouping in johnson s vision the state labor and business would all play major roles in the promotion of national economic development as well as restoring the social contract long shredded by economic neoliberalism on the left and radical free market libertarianism on the right of course a range of powerful trend lines are working against this model the scale of challenge to make necessary advances in scientific and medical research to sustain a human population in the billions requires international collaboration the tidal wave of merged investors and industry continues at a rapid clip and the globalized telecommunication process is homogenizing culture and taste across the planet in fiscal policy terms johnson s rejection of the treasury s prevailing austerity bias has been particularly noteworthy the former chancellor sajid javid had repeatedly insisted that the uk should run a balanced budget by 2023 the maintenance of which would have severely hampered the johnson administration s ability to offset potential trade shocks emerging from a more restrictive trade relationship with the eu as well as mitigating the government s ability to embrace a robust national industrial policy post brexit the resultant clash was brought to a head when johnson forced out his chancellor by issuing an ultimatum to javid to fire all his advisers a condition that the chancellor later said no self respecting minister would accept the clipping of the treasury s wings and the corresponding resignation of britain s chancellor of the exchequer has been caricatured by johnson s opponents in both parliament and the press as the actions of an insecure power hungry prime minister seeking to centralize power but in reality the move represents a long overdue move to cut down the treasury s stranglehold over the totality of economic policy relative to other government departments and paves the way for an expansionary post brexit budget it is true that government spending under donald trump has not been marked by deficit fetishism but unlike trump much of boris johnson s anticipated spending bonanza is largely being directed toward the working and middle classes as opposed to society s top tier by and large johnson s policy reflects the embrace of a national industrial policy that collides with the prevailing neoliberal notion that the government should be nothing but a neutral umpire delegating all entrepreneurial activity and innovation to the private sector that is an idea akin to holy writ in brussels the problem with this view as i have written before is that it arbitrarily restricts the range of fiscal activity that can be undertaken for broader public purpose when governments occasionally find a way to redistribute the benefits of to the broader population whether via a minimum wage tighter regulation state intervention or similar policy these measures are invariably castigated as wrongheaded inevitably leading to less efficiency sub optimal growth and lower standards of living the johnson government s prioritization of redistributing fiscal resources to the country s poorer northern regions runs in the face of these neoliberal shibboleths the regions on which he is focusing have long been the losers of globalization at the expense of london and the southern home counties which boomed as communities in the rest of the country began to wither away johnson s measures also send profoundly important political signals they are designed to build on his recent political success where he breached labor s red wall the party s traditional working class base in the manufacturing and mining districts of northern england which largely supported brexit and turned to the tories during the december election for the first time in decades johnson s political endgame is to ensure that these newly acquired working class constituencies are converted to long term electoral strongholds for the tories the consequences of that kind of electoral success could have long lasting implications with his policy actions so far the british pm is appealing to a mass of working class constituencies long alienated by successive governments both tory and labor that prioritized the european union s technocratic market fundamentalism to put it in u s terms the equivalent would be the republicans converting the midwest into a permanent gop regional stronghold which would almost certainly relegate the democrats to perpetual minority party status in the meantime the opposition labor party experienced its worst result since 1935 and more recently lost a municipal by election in northeast england where a 20 year old tory candidate decisively took almost 50 percent of all votes cast on the immigration policy front the new conservative government has introduced a new policy that prioritizes skill largely modeled after the australian and canadian points based systems whereby a non resident who is able to score above a threshold number of points in a scoring system that might include such factors as education level income skills in high demand language fluency existing job offer etc is given priority for immigration this policy too has predictably engendered charges of the tories pandering to racists what has many critics up in arms is that among the essential criteria is being able to speak english even though proficiency in a country s native tongue helps to engender more social cohesion less cultural alienation easier links to studies and other such benefits it should also be noted that language requirements are not unique to the uk canada likewise prioritizes fluency in its two official languages english and french other provisions of the new immigration law include having a job offer to qualify for entry and being above a designated skills threshold again there is nothing particularly novel about these features virtually all eu countries demand economic self sufficiency as a prerequisite to the free movement of people nor is a points system that prioritizes skilled labor inherently restrictive to mitigate short term disruption to businesses the new proposed legislation does provide alternative social safety valves retaining existing youth mobility schemes and family reunification from the existing immigration laws finally even though the law might create short term disruption for service industries notably in food and beverage as they wean themselves off cheap sources of external labor there are long term benefits to the proposed new policy as the telegraph s matthew lynn notes in truth curbing low skilled immigration can change the economy for the better why because it will force the economy into higher productivity higher wage industries just take a look at the evidence from the places where it has been tried according to oecd data each of the main countries with a points system has done significantly better than the uk at increasing output per worker taking 2010 as 100 gdp per worker has risen to 110 in australia to 107 in canada and 103 in new zealand but only to 102 in britain the oecd average is 106 our output person has barely grown over the past 10 years it will also revalue these service jobs as a smaller labor pool makes those job openings harder to fill a skills based system also changes the migration pattern from the same regions we are seeing evidence of this in the u s as professor michael lind highlights in his new book the new class war saving democracy from the managerial elite lind notes for example that an increasing number of south americans in the u s are educated professionals world bank officials from uruguay etc and in neither the u s nor europe is there a backlash against indian doctors or chinese engineers except in the case of h1bs but that is a matter of labor exploitation as matt taibbi highlighted in a recent rolling stone piece boris versus eu what about the big elephant in the room namely brexit and the uk s future trading relationship with the eu boris johnson s domestic political jiujitsu has understandably discombobulated his negotiating interlocutors in the eu which likely means a much more contentious negotiation about the evolution of the post brexit relationship between the uk and eu hints of the challenges lurking became evident when boris johnson s chief brexit negotiator david frost warned brussels that the uk would not under any circumstances sign up to eu rules in a trade deal with brussels which circumscribed the former s sovereignty and enforced the eu s regulatory and legal framework via the european court of justice to be sure these are but the opening shots in what is likely to be a difficult negotiation but in contrast to the previous administration of former prime minister theresa may johnson s government is reversing the government s priorities national sovereignty over the maintenance of frictionless trade rather than the opposite the reality is that johnson s nationalism represents a vision that is ultimately irreconcilable with that of brussels a fact that the eu is only beginning to grasp as it establishes its negotiating brief brexit was never an end in itself but a means to a very different sort of destination for the uk as such not only is the uk a regulatory rival of the eu but also in a broader sense it presents an ideological challenge to much of the prevailing framework that has dominated policymaking globally for over half a century but which is likely ending johnson will succeed if he can re establish a social contract among business labor and government constituents a modern day tripartism that replaces today s incipient caste system characterized by a steadily growing underclass often foreign born in menial dead end personal service jobs rather than simply deriding him the left would do well to pay heed failure to do so could have catastrophic consequences for them

effect of reducing reserves which in turn reduces asset values other charges included exploration related write downs and asset de recognition at the lima refinery associated with redundant equipment

information unless otherwise indicated i reserves estimates have been prepared by internal qualified reserves evaluators in accordance with the canadian oil and gas evaluation handbook have an effective date of december 31 2019 and represent the company s working interest share ii projected and historical production volumes provided are gross which represents the total or the company s working interest share as applicable before deduction of royalties and iii all husky working interest production volumes quoted are before deduction of royalties the company uses the term barrels of oil equivalent or boe which is consistent with other oil and gas companies disclosures and is calculated on an energy equivalence basis applicable at the burner tip whereby one barrel of crude oil is equivalent to six thousand cubic feet of natural gas the term boe is used to express the sum of the total company products in one unit that can be used for comparisons readers are cautioned that the term boe may be misleading particularly if used in isolation this measure is used for consistency with other oil and gas companies and does not represent value equivalency at the wellhead the

which is consistent with other oil and gas companies disclosures the company s proved reserves life index for a given period is determined by taking the company s total proved reserves at the end of that period divided by the company s upstream gross production for the same period readers are cautioned that the term proved reserves life index may be misleading particularly if used in isolation this measure is used for consistency with other oil and gas companies and does not reflect the actual life of the reserves the company uses the term reserves replacement ratio which is consistent with other oil and gas companies disclosures reserves replacement ratios for a given period are determined by taking the company s incremental proved reserve additions for that period divided by the company s upstream gross production for the same period the reserves replacement ratio measures the amount of reserves added to a company s reserves base during a given period relative to the amount of oil and gas produced during that same period a company s reserves replacement ratio must be at least 100 percent for the company to maintain its reserves the reserves replacement ratio only measures the amount of reserves added to a company s reserves base during a given period reserves replacement ratios presented as excluding economic factors exclude the impact that changing oil and

printed a chart showing the federal deficit peaking two or three years out but then declining budget after budget the projected decline remained tantalizingly in the out years eventually after the mirage never did materialize the government stopped printing the chart advertisement 4 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content at the time of the 1993 election interest payments on the debt were running at 65 3 billion in 2019 dollars that translated to fully one third of federal revenues one of every three dollars of federal revenue was going to pay interest rather than to buy the goods services or income support that canadians regarded as the proper function of government this shortfall led to another kind of crisis of confidence in government because few canadians perceived any benefit from interest payments on the national debt the tax cost of those public services that were being delivered seemed one third higher than it should have been ten months after that stornoway dinner in november 1993 the liberals were elected on one of the most detailed platforms a canadian political party had ever published their famous red book its purpose was to persuade voters the party was ready for power as had not been the case in 1988 when after a surge in support following the great free trade leaders debate of that year it became clear the liberals had no plan for government beyond tearing up the just negotiated canada u s trade agreement the red book s other purpose was to establish consensus on difficult policy issues among the various factions of the liberal party itself on the contentious question of deficits and debts the compromise reached was to mimic the entry conditions of the european union s then year old maastricht treaty and aim for a deficit of three per cent of gdp advertisement 5 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the budget finance minister paul martin presented in february 1994 just 126 days after taking office aimed to do exactly that initially it was well received but a bump up in interest rates over the next few months threw it badly off course short term rates rose 400 basis points by the end of the year and forecast interest payments ballooned by an estimated 9 5 billion in 2019 dollars a major lesson of canada s experience with high and rising debt in the 1970s and 1980s one not sufficiently appreciated by readers who came to economic maturity during the last few years of very low interest rates is precisely that when a government s debt is high unforeseen spikes in interest rates can leave its budget in shreds as motivation for martin s 1995 budget strategy the importance of ending the debt s ability to bushwhack government policy cannot be underestimated as the minister later put it our goal in beating the deficit is not simply to make the bond market feel better our goal is to be in a position to tell the bond market to get lost by mid 1994 the chrétien government was convinced the 1995 budget would require extreme measures if it were to achieve the declared goal of meeting its budget targets and restoring canadians confidence in ottawa s ability to keep its budgetary promises starting in mid summer the department of finance began meeting with ministers to inform them how much cutting was to be required and discuss how they might do it at the same time cabinet member marcel massé a former clerk of the privy council began program review the government s new exercise in zero based budgeting ministerial consultations with ministers martin and massé became known around ottawa as the star chamber some departments were put on what may well have seemed like a fiscal rack the requirement for industry for instance was a 60 per cent reduction in industrial subsidies advertisement 6 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the budget that resulted was sold as epoch making in his budget speech martin declared mr speaker there are times in the progress of a people when fundamental challenges must be faced fundamental choices made a new course charted for canadians this is one of those times we can take the path too well trodden of minimal change of least resistance of leadership lost or we can set out on a new road of fundamental reform of renewal of hope restored similarly heroic language accompanies many budgets but the 1995 budget really did take extreme measures it cut government spending not just in real terms after inflation is accounted for which is rare enough but also in nominal terms something that had not been seen since before the second world war and it did so for two years running it remade federal provincial fiscal relations by completing the switch from tied to block grants initiated in 1977 by the trudeau government it did away with the crow rate rail transportation subsidies that had stood since 1897 it cut the cbc to such an extent the corporation s president resigned in protest the next day it reduced unemployment insurance benefits and it promised though it did not deliver a reform of old age security a decision that caused a last minute dispute between martin and chrétien finally it set the stage both for the elimination of the federal deficit which was achieved in 1997 98 and lasted for 10 years as well as for reductions both in the absolute value of the debt and in the debt to gdp ratio with the latter eventually falling to under 30 per cent of gdp not as low as its post war minimum but low enough to establish the period of fiscal stability that has allowed most canadians to forget about any possibility of the imf intervening in our economic policy advertisement 7 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content did the 1995 budget change canadian fiscal policy forever no after a difficult and impressive but also necessary step down in both the level of federal spending and its share of gdp spending eventually returned to trends that had been observed before the 1995 budget but by then both indicators were better proportioned to the economy s ability to sustain them which meant the vicious circle of interest payments leading to more debt leading to more interest payments finally was ended or at least has been for two decades the question the current generation of canadians now faces is whether deliberately departing from the 1995 2015 political consensus favouring balanced federal budgets threatens a return to the potentially unstable debt dynamics of 1975 1995 the philosopher george santayana famously said that those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it strictly it doesn t follow that those who do remember the past aren t also similarly condemned but a good understanding of what did happen 25 and more years ago certainly cannot hurt to that end the papers in the fraser institute s new publication which is available free online make for socially instructive reading it would be

outperformer tuesday as risk assets extended monday s punishing declines and investors continued to flock toward perceived safe havens amid mounting concern over the spread of coronavirus outside of china with outbreaks confirmed in south korea japan italy and others italy has quarantined towns and villages in its northern regions in an effort to halt the spread of the virus the first sign in europe of the same kind of disruption that s brought china s economy near to a standstill this year this is as containment efforts continue to see china s economy operating substantially beneath its capacity amidst the doom and gloom the gbp continues to offer a ray of hope though we need to respect the fact that a lot of fiscal easing in the uk is already discounted heavily into some asset prices we still think the march budget will reinforce the fact that 2020 as a whole is going to be a year of fiscal reform dynamism for the uk if anything the covid 19 outbreak in europe increases the chance of there being a decent mix of long term and short term countercyclical measures in the march budget says stephen gallo european head of fx strategy at bmo capital markets above pound to dollar

the pound is the only other one of five traditional major currencies to have short term bond yields that are above the zero level sterling has been battling to keep its head above water of late although this week so far appears to have put wind in the sails of the pound to dollar rate leading it back toward the upper boundary of a falling wedge continuation pattern on the charts as investors bet increasingly heavily the federal reserve fed will cut its interest rate multiple times before the year is out rates market pricing has shifted in recent weeks from implying that barely more than one rate was likely this year to confidently wagering that three cuts are now all but a certainty which has brought american government bond yields back toward record lows set years ago and dented

position ahead of talks that are set to get underway next month both parties have until the end of june to put meat on the bones of an agreement or oragnise an extension of the current transition period beyond december 31 and some analysts expect that this deadline will risk seeing cliff edge concerns again weighing on sterling from mid year onward prime minister boris johnson s withdrawal agreement gives rise to possible constitutional consequences for all of the uk but especially northern ireland in the even the backstop is activated although this doesn t completely eliminate the prospect of something like a no deal brexit from happening in 2021 we continue to view anticipation of fiscal stimulus in the 11 march budget as a gbp supportive factor in the short term especially

don lee los angeles times washington as the coronavirus outbreak enters a potentially dangerous new phase with cases widening in europe and expected to spread in the united states economists have begun to raise their estimates for the risk of a global recession and fallout to the american economy economists say the stock market sell off in recent days reflects a reassessment of the likely magnitude of the hit to corporate earnings in the virus wake suggesting the economic pain could last longer and the recovery may not be as swift as initially thought businesses of all kinds in a lot of places being impaired really made me skeptical that this is something that would fade quickly and from which we would recover quickly said carl tannenbaum chief economist at northern trust in chicago and that realization is now cascading through both to investors and to policymakers that this is a situation that is more serious than initially thought many american companies rely on overseas sales and production in china for a significant share of their revenue and profits and a growing number of firms including apple starbucks and the chipmaker qualcomm have lowered their earnings guidance in recent days tannenbaum now sees the federal reserve cutting interest rates by a quarter of a point in april just a few weeks ago he and many other analysts expected the central bank would stand pat on rates for the rest of the year fed officials aren t sounding alarm bells yet but say they re closely monitoring the situation and while they don t want to react to volatile swings in financial markets deepening losses in stocks could undercut consumer confidence which in turn could cause a retrenchment in spending and push the economy into recession oil prices treasury yields and stock indexes all have sunk this week the dow lost ground for a fifth straight session wednesday and is now down more than 8 from a week ago the equity market is central to the u s economy said mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics noting that the large baby boom population is particularly susceptible to a market downturn because they have much of their nest egg in it zandi considered the rapid spread of the virus in italy a major turning point and after tuesday s warning from the u s centers for disease control and prevention that infections were bound to increase in the united states he raised the odds of a global recession to 50 up from just 20 last week if it goes to a pandemic then i think the economy is in recession he said the world health organization hasn t yet classified the outbreak as a pandemic as of late wednesday its daily tracking reported more than 81 000 confirmed cases in more than 36 countries with the death toll exceeding 2 750 the vast majority in china the rate of increase in cases is now fastest outside of china in fact china where the covid 19 virus was first detected in december has seen a steady decline in reports of new infections in recent days and key parts of the chinese economy which had been in virtual lockdown have picked up notably as many operations have resumed but even as things look better in china a surge of new cases in south korea italy and iran has sparked fears that the economic impact will only widen as other countries and the companies that operate there adopt similarly stringent responses to keep the virus in check such as travel restrictions and temporary closures of factories and businesses in the face of heightened uncertainties some companies are taking more extreme measures nestle this week told all of its 291 000 employees worldwide to hold off on business travel until the middle of next month even before the virus outbreak the global economy was smarting from president trump s trade wars uncertainties about brexit and rising tensions in south america and the middle east now it looks like several major economies japan germany italy south korea could slide into a technical recession defined as two consecutive quarters of negative output fed officials seemed unruffled by the stock market declines or that the yield on the benchmark 10 year treasury note fell to an all time low tuesday as investors fled riskier assets for the safety of u s government bonds fed vice chair richard h clarida speaking at an economic conference in washington on tuesday afternoon said that it is still too soon to even speculate about either the size or the persistence of these effects or whether they will lead to a material change in the outlook clarida added that the u s economy and the central bank s current monetary policy were both in a good place essentially repeating public comments made by fed chair jerome h powell two weeks ago trump s chief economic advisor larry kudlow has insisted that even if the rest of the world tumbled into recession the u s could remain an island of prosperity right here we re doing awfully well now he said on cnbc on tuesday as stocks were rapidly falling we have contained this he said i won t say airtight but it s pretty close to airtight as of wednesday there were at least 60 confirmed cases in the u s with no deaths trump who returned wednesday from a trip to india appeared frustrated by the increased concern at home and sought to reassure americans in an evening news conference in a tweet earlier wednesday he praised his administration s response to the virus and lashed out at the news media for making the coronavirus look as bad as possible including panicking markets trump has frequently touted the stock market gains under his watch something that he sees as a validation of his successful stewardship of the economy ahead of the november election u s job growth in particular has held up very well and the fed s low interest rates have given a boost to the housing market and are helping household balance sheets at the same time corporate debts are high manufacturing remains in recession and business investment is sluggish analysts say it s possible the u s could skirt a recession in a global downturn but it ll be close editors story can end here research firm oxford economics this week also revised its outlook writing that the economic impact to the u s and global economy was believed to be mostly contained last week but rising volatility plunging stock prices and a strengthening dollar will likely exacerbate the economic shock on the u s economy even if the world avoids a coronavirus pandemic oxford economics said the u s economy will barely be able to stay above water in the first quarter and that growth for the year as a whole was likely to come in at a sub par rate of 1 5 one of the biggest threats is interruptions in global supply chains the network of manufacturers vendors distributors and transporters needed to get goods from factories to customers despite kudlow s assertion that there s no supply disruptions out there yet many companies and analysts in various industries can attest otherwise ipc an electronics industry trade group said this week that manufacturers were already hurting and surveys indicate they are expecting on average product shipment delays of at least five weeks said john mitchell ipc s president and chief executive the delays will likely have ripple effects for the rest of the year

as usual with shaaban s speeches syrians reaction was one of disbelief with the syrian economy in an unprecedented nose dive even while shaaban made this claim and the value of the syrian pound reaching 1 000 to one us dollar all but assad s super rich elite are struggling to meet their most basic daily needs not just in areas controlled by the syrian regime and its iranian militia allies but nationwide even before shaaban s ill conceived claims the worsening economic conditions among other factors had already led to widespread discontent even in traditionally regime loyalist areas in the majority druze province of suweida in south syria local people held demonstrations condemning the regime s corruption and incompetence with banners bearing slogans like we want to live and the syrian media is fake the economic crisis has further increased the already heavy burden on syrians still suffering from the consequences of the war that has spanned nine years to date the regime has effectively bankrupted the country to maintain power many of those who survived the relentless bombing by syrian russian and iranian air and ground forces that reduced whole villages towns and city neighbourhoods to rubble now have no choice but to return to their destroyed areas they have to accept the regime s security agreements and try to start afresh amid the ruins of their homes with no sign of hope improvement or freedom on the horizon it s been outlawed for people to even carry any dollars in their pockets so how should someone try to exchange it in an open manner mahmoud al ahmad the owner of a currency exchange bureau in the city of damascus told the new arab it s been outlawed for people to even carry any dollars in their pockets this is due to bashar al assad s decree banning foreign exchange trading those who do so face security prosecution possibly imprisonment or heavy fines this issue wasn t considered important previously with no decree banning it but with the issuance of the decree it became impossible we exchange dollars in a private way not according to the exchange rate from the central bank but rather according to the market price if the price of one dollar in the central bank is 700 syrian pounds and in the market 1 000 pounds we exchange it at 950 or 900 syrian pounds al ahmad added read also syrian pound continues to plunge to new lows rattling assad regime asked about the reason for the decline in the exchange rate of the syrian pound against the dollar he said there are many hidden reasons it seems to me that russia and iran have reduced their foreign exchange support for syria what is certain is that the movement in lebanon is a major reason the syrian merchants were bringing foreign currency especially dollars from the banks of lebanon and with these banks lacking cash liquidity merchants could no longer take their money from there there is no doubt that the caesar act sowed fear in the hearts of merchants and regime supporters which prevented them from dealing in cash in syria although the accelerating pace of events in neighbouring lebanon constitutes one of the causes of the financial meltdown in syria due to the closure of the lebanese banks used by assad s regime to transfer money from abroad in order to avoid the sanctions imposed on it the syrian regime itself bears the greatest responsibility for this deterioration in economic conditions and in every other aspect of life it is difficult for non syrians to conceive the endemic corruption at every level within the syrian state where the regime s government and all state institutions work solely under the orders of the security services overseen by assad and backed by iran and russia read also banking in lebanon is not paying off for damascus the sole concern of assad and his backers and therefore of all state bodies is restoring absolute control over syria s land and people who are treated in effect as chattels to be subjugated through terror intimidation and silencing of any dissent corruption is thus an innate part of a system based on exploitation and self enrichment with this culture of impunity at every level affecting all aspects of life further increasing the economic hardships for the vast majority among the worst affected are the hundreds of thousands of syrian women who have been left widowed or whose husbands are imprisoned or disappeared by the regime for participating in the revolution among the worst affected are the hundreds of thousands of syrian women who have been left widowed or whose husbands are imprisoned or disappeared by the regime for participating in the revolution with no family breadwinner and with young children to raise these women have been forced to find any work usually in menial low paid jobs due to the lack of employment opportunities samar b a resident of damascus whose husband was detained by the regime some years ago now lives with her two children her mother and her sister the salary that i earn from the government job is 60 after the last increase and my sister s salary from her job is about 50 she tells the new arab the rent for the house we live in isn t high compared to other homes and is around 60 per month the cost of living for us is about 100 per month while the bills are 20 i work for 13 hours a day so i can support my family i think that the deteriorating economic conditions are due to several reasons the first of which is that the regime has gone bankrupt after it sold the country to foreigners also oil returns aren t used for our benefit and the ports were sold to russia eastern ghouta was a major source of currency for the regime but the state treasury has been depleted for years to come she adds i don t think that the situation is going to improve on the contrary it s in an accelerating deterioration but i am happy because the supporters of the murderous regime are also starving today however as much as the situation deteriorates it s unlikely that the people in damascus will break their silence or protest in the near future the situation in damascus is very different to that in suweida which has largely been spared the bombardment arrests and siege endured for years in damascus in the traditionally loyal syrian coastal areas where a majority still supports the syrian regime the situation is a little different ahmad n is a resident of the city of latakia where he runs a shop things are worse here than before he tells the new arab my wife and son were forced to work in order to be able to keep us afloat financially with the rise in prices due to the fall in the price of the syrian pound compared to the dollar not everyone is able to secure their needs or even buy basics even supporters of the regime despite bashar al assad s ruling preventing the circulation of the dollar under penalty of punishment people are still dealing in it more than before due to the instability of the lira price everyone is pessimistic about what will come the continuation of the war and its cost the state s failure to assume its responsibilities towards the citizens and the widespread corruption in addition to the security services control of everything has made our area a treacherous forest that s very difficult to live in we see death coming to us and there is nothing we can do it is no secret to anyone that the syrian economy began to crumble since the us president signed the caesar syria civilian protection act in late december last year also known as the caesar act it is a united states legislation that sanctions the syrian regime including bashar al assad for war crimes against the syrian population however the bill has not been passed into law yet but even without the caesar act the dire conditions for most syrians would not have improved the syrian regime s monopolising and exhausting of all the state s resources to fund its war against its own the people and the selling or giving away most of these resources to its backers in russia and iran to pay for their support was the final straw for an economy already buckling under the decades long damage by the assad regime the war has effectively compounded the existing status quo wiping out the already precarious middle class leaving two classes in syria the assad s and their small wealthy elite of family and beneficiaries and the crushed majority for the assad s as always every solution to the problems besetting the nation lies in punishing and extorting this already crushed majority further instead of proposing solutions to renovate rebuild and improve the nation based on study research analysis and a positive vision of syria s future the regime is intent on further persecuting the people while the syrian people are still as always expected to endlessly suffer fight and or die to protect this status quo to accept foreign occupation and ownership of their nation and to view imprisonment torture and disappearance as the natural price of any dissent the regime elite continues to live in extravagant luxury with a fortune of hundreds of millions of dollars plundered from the syrian people deposited in offshore accounts around the world for assad s inner circle the terrible suffering of the majority of syrians is a faraway inconvenience that doesn t affect their lives any more than those of any wealthy american or russian for assad s inner circle the terrible suffering of the majority of syrians is a faraway inconvenience that doesn t affect their lives any more than those of any wealthy american or russian assad s children and those of his elite will live in luxury in grace and favour homes in russia while ordinary syrians die we don t yet know whether the collapsing syrian economy the worthless currency and atrocious living conditions will push syrians to rise up again against the regime and its bloodthirsty sponsors or if the regime will perhaps try to win international favour by abandoning its war against the people after the caesar act goes into effect but after reducing a nation to rubble and ashes selling its resources to foreign states killing or dispossessing over half its population and leaving the survivors in penury in order to cling to power one thing is near certain assad s morally and fiscally bankrupt regime is living on borrowed time false names have been used to protect the identity of those who face persecution for any condemnation of the regime dani qappani has worked as a media and human rights activist in syria since the beginning of the popular uprising in march 2011 in his hometown moadamiyeh city west of damascus city he lived under siege imposed by the syrian regime and affiliated militias between 2012 and 2016 before being displaced with his family to the north of syria he is a survivor of the august 2013 chemical attack and a large number of other attacks and massacres in his city at the time he is now based in the

article the dow jones industrial average sank nearly 1 200 points thursday deepening a weeklong global market rout caused by worries that the coronavirus outbreak will wreak havoc on the global economy the s p 500 has now plunged 12 from the all time high it set just a week ago that puts the index in what market watchers call a correction which analysts have said was long overdue in this bull market which is the longest in history it was the worst one day drop for the market since 2011 and stocks are now headed for their worst week since october 2008 during the global financial crisis the losses extended a slide in stocks that has wiped out the solid gains major indexes posted early this year investors came into 2020 feeling confident that the federal reserve would keep interest rates at low levels and the u s china trade war posed less of a threat to company profits after the two sides reached a preliminary agreement in january the virus outbreak has upended that rosy scenario as economists lower their expectations for economic growth and companies warn of a hit to their business this is a market that s being driven completely by fear said elaine stokes portfolio manager at loomis sayles with market movements following the classic characteristics of a fear trade stocks are down commodities are down and bonds are up bond prices soared again sending the yield on the 10 year treasury to another record low when yields fall it s a sign that investors are feeling less confident about the strength of the economy going forward more and more companies are warning that the outbreak will hurt their profits microsoft warned that the outbreak had interrupted its supply lines following a similar warning last week from apple crocs also fell sharply after saying its results would be hurt energy stocks fell sharply as the price of oil dropped 3 4 stokes said the swoon reminded her of the market s reaction following the sept 11 2001 terrorist attacks eventually we re going to get to a place where this fear it s something that we get used to living with the same way we got used to living with the threat of living with terrorism she said but right now people don t know how or when we re going to get there and what people do in that situation is to retrench the virus has now infected more than 82 000 people globally and is worrying governments with its rapid spread beyond the epicenter of china japan will close schools nationwide to help control the spread of the new virus saudi arabia banned foreign pilgrims from entering the kingdom to visit islam s

feel the economic effects of the virus goldman sachs on thursday said earnings for companies in the s p 500 index might not grow at all this year after predicting earlier that they would grow 5 5 strategist david kostin also cut his growth forecast for earnings next year besides a sharply weaker chinese economy in the first quarter of this year he sees lower demand for u s exporters disruptions to supply chains and general uncertainty eating away at earnings growth such cuts are even more impactful now because stocks are already trading at high levels relative to their earnings raising the risk before the virus worries exploded investors had been pushing stocks higher on expectations that strong profit growth was set to resume for companies the s p 500 was recently trading at its most expensive level relative to its expected earnings per share since the dot com bubble was deflating in 2002 according to factset if profit growth doesn t ramp up this year that makes a highly priced stock market even more vulnerable goldman sach s kostin said the s p 500 could fall to 2 900 in the near term which would be a nearly 7 drop from wednesday s close before rebounding to 3 400 by the end of the year traders are growing increasingly certain that the federal reserve will be forced to cut interest rates to protect the economy and soon they re pricing in a nearly two in

ground in the latest rout of stocks medical teleconferencing company teladoc surged 15 7 and 3m which counts surgical masks among its many products rose 0 8 the market s sharp drop this week partly reflects increasing fears among many economists that the u s and global economies could take a bigger hit from the coronavirus than they previously thought earlier assumptions that the impact would largely be contained in china and would temporarily disrupt manufacturing supply chains have been overtaken by concerns that as the virus spreads more people in numerous countries will stay home either voluntarily or under quarantine vacations could be canceled restaurant meals skipped and fewer shopping trips taken a global recession is likely if covid 19 becomes a pandemic and the odds of that are uncomfortably high and rising with infections surging in italy and korea said mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics the market rout will also likely weaken americans confidence in the economy analysts say even among those who don t own shares such volatility can worry people about their own companies and job security in addition americans that do own stocks feel less wealthy both of those trends can combine to discourage consumer spending and slow growth market roundup the s p 500 fell 137 63 points or 4 4 to 2 978 76 the dow fell 1 190 95 points or 4 4 to 25 766 64 the

pressing challenges and our drive to advance life around the world we reorganized into five business groups focused on providing customer centered solutions across the data communications dura line precision agriculture netafim building and infrastructure wavin fluor koura and polymer solutions vestolit verticals and we started operationalizing our play to win strategy to capitalize on organic growth opportunities and deliver superior operational and financial performance added martínez valle as we started doing in 2019 we will double down on operational excellence and focus on markets products and solutions that will yield higher margins across our key verticals in 2020 as initiated in 2019 the company continues to work to control costs optimize its working capital management and steer a disciplined capital allocation policy outlook for 2020 recent developments related to the coronavirus outbreak have significantly increased uncertainty around economic growth that could negatively impact some of our key markets assuming no major disruption in the global economy the company feels confident that it will deliver mid single digit growth in ebitda and stronger free cash flow generation that will in turn result in a decrease in leverage the company continues to double down on its efforts to drive operational excellence and deliver superior operational and financial performance consolidated financial information revenues in q4 2019 revenues totaled 1 6 billion down 53 million or 3 from q4 2018 mainly due to lower sales in the wavin and dura line businesses in 2019 overall revenues decreased to 7 0 billion representing a 3 decline as compared to 2018 mainly due to lower sales in the vestolit and wavin businesses ebitda in q4 2019 consolidated reported ebitda was 294 million up 9 from the 269 million reported in q4 2018 the ebitda margin for the quarter was 18 0 normalized ebitda excluding the impact of ifrs 16 and one time effects grew 13 with an

ifrs 16 and one time effects declined 5 8 with an implicit margin of 18 8 mainly due to lower profit margins from vestolit amidst challenging market conditions as well as koura which was negatively

2019 financial costs decreased by 12 million or 16 as compared to q4 2018 the decrease was mainly because in q4 2018 we registered the full annual effect of the mark to market valuation of the put option granted to netafim s minority shareholders in connection with the netafim acquisition while in 2019 the effect was recorded on a quarterly basis in 2019 overall costs increased 12 million or 4 as compared to 2018 the increase was mainly due to the adoption of ifrs 16 which impacted net interest expenses as well as higher bank commissions related to the renewal of orbia s 1 5 billion revolving credit facility and netafim s refinancing of its bank loan these increased costs were partially offset by a decrease in foreign exchange losses taxes in q4 2019 income tax charges were 62 million as compared to 5 million in q4 2018 resulting in an effective tax rate of 68 driven by the appreciation of the mexican peso over the us dollar and due to higher fiscal profits generated by inflation in mexico in 2019 overall income tax charges amounted to 206 million as compared to 195 million in 2018 this resulted in an effective tax rate of 39 driven by the appreciation of the mexican peso over the us dollar as well as by the repatriation of dividends as cited in the q3 2019 report consolidated net majority income loss net majority income in q4 2019 decreased 34 million as compared to a 32 million decrease in q4 2018 yielding a 2 million loss mainly affected by the one time effects and the higher income tax as mentioned above in 2019 overall orbia posted 207 million in net majority income as compared to 355 million reported in 2018 due primarily to lower operating income financial performance by business group fluent business group including wavin dura line netafim mm

2019 the fluent business group posted revenues of 939 million down 5 as compared q4 2018 the drop was mainly due to a decline in wavin s overall sales in latin america impacted by sluggish activity in mexico and ecuador and as well as lower sales in our main european markets dura line was mainly impacted by lower sales in india and the shift to a more profitable product mix while netafim s slight decline in sales was due to projects in india that concluded in 2018 in 2019 overall fluent revenues decreased 2 to 4 0 billion as compared to 2018 mainly due to lower sales posted by wavin europe and wavin latam as well as by dura line dura line s lower sales numbers were largely due to a continued shift to a more profitable product mix as well as a reduction in india sales these declines were

wanted to provide a little more detail at cibc we have invested a significant effort in building a purpose driven bank with a client focused culture our purpose is to help make our clients ambitions a reality each and every day we ve made steady progress in embedding it into the fabric of not just what we do but also how we do it across our bank our unrelenting focus on our clients is evidenced by our clients experience results that we re all proud of this quarter we achieved our highest ever ipsos net promoter score in canadian banking this builds on the very strong j d power results we delivered last year in both canadian banking and brokerage as well as our leading client experience results in the united states when it comes to costs we also need to continue to challenge ourselves to be a more modern bank by focusing on continuous improvement and keeping a careful eye on our resource our 55 mix ratio is down 5 from 2015 which was achieved through repurposing resources realigning our organization and simplifying our processes while we ve made steady progress in starting this journey we have more work to do this also includes reviewing our organizational structure maximizing our capabilities and streamlining decision making all to further enable execution of our growth strategy at the same time we re committed to reskilling and upskilling our talent to ensure our employees have the opportunity to develop and grow as digitization becomes a greater enabler of our banking business to that end the restructuring charge we announced this morning supports an enterprisewide program to accelerate delivery of our priorities including improving our efficiency we re not taking these decisions lightly but the restructuring will help us repurpose our cost structure as we simplify reinvest in and position our bank to further strengthen our relationships with our clients turning to capital while we maintain a strong capital position and balance sheet discipline we continue to thoughtfully and strategically enhance returns through effective deployment this is an area where we ve been making solid and steady progress as we diversify our bank a clear example of this is our us business which represented 6 of our earnings in 2015 through organic growth as well as strategic acquisitions it represents 20 of earnings today we remain comfortable with our capital position and will continue to return capital to shareholders and remain primarily focused on organic growth so to wrap up i m pleased with our performance this quarter we had solid results from our core businesses and we are seeing good progress in some areas that underperformed in 2019 our performance also demonstrates the strength of our client focused strategy and the value of diversification across client segments industry sectors and geography and with that i d like to turn the call over to hratch to review our financial performance hratch panossian senior executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you victor and good morning everyone my comments will refer to the slides that are posted on our website starting with slide 7 for the first quarter of fiscal 20 we reported earnings of cad1 2 billion and diluted earnings per share of cad2 63 our results included two items of note a cad250 million after tax charge related to the restructuring referenced by victor and cad21 million after tax in amortization of acquisition related intangibles adjusting for these items of note we delivered net earnings of cad1 5 billion and earnings per share of cad3 24 up 8 over the prior year this quarter s results reflect continued progress against our client focused strategy we increased the breadth of our client base deepened relationships and improved client experience while continuing to invest for future growth in aggregate these efforts netted 5 growth in pre provision earnings and improved roe of 16 1 revenue of cad4 9 billion was up 7 year over year supported by continued growth across all businesses with particular strength in our differentiated capital markets platform and our commercial and wealth management businesses across north america adjusted expenses grew 1 ahead of revenues this quarter from an unusually low q1 last year this growth reflects higher performance based expenses and continued franchise investments net of the productivity improvements achieved over the year we anticipate expense growth to moderate over the balance of fiscal 20 as continued investments are offset by the impact of the announced restructuring which will affect nearly 5 of our team and reduce run rate expenses by over cad260 million these savings will start materializing in fiscal 20 contributing to improvements toward positive operating leverage by the end of the year the entire run rate impact of the restructuring will be reflected in our financials in fiscal 21 turning to slide 8 we ended the quarter with a cet1 ratio of 11 3 down from 11 6 due to a number of one time items in the quarter our pro forma cet1 ratio including the impact of the announced fcib transaction was approximately 11 7 and remains above our target range internal capital generation of 33 basis points was more than offset by the impact of the restructuring charge and higher risk weighted assets in the quarter in addition to normal course business growth regulatory changes model parameter updates and the partial reversal of last quarter s market risk reduction contributed to unusually high rwa growth over the quarter this quarter we also bought back 1 5 million common shares as part of our ongoing normal course issuer bid which had an impact of 7 basis points on cet1 going forward we will continue prioritizing capital allocation to organic growth in our business and we will return capital to shareholders while maintaining the strength of our balance sheet let me now turn to the performance of our business units the balance of my presentation will be focused on adjusted results which exclude items of note slide 9 reflects our personal and small business banking results where we continued to see stable margins strong growth in deposits and quarter over quarter growth in residential secured lending both in balances and commitments net income of cad619 million was down 2 from last year as continued investments in the business outpaced revenue growth revenues of cad2 2 billion increased 2 year over year benefiting from 4 growth in nii driven by expanded margins and volume growth in both loans and deposits net interest margin was 251 basis points for the quarter relatively stable sequentially and up 9 basis points from last year primarily due to the benefit of favorable rates going forward we expect nim to remain relatively stable with modest downward pressure from any further impact on the yield curve and competitive pricing non interest expenses of cad1 2 billion were flat sequentially but up 5 from the prior year as we continued to invest in modernizing our infrastructure distribution channels and products while we experienced some quarter over quarter fluctuation in expenses as we ve noted before we continue to expect full year expense growth for the segment to be closer to our 3 guidance slide 10 shows the results of our canadian commercial banking and wealth management business where we continued to see strength in commercial banking and improved performance in wealth management net income for the quarter was cad336 million up 7 from a year ago pre provision earnings were up 5 driven by strong revenue growth of 7 net of a 9 increase in non interest expenses expense increases reflect higher performance based compensation and investments including continued hiring in client facing roles we continue to expect fiscal 20 expense growth to be in the mid single digit range with some variability from expenses linked to top line performance commercial banking revenues were up 4 from a year ago net interest income benefited from continued volume growth offset in part by the impact of market rates and pricing deposit and lending balances were up 14 and 9 respectively and we continue to see balanced growth across all segments and geographic regions wealth management benefited from improvements in markets and a cad2 3 billion increase in net sales over the same period last year revenue for the business was up 9 primarily driven by higher fee based assets in full service brokerage and 13 growth in aum slide 11 shows the results of us commercial banking and wealth management where we continue to experience strong growth as we expand our business net income for the quarter was cad185 million up 6 over the prior year revenues were up 9 year over year as double digit volume growth and higher asset management fees more than offset the significant decline in interest rates over the year average loans grew 18 from a year ago reflecting continued momentum in client development the impact of new regional offices and expansion into new sectors average deposits grew 20 year over year due to strong growth from new and existing clients we also saw strong growth in our us private wealth business where aum was up 20 over the prior year driven by organic client growth tighter integration with our commercial and private banking businesses and market appreciation net interest margin for the segment was 302 basis points up 3 basis points sequentially and down 29 basis points from a year ago this quarter we discontinued the treatment of integration costs and purchase accounting adjustments associated with our us acquisitions as an item of note resulting in a small benefit to the segment s adjusted income and nim excluding this benefit nim was down slightly as a result of continued decline in short term rates going forward we expect nim to remain relatively stable subject to further fluctuations in interest rates non interest expenses increased 10 from the prior year reflecting higher performance based compensation and continued investments to drive growth as signaled last quarter q1 includes a seasonal increase related to the accrual of incentive compensation and benefit costs and we anticipate more modest growth for the rest of the year turning to capital markets on slide 12 net income of cad335 million for the quarter was up 63 from a year ago underpinned by 31 growth in pre provision earnings and improvement in credit provisions over the prior year revenue of cad171 million this quarter was up 22 from the prior year driven by strong trading activity across all products as well as higher corporate banking and underwriting revenues results this quarter reflect progress against the segment s strategy benefiting from continued momentum in the us and further revenue growth originating from retail and commercial clients across our bank non interest expenses of cad419 million were up 14 from a year ago primarily driven by higher performance related compensation as well as increased investments in growth and enterprise initiatives finally slide 13 reflects the results of the corporate and other business unit net income for the quarter was cad8 million compared with cad39 million for the prior year this reflects stronger performance in fcib net of reductions in treasury revenues and expense growth related to enterprise and infrastructure investments as mentioned previously we anticipate the sale of our controlling interest in fcib to close in the second half of 2020 and we will provide updated guidance for this segment at that time and with that i will turn the call over to laura laura dottori attanasio senior executive vice president and chief risk officer thank you and good morning turning to slide 15 this quarter provisions for impaired loans represented a year over year and quarter over quarter decrease this was primarily driven by our capital markets and canadian commercial banking businesses and included an additional provision for one commercial banking account that we discussed last quarter and some reversals in capital markets our provisions on performing were cad17 million down from the prior quarter this was mainly due to routine model and parameter updates overall our forward looking indicators remained relatively unchanged this quarter the next slide provides an overview of our gross impaired loans which remained stable at 47 basis points the slight increase in our residential mortgages was driven by continued seasoning of the loans that we originated over the past few years slide 18 provides the 90 plus day delinquency rates of our canadian consumer portfolios the increases in delinquencies are largely driven by our mortgage and secured personal lending portfolios and reflect the seasoning of the mortgage book as well as some continued weakness in the oil provinces i continue to be pleased with the overall performance of our credit portfolios and while provisions for losses were low this quarter we are maintaining our guidance of below 30 basis points on provisions for impaired loans for fiscal 2020 with that i ll turn the call back to the operator for questions questions and answers operator the first question is from john aiken with barclays please go ahead john aiken barclays analyst good morning victor with the cet1 ratio pro forma being above the range can we expect that to be managed down back within the range or should we expect that to be maintaining a little bit higher level given i guess some of the uncertainty around the macro outlook victor g dodig president and chief executive officer good morning john thanks for your question we ve always said that we re operating within 11 to 11 5 cet1 range that s our comfort zone on a pro forma basis with the fcib sale we ll be higher than that as we ve said to our shareholders we re going to be using it toward organic investment dividend increases both of which we highlighted today and an ongoing buyback program in which we executed against more repurchase of shares this past quarter and we ll continue to do so in the quarters ahead but i d say the message is operating within 11 to 11 5 is our range that we re comfortable in john aiken barclays analyst great thanks victor and laura if i can very quickly you mentioned in your prepared remarks the provisions in canadian commercial relating to the credit we talked about last quarter how comfortable are you that with the additional provisions taken this quarter this has actually been put to bed laura dottori attanasio senior executive vice president and chief risk officer well this is an evolving situation so at this time we re provisioned at about cad0 76 on the dollar so i m quite comfortable today with the provision rate that said and as you can appreciate things can evolve i think the important takeaway here is that as things evolve if ever we did have to further provision there is a lot less left to write down john aiken barclays analyst understood thank you i ll requeue operator thank you the next question is from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please go ahead ebrahim poonawala bank of america merrill lynch analyst good morning so i guess a question for victor there seems to be this perception when you talk to investors some of your shareholders around under investment in the retail franchise in canada and the risk of a widening gap relative to some of your larger peers would love to hear your thoughts around one do you think this is a valid concern and if so how much will it take both in terms of expense spend both in terms of dollars and time to catch up to some of those peers victor g dodig president and chief executive officer good morning ebrahim so a couple of things i d say one is i always listen to investors and investor feedback but i have to tell you all that we have a very solid personal and small business banking franchise in canada and we also recognize the importance of our franchise to our growth strategy so let me highlight some of our strengths we have a leading mobile platform that s been recognized by independent research agencies and our clients it s been recognized by millennials who the under 35 class according to j d power think that we re the best mobile platform out there we have a functionality that exceeds some of our peers we ve been investing in that platform to continue to have a lead we have a leading relationship management platform the imperial service is still an unmatched service in canadian banking and we continue to invest there and we ll continue to invest in our advice platform in the quarters ahead which we ll share with you as those investments come to life we ve been investing in our small business platform we ve got some interesting significant pilots going on in the small business side where we re seeing very encouraging results we ve invested significantly in our banking centers we now have almost 90 of our transactions being done outside of the banking center so that we can focus on advice and our banking centers have been repurposed in that regard and we have rejuvenated our product suite we have our smart plus platform so any canadian that has cad6 000 in their checking account or cad100 000 in any part of cibc pays no checking account fees and gets a free premium credit card we ve invested in smart investment solutions which is driving our volume on the investment side so those are our strengths and i think it s important to highlight those because they are real they are incumbent advantages that we continue to build on and we ll invest in now in the past year we also recognized those areas of opportunity for improvement there is clearly an area of opportunity for improvement in mortgages we ve invested in that by putting in a higher quality and larger number of mobile advisors investing in technology so they can simplify their way of doing business and onboarding clients for mortgages and we ve established this relationship with re max which we re very excited about as they are the leading agency in the eastern part of our country the second thing is mutual funds last year we had an outflow of cad1 6 billion in the first quarter this year we had a positive inflow of cad1 billion that s a cad2 6 billion delta it s being driven by our smart investment solutions which are market leading in terms of structure and pricing our investment performance on the investment side we ve got 72 of our assets under management are performing above benchmark on a five year basis and 86 on a one year basis and in our cards business we re seeing improved acquisition our goal is to continue to embrace the launch of the new air canada card and continue to invest in our aventura platform including our cash back cards so our goal is to continue to invest in our business deliver positive operating leverage and continue to ensure that our solid personal and small business banking franchise in canada delivers the growth that our investors expect and we know we can deliver ebrahim poonawala bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it that was pretty comprehensive i guess if i had to one line it it sounds like you don t really share the investor perception around this victor g dodig president and chief executive officer i think that if you actually lift up the hood and look at what we re doing look at how we re positioned look at some of the growth trajectory in those areas where we exhibited some softness last year things are heading in the right direction now as you all know it takes time right but we said we re going to get to market level mortgage growth toward the end of the year we ve already turned around our investment franchise we re seeing client experience scores at the highest level that we ve ever seen now one quarter does not make a trend but if you actually look at it over a number of years our client experience scores have been improving we re focused on serving our clients and we re focused on being best in class ebrahim poonawala bank of america merrill lynch analyst that s helpful thank you very much victor g dodig president and chief executive officer thank you ebrahim operator thank you the next question is from gabriel dechaine with national bank financial please go ahead gabriel dechaine national bank financial analyst good morning just want to follow up on the capital commentary at 11 3 you re still comfortable with the pace of buybacks or are you looking at it on a pro forma basis when you re contemplating capital deployment hratch panossian senior executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning gabriel it s hratch i ll take that one i would say we are comfortable for a number of reasons so one we do look at that pro forma number and we continue to feel comfortable about the probability of that realizing around the midpoint of the year as we discussed two we look at the forward trajectory of capital generation and outside of the one time items this quarter as well as some of the volatility we saw between last quarter and this quarter which bled some rwa growth into this quarter we feel very confident with our net generation going forward and so between those two things we feel comfortable that we re in a position to continue that gabriel dechaine national bank financial analyst thanks and on the credit side of things for laura i ve asked this question with other banks i m getting a pretty consistent too early to tell response but given the balance of factors you ve got coronavirus and the indirect impact the rail blockades that continue to have an impact on the economy and notwithstanding this quarter s better than expected credit performance there s got be some upward pressure that you could contemplate in q2 if not beyond at least from the provisions on performing no or yes laura dottori attanasio senior executive vice president and chief risk officer well i continue to guide to as i said in my prepared remarks to below 30 basis points as it relates to provisions on impairs and as you pointed out things relating to the coronavirus rail blockades we re still sort of in early days they are two important events and they can certainly impact our economy on a go forward basis so we continue to monitor them closely and dependent upon what happens and length of time i would expect that we would see that start to represent first in fli movements and so in our provisions on performing but it s still early days gabriel dechaine national bank financial analyst thank you operator thank you and the next question is from meny grauman with cormark securities please go ahead meny grauman cormark securities analyst hi good morning i m wondering if the change in leadership in the retail business changes anything in terms of the strategy for that business victor g dodig president and chief executive officer our strategy is as i articulated a little earlier meny we re very confident in the solid platform that we have and our ability to invest in that platform and deliver further growth i think laura is well poised to take on the leadership of the business christina is well placed to take on the leadership in a new role in technology infrastructure and innovation and i know that two of them as well as the entire team which has been working together for quite some time will continue to focus on delivering profitable growth to our franchise meny grauman cormark securities analyst and then just on the restructuring charge i don t think you mentioned i m wondering were these charges concentrated in a particular area and if so what and then on the cad260 million run rate savings hratch how much of that will be falling to the bottom line i think victor you talked about repurposing a lot so i m wondering how that geography goes victor g dodig president and chief executive officer okay meny let me say a couple of things about restructuring because i think it s important to get our entire narrative out to our investor base and i m going to let hratch to deal with some of the very specifics in terms of what we re anticipating in the back half of this year as well as 2021 so just to remind everyone we set out our path five years ago to create a more client focused agile and cost efficient bank since then i think we made solid progress on a number of fronts we ve reduced our nix ratio from 60 to 55 i think that s quite an accomplishment from the cibc team we took a restructuring charge in 2016 to further accelerate our efficiency and the restructuring charge we announced today is a further effort to simplify our bank we believe as a leadership team that the charge we announced today is sufficient to get our bank to the operating model that s going to do a couple of things deliver improved top line growth help us achieve our 53 5 to 54 2022 target that s by the end of that year deliver positive operating leverage across our platform into the year ahead across all our sbus and get us back to that 5 to 10 eps growth range in a stable market environment that s what we believe that s why we ve done this and we don t anticipate doing this going forward it is really all about now operating performance of our businesses you had some specific questions about the expenses and how we re thinking about that going forward so hratch maybe you want to elaborate on that hratch panossian senior executive vice president and chief financial officer sure thank you victor so i think as victor said for this year we will continue our investments and we also see continued investment into 2021 forward the purpose here of the restructuring was to find offsets and to find efficiencies in areas where work can be eliminated or done more efficiently so that we can continue investing in the front line so with all of that for this year for fiscal 20 on a net basis we re still comfortable with that 4 to 5 guidance full year for expenses that we spoke about and a couple of items in that are performance based expenses are trending a bit higher because of outperformance and we re pleased with that and some of the beginning of the restructuring early parts of that cad260 million reflecting this year net that off a bit so net net so we re still in that 4 to 5 range but in terms of quarterly trends as victor mentioned accelerating toward positive operating leverage at the end of the year when the full impact of the cad260 million comes in next year that will give us the ability to reduce baseline expense growth as a starting point to the low single digits now that will be the base line off of which we will decide our reinvestment levels and our goals as victor said are operating leverage positive and trying to get back to that 5 to 10 earnings growth it s early to tell what the environment looks like so we ll resize reinvestment based on those output and so the exact expense growth for 21 we ll give you more guidance on later in the year meny grauman cormark securities analyst thank you operator thank you the next question is from steve theriault with eight capital please go ahead steve theriault eight capital analyst thanks very much i d like to start with the canadian commercial business jon the commercial lending growth had been very very steady around 12 the last number of quarters but slowed a few hundred basis points in q1 maybe just some detail there are you seeing any increased competition or terms you don t like in the market what s driving that jon hountalas senior executive vice president and group head commercial banking and wealth management canada yeah so thank you for the question if you look we tend to look at the business on both sides of the balance sheet i d tell you over the last eight or nine quarters deposits have been double digits every quarter loans have kind of jumped back and forth sometimes they re low double sometimes they re high single this quarter they re high single so that feels pretty normal when we look at the kind of pipeline it s in line with history new business in q1 in line with history utilization rates were a bit down so that s a bit different so we re watching that early days and to your comment yeah we are passing on more business we re relationship mate right we don t compete on price or risk if we have to pass on business that doesn t fit our model we re happy to do it we re very comfortable with the model we ve built long term we think we can grow faster than market on both sides of the balance sheet in the short term if we see things in the market that don t make sense for us we pass so we are passing on a few more deals in commercial banking steve theriault eight capital analyst okay that s helpful and then kind of related but victor you mentioned small business and looking at that line item it s a little down this quarter it s been flat for a while victor so you mentioned some initiatives there can you or christina give a little more detail and what s your level of confidence we ll see some acceleration this year in the small business line victor g dodig president and chief executive officer good morning steve so i am going to pass it on to ck go ahead christina kramer senior executive vice president and group head personal and small business banking canada i ll take that question thank you victor and thank you steve the first priority as we look at our small business segment was to focus on specific client segments canadian entrepreneurs and professionals and we ve been focused on growing the business by meeting clients core payments and cash management needs so that s on the deposit side and we ve seen positive deposit growth in that space last year we added and this speaks to the reinvestments that victor was talking about we added over 170 new specialized business advisors and support roles in targeted markets and we ll continue to make those investments to advance our relationship based strategy so those new roles their growth is outpacing our expectations still early days but outpacing expectations and we re expanding into other parts of canada this year so we see further opportunity on the business borrowing side has not been our primary focus initially but as we expand or specialize the mobile business advisor force we believe we will increase our growth on the borrowing side and with the roles that we ve already put in place albeit again still early on we re seeing higher lending origination activity so good early results that s where we ve been focusing in the small business segment steve theriault eight capital analyst okay thanks for that color operator thank you the next question is from scott chan with canaccord genuity please go ahead scott chan canaccord genuity analyst good morning just a quick question on the restructuring charge did it affect the u s business at all hratch panossian senior executive vice president and chief financial officer morning scott it s hratch i ll jump in so the way to think about this across segments that it s fairly broad and it affects all segments roughly proportionate to where our fte count is if you look at it so it is largely focused on where we can do things more efficiently across a number of the areas and there are those types of roles both in corporate and other segment in operations and so forth and other areas but there are those types of roles across the entire bank so look at it proportionally across the segment scott chan canaccord genuity analyst okay that s helpful and sticking with the u s segment the commercial growth seems to be continues to be very robust we ve seen a lot of your peers and industry data notice some deceleration in the quarter and potentially throughout fiscal 20 just curious to hear your thoughts on the trajectory on your volume business there michael g capatides senior executive vice president and group head u s region president and ceo cibc bank usa thanks scott this is this mike capatides i ll take that question as we said last quarter our growth is in part due to the new initiatives we put in place over the course of the past year and a half that s new offices new products and increased referrals among our various business groups in the u s last quarter it was about 50 50 between new and same store this quarter it s about one third new two thirds same store so this healthy growth is in large part due to purposeful new initiatives we put in place we expect that growth to moderate for the rest of the year but remain healthy probably to the high single digit low double digits and importantly it ll be proportional between our c i portfolio and our real estate and private banking portfolio having said all that we re staying disciplined on pricing and credit although we do see a lot of competition we too are passing on deals that do not make sense for us right now but we re very pleased with the way the team continues to execute on a very purposeful u s strategy that we put in place along with the acquisition a couple of years ago scott chan canaccord genuity analyst thank you operator thank you the next question is from sumit malhotra with scotiabank please go ahead sumit malhotra scotiabank analyst good morning i m going to stay with mike to start mike when the bank acquired pvtb a few years ago one of the talking points that was discussed was the ability of cibc to help accelerate the funding profile and the low cost funding profile of that institution is coming off a low base but we do see your no interest your zero interest bearing deposits starting to increase can you tie that into some of the initiatives that victor talked about in terms of how the bank is engaging with clients and maybe more specifically numbers wise how does that tie into what seems to be a constructive margin outlook in the face of another step lower in the interest rate structure michael g capatides senior executive vice president and group head u s region president and ceo cibc bank usa sorry it s my microphone on i ll start off it and pass it over to hratch on the deposit side we re seeing greater opportunities in our market space especially related to the expansion of the cibc brand and we ve been able to work very very effectively with our new and existing cibc clients to expand that deposit base and liquidity services importantly as the balance sheet has grown we ve been able to maintain a very healthy level of non interest bearing accounts checking accounts and expanded our treasury services these clients are generally in the commercial and wealth sector and are somewhat price sensitive but as we adjust rates which a good part of our book is libor based most of our book which is forward looking our team has worked very very hard and productively with our clients to readjust our deposit pricing and frankly a day to day effort and you re starting to see that in our nims and you ll see it going forward in addition our digital agility platform has performed very well and that s given us some flexibility in terms of our deposit stack so overall we re just we re happy with how our deposit strategy is rolled out it s been strong and i ll turn it over to hratch now to give similar technical information on our nims hratch panossian senior executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks mike and thanks for the question sumit so i think mike covered the business elements the few things i would add is as cibc acquired by the bank we brought the ability there to help and accelerate the growth of deposits as well as the ability to manage the profitability and margins i think that urge you through some of our hedging program and so there s a number of things that we ve done mike talked about some of the initiatives in the business and there have been some cross segment initiatives so some deposits from our commercial clients in canada that may have had deposits there some opportunities for deposits from our geneva and atlantic trust clients historically that now with a private banking offer that we have there s some personal deposits on that so all of those are helping generally puts and takes but generally helping as well and we hope over time will help on the cost of deposits which helps margins but deposits overall i would say stable to some of the initiatives mike mentioned managing that more closely loan margins as well staying fairly stable some movements as the composition of the portfolio moves but we re able to keep those stable and so the residual really has been around interest rate sensitivity and the yield curve due to the mismatches between assets and liabilities and we ve put a lot of hedging capability on top of that through our central treasury since then and so that stabilized margin so we had forecasted margins to be relatively stable there s a bit of noise in that uptick this quarter due to the item i mentioned in my remarks but net of that margins were down 3 basis points which is relatively stable in the short rate environment that we are seeing and we expect that to continue because of all the dynamics i spoke about sumit malhotra scotiabank analyst thanks for that color and i ll wrap up with a quick one for you hratch you mentioned that you expect firstcaribbean the firstcaribbean divestiture to close in the second half of this year thinking about the full year impact to earnings power for the bank if you still have that disclosure out there i know there is some differences between what they report and how it gets picked up in the bank s financials if i was to estimate approximately cad0 40 a share as the net as the net amount that cibc would forego is that in the ballpark of what you re expecting hratch panossian senior executive vice president and chief financial officer i would say that s high sumit and so i think remember there s a number of components here there s a contribution from firstcaribbean there is the portion that we will continue to recognize through earnings because of our continued stake of 24 9 so the net of those two is what would be lost there is some economics related to the loan related to the transaction you ve got to net that off as well so i would say it s significantly below that number and the way we re thinking about it is between the loss on steady state earnings and the capital that s generated as it s released as part of the transaction once we deploy that capital and the return to shareholders we re relatively eps neutral sumit malhotra scotiabank analyst thanks for your time operator thank you the next question is from mario mendonca with td securities please go ahead mario mendonca td securities analyst good morning if we could take a step back now and just look at the balance sheet in total and the page i m using is your average balances on page 17 of the supplement and what i observed this quarter is that the growth in the average assets is meaningful it s a fair bit greater than what we ve seen in the past and as i drill down on the various items there s repos for sure securities definitely cash and deposits with banks could you help me understand if this is the new level from which cibc would grow or was this quarter somewhat special in terms of what the bank was presented in terms of opportunities hratch panossian senior executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning mario it s hratch i ll take that i would say this is all normal course business there can always be some volatility back and forward but a number of items driving that and i ll elaborate a little bit more so one there is the ongoing dynamic across the balance sheet as we grow certain items other than drawn loans for example our deposit books our undrawn commitments and other contingent exposures from a funding perspective because of the new liquidity rules that increases the liquidity in hqla requirements that we manage and treasury for lcr purposes and other liquidity metrics and so that drives a continual increase in securities that you ll see come in in the treasury side so that s one element and that i would say is ongoing the second element which is also treasury related as you can have fluctuations in liquidity and so you ll see the cash line item as well up significantly this quarter that i would say is transient liquidity so some of that will be volatile and not necessarily steady state and then lastly we had an increase in securities in our capital markets business that s related to the ongoing client business that we re doing growing that business and so again that can have some fluctuation but as we grow the business i would expect that to grow both across our financing business as well as some of the other desks and so those are the main drivers little bit of noise obviously on the ifrs goes up this quarter that adds to the balance sheet but nothing significant mario mendonca td securities analyst so hratch would it be fair to say then it s hard to tell whether this will grow from here it could shrink it could grow just sort of depends on what s presented next quarter is that fair hratch panossian senior executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i think it ll be a little volatility the longer term trend as we grow our business i would expect that to grow because of the liquidity requirements that i mentioned mario mario mendonca td securities analyst and then finally if we look at the increase in rwa this quarter and you acknowledged that it was big i understand the various pieces is there an opportunity here for cibc to actually shrink some of these balances and redeploy it to things like buybacks like does this actually present an opportunity to boost capital is that any is that reasonable in the way the bank looks at it hratch panossian senior executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so i ll say a few things let me start with a quarter because i think it is important to clarify that so as i mentioned if you look at the 36 basis points of normal course business rwa growth if you will that is probably about 10 basis points overstated this quarter so when i look at last quarter and this one combined i think there is a 10 basis point that was borrowed from one quarter to the other and that s related to our trading related rwas both across counterparty credit and market risk those will move around between quarters and there s some volatility right because of market movements that change change the marks on derivatives and so forth and changes in market risk based on the dynamics of bar and stress bar so net net we still think that this quarter core is the same amount of capital deployment going forward now is there an opportunity to deploy less we are always conscious of the roes and the returns that we re getting on any capital that we deploy we are focused on organic growth but we are very disciplined we do not have significant areas of our business where our returns of capital deployed are below what we expect as returns and well above cost of capital and hurdles but we ll continuously look at that on the margin there may be opportunities here and there but i think we re more in the mode of deploying capital toward growth that was our strategy that was one of the reasons that we invested in the u s to give us an avenue to deploy the organic capital generation and so we re seeing the current dynamic as the right one with small amount in net generation but a lot of business growth through deployment mario mendonca td securities analyst okay thank you operator thank you the next question is from sohrab movahedi with bmo capital markets please go ahead sohrab movahedi bmo capital markets analyst thank you just wanted to start off maybe with harry for a second i mean very strong quarter harry you had once upon a time said that you think the capital market segment is probably about a cad1 billion a year type contributor to the total bank is there any reason to think that yardstick has changed harry culham senior executive vice president and group head capital markets good morning thanks for the question yeah you re right i did say that in the past and we ve evolved i would say the core franchise continues to perform very well very diversified organic growth here in canada with our core branches but also internationally and as we ve said in the past our medium to long term focus is to grow in the u s and also the same time increase our stable recurring revenues through innovative solutions and servicing our personal and commercial clients and that s all growing in double digits so i guess the answer to your question is we feel confident that we can deliver in a slightly higher range now and i put it as sort of cad250 million to cad300 million niat per quarter and surpass expectations as we did in this quarter given favorable market conditions from time to time and credit conditions so the franchise is growing we think we can continue to grow at this pace going forward sohrab movahedi bmo capital markets analyst okay and maybe just you know credit spreads obviously a big factor for everyone this quarter but even since the quarter end high yield spreads have kind of widened are you seeing anything noteworthy as far as the trading businesses so far this quarter harry culham senior executive vice president and group head capital markets we had a reasonably good start to quarter two obviously the markets are volatile they remain liquid so they re constructive for client activity there has been a little bit of gapping from time to time but we re pretty confident that we re there for our clients we re doing good client business it s a reasonable start to quarter two we ll see where the markets take us with the various different disruptions clients are active the pipeline is pretty strong and as victor pointed out this is a differentiated platform where we re building businesses using technology to get through the cycles of capital markets so therefore i m confident in the guidance i gave you a moment ago sohrab movahedi bmo capital markets analyst okay can i sneak in one more victor g dodig president and chief executive officer sure sohrab movahedi bmo capital markets analyst victor or hratch lots of talk about the roe but also about getting back to that 5 to 10 kind of eps growth target range if at the margin which one trumps the other one would you pursue growth or would you make the roe decision victor g dodig president and chief executive officer how about both because that s really our focus we ve been quite clear over five years ago when we said look part of our mandate is to get our eps to 5 to 10 and make sure that roes stays above 15 so we believe that some of the actions that we ve taken on cost and some of the management effort we ve taken on driving the top line will continue to show through in our eps growth as we head into the back half of this year and early next year we also are all too aware of how do we get a balanced business going in terms of capital light businesses like some of the agency businesses we have going through capital markets and the technology investments that we ve made our wealth management businesses which are showing robust net flows in both canada united states and the rejuvenation of continued rejuvenation of our mortgage business which has a lower rwa density driving better growth and continued focus on deposits will all contribute to ensuring that roe stays in the 15 plus range sohrab movahedi bmo capital markets analyst thank you operator thank you the next question is from doug young with desjardins capital please go ahead doug young desjardins capital analyst good morning just on the capital markets side victor you made a comment and i m just hoping to get a little more detail because i find it real hard to model capital markets but you said a growing percent of revenues are from stable recurring revenue streams in capital market which could be great to understand what can you quantify that can you kind of layer out what a little bit more detail on that thank you victor g dodig president and chief executive officer i m going to turn it over to harry in a sec doug but i just want to highlight a couple of things the technology investments that we ve made have not only served our capital markets clients sort of in its classic institutional and corporate sense but there s been a higher degree of connectivity to our retail and commercial businesses we do measure that connectivity how much business are we putting through our personal and small business bank as well as through our commercial and wealth management franchises and that number is growing and we see that is having a higher quality level more of a recurring nature the second thing that we ve created today is just this whole notion of direct financial services the alternate solutions group which you ll get more visibility to over the coming quarters as well as our simply business and our investors edge business are all pretty profitable and growing businesses that really rely heavily on technology and the kind of technology investments that we ve been making in capital markets to drive a better result so harry let me just pass it on to you in terms of highlighting anything else you d like to highlight in that regard i will say unequivocally that the capital markets revenue streams that are coming from cibc are fundamentally different than they used to be and are much more recurring and high quality in nature harry culham senior executive vice president and group head capital markets yeah i guess i would add that we have diversified the franchise significantly clearly the core corporate institutional franchise is very important to this business if you just look at the pre provision earnings growth over the last five years of this business is growing in double digits so we re confident that that growth will continue with very good technology investment and continued diversification of client base so victor mentioned servicing personal and commercial clients that s very important of this franchise we think we have an edge there and we think we have very good market share that we continue to grow in canada but also in the u s so very pleased with the growth of the non traditional corporate institutional clients into the personal and commercial space doug young desjardins capital analyst i mean i guess i would say care to put a number or percent on where that recurring revenue stands and where you think it would go hratch panossian senior executive vice president and chief financial officer so this is doug it s hratch this is an area that we re going to continue providing more transparency on as we go forward so as we work toward our next investor day with some of what was announced today as well was harry s responsibilities around the sector we re going to work through our disclosures to provide more transparency but not at this time doug young desjardins capital analyst okay and then just on the cet1 a lot of questions on it but if i look at it simplistically it looked like organic internal capital generation was negative clearly that s not the case as hratch you talked about something borrowed from last quarter that impacted this quarter i guess my question is what is the organic internal capital generations that one growth that we should think about is it less so than it was about three two three years ago and as part of your issue is that you re getting good growth in the u s and i believe the u s is still under the standardized model if i m not right there you can correct me and is there a potential to change that if it is hratch panossian senior executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so thanks for the question i ll take it so let me start with the quarter and i ll reiterate so the 36 basis points we saw this quarter in rwa growth is unusual and we don t anticipate to see that in the quarters going forward some of it was that quarter over quarter as i mentioned so take 10 basis points off i think you re more in the ballpark of what we would expect to see going forward so in terms of net generation nothing has changed in the short term so the last guidance we provided was that we would be somewhere in the range of that sort of 5 basis points to 10 basis points a quarter and i think that s still the right range i would probably look at it on an annual basis given the quarter over quarter volatility so i d sort of call it that 30 basis points to 40 basis points 35 basis points to 40 basis points over a year we still feel pretty good about that and the way we manage that goes back to the question earlier on the roes from sohrab we are very focused on marginal roe forward and the roe above the bank because we very much recognize that roe net of dividends is really our ability to grow capital and as long as we maintain that capital level that equates to our growth level and at the same roe that equates to our growth within our guidance range so we ll continue to manage that going forward and like i said i think that 30 basis points to 40 basis points hasn t changed doug young desjardins capital analyst and that u s business is it standardized was i right on that hratch panossian senior executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so it is it is still on standardized yes we do have an ability to go to advanced and there is a timeline around that so we re probably a couple of years away still but we are working through it doug young desjardins capital analyst okay thank you operator thank you i would now like to turn the meeting over to victor victor g dodig president and chief executive officer thank you operator so we ve had a good start to 2020 with strong earnings growth this quarter that reflect the strength of our client focused strategy the importance of earnings diversification and discipline and cost management while maintaining a strong capital position we will continue our journey to transform our bank into a relationship focused modern consumer and business making franchise with a leading north american commercial wealth platform and a differentiated capital markets business in summary we re a different bank today with tremendous opportunities available to us now that weren t possible a few years ago i ve never been more excited about our future i d like to thank our cibc team for their dedication to our client to our clients each and every day and i d like to thank you all for joining us on our call today we look forward to speaking with you next quarter and obviously in between that time thank

further explanation of terms used herein daniel martinez valle ceo of orbia advance corporation remarked 2019 was an important year for our company it marked the culmination of a multi year acquisition strategy that had dramatically increased our global footprint and market penetration we unveiled a new name purpose and strategy that reflected our ability to tackle the world s most pressing challenges and our drive to advance life around the world we reorganized into five business groups focused on providing customer centered solutions across the data communications dura line precision agriculture netafim building and infrastructure wavin fluor koura and polymer solutions vestolit verticals and we started operationalizing our play to win strategy to capitalize on organic growth opportunities and deliver superior operational and financial performance added martínez valle as we started doing in 2019 we will double down on operational excellence and focus on markets products and solutions that will yield higher margins across our key verticals in 2020 as initiated in 2019 the company continues to work to control costs optimize its working capital management and steer a disciplined capital allocation policy outlook for 2020 recent developments related to the coronavirus outbreak have significantly increased uncertainty around economic growth that could negatively impact some of our key markets assuming no major disruption in the global economy the company feels confident that it will deliver mid single digit growth in ebitda and stronger free cash flow generation that will in turn result in a decrease in leverage the company continues to double down on its efforts to drive operational excellence and deliver superior operational and financial performance consolidated financial information revenues in q4 2019 revenues totaled 1 6 billion down 53 million or 3 from q4 2018 mainly due to lower sales in the wavin and dura line businesses in 2019 overall revenues decreased to 7 0 billion representing a 3 decline as compared to 2018 mainly due to lower sales in the vestolit and wavin businesses ebitda in q4 2019 consolidated reported

2019 financial costs decreased by 12 million or 16 as compared to q4 2018 the decrease was mainly because in q4 2018 we registered the full annual effect of the mark to market valuation of the put option granted to netafim s minority shareholders in connection with the netafim acquisition while in 2019 the effect was recorded on a quarterly basis in 2019 overall costs increased 12 million or 4 as compared to 2018 the increase was mainly due to the adoption of ifrs 16 which impacted net interest expenses as well as higher bank commissions related to the renewal of orbia s 1 5 billion revolving credit facility and netafim s refinancing of its bank loan these increased costs were partially offset by a decrease in foreign exchange losses taxes in q4 2019 income tax charges were 62 million as compared to 5 million in q4 2018 resulting in an effective tax rate of 68 driven by the appreciation of the mexican peso over the us dollar and due to higher fiscal profits generated by inflation in mexico in 2019 overall income tax charges amounted to 206 million as compared to 195 million in 2018 this resulted in an effective tax rate of 39 driven by the appreciation of the mexican peso over the us dollar as well as by the repatriation of dividends as cited in the q3 2019 report consolidated net majority income loss net majority income in q4 2019 decreased 34 million as compared to a 32 million decrease in q4 2018 yielding a 2 million loss mainly affected by the one time effects and the higher income tax as mentioned above in 2019 overall orbia posted 207 million in net

mexico and ecuador and as well as lower sales in our main european markets dura line was mainly impacted by lower sales in india and the shift to a more profitable product mix while netafim s slight decline in sales was due to projects in india that concluded in 2018 in 2019 overall fluent revenues decreased 2 to 4 0 billion as compared to 2018 mainly due to lower sales posted by wavin europe and

note 5 of the 2019 audited financial statements for more details mr mario plourde president and chief executive officer commented we are very pleased with the annual adjusted oibd level of 604 million generated in 2019 the second consecutive year of record performance for cascades these historic results affirm the solid progress we are making with our growth optimization and strategic initiatives on a sequential basis fourth quarter results reflect the softer seasonal demand common to the end of the year and less favourable pricing and sales mix in all business segments these effects were partially mitigated by lower raw material prices for all of our segments acquisitions completed throughout the year and sequentially lower production costs in tissue and european boxboard year over year quarterly performance was similarly aided by lower raw material pricing and recent business acquisitions in addition to lower energy costs the resulting benefits outweighed less favourable sales pricing and mix in all segments with the exception of tissue and higher production costs in our north american operations in part due to the higher proportion of sales coming from converting activities on the strategic front cascades purchased the cdpq s 20 2 interest in our greenpac mill on january 3 2020 increasing ownership of this state of the art lightweight containerboard facility to 86 3 will improve available cash flow levels and reinforce the competitive positioning of the containerboard platform in a similar vein we continued to advance the integration of the orchids activities during the quarter and subsequently completed the conversion of the barnwell paper machine from qrt to conventional paper in mid january 2020 finally we successfully refinanced our senior notes in november taking advantage of favourable market pricing conditions to proactively manage our debt profile discussing near term outlook mr plourde commented first quarter performance is projected to improve year over year largely driven by improvements in the tissue segment as a result of our strategic repositioning and ongoing integration of the orchids activities results in our other three segments are expected to be stable with pricing headwinds for these businesses expected to be offset by improved volumes and favourable raw material pricing in containerboard and boxboard europe our operational outlook is positive for 2020 we are forecasting strong year over year improvement in the tissue segment moderate year over year improved results in specialty products and stable annual performance in boxboard europe while pricing headwinds are expected to translate into softer annual containerboard results raw material prices continue to be a strong tailwind for this business as does our focus on improved operational execution on a consolidated basis we expect to generate solid cash flow levels in 2020 of which approximately 250 million will be dedicated to capital expenditures based on current operational conditions we expect the remaining cash flow to be in excess of 100 million these funds will be allocated in part to the bear island conversion project when approved and once the financial and operational structure is finalized and to the reduction of our debt financial summary selected consolidated information in millions of canadian dollars except

the current presentation analysis of results for the three month period ended december 31 2019 compared to the same period last year sales of 1 227 million increased by 31 million or 3 compared with the same period last year specifically tissue sales increased by 57 million or 17 a reflection of increased volumes higher average selling price more favourable sales mix and the addition of orchids paper assets european boxboard sales decreased by 2 million or 1 compared with the previous year largely driven by less favourable average selling price and mix and canadian dollar euro exchange rate and slightly lower volumes the effects of which were largely mitigated by the business acquisition in spain at the end of 2018 the specialty products segment generated an 8 or 8 million sales improvement year over year reflecting 2018 acquisitions and slightly higher volumes the benefits of which outweighed slightly less favourable pricing and sales mix lastly sales in the containerboard packaging group decreased by 21 million year over year due to slightly lower volume and less favourable average selling price and sales mix year over year the corporation generated an operating income before depreciation and amortization oibd of 76 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 this compares with the 35 million generated in the same period last year this reflects impairments charges of 75 million and 34 million recorded in the tissue segment in the fourth quarters of 2018 and 2019 respectively and additional impairment charges of 14 million related to goodwill that were recorded in our recovery operations in 2019 on a year over year basis operating results benefited from more favourable raw material prices across all four businesses lower energy costs in all segments with the exception of specialty products and business acquisitions completed in the last twelve months offsetting these benefits were less favourable selling prices and mix in all segments except tissue and higher production costs in all segments largely attributable to the higher proportion of sales coming from converting activities results generated by recovery activities accounted for with corporate activities as of the current quarter negatively impacted results in the current period following year over year decreases in recycled fibre pricing operating results for 2019 also include the beneficial impact of ifrs 16 accounting for leases which increased fourth quarter 2019 oibd by approximately 7 million on an adjusted basis1 fourth quarter 2019 oibd stood at 152 million versus 113

13 2019 adjusted sales were 830 1 million and adjusted eps was 1 47 for 2019 2019 adjusted sales excluding the impact of divested products lines was 792 7 million the exhibits attached hereto provide reconciliation detail on the normalizing adjustments for the full year 2019 stoneridge reported gross profit of 213 7 million and adjusted gross profit of 219 9 million 26 5 of adjusted sales 2019 operating income was 71 3 million and adjusted operating income was 48 0 million 5 8 of adjusted sales 2019 adjusted ebitda was 80 3 million 9 7 of sales jon degaynor president and chief executive officer commented we experienced a challenging fourth quarter primarily as a result of non recurring events such as the general motors strike and incremental facility closure costs as well as inefficiencies in one of our plants it is important to place our short term performance in the context of the strides we have made in positioning stoneridge for the future we accelerated our transformation of the company in 2019 by rationalizing our product portfolio optimizing our manufacturing footprint and investing in significant new programs that will drive long term profitable growth most importantly we continued to transition our investments into advanced technologies and systems such as mirroreye that allow stoneridge to establish a highly differentiated position in our end markets as a result of our pivot toward advanced technology this year we were awarded three additional mirroreye oem programs including the largest single program in company history these awards solidify our position as the global leader in oem camera mirror systems the customer platforms on which we have been awarded mirroreye programs represent approximately 75 of the north american oem production volume with at least one major oem yet to make a sourcing decision for a frame of reference our currently awarded programs at customer quoted penetration rates represent more than 75 million of peak annual revenue if camera mirror systems were to become standard equipment our awarded programs would represent peak annual revenue of approximately 500 million with our recently awarded programs and mirroreye at customer quoted penetration rates our backlog grew by over 6 percent excluding recently divested product lines and the impact of current currency exchange rates and production forecasts full year in review control devices adjusted sales excluding the impact of divested non core product lines in 2019 totaled 396 4 million a decrease of 2 1 relative to 2018 the reduction is due to the impact of the general motors labor strike and decreased sales volumes due to volume reductions related to the legacy shift by wire programs these decreases were partially offset by increases in our china automotive european automotive and european commercial vehicle markets control devices adjusted gross margin decreased due to lower sales and increased overhead and direct material costs partially attributable to increased expediting and tariff costs compared to 2018 reductions in gross margin were partially offset by reduced sg a and d d costs resulting in adjusted operating margin of 12 1 excluding the impact of recently divested non core product lines electronics sales of 368 9 million decreased by 3 4 relative to 2018 primarily due to a decrease in sales volume in our european commercial vehicle market and unfavorable currency translation this decrease was partially offset by an increase in sales volume in our north american and china commercial vehicle markets and increased sales of european and north american off highway vehicle products electronics segment gross margin decreased due to lower sales an unfavorable product mix and increased costs related to electronic component shortages resulting in increased direct material costs the segment s adjusted operating income decreased as a result of a lower gross margin partially offset by reduced d d costs resulting in adjusted operating margin of 7 0 stoneridge brazil formerly known as pst sales of 67 5 million decreased due to lower volumes for our argentina aftermarket channel audio and alarm products tracking devices and monitoring service revenues this decrease was partially offset by higher volumes for our oem and factory authorized dealer installer products the segment s gross margin declined due to a reduction in sales volume and adverse sales mix stoneridge brazil s adjusted operating margin decreased to 3 5 due to a lower gross margin which was partially offset by lower sg a costs as a percentage of sales degaynor continued we believe the actions we executed in 2019 positioned each of our segments for continued long term success by divesting our non core products rationalizing our manufacturing footprint and investing in strategically differentiated products and capabilities control devices is increasingly well positioned to outpace our underlying markets in electronics we expect that headwinds in commercial vehicle end markets will temper revenue growth in 2020 before the ramp up of several large programs at the end of the year and into 2021 considering our additional mirroreye awards in 2019 as well as the potential for significant take rate improvement we are planning for continued and increased investment to support those awards in 2020 in 2020 the integration of stoneridge brazil into the global electronics strategy will continue with expanded regionalized product development and the ramp up of oem awards overall we will continue to focus our resources on the areas of largest opportunity for the company and drive long term value creation for our shareholders cash and debt balances as of december 31 2019 stoneridge had cash and cash equivalent balances totaling 69 4 million total debt as of december 31 2019 was 129 1 million total debt less cash and cash equivalents yields a current net debt to trailing twelve month adjusted ebitda ratio of approximately 0 7x 2020 outlook the company announced 2020 sales guidance of 750 0 770 0 million bob krakowiak chief financial officer commented we are expecting reduced 2020 revenue relative to 2019 excluding the impact of divested product lines with midpoint revenue guidance of 760 0 million driven primarily by reduced end market production forecasts and the continued ramp down of our legacy shift by wire programs we have included a modest amount of mirroreye retrofit revenue in our guidance and will continue to evaluate our assumptions as the year progresses our 2020 revenue guidance considers the fact that divested product lines contributed approximately 37 4 million to sales in 2019 moving forward we expect that the impact of new program launches will drive significant growth in 2021 and have updated our 2021 targeted revenue to reflect a growth rate of approximately 12 relative to 2020 guidance further the company announced guidance for 2020 adjusted gross margin of 28 0 29 0 adjusted operating margin of 5 0 6 0 and adjusted ebitda margin of 9 0 10 0 the company announced adjusted earnings per share guidance of 0 95 1 15 and an effective tax rate of 20 0 25 0 krakowiak continued with respect to adjusted earnings per share for comparison purposes the divested product lines reduce eps in 2020 by approximately 0 09 in 2020 we are expecting 8 to 12 million of incremental operational improvements that will be partially offset by on going investment in resources to support multiple future program launches and continued new product development finally we anticipate our effective tax rate in 2020 to be 20 to 25 compared to 8 4 in 2019 which reduces eps by approximately 0 23 based on the midpoint of our guided tax rate in consideration of the impact of divested product lines reduced revenue due primarily to externalities operational improvements and incremental investment to support future growth as well as the increased tax rate we are expecting a midpoint adjusted eps of 1 05 in 2020 share repurchase program krakowiak commented our expectations are for continued strong growth due in part to increasingly optimistic views related to the penetration rate of oem mirroreye programs as well as significant opportunities for margin expansion because of these strong expectations the company s board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program for up to 50 million over the next 18 months this is in addition to the 50 million share repurchase authorization we announced late in 2018 we believe that executing share

inorganic investments the company s common shares may be repurchased from time to time at prevailing prices subject to market conditions common share price and other considerations the repurchases may

the following post was written and or published as a collaboration between benzinga s in house sponsored content team and a financial partner of benzinga while the fourth quarter of 2018 saw stocks wobble risky assets have performed exceptionally well over the past 13 months or so pushing valuations for both stocks and bonds to the upper end of historical ranges looking at data stretching back to 1990 for some clues toward valuation equities stand at the 83rd percentile using the price to earnings multiple and bonds are at the 94th percentile using yield to worst suggesting that each asset has been richer at certain times but are far from cheap 2020 has brought new headline risks for investors to absorb especially around the novel coronavirus which started in wuhan china by many accounts chinese authorities are taking aggressive measures to contain the outbreak and limit its contagion effects these actions are likely helping to limit the negative humanitarian impact but may also have a perverse effect on the economy as production remains limited for what increasingly looks like an extended time this also impacts the supply side for many companies with sizable chinese exposure this backdrop does not necessarily spell the end of the bull market as global financial conditions remain loose but it does make the case for investors to look for diversification options to complement their portfolios with stock and bond valuations high and volatility likely increasing preparing for the worst investors have a multitude of options that deliver uncorrelated or even inversely correlated returns to equities ranging from the simple to the complex to the manufactured in today s market investors may benefit from recalling occam s razor when it comes to seeking a solution for their portfolios as simpler approaches may have greater benefits than sophisticated ones first and foremost complexity comes with a price whether that be higher expenses or a higher requirement for understanding the drivers of the diversification potential and its ability to do so going forward going with your g u t in the spirit of keeping it simple one can look at three distinct assets gold utility stocks and long term treasurys and examine their historical correlations to the s p 500 over the 8 year period illustrated below gold has a 0 07 correlation utilities a 0 23 correlation and long term treasuries a 0 32 correlation while individually these assets will see their correlations shift through time with utilities recently having a higher correlation and long term treasuries a lower one the trio of asset classes together delivers an average correlation of 0 00 perhaps more importantly all of the three have relatively stable volatilities and are uncorrelated with each other making them attractive from a diversification perspective gold utilities and long term treasurys have low correlation to stocks source bloomberg finance l p as of february 1 2012 to january 31 2020 gold represented by the lbma gold price pm utilities represented by the solactive us large mid cap utilities index and long term treasuries represented by the solactive us 20 year treasury bond index one cannot invest directly in an index flight to safety since march 2015 investors have added over 179 billion to what bloomberg intelligence has classified as representing safe haven etfs this group includes funds offering exposure to gold us treasuries and low volatility equities over this period us treasurys have seen the greatest interest with over 105 6 billion of inflows while gold has been the least with 19 1 billion of inflows flows across these 3 groups have averaged 3 billion monthly with us treasurys accounting for more than half of that seeing 1 8 billion monthly both the cumulative totals and consistent monthly net flows highlight how etf investors may be interested in potentially buffering their portfolios in the event of a sell off in other words while safe havens saw an impressive 36 2 billion of inflows in the fourth quarter of 2018 activity was consistent and generally positive before and after this most recent sell off investors have been adding to safe havens even with robust stock markets source bloomberg finance l p as of march 1 2015 to february 14 2020 data represents the net flows of u s listed etfs that bloomberg intelligence has classified as safe haven etfs including gold us treasurys and low volatility equity what s next heading into 2020 consensus among economists was that we should see an acceleration of global economic growth thanks to a combination of reduced uncertainty around trade looser monetary policy and a general pickup in activity especially in the emerging markets while this view may eventually come to fruition it likely needs to be pushed out into the future thanks to the impact that the coronavirus will have on china and all of its related trade linkages relative to bonds stocks continue to look attractive however the path forward looks increasingly volatile making the case for introducing defensive exposures gold and treasurys offering diversification potential relative to stocks is intuitive but utilities having a 0 23 correlation may be less so in addition to generally stable revenue and cash flow streams one driver is related to the profile of utilities being a sector with above average dividend yields implying that a greater portion of an investor s total return would come from income as opposed to capital appreciation all else being equal another sector with high income potential and interest rate sensitivity is real estate however real estate has a much higher beta or sensitivity of its volatility to the s p 500 than utilities do so while their most recent beta for real estate is below that of utilities it is higher more often than not and does not offer the consistency that investors require when it comes to diversified exposures that are intended to be there for them when they need it most a greater concern for utilities may be that related to their current valuation they look expensive relative to history and the broader market however as previously noted the market itself is at the top end of its valuation range one could agree that out of favor sectors like energy may be a better buffer than utilities from a valuation standpoint but that would be ignoring the impact that energy firms have a heavy reliance on the demand for petrochemicals which would likely be negatively impacted in the event of a selloff while investors should always be cognizant of the valuation they are paying for any asset in today s market utilities are not necessarily in a position to perform differently than they have in previous pullbacks simply because they are trading richly relative to current sales and earnings compared to real estate utilities have a lower beta to the s p 500 on average source bloomberg finance l p as of

maturing debt revise our dividend policy or fund other uses of capital that we believe will enhance stockholder value free cash flow is considered a non gaap financial measure under the rules of the sec free cash flow is limited and does not represent remaining cash flow available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct payments required for debt maturities payments made for business acquisitions or required pension contributions if any therefore it is important to view free cash flow in addition to rather than as a substitute for our entire statement of

a bipartisan us congressional delegation led by representative ami bera who chairs the house foreign affairs committee s hfac subcommittee on asia the pacific and nonproliferation was in nepal earlier this week the four member delegation that included representative george holding member of the house ways means committee staff director at the subcommittee on asia the pacific and nonproliferation nikole burroughs and senior professional staff member at hfac sajit gandhi held meetings with government officials civil society leaders staff at the us embassy and the millennium challenge corporation among others on the sideline of their visit to nepal nagarik daily s guna raj luitel and republica s kosh raj koirala talked to ami bera to learn more about us foreign policy on nepal latest controversies about the mcc and other issues pertaining to the nepal us relations excerpts can you begin by explaining the purpose of this delegation i am democratic member of congress and george holding is republican so this is bipartisan delegation we have travelled extensively together and both of us have deep appreciation of south asia i just assumed chairmanship of the foreign affairs sub committee committee that has jurisdiction over asia so this is my first trip as chairman one of the priorities of this committee is looking at young democracies in asia and what are the things we are doing as the us supports the young democracies and then what are things that we should be doing so we have to come to south asia nepal was one of the choices for our visit because our embassy and some of our workers at usaid are helping nepal to do the same as a chairman that is also my priority we also wanted to talk to your leadership how they find it we also visited sri lanka which is also coming out of decades of civil war we wanted to see how they are doing as a democracy and in the reconciliation process we also made a brief visit to india to talk to indian leadership about what is happening in india today we wanted to get a sense of this from them and then nepal is actually the longest of our trip i had never been here i think it is important for us to learn about those countries the best way to learn about the countries is to visit those countries what impression do you have after your visit to nepal two things have struck me first thing is how happy our embassy staffs are each of the embassy members i talked to is happy to come to nepal and many of them intend to extend their time in nepal that tells me something how they feel about people and the country secondly i also found people happy again that is my three day impression best part of the trip was getting out of kathmandu to see some of the usaid programs we could see the activities of peace corps members and local people you also met with the political leaders what sense did you get out of that meeting we met with prime minister foreign minister and the finance minister they are grateful for the partnership with the united states we are grateful that we got high level meetings that tells us that they value the presence of the united states we heard from each other we talked about how their democracy is coming along and how things could be made better they would like more us investment more private sector investment coming in one of the reasons why mcc is such an important tool is that it signals to business community that this is a good place to make investment mcc has lately courted serious controversy in nepal with a section of leaders of ruling party arguing that there are many smaller agreements within the mcc a task force formed earlier by the ruling ncp to study about the content of the mcc agreement suggested that parliament should endorse the agreement only after the amendment is it true that mcc has different smaller agreements not to my knowledge mcc was negotiated by the nepali government with the united states the government is the one that actually chose the project s focus areas i think the government actually chose to focus on the right areas of power transmission and transportation infrastructures those were not things united states asked to focus they are the ones nepali government choosing that would have the highest impact i do not think there are any side languages mcc is an incredibly valuable tool other countries that have entered into the mcc compact have used this as a tool for their development it is a tool to encourage more business presence we think it is in nepal s interest nepal has signed the compact to help build the power line any members of the parliament can take time to read the compact agreement if they have questions as far as i am concerned it is a pretty standard agreement and that is in nepali government s interests a significant amount of investment dollars that the government will be able to use is the best for nepal obviously we want some transparency and that the funds are being used where they are meant to be used but nepali government is actually in charge of how they implement those funds for those two projects part of the reasons why the mcc seems to have courted controversy is because of different interpretations can you explain in a simpler terms what exactly is the mcc compact it is a tool that gives us ability to partner with the recipient government it is really a grant so we are not saying here is how you have to use those funds what we are saying is when we entered into that compact the government that is receiving those funds is selecting the projects in focus areas making sure that there is transparency and there is good business practice because we think that sends signals to the us business community and even the international business community that this is a serious place we should start thinking about investing our resources that is the simplest way to explain about it what we are not telling here is how you should use the funds we just want to make sure that there is transparency in the way funds are being used some of the ruling party leaders even allege that the mcc is the us strategy to encircle china what do you say to this i would ask how helping nepal improve its energy transmission infrastructures or improve the road transportation system helps to encircle china i would tell them to read the compact i would also ask them to talk to their own government it is one which picked the projects under the compact did you have any words from prime minister about the endorsement of the mcc through the parliament since the implementation calendar of the mcc projects has already been affected we emphasized that we believe in nepal and we believe in nepal s future and the mcc is a tool that helps nepal to realize that future if you build strong nepal if you build strong economy in nepal those are tools of democracy that is the underpinnings of a strong democracy those are the decisions nepal s people and the governments have to make yes the implementation timeline is in june and that is coming very quickly there are many countries that clearly require assistances i would encourage nepali government to have questions with who signed the compact they negotiated and signed to answer those questions i would encourage them not to be swayed by disinformation there are probably others who are putting information out that are not accurate there is a timeline here at some juncture congress will say there are a lot other countries young democracies which want to have 500 million dollars mcc compact is a public document take that document and read that now to see if there are any things that you are concerned about misinformation is not unique to nepal you see them in our elections you see them in our politics but at the end of the day it is for us as elected leaders and officials in our country to take the decision we say same things to the leaders in nepal they should also ask themselves as this tool is aimed at development we think it is in nepal s benefits if they do not choose and pursue to implement the mcc compact what signals will that send to the business community and i would say they should take time to read the mcc compact and ask our embassy questions we in congress think that it is in nepal s interest to have electrical generation transmission capability we think that would help generate income for nepal from many other projects we also think businesses are going to invest here transportation system roads infrastructures and those are all important things for companies more importantly for us companies if you want that foreign investment the compact sends strong signal for the investment community mcc is also defined as part of us led indo pacific strategy how do we understand indo pacific strategy where does nepal figure into that the indo pacific strategy is a maritime security strategy it is a strategy of free movement of goods and services that s all the way from the indian ocean through the pacific ocean nepal fits into it from democracy perspectives it s really a strategy of movement of goods and services nepal is a young democracy and we want nepal to be successful we think democracy is the best form of the government because it is responsive to the people and we see the potential in nepal which is why the us members of congress chose to come here indo pacific strategy does not fit into any larger geopolitical strategy other than for strong and a democratic nepal how do you assess the state of civil liberties including press freedom in nepal there was not any direct conversation about this with the officials but we did emphasize on foundational values of a strong democracy is a freedom of press that s incredibly important we talked little bit about information and disinformation it is important that there is freedom of press and that there is no censorship was there any discussion about transitional justice as well not at that depth other than both our embassy and the us members of the congress emphasized part of the healing process after years of civil wars is helping families find closer and is looking for accountability that s up to the nepali side to decide what that process looks like but again you hear me say strong democracy part of that is democracy has to represent all the people and part of that is having reconciliation process that heals the country after the civil wars and that takes time but ultimately that is up to the nepali people to decide what the process should look like are there any future plans and programs of the united states parliament to work together with the parliament of nepal we have an open invitation for the nepali parliamentarians to come visit the members of the congress we think the strongest link is between parliamentarians that is because the president might be in power for four years or eight years and sometimes they shift their agendas but members of congress generally are here for a longer period of time and when you think about a long term strategic relationship with nepal as you are building your democracy recovering from the earthquake and building your economy that does not happen in four years or eight years there should be a long term partnership the successful implementation of mcc could give a positive message in bringing more fdi in nepal do you have any suggestions for nepal on how should nepal project itself in the international arena to bring more fdis in the country i think the couple of potential areas for nepal are tourism and hydroelectricity the tourism sector is the area where the us has expertise working with nepali companies we want nepal to build the industry as there are opportunities to develop eco tourism and high end tourism i think visit nepal 2020 is an example of the government projecting the country as a great place to visit the government has already identified hydroelectric capacity of the country the unique geography of nepal lends itself to electricity generation and i think the reason they chose to focus on transmission line under mcc compact is that they can generate more electricity than nepal actually needs nepal should sell the electricity generated to the countries that are in the need of power this can generate income and revenue for nepal these are two obvious areas for nepal in what areas can nepal and the united states work together i think the nepali government made the right decision with the mcc the 500 million dollar can help nepal build reliable electricity excess capacity and ability for transmission that reliability is going to be important as it helps bring in foreign direct investment to nepal there is a satellite company in california named astranis space technologies nepal would like to have its own satellite i think in a mountainous country like this that makes sense i think they can deliver this to nepal at a better price with faster speed if you get a deal like that it sends signals to all the companies not just us companies that this is the place where you can make investment do you intend to suggest anything to the us government that can be helpful for the development of nepal after your visit here we would like to make sure nepal is a successful democracy nepal is still a young democracy i see some of the farmers working in one of the rural parts of the country the farmers are entrepreneurial and i was impressed to see increase in the level of productivity with a small investment a step of democracy is when people have jobs and income also a step of democracy is when they feel that they can make the lives of children better that is why we use the tools to identify the assets any country has the government and the people should make the decisions that are in the best interest of the country the government should think what s in the best interest of nepali people every country in this region will have relationships with both china and the united states to make sure the partnerships are in the best interest of people people see the united states as a role model of democracy in your opinion what leads democracy to fail as nepal is a new democracy what do you think are the imminent threats for democracy here democracy fails when the government is not responsive to people the government can t solve every problem but it has to be responsible to people at the end of the day people would like to believe that if they work harder they can create a better life for their children but if the government isn t transparent and is corrupt people start thinking that voting does not matter that is when the democracy fails

here is the post earlier on case shiller case shiller national house price index increased 3 8 year over year in december it has been almost thirteen years since the bubble peak in the case shiller release today the seasonally adjusted national index sa was reported as being 15 8 above the previous bubble peak however in real terms the national index sa is still about 6 6 below the bubble peak and historically there has been an upward slope to real house prices the composite 20 in real terms is still 14 0 below the bubble peak the year over year growth in prices increased to 3 8 nationally as expected with lower mortgage rates and fewer homes for sell usually people graph nominal house prices but it is also important to look at prices in real terms inflation adjusted case shiller and others report nominal house prices as an example if a house price was 200 000 in january 2000 the price would be close to 291 000 today adjusted for inflation 45 that is why the second graph below is important this shows real prices adjusted for inflation nominal house prices the first graph shows the monthly case shiller national index sa and the monthly case shiller composite 20 sa through december in nominal terms as reported in nominal terms the case shiller national index sa and the case shiller composite 20 index sa are both at new all times highs above the bubble peak real house prices the second graph shows the same two indexes in real terms adjusted for inflation using cpi less shelter note some people use other inflation measures to adjust for real prices in real terms the national index is back to march 2005 levels and the composite 20 index is back to july 2004 in real terms house prices are at 2004 2005 levels price to rent in october 2004 fed economist john krainer and researcher chishen wei wrote a fed letter on price to rent ratios house prices and fundamental value kainer and wei presented a price to rent ratio using the ofheo house price index and the owners equivalent rent oer from the bls here is a similar graph using the case shiller national and composite 20 house price indexes this graph shows the price to rent ratio january 2000 1 0 the price to rent ratio has been moving sideways recently on a price to rent basis the case shiller national index is back to march 2004 levels and the composite 20 index is back to november 2003 levels in real terms prices are back to late 2004 levels and the price to rent ratio is back to late 2003 early 2004
annual production targeted at approx 5 0 million tonnes of high grade low impurity iron concentrate grading 65 iron with 0 6 v2o5 per tonne of concentrate initial capex c 457 5 million payback period of 3 0 years current mineral resource estimate supports a potential mine life of 37 years total site operating costs of c 52 38 t of concentrate over potential lom upside potential from resource expansion and the potential to expand production toronto on accesswire february 27 2020 vanadium one iron corp vanadium one or the company tsxv vone is pleased to announce the results of its preliminary economic assessment pea at its mont sorcier iron and vanadium project located near chibougamau quebec the pea was completed by independent consulting group csa global consultants canada ltd csa global an erm group company pea summary results the pea for mont sorcier was based upon the mineral resource estimate outlined in the company s most recently released national instrument 43 101 technical report dated april 23 2019 the pea outlines a robust economic assessment for mont sorcier based on a traditional open pit mining scenario with magnetic separation processing to produce approximately 5 0 million tonnes per annum of vanadium rich iron concentrates with low levels of impurities based on test work to date this material is amenable for direct blast furnace route use cliff hale sanders president and ceo of vanadium one iron commented we are very pleased that the results of the pea support our vision for the potential of the mont sorcier project to be a profitable long life operation located in an established mining region mont sorcier has strong access to infrastructure already in place which reduces upfront capital requirements and with the production of premium 65 high grade iron concentrate with vanadium credits we believe these characteristics position mont sorcier as one of the premier iron development projects in the world based upon the results of the pea the company is confident in its ability to improve the economics of this initial pea through improved resource definition and growth ongoing project optimization efforts and further metallurgical test work to enhance product quality even further going forward the company will now focus on developing strategic partnerships to complete a feasibility study to bring mont sorcier to a formal development decision as quickly as possible the pea was prepared by csa global incorporating contributions from vulcan technologies for the iron and vanadium market pricing study the pea is preliminary in nature as it includes inferred mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves and there is no certainty that the preliminary economic assessment will be realized project summary mont sorcier is located approximately 18 km east of chibougamau quebec in a region with a long history of mining and robust infrastructure in place to support future development mont sorcier has access to all season roads low cost provincial hydro power and is within 20km of the rail head connected to two all season ocean going ports the railway runs approximately 370 km to the port of saguenay and is currently underutilized providing sufficient capacity for the project needs iron and vanadium pricing market study in preparation for the pea the company commissioned an independent market pricing study to determine the potential value of the vanadium rich iron product produced by mont sorcier given the lack of available quoted market index prices the study was completed by paul vermeulen of vulcan technologies in late october 2019 the study reviewed main iron index price forecasts as well as estimates of the applicable vanadium credits the study reviewed a value in use methodology based upon a review of the grade and concentrate chemistry from mont sorcier relative to other similar iron products and the study concluded that the concentrate from mont sorcier should receive a us 15 t premium to the platts 65 price iron index for the contained vanadium credits based on a net attributable value using a long term v2o5 price of 7 25 lb the pea used a concentrate selling price aligned with those in the vulcan market study october 2019 with an average value over the life of the project at c 140 79 t an example of the pricing for 65 concentrate is provided in the table below mining the mine design is based on the sequential mining of the south zone followed by the north zone using standard open pit mining techniques of drill blast and haul this will allow for the south pit to be used for waste disposition in future years csa global has developed a mine plan which processes 555 million tonnes of the current resource base over a 37 year mine life at an average strip ratio of 0 89 to 1 mining will reach a peak of material movement of approximately 44 million tonnes per annum mining costs are estimated at c 2 29 t of material moved sio 2 content will be kept under 2 5 through pit grade control practice to maintain above 65 fe in concentrate mont sorcier mine production profile source csa global metallurgy and processing as outlined in a press release dated february 10 2020 vanadium one iron engaged corem to undertake initial metallurgical test work to support the recoverability of the iron and vanadium into concentrates the results of the test work confirmed the production of premium high grade 65 8 iron concentrate with 0 67 v2o5 expected at mont sorcier averaged from 4 composite samples representing high and low grade drill core samples from the north and south deposits the processing plant designed for mont sorcier is in line with similar projects in production globally using standard equipment and technologies the pea has included crushing and grinding to a p95 of 45 microns to ensure the production of premium concentrate grades with three stages of magnetic separation based upon the mine plan mont sorcier is expected to produce a life of mine average concentrate grading 65 iron with 0 6 v2o5 mont sorcier plant process flowsheet source csa global infrastructure the site is located with access to all weather roads water low cost grid hydro power and sufficient railway capacity to support project development with only modest infrastructure capital needs the pea incorporates expenditures required for additional infrastructure including auxiliary buildings electrical grid connection rail loading facilities at the mine site and unloading facilities at the port of saguenay this also includes a new rail loop at the mine to improve loading efficiencies for the pea it has been assumed all concentrate production will be rail hauled to the port of saguenay for international shipment to china given the proximity to chibougamau no permanent camp is required for the anticipated permanent workforce in addition the project will also include new tailing facilities in a location to be determined after consultation with local stakeholders and additional engineering and design capital costs upfront capital costs are estimated at c 457 5 million with a pay back of 3 0 years with an after tax irr of 33 8 sustaining capital is estimated at c 600 7 million over the life of mine and is principally related to equipment replacement capital costs include a 15 continency for equipment and 30 for plant and infrastructure it should be noted that included within mine capital costs is c 229 1 million c 28 8 million initial capex for the mining fleet and c 226 million c 31 5 million initial capex for rail cars for concentrate transport based upon expressions of interest from vendors management is of the view these items can be readily leased to reduce initial capital needs with an increase in operating costs this will be determined at a later date based upon the receipt of more formal quotes as will a review of the potential benefits of using contract mining operating costs the lom operating costs are estimated at c 52 38 t of concentrate produced and delivered to the port of saguenay and loaded onto a vessel additional selling costs related to ocean freight are expected to add c 27 78 per tonne of concentrate assuming delivery to china transport costs could be reduced significantly should the company find a north american purchaser note cash costs is a non ifrs financial performance measure with no standard definition under ifrs the company provides them as supplementary information that management believes may be useful investors tax assumptions for the pea a simple after tax model was developed for the mont sorcier project pending a more detailed review in the future all costs are in 2020 canadian dollars with no allowance for inflation or escalation the mont sorcier project is subject to three levels of taxation including federal income tax provincial income tax and provincial mining taxes quebec mining tax rate of 16 income tax rate of 26 5 federal and provincial combined the federal and provincial corporate tax rates currently applicable over the project s operating life are 15 0 and 11 5 of taxable income respectively the marginal tax rates applicable under the recently adopted mining tax regulations in quebec are 16 22 and 28 of taxable income and depend on the profit margin as the project concerns the processing of iron concentrate at the mine site a processing allowance rate of 10 was assumed actual taxes payable will be affected by corporate activities profitability and current and future tax benefits that have not been considered the combined effect on the project of the three levels of taxation including the elements described above is an appropriate cumulative effective tax rate of 30 3 based on project earnings it is anticipated based on the current project assumptions that the company will pay approximately c 2 715 million in direct tax payments to the provincial and federal governments over the life of mine based on the operating and commodity price assumptions used in the pea overall project economics the overall project shows potentially robust economic results with a an after tax npv at 8 discount rate of c 1 699 million and irr of 33 8 project economics are based on a potential 37 year mine life with a 3 year payback period with positive after tax cash flow commencing in year 1 total cumulative after tax free cash flow over the life of mine is estimated at c 6 253 million sensitivities the table below highlights the main project sensitivities proposed development program in light of the robust pea results the company is in the process of developing a detailed development plan and budget to determine the requirements to bring mont sorcier to a development decision with the completion of a formal feasibility study while details are still being finalized such a program would be expected to take approximately 24 months from commencement consisting of the following key components undertake a formal strategic review of potential development partners and enter into an agreement to support project development and future funding requirements undertake additional drilling to improve resource confidence levels to support a feasibility study a total of approximately 12 000 meters is recommended to complete this program undertake further metallurgical testing to determine final concentrate characteristics to optimize final product specifications and to enhance overall recovery based upon more detailed resource and mine sequencing details commence environmental base line studies commence formal discussion with first nations and local community groups to negotiate an impact and benefits agreement commence and complete the required permitting process increased management and operational capacity with the addition of key specialists to bring the project to a final development decision commence and complete project financing negotiations mineral resource estimate the pea is based on a mine plan derived from the mineral resource estimate dated april 23 2019 outlined below mineral resource estimate1 at mont sorcier using a cut off grade2 of 14 fe 1 numbers have been rounded to reflect the precision of inferred and indicated mineral resource estimates 2 the reporting cut off was calculated for a saleable magnetite concentrate containing 65 fe with price of us 90 t of dry concentrate 50 of the price of v2o5

on aug 18 china s stock market plummeted by a vertigo inducing 6 2 percent in one day of trading part of a months long decline that s erased over 3 trillion worth of market value from the country s equity markets that followed last week s surprise decision to allow the value of the renminbi rmb china s currency to fall several percentage points against the u s dollar which some view as a move intended to aid chinese exports as the country s economy flags global markets have appeared rattled with major media outlets repeatedly invoking the specter of financial contagion from falling chinese stocks and with major equity indices of the world s biggest economies mostly retrenching in the days following the recent rmb devaluation how real is the threat of a global recession led by a deteriorating chinese economy tea leaf nation asked several experts to respond to the recent hand wringing stephen roach of the yale school of management was previously morgan stanley s chief economist patrick chovanec is chief strategist and managing director at silvercrest asset management and an adjunct professor at columbia university s school of international and public affairs derek scissors is a resident scholar at the american enterprise institute daniel rosen is partner and co founder of the rhodium group an advisory company and an adjunct professor at columbia university s graduate school of international and public affairs david wertime if and when a china led recession happens how might it differ in its particulars from previous global recessions that is what might a recession with chinese characteristics look like stephen roach the outpouring of concern over the likelihood of a chinese recession is vastly overblown in my view yes china is struggling with a number of complex problems the downside of a major equity bubble excesses in its property market deleveraging from a debt intensive growth spurt in the aftermath of the great crisis of 2008 2009 and a decline in exports stemming mainly from sluggish growth in its major trading partners in the developed world for the rest of the world this powerful shift in the basic structure of china s growth model from a focus on production to an emphasis on consumption feels very much like a recession it puts especially severe pressures on resource based economies such as australia brazil and canada as well as on producers of components and parts largely in east asia that drive exports through china centric supply chains the sharp correction in global commodity prices is a direct outgrowth of the cumulative weakening in china s old model of commodity intensive economic activity overlooked is this seemingly recession like contraction in the old china is the emergence of a new and increasingly powerful source of economic growth a shift to services led activity in 2014 china s services based tertiary sector rose to 48 2 percent of chinese gdp up four percentage points from 2010 and well in excess of the 42 6 percent share in the manufacturing and construction led secondary sector chinese urban job growth has averaged slightly over 13 million in 2013 2014 fully 30 percent faster than what the government had been targeting at 10 million moreover the data flow in early 2015 suggests that urban job creation is holding near the impressive pace of recent years patrick chovanec a correction in china isn t the event we ve been dreading it s the event we ve been waiting for worries about china s economic downturn causing a global recession are based on the assumption that all growth is good growth no matter where it happens or what it consists of and that a downturn in china s growth must be bad for everyone in fact a lot of the growth we ve seen in china these past several years has been bad growth or growth in quotation marks that is harmful to the global economy having created huge overcapacity and adding to a global glut of supply versus demand china s over investment boom inflated the price of inputs like copper iron ore and oil but it deflated the price of all kinds of finished goods the end of that boom is deflationary for inputs which is clearly being felt by commodity producers but by curbing overcapacity and shifting resources to the chinese consumer it will eventually help reflate other markets derek scissors weaker chinese growth has already pounded commodities producers and unnerved asset markets but not triggered a global recession since the ensuing lower prices simultaneously help commodities buyers financial contagion is unlikely since china is largely cut off from the rest of the world financially due to its closed capital account conversation can xi jinping turn china s economy around arthur r kroeber george chen more on monday the shanghai composite index fell 8 5 percent erasing all of the gains it had made in an extraordinary run up this year the drop was the second 8 5 percent drop in recent weeks the first such drop the occasion for the conversation the way china triggers a global gdp recession is to try to export problems this is happening in steel for example if trade intervention occurred it would expand china s trade surplus further cutting into rest of world gdp it would also intensify the deflationary pressure china has exported for the past 15 years which has been beneficial at some points but is harmful now a recession with chinese characteristics thus looks like one we ve feared off and on since the 1930s deflation triggered by beggar thy neighbor behavior it wouldn t be as sharp as the depression but would have multiple similarities a major producer united states then china now reacts to a bubble popping by trying to squeeze gains out of its trade partners seeing as they are already running large deficits with this large and suddenly irresponsible actor the trade partners show no hesitation in retaliating and off we go though again not in the same devastating fashion as the 1930 s wertime is china better or worse equipped than the united states to safeguard against a recessionary event roach while it sounds very clever to call this a recession with chinese characteristics i think it misses the point of the powerful structural transformation that is now reshaping china s economy china has not repealed the laws of the business cycle the stiff headwinds it is now facing are certainly having an adverse impact on the industrial sector underpinnings of exports and investment the recent shift in chinese currency policy from a decade of rmb appreciation to what i suspect will be a protracted depreciation is a clear effort on the part of chinese policymakers to cushion the blow targeted fiscal initiatives and recent accommodative shifts in monetary policy are also aimed at tempering the downside pressures notwithstanding these initiatives the most important thing that china can do to safeguard its economy is to stay the course of reform and rebalancing and provide ongoing support for the transformation to a new services led increasingly consumer driven economy if china were to backtrack on those efforts then it would find itself quickly in the same box that the major developed economies are now trapped in a quagmire of anemic growth with attendant pressures on jobs and social stability the good news is that china has not succumbed to this temptation daniel rosen china is a middle income developing economy several decades away from having the institutions and mechanisms advanced market economies use to safeguard against excess volatility including on the downside over economic cycles conversation how much does the chinese market matter to the world yukon huang ira kalish more china s main market reflected in the shanghai composite index has fallen 24 percent since june 12 losing 2 4 trillion in value while many analysts are focused on the financial crisis in greece some are beginning to wonder if china s woes chovanec what the rest of the world should care about isn t chinese output gdp growth but chinese consumption growth even in the face of a downturn chinese consumer demand has the capacity to remain relatively resilient people talk about china being a global growth driver but in fact by running chronic trade surpluses it has been a growth deriver by propping up consumption in the face of an otherwise wrenching economic adjustment china can become a source of much needed demand and a true growth driver for the world economy the correction taking place in china is essential to making that happen scissors the question is not whether china is better equipped to safeguard against a recession compared to the united states now that answer is easy the united states is far far better equipped we have much richer consumers and an economy structured to serve them we already run large trade deficits and can absorb even more in the way of foreign goods and services because we have the global reserve currency china has none of these things its successful stimulus in the past has been production stimulus exactly the opposite of what is needed china now would be a very bad joke as global economic leader wertime might a china led recession perversely mark its arrival as a great global power roach there is no shortcut to global power for china that can only come with a more sustainable approach to growth and development the chinese economy has come a long way in a very short period of time but in many respects this was a powerful catch up from the growth that was squandered in the quarter of a century under mao zedong s leadership from 1949 to 1976 if anything china stayed the course of the catch up model for too long resulting in what former premier wen jiabao called an unbalanced unstable uncoordinated and unsustainable economy it was in retrospect a recipe for trouble china s stature as a global economic power can only come with a rebalanced and more sustainable economy a recession in the old catch up model is not sufficient to spark that ascendancy unless it is accompanied by increased dynamism of the new but it is likely to take years if not decades to reach the promised land in the meantime it is ludicrous to expect instant gratification from the current set of tough adjustments rosen previous chinese recessions came and went without marking the arrival of a new great global power the extent of china s global power is more dependent on other factors such as confidence in the sustainability of its political systems environmental stewardship and ability to host basic capital markets than it is on beijing s tolerance for business cycles scissors the extent of the damage the united states did to the world economy in the 1930s was due in part to the absence of a global economic leader britain had declined and germany had aborted its own rise right now the united states is still by far the dominant economic power according to credit suisse american national wealth is almost twice that of china and japan combined the average american makes 12 times as much annually as the average chinese china is even pegged to the u s dollar as long as the united states does not abandon its role china cannot announce a larger presence on the world stage by causing a major downturn it may well be that more bad economic choices make the united states in 2030 look like britain in 1930 and open the door for china to be globally irresponsible but it s at least as possible that china in 2030 will be staggeringly deep in debt demographically contracting and the latest example of a statist failure chovanec the impact of china s slowdown is not unlike the impact of japan s boom and bust like china japan was a chronic surplus country that derived growth from u s consumer demand japan did not drive u s growth in the 1980s demand from america helped drive japanese growth when japan faltered and growth stagnated through the 1990s it didn t take the u s economy down with it because it was never driving the u s economy in the first place i m not saying this adjustment won t be a bumpy path or that the benefits will be immediately apparent and anyone betting on the existing patterns of growth to continue is in for a rude surprise but the net effect of china rebalancing will be positive for the global economy and for the u s economy none of this by the way depends on chinese policymakers getting it right this change is coming whether they embrace it or not
risk of global recession in 2020 revitalized by coronavirus outbreak us yield curve inversion deepens as business activity contracts recession risk is back on the rise and largely attributable to expected economic impact from the coronavirus outbreak the us dollar has crumbled since notching a three year high as preliminary markit pmi data for february showed us business activity contracted to

tumble to 49 6 for february and is down from a reading of 53 3 the month prior even more worrisome than the composite pmi figure was a nosedive in the services business activity index which fell at

permeating across the broader market can be observed by taking a look at the us treasury yield curve given its historical usefulness in predicting potential economic downturns a notable flattening of

specifically the 3m10s and 2s10s yield curve spreads dropped from 30 bps and 34 bps respectively at the beginning of the year to the latest measurements of 0 17 and 0 16 this largely stems from the anticipated drag on global gdp growth due to the novel coronavirus outbreak which has led investors to flee risk and seek safety provided by long dated government bonds such as 10 year or 30 year

assumptions believed to be reasonable as of the date atlantica published fy 2019 financial results atlantica disclaims any current intention to update such guidance except as required by law non gaap financial measures this press release also includes certain non gaap financial measures including further adjusted ebitda including unconsolidated affiliates further adjusted ebitda including unconsolidated affiliates as a percentage of revenues margin and cafd non gaap financial measures are not measurements of our performance or liquidity under ifrs as issued by the iasb and should not be considered alternatives to operating profit or profit for the period or any other performance measures derived in accordance with ifrs as issued by the iasb or any other generally accepted accounting principles or as alternatives to cash flow from operating investing or financing activities please refer to the appendix of this presentation for a reconciliation of the non gaap financial measures included in this press release to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with ifrs as well as the reasons why management believes the use of non gaap financial measures in this presentation provides useful information we present non gaap financial measures because we believe that they and other similar measures are widely used by certain investors securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of performance and liquidity the non gaap financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under ifrs as issued by the iasb non gaap financial measures and ratios are not measurements of our performance or liquidity under ifrs as issued by the iasb and should not be considered as alternatives to operating profit or profit for the period or any other performance measures derived in accordance with ifrs as issued by the iasb or any other generally accepted accounting principles or as alternatives to cash flow from operating investing or financing activities some of the limitations of these non gaap measures are they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments they do not reflect changes in or cash requirements for our working capital needs they may not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debts although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges the assets being depreciated and amortized will often need to be replaced in the future and further adjusted ebitda and cafd do not reflect any cash requirements that would be required for such replacements some of the exceptional items that we eliminate in calculating further adjusted ebitda reflect cash payments that were made or will be made in the future and the fact that other companies in our industry may calculate further adjusted ebitda and cafd differently than we do which limits their usefulness as comparative measures we define further adjusted ebitda including unconsolidated affiliates as profit loss for the period attributable to the company after adding back loss profit attributable to non controlling interest from continued operations income tax share of profit loss of associates carried under the equity method finance expense net depreciation amortization and impairment charges cafd is calculated as cash distributions received by the company from its subsidiaries minus all cash expenses of the company including debt service and general and administrative expenses our management believes further adjusted ebitda including unconsolidated affiliates and cafd is useful to investors and other users of our financial statements in evaluating our operating performance because it provides them with an additional tool to compare business performance across companies and across periods further adjusted ebitda is widely used by investors to measure a company s operating performance without regard to items such as interest expense taxes depreciation and amortization which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired our management believes cafd is a relevant supplemental measure of the company s ability to earn and distribute cash returns to investors and that cafd is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance because securities analysts and other interested parties use such calculations as a measure of our ability to make quarterly distributions in addition cafd is used by our management team for determining future acquisitions and managing our growth further adjusted ebitda and cafd are widely used by other companies in the same industry our management uses further adjusted ebitda and cafd as measures of operating performance to assist in comparing performance from period to period on a consistent basis and to readily view operating trends as a measure for planning and forecasting overall expectations and for evaluating actual results against such expectations and in communications with our board of directors shareholders creditors analysts and investors concerning our financial performance in our discussion of operating results we have included foreign exchange impacts in our revenue and further adjusted ebitda including unconsolidated affiliates by providing constant currency growth the constant currency presentation is not a measure recognized under ifrs and excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates we believe providing constant currency information provides valuable supplemental information regarding our results of operations we calculate constant currency amounts by converting our current period local currency revenue and further adjusted ebitda using the prior period foreign currency average exchange rates and comparing these adjusted amounts to our prior period reported results this calculation may differ from similarly titled measures used by others and accordingly the constant currency presentation is not meant to substitute for recorded amounts presented in conformity with ifrs as issued by the iasb nor should such amounts be considered in isolation consolidated statements

gaapfinancialmeasures this press release also includes certain non gaap financial measures including further adjusted ebitda including unconsolidated affiliates further adjusted ebitda including unconsolidated affiliates as a percentage of revenues margin and cafd non gaap financial measures are not measurements of our performance or liquidity under ifrs as issued by the iasb and should not be considered alternatives to operating profit or profit for the period or any other performance measures derived in accordance with ifrs as issued by the iasb or any other generally accepted accounting principles or as alternatives to cash flow from operating investing or financing activities please refer to the appendix of this presentation for a reconciliation of the non gaap financial measures included in this press release to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with ifrs as well as the reasons why management believes the use of non gaap financial measures in this presentation provides useful information we present non gaap financial measures because we believe that they and other similar measures are widely used by certain investors securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of performance and liquidity the non gaap financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under ifrs as issued by the iasb non gaap financial measures and ratios are not measurements of our performance or liquidity under ifrs as issued by the iasb and should not be considered as alternatives to operating profit or profit for the period or any other performance measures derived in accordance with ifrs as issued by the iasb or any other generally accepted accounting principles or as alternatives to cash flow from operating investing or financing activities some of the limitations of these non gaap measures are they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments they do not reflect changes in or cash requirements for our working capital needs they may not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debts although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges the assets being depreciated and amortized will often need to be replaced in the future and further adjusted ebitda and cafd do not reflect any cash requirements that would be required for such replacements some of the exceptional items that we eliminate in calculating further adjusted ebitda reflect cash payments that were made or will be made in the future and the fact that other companies in our industry may calculate further adjusted ebitda and cafd differently than we do which limits their usefulness as comparative measures we define further adjusted ebitda including unconsolidated affiliates as profit loss for the period attributable to the company after adding back loss profit attributable to non controlling interest from continued operations income tax share of profit loss of associates carried under the equity method finance expense net depreciation amortization and impairment charges cafd is calculated as cash distributions received by the company from its subsidiaries minus all cash expenses of the company including debt service and general and administrative expenses our management believes further adjusted ebitda including unconsolidated affiliates and cafd is useful to investors and other users of our financial statements in evaluating our operating performance because it provides them with an additional tool to compare business performance across companies and across periods further adjusted ebitda is widely used by investors to measure a company s operating performance without regard to items such as interest expense taxes depreciation and amortization which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired our management believes cafd is a relevant supplemental measure of the company s ability to earn and distribute cash returns to investors and that cafd is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance because securities analysts and other interested parties use such calculations as a measure of our ability to make quarterly distributions in addition cafd is used by our management team for determining future acquisitions and managing our growth further adjusted ebitda and cafd are widely used by other companies in the same industry our management uses further adjusted ebitda and cafd as measures of operating performance to assist in comparing performance from period to period on a consistent basis and to readily view operating trends as a measure for planning and forecasting overall expectations and for evaluating actual results against such expectations and in communications with our board of directors shareholders creditors analysts and investors concerning our financial performance in our discussion of operating results we have included foreign exchange impacts in our revenue and further adjusted ebitda including unconsolidated affiliates by providing constant currency growth the constant currency presentation is not a measure recognized under ifrs and excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates we believe providing constant currency information provides valuable supplemental information regarding our results of operations we calculate constant currency amounts by converting our current period local currency revenue and further adjusted ebitda using the prior period foreign currency average exchange rates and comparing these adjusted amounts to our prior period reported results this calculation may differ from similarly titled measures used by others and accordingly the constant currency presentation is not meant to substitute for recorded amounts presented in conformity with ifrs as issued by the iasb nor should such amounts be considered in isolation consolidated statements

financial measures this press release also includes certain non gaap financial measures including further adjusted ebitda including unconsolidated affiliates further adjusted ebitda including unconsolidated affiliates as a percentage of revenues margin and cafd non gaap financial measures are not measurements of our performance or liquidity under ifrs as issued by the iasb and should not be considered alternatives to operating profit or profit for the period or any other performance measures derived in accordance with ifrs as issued by the iasb or any other generally accepted accounting principles or as alternatives to cash flow from operating investing or financing activities please refer to the appendix of this presentation for a reconciliation of the non gaap financial measures included in this press release to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with ifrs as well as the reasons why management believes the use of non gaap financial measures in this presentation provides useful information we present non gaap financial measures because we believe that they and other similar measures are widely used by certain investors securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of performance and liquidity the non gaap financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under ifrs as issued by the iasb non gaap financial measures and ratios are not measurements of our performance or liquidity under ifrs as issued by the iasb and should not be considered as alternatives to operating profit or profit for the period or any other performance measures derived in accordance with ifrs as issued by the iasb or any other generally accepted accounting principles or as alternatives to cash flow from operating investing or financing activities some of the limitations of these non gaap measures are they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments they do not reflect changes in or cash requirements for our working capital needs they may not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debts although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges the assets being depreciated and amortized will often need to be replaced in the future and further adjusted ebitda and cafd do not reflect any cash requirements that would be required for such replacements some of the exceptional items that we eliminate in calculating further adjusted ebitda reflect cash payments that were made or will be made in the future and the fact that other companies in our industry may calculate further adjusted ebitda and cafd differently than we do which limits their usefulness as comparative measures we define further adjusted ebitda including unconsolidated affiliates as profit loss for the period attributable to the company after adding back loss profit attributable to non controlling interest from continued operations income tax share of profit loss of associates carried under the equity method finance expense net depreciation amortization and impairment charges cafd is calculated as cash distributions received by the company from its subsidiaries minus all cash expenses of the company including debt service and general and administrative expenses our management believes further adjusted ebitda including unconsolidated affiliates and cafd is useful to investors and other users of our financial statements in evaluating our operating performance because it provides them with an additional tool to compare business performance across companies and across periods further adjusted ebitda is widely used by investors to measure a company s operating performance without regard to items such as interest expense taxes depreciation and amortization which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired our management believes cafd is a relevant supplemental measure of the company s ability to earn and distribute cash returns to investors and that cafd is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance because securities analysts and other interested parties use such calculations as a measure of our ability to make quarterly distributions in addition cafd is used by our management team for determining future acquisitions and managing our growth further adjusted ebitda and cafd are widely used by other companies in the same industry our management uses further adjusted ebitda and cafd as measures of operating performance to assist in comparing performance from period to period on a consistent basis and to readily view operating trends as a measure for planning and forecasting overall expectations and for evaluating actual results against such expectations and in communications with our board of directors shareholders creditors analysts and investors concerning our financial performance in our discussion of operating results we have included foreign exchange impacts in our revenue and further adjusted ebitda including unconsolidated affiliates by providing constant currency growth the constant currency presentation is not a measure recognized under ifrs and excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates we believe providing constant currency information provides valuable supplemental information regarding our results of operations we calculate constant currency amounts by converting our current period local currency revenue and further adjusted ebitda using the prior period foreign currency average exchange rates and comparing these adjusted amounts to our prior period reported results this calculation may differ from similarly titled measures used by others and accordingly the constant currency presentation is not meant to substitute for recorded amounts presented in conformity with ifrs as issued by the iasb nor should such amounts be considered in isolation consolidated statements

by julia payne london feb 27 reuters latin american and sub saharan african countries have taken out at least 152 billion in oil mineral and metal backed loans from china since 2004 easy money that has contributed to crippling debt levels an ngo report said on thursday the natural resource governance institute nrgi calculated that including loans from other countries such as russia and global commodity traders the total amounted to 164 billion two chinese state banks china development bank and eximbank alone accounted for 77 of the loans nrgi said in its report some analysts have raised alarm bells in recent years over debt levels in emerging markets which have more than doubled to 72 trillion over the past decade while the international monetary fund imf says the number of countries in or at risk of debt distress has risen steadily nrgi said such loans appealed to developing countries that have limited access to global capital markets however the advantages such as cheaper terms were undermined by weak governance and opaque conditions as there had been little competition between lenders while these loans have often provided much needed infrastructure such as roads and hydro dams in many cases they have led to crippling levels of debt and the risk of losing collateral that is itself worth more than the value of the loan wrote co author david mihalyi a senior economic analyst with nrgi these loans make up significant portions of countries gdp where they account for more than 10 percent of gdp nrgi found that they were cited by the imf as key contributors to debt sustainability problems for instance the oil price crash in 2014 hit the republic of congo and chad hard and they were unable to allocate physical cargoes of crude as debt repayments while also maintaining sufficient income in order to secure an imf bail out chad had to restructure its oil backed loan with glencore with the help of banks which it succeeded in doing in 2018 congo was also granted a conditional rescue plan last year worth 2 billion from the imf and other lenders but these payments have been frozen since government discussions with glencore and trafigura hit a wall another major risk was that the funds were often made available outside of the government s regular budget process nrgi s report said off budget spending is not subject to the normal budgetary safeguards such as national investment planning national debt strategy parliamentary scrutiny national procurement procedures and the auditing of execution by the appropriate government agencies for instance fewer than half of national oil companies publish audited financial accounts and only a few of those report on how they spend their proceeds in any detail nrgi said among the 52 loans examined by nrgi the interest rate could only be identified in 19 in ghana the imf has warned that a planned increase in bauxite output to meet repayments for a 2 billion loan from the chinese state firm sinohydro may not be possible elsewhere guinea has signed for a 20 billion loan worth 200 of its gdp also backed by bauxite production although a significant portion has not yet been drawn down nrgi said nrgi noted that while bauxite output had started in guinea at the concessions to the chinese that are part of the deal there was little public information on how repayments would be made along with the imf the ratings agency moody s has also raised concerns about lending in sub saharan africa by non members of the paris club such as china the lending terms can be less transparent and predictable they can also be complex when debt is collateralized as in the case of commodity backed facilities in resource dependent countries moody s said in a recent note in the absence of conditionality on structural reforms the economic returns of nontraditional bilateral lending may be lower than if accompanied by policy reforms nrgi graph on loans against gdp nrgi data of size of loans in regions reporting by julia payne additional reporting by karin strohecker editing by kevin liffey julia payne thomsonreuters com 44 207 542 1836 the views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of nasdaq inc

dinner remarks by philip r lane member of the executive board of the ecb at the centre for european reform it is a pleasure to be invited to speak at the centre for european reform before turning to the longer term issues that are the primary focus of this speech i wish to comment on the coronavirus as emphasised by president lagarde earlier today we are closely monitoring the information about the spread of the coronavirus which is first and foremost a public health emergency with the most severe impact on the families of those that have died from the virus in terms of the macro financial implications the more quickly is the virus contained the smaller will be the impact on the world economy and the faster will be the recovery conversely more widespread contagion and a longer interruption in normal economic activity constitute additional downside risks to near term projections accordingly it is a priority for the ecb to assess on a continuous basis the implications of the evolving situation for economic and financial conditions in my remarks this evening i aim to outline some of the factors that are relevant in understanding the role of monetary policy in the current environment of low interest rates and low inflation first there has been a trend decline in the underlying equilibrium real interest rate since the 1980s the equilibrium real rate typically labelled r is the rate required to match the desired levels of saving and investment the combination of slower population growth rising life expectancy and an ageing population acts through multiple channels to push up desired savings and reduce desired investment a reduction in desired investment also reflects slower productivity growth and possibly shifts in the structure of the aggregate production function in the wake of the global financial crisis risk appetite may also have diminished which provides a disincentive to invest reinforces the precautionary saving motive and encourages a portfolio shift to less risky assets such as sovereign bonds finally the scars of the crisis have also affected desired savings and desired investment levels many banks firms governments and households have focused on repairing their balance sheets or have been constrained by legacy effects when making investment decisions some of these forces may go into reverse over time especially if we see a more complete recovery from the crisis and if there were improved public policies to cope with demographic trends and better productivity developments such as the successful widespread adoption of artificial intelligence innovations in automation and enhanced infrastructure investment however for now the downward pressure on the equilibrium real rate is a significant environmental constraint on the options available to central banks the low equilibrium real rate has been compounded by weak nominal developments over the last decade the global financial crisis plus the sovereign debt crisis in the case of the euro area resulted in a considerable amount of slack in labour markets and capacity utilisation in the euro area the post crisis focus on fiscal consolidation meant that the fiscal stance was not supportive of domestic demand until quite recently given these forces the ecb has adopted an accommodative monetary stance which has been characterised since 2014 by a combination of a a negative policy rate b an asset purchase programme c targeted longer term refinancing operations tltros and d forward guidance on the path of policy instruments this policy stance has been successful in warding off deflation risk and more recently in supporting a resurgence in wage inflation through the accumulated reduction in labour market slack however ongoing monetary accommodation is still required in order to ensure the robust convergence of price inflation to our aim this sustained period of below target inflation reflects both the extent of post crisis slack in the economy and the inherent gradualism of inflation adjustment in this environment in particular while above target inflation can be countered by sharp monetary tightening lower bound limits on policy space mean that policy easing measures must take the form of less sharp adjustments that are maintained over an extended horizon a corollary fundamental principle in the design of monetary policy in this environment is that in order to avoid a long term de anchoring of inflation expectations easing measures must be sufficiently pre emptive to guard against a further downward drift in inflation dynamics furthermore under conditions in which policy rates are likely to rise only gradually over time fiscal measures have an especially powerful macroeconomic impact both by providing stabilisation in the event of adverse shocks and by supporting the return of inflation to our aim in conclusion i have briefly described some of the forces shaping the ecb s current monetary stance however there are still many open questions that are raised by the combination of low interest rates and low inflation accordingly this year s review of our monetary policy strategy provides an excellent opportunity to take stock reflect on our experiences and listen to a wide range of external voices
the international monetary fund imf says zimbabwe may plunge into a humanitarian crisis due to missed economic targets and this can only be averted if the international community provides the much needed donor support in a statement wednesday following the conclusion of its latest article iv consultation in the southern african nation the imf said wednesday the macroeconomic stability remains a challenge the economy contracted sharply in 2019 amplified by climate shocks that have crippled agriculture and electricity generation the newly introduced zwl has lost most of its value inflation is very high and international reserves are very low it said the climate shocks have magnified the social impacts of the fiscal retrenchment leaving more than half of the population food insecure with another poor harvest expected growth in 2020 is projected at near zero with food shortages continuing it noted that the government that came to office following the 2018 elections adopted an agenda focused on macro stabilization and reforms this was supported by a staff monitored program from the imf adopted in may 2019 but is now off track as policy implementation has been mixed notable reforms include a significant fiscal consolidation that has helped reduce the monetary financing of the deficit the introduction of the new domestic currency in february 2019 the creation of an interbank fx forex market and the restructuring of the command agriculture financing model to a public private partnership with commercial banks however uneven implementation of reforms notably delays and missteps in fx and monetary reforms have failed to restore confidence in the new currency reengagement with the international community continues to face delays said the imf adding that the zimbabwean government has yet to define the modalities and financing to clear arrears to the world bank and other multilateral institutions and to undertake reforms that would facilitate resolution of arrears with bilateral creditors this continues to constrain zimbabwe s access to external official support as a result the authorities face a difficult balance of pursuing tight monetary policy to reduce very high inflation and prudent fiscal policy to address the macroeconomic imbalances and build confidence in the currency while averting a crisis the imf said while the 2020 budget includes a significant increase in social spending it is likely insufficient to meet the pressing social needs absent a scaling up of donor support the risks of a deep humanitarian crisis are high executive board assessment executive directors noted with concern that zimbabwe is facing an economic and humanitarian crisis exacerbated by policy missteps and climate related shocks these would require difficult policy choices from the authorities and support from the international community the imf urged zimbabwean authorities to make a concerted effort to ensure economic and social stability through the adoption of coordinated fiscal monetary and foreign exchange policies alongside with efforts to address food insecurity and serious governance challenges they emphasized the importance of reengagement with the international community to support efforts to achieve economic sustainability and address the humanitarian crisis notwithstanding efforts in 2019 to tighten the fiscal stance and contain quasi fiscal operations by the central bank the imf said pervasive deficits remain and could be exacerbated by the need to respond to the humanitarian crisis directors called for non essential spending cuts including decisive reforms to agricultural support programs to allow for social spending needs they underscored the importance of public financial management and enhanced domestic revenue mobilization efforts they stressed that eliminating deficit monetization would not only be crucial for fiscal sustainability but it is also expected serve as a precondition for the stabilization of hyper inflation and the preservation of the external value of the currency the imf noted that zimbabwe remains in debt distress with large external arrears to official creditors and encouraged the authorities to give impetus to reengagement efforts and debt management and transparency in particular they cautioned against continued recourse to collateralized external borrowing on commercial terms as this may potentially complicate any future arrears clearance operation the imf underscored the need to establish credibility in the new currency it encouraged the authorities to press forward with the establishment of a functional foreign exchange market and to remove distortions that could lead to rent seeking behavior in the economy the imf further noted that given low reserves and hyper inflation limited credibility and a lack of access to traditional forms of external financing a monetary targeting regime is appropriate to conduct monetary policy enhancing central bank independence and transparency including by timely publication of monetary statistics would be important it welcomed the progress on financial innovation supervision and inclusiveness indicators however it said there is need for continued vigilance to ensure financial stability

over to sara sara greenstein president and chief executive officer thank you brendan good morning everyone and thank you very much for joining us this morning before i get started i d like to just take a minute and share with you what attracted me to lydall this role and why i m really excited to be here at this time i ve been in executive level roles most recently at u s steel and around manufacturing companies for nearly two decades one of the things that has most impressed me about lydall is the quality and reliability of our products the extraordinary solutions oriented approach to customer service and the spirit and passion of the 3 000 plus employees around the world i really believe that there s a lot of value to be unlocked and created i also know it s going to take a lot of hard work and a little bit of patience to get there turning to slide 3 as brendan mentioned i ve been on the job now for just over three months and i focused the majority of my time thus far on visiting our operating sites around the world meeting with our employees the men and women who serve as the lifeblood of lydall and manufacture our products that our customers want to buy and initiating a process focused on where we can provide the most value to all stakeholders to our customers to our employees and our shareholders i will soon shift my focus to speaking directly with customers and while i have many insights to share about our business i thought i d start with a story regarding one of the experience i had while visiting one of our largest plants in north carolina as you might know we have over 800 employees in our hamptonville facility many of whom have been with the company for decades i had the privilege of helping to serve a traditional holiday meal mid december across all three shifts in the plant and it gave me a great opportunity to meet a wide cross section of our workforce this visit as with all of my visits brought into sharp focus the fact that lydall is not only a global manufacturing company but also a strong community that provides economic opportunities for all of our 3 000 plus employees and their families around the world we have a responsibility to them as we do all of our stakeholders while our financial performance has been both unpredictable and unacceptable for several quarters lydall does have a strong platform and opportunity for each business segment to leverage and grow in their respective end markets the global footprint of our operations and our product portfolio are cornerstones on which we can drive growth although each business has unique challenges in their markets these challenges are manageable and addressable having said that we will be more focused on optimizing the global footprint to better adapt to end market conditions in order to achieve this we must unlock value by breaking down operational barriers while each unit has a unique business model and approach there s been limited collaboration between our businesses regarding vertical market approaches or customers we are improving communications collaboration and driving accountability across the enterprise i ve also been incredibly impressed and encouraged by the strong relationships the lydall team has developed with our customers our highly engineered products focus on creating custom solutions that enable us to be deeply embedded with our customers and providing high quality innovative and value added solutions these relationships are a tremendous asset to the business and while some of the areas in which we compete have certainly become commoditized we can and do differentiate ourselves by delivering to customers the highest quality lowest cost products while simultaneously partnering with them on their most complex business challenges with unmatched solutions these are areas there are areas that must be improved immediately and we recognize the need to leverage our invested capital more efficiently to drive better returns on our investment in particular the interface acquisition has clearly underperformed and fixing this business is a priority given the lower demand in the markets that it serves what s more lydall has a rich repository of talent clients r d and other resources that must be more effectively leveraged and integrated across the entire enterprise to that end we ve engaged one of the world s top business consulting and transformation firms and are in the process of conducting a strategic review with our executive team to evaluate lydall s portfolio and end markets this process will identify and develop actions to ensure that we are leveraging our existing invested capital and other resources efficiently it will also help prioritize strategic actions that optimize future capital allocation all oriented toward driving long term shareholder value in addition this review will provide a framework for evaluating the markets where we currently participate along with our ability to compete in these markets we will implement the findings of this review at a pace that is consistent with the organizational bandwidth while prioritizing short term wins and aligning the organization to deliver sustainable value we expect to conclude this strategic review by the end of second quarter 2020 and expect to share more detail on the results later this year internally the end markets that we serve continue to be both dynamic and challenging with recent developments related to the coronavirus in china we remain focused first and foremost on the health and well being of our 200 plus employees who work across our china operations following the lunar new year holiday our thermal acoustical facility in taicang returned to operations on february 10 albeit with less than full staff we expect to ramp up production to support oem and tier one customer requirement over the remainder of the first quarter as our customers return to full production in our technical nonwovens operations production was slower to recover with our wuxi and yu sheng facilities reopening on february 10 and 13 respectively and the qingpu facility resuming operations the week of february 17 at reduced staffing levels while our performance materials business does not have production operations in china we are working with customers to evaluate their requirements and react accordingly finally the resulting impact to our supply chain including local logistics and deliveries to our customers have been disrupted given transportation and logistics constraints considering all of these items we expect first quarter sales will be impacted but given the dynamic nature of this event we cannot reliably quantify the impact at this time turning to slide 4 we ll shift to a discussion of business conditions in end markets that we serve let s start with the automotive market which after several years of growth is clearly slowing and in some regions in fact contracting while 2019 saw a modest decline in north america including the protracted strike at general motors volumes in europe were essentially flat and production in china was down significantly despite this in 2019 our thermal acoustical solutions business grew global sales organically by 1 1 current forecast for 2020 indicate a slowing in north america and europe our forecasts indicate flat to slightly down volumes in particular the european union regulation mandating lower carbon dioxide emissions in 2020 could further impact european sales volume as auto producers struggle to comply with fleetwide targets or face significant monetary penalties while we see a favorable uptick in 2019 european volumes related to the platform rationalization resulting from the combination of psa and opel the potential impact of the pending merger with fca is still to be determined finally prior forecast for china indicated volumes would be flat in 2020 and although the full impact of the coronavirus is not fully understood we anticipate it will be a negative impact generally the european industrial sector saw slowing growth in 2019 from a variety of factors including global trade uncertainties and the potential impacts of brexit we anticipate continued softness in the european industrial markets and are seeing softer backlogs in our industrial filtration segment and technical nonwovens consistent with the slowdown in large project orders in fourth quarter 2019 compared to that same period in 2018 in performance materials we anticipate full year sales as interface sealing products will stabilize this assumes no significant recovery in the ag and construction equipment automotive small engine or related markets while we are expecting full year sales to be down slightly in the sealing and advanced solutions segment we expect to see sales stabilize sequentially from fourth quarter 2019 followed by a modest uptick in the second half of 2020 globally air and liquid filtration markets were generally stable in 2019 and we fully expect the continued demand for clean air and water will drive stable demand in 2020 on the supply side cost for aluminum used in our thermal acoustical solutions business stabilized in 2019 average lme pricing is down for the sixth consecutive quarter and we have modeled flat pricing in 2020 for both the lme index and midwest premium finally conversion costs for 2020 in north america have been negotiated and are locked in at the same level as 2019 polyester fiber costs used in our filtration and engineered materials business segments have generally been steady through the year and we anticipate that this will hold in 2020 supply constraints and higher prices on meta aramid fibers used in technical nonwovens and performance materials have generally stabilized with that i ll turn the call over to randy to cover fourth quarter results randy gonzales executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you sara turning to slide 5 i ll briefly cover some key highlights for the fourth quarter and then provide an overview of our operating segment results as a reminder we will be discussing adjusted financial metrics including adjusted ebitda by segment before we continue i d like to outline the larger items that are adjusted in the fourth quarter to quarter period results first a noncash impairment charge of 64 2 million including 63 million of goodwill impairment booked in the performance materials segment the goodwill impairment is principally due to the underperformance of the interface business that was acquired in august 2018 in addition 2 3 million of expense related to the ceo transition and 1 9 million related to severance programs have also been adjusted a complete reconciliation to comparable gaap numbers are provided in the press release and earnings presentation fourth quarter 2019 net sales of 193 million decreased 7 9 or 16 7 million from the same period in 2018 organically sales decreased 8 3 driven by weakness in interface sealing end markets lower demand for industrial filtration products in china and europe and lower domestic automotive volumes attributable to general motor strike excluding a sales reduction of 3 2 million from the gm strike sales in thermal acoustical solutions were essentially flat the strong dollar continued to be a headwind on foreign sales reducing consolidated revenue by 1 7 million or 0 8 percentage points and tooling sales were up 4 million or 1 9 acquisitions and divestitures contributed a net decrease of 1 6 million or 0 7 points of growth driven primarily by the divestiture of the geosol business in technical nonwovens in the second quarter of 2019 adjusted ebitda for the quarter was 12 4 million a decrease of 13 million manufacturing inefficiencies in the thermal acoustical solutions segment and unfavorable mix and lower cost absorption in performance materials both contributed to this performance notably technical nonwovens drove 30 basis points of segment ebitda margin expansion compared to prior year i ll talk in more detail about each segment later consistent with our guidance last year we invested 1 9 million or last quarter we invested 1 9 million of severance related expenses in the fourth quarter to align our expense structure with end market conditions this investment was all related to headcount reductions and will return approximately 4 5 million of run rate savings in 2020 and beyond adjusted loss per share was 0 17 per share down 0 69 from the fourth quarter 2018 including approximately 0 07 of incremental amortization associated with the interface acquisition turning to slide 6 full year 2019 sales were 837 million up 51 5 million with net acquisition activity adding 81 5 million to sales offset by fx headwinds of 16 3 million and lower tooling sales of 1 2 million resulting organic sales declined 12 6 million or 1 6 adjusted ebitda of 80 4 million and adjusted ebitda margin of 9 6 declined 9 9 million and 190 basis points respectively from 2018 cash generation of 23 9 million in the quarter and 86 9 million for the year was supported by improvements in working capital this includes 15 million of cash generation from factoring of accounts receivable that would normally have been collected in first quarter 2020 debt reduction continues to be one of our top capital allocation priorities with 14 million paid down in the quarter and 52 million in 2019 total outstanding debt on the company s credit facility was 273 million at the end of the year for a net leverage ratio of approximately three times adjusted ebitda as defined in our credit agreement capital expenditures in fourth quarter 2019 were 8 6 million and 35 9 million for the full year at the low end of our previous estimate moving into 2020 we anticipate lower capital spending of approximately 25 million to 30 million as larger investments particularly in thermal acoustical solutions are predominantly behind us fourth quarter effective tax rate of 1 3 and full year 2019 tax rate of 8 3 were both impacted by the goodwill impairment charge that is not tax deductible adjusted for this the tax benefit associated with pension settlement charges earlier in 2019 and other adjustments the full year tax rate is 29 driven higher by losses and jurisdictions where a tax benefit is not recognized and tax law changes we expect the 2020 tax rate to be in the range of 25 to 27 moving to slide 7 i ll discuss our segment results starting with our thermal acoustical solutions segment this is our global automotive business that specializes in providing innovative engineered thermal and acoustical solutions for vehicle underhood underbody powertrain and exhaust applications fourth quarter sales in this business were 86 1 million down organically 3 1 or 2 7 million adjusted for 3 2 million of lost sales from the general motor strike in october sales are up 0 5 million organically regionally north american sales were down from fourth quarter 2018 largely on lower sales of acoustical products partially offset by higher sales of thermal shields european part sales grew slightly more than 5 net of unfavorable foreign exchange with continued volume gains on selected platforms in china while the overall market continues to be down year over year lydall s part sales were up significantly as new programs continue to ramp tooling sales of 10 2 million were up 3 9 million compared to prior year contributing 470 basis points to segment sales foreign exchange primarily the euro reduced segment sales growth by 100 basis points or 900 000 profitability in the thermal acoustical solutions segment was negatively impacted by 4 million or 460 basis points of additional operating costs compared to the prior year in north america we continue to see overhead costs increase temporary labor and overtime while our european operations continued to incur incremental expedite and outsourcing costs because of higher oem delivery volumes in addition unfavorable product mix specifically lower volumes of higher margin acoustical products impacted margins with fourth quarter adjusted ebitda margin of 6 6 down 640 basis points from prior year moving to slide 8 i will cover our performance materials segment which provides specialty filtration and engineered sealing solutions to a variety of end markets and industries globally sales of 55 8 million were down 9 8 million or a decline of 15 1 organically the contraction was driven by softer end markets in our sealing and advanced solutions segment which was down almost 19 on broad weakness in all regions sales in our filtration segment were down 8 3 with gains in air filtration offset by lower liquid filtration volumes foreign exchange headwinds were offset by higher inorganic growth from the h v product line acquisition completed in the second quarter of 2018 fourth quarter segment adjusted ebitda margin of 10 is down 570 basis points from the prior year period impacted by lower absorption on reduced volumes in our sealing segment and higher labor and overhead costs these increases were partially mitigated by lower material costs productivity improvements and improved sg a efficiencies fourth quarter results include 4 1 million of intangibles amortization for interface which is an incremental 1 5 million from the same period in 2018 for the full year intangibles amortization related to interface was 16 2 million an increase of 12 7 million compared to 2018 in 2020 we re projecting amortization expenses related to interface to be flat to 2019 approximately 4 million per quarter slide 9 covers our technical nonwovens segment this segment produces air and liquid filtration media as well as other engineered products for use in various commercial applications such as geosynthetics automotive industrial and medical among others sales in the fourth quarter of 2019 were 56 8 million down 12 4 from prior year adjusting for fx headwinds of 70 basis points and another 330 basis points for the geosol divestiture organic sales were down 8 4 compared to prior year industrial filtration sales were down 6 9 million or 18 6 heavily impacted by lower sales in china and softer industrial markets in europe advanced material sales as reported are down 1 1 million but adjusted for the 2 1 million of lower sales from the geosol divestiture sales are up 1 1 million or 3 9 in terms of profitability adjusted segment ebitda margin of 12 was up 30 basis points from fourth quarter 2018 this was driven primarily by productivity improvements and lower sg a spending meta aramid fiber prices were up in the fourth quarter compared to prior year but were offset by higher pricing as a reminder adjusted segment ebitda accounts for restructuring expenses and severance expenses of 80 basis points in fourth quarter 2019 and 50 basis points in fourth quarter 2018 that concludes our review of the fourth quarter results it was a challenging quarter with top line sales impacts from the gm strike weaker demand in europe and china for technical nonwovens and continued weakness in interface sales given the end market conditions sara discussed earlier we enter 2020 with a focus on the key activities that we can control on that topic i ll turn it back to sara for her closing comments sara greenstein president and chief executive officer thanks randy and in the spirit of the things that we can control i d like to close with some comments on our focus areas for 2020 in thermal acoustical solutions our priority is to mitigate higher labor and overhead costs to offset the mix impacts of the significant sales drop of high margin acoustical fiber based products in technical nonwovens we will focus on further market penetration of new products and innovation that is accretive to our portfolio and in performance materials we will continue to drive a more flexible and agile cost structure that enables us to react to changes and market demand and across all segments we re focused on the stability and growth in china acknowledging the current uncertainty around the coronavirus across the enterprise we remain fully engaged in improving working capital and accelerating strong cash flow generation in 2020 which will enable the company to reduce its outstanding debt and improve our net leverage ratio although many challenges lie ahead we re cautiously optimistic for the future we truly believe lydall stands apart from competitors in terms of our products our focus on innovation and our relationships with our customers our focus for 2020 will be ensuring that as a company we are strategic in how we utilize our capital personnel and all resources across the organization when i started this call i shared with you that i believe that there s a lot of value to be unlocked and that this will require some patience and a lot of hard work at lydall we have a strong foundation of assets we have a strong customer base we have very dedicated employees and we are building an exciting new strategic vision and plan that we will share with you in the coming months the fact is that trust is earned from what you do not just what you say i always say words matter actions matter more i experienced this firsthand growing up on a farm in the midwest where i learned very early on the value of hard work always showing up performing and most importantly keep your word i recognize these values in lydall s culture and employees and i will look to foster them because i know that we can and will win together with that let s open it up for questions questions answers operator our first question is from edward marshall with sidoti company please go ahead edward marshall sidoti and company llc analyst good morning sara welcome to the call i m looking forward to working with you in understanding your vision for the company so with the context of the commoditized products in which you see existing in the business and the more commoditized they ve become i m wondering if we could take a step back and look at the earnings power of the business historically i m wondering if you if in your vision do you feel that that is achievable over the next say few years sara greenstein president and chief executive officer so when i look at our portfolio ed as i said i mean we certainly have some end markets in which we operate that is marching toward a more commoditized position and yet with those very same customers we re actively innovating with them around their portfolio to become more differentiated product so my comment that i made in my remarks is reflecting the fact that we have the footprint and capability to deliver in a commoditized market while simultaneously the relationships and technical expertise and capability to continue to innovate and i think that in providing my early perspective acknowledging that and that that is a foundation upon which we can continue to grow is useful and we certainly will edward marshall sidoti and company llc analyst got it so when i look at the description of commercial performance i m wondering how you plan to target it looking at say pricing actions expanding your product lines to say innovation which i think you just mentioned or finally finding larger or larger number of customers within the base i m just kind of trying to understand the commercial performance piece that you called out as one of the initiatives sara greenstein president and chief executive officer right right and i mean i would say all of that and right a big part of the process that we re following as it relates to laying out the strategic vision is to understand exactly that the markets that we play in the trends around those markets and our ability to compete in those markets and make the conscious choice around where best to deploy capital both human and financial to ensure that we re driving real value and so i would say in the near term it s about ensuring that we have further penetration of the products that we ve launched and in the mid and long term it s using this strategic process that we have under way to inform where and how we continue to pursue and deploy capital accordingly edward marshall sidoti and company llc analyst got it got it and then i guess following up on the capital comment as i heard randy say your continuing priorities are cash and of cash is debt reduction i m curious if the pace of the debt reduction continues understanding that balance of your balance of your capital position between using that cash for the debt reduction and then also for the necessary changes i guess in the use of the business through either restructuring or severance actions as well as growth potential as we move forward randy gonzales executive vice president and chief financial officer so i ll take that one ed so in our cash modeling and debt paydown modeling we re very comfortable in respect to being adequately able to continue to pay down debt in an aggressive manner like we did in 2019 in addition to continuing to fully fund our capital programs many of which are carryovers from last year which have a clear return on investment have a good business case and gives us the ability to compete in different products in different markets that we haven t been in in the past so i think it s consistent with the theme on what just what sara just said about deploying capital in the correct way we ll be able to fund those completely edward marshall sidoti and company llc analyst ok great to hear looking forward to kind of the developments over the next several quarters thanks very much sara greenstein president and chief executive officer thanks ed randy gonzales executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks ed operator our next question is from chris moore with cjs securities please go ahead chris moore cjs securities analyst hey good morning guys yes i know you re obviously still very much in the kind of big picture analysis mode i was and sara started to touch on a little bit i was wondering maybe if you could just walk through the margin challenges on a segment by segment basis kind of from that ability things that are under your control and areas that are more end market related like for example on the tas side maybe just kind of compare the fiber versus metal in terms of where you have control and where you don t randy gonzales executive vice president and chief financial officer yes chris this is randy certainly within the tas segment in 2019 we continue to talk about the operational challenges so the expedited freight the outsourcing the overtime that continue to be a challenge for us in q4 along with the challenges of the unfavorable mix between the thermal products and the acoustical products i will say that that unfavorable mix we see continuing in 2020 but we anticipate being able to offset those with the improvements in the operations in 2020 which earlier in the year we ve already seen significant improvement so far chris moore cjs securities analyst got you that s helpful maybe just on the 64 million charge so obviously it s all in performance materials it looks like it s focused on interface so the outlook sounds like it s stable for fiscal 20 are there end markets that you re questioning that maybe are no longer kind of longer term viable to you just trying to get a better sense as to what drove the writedown at this stage randy gonzales executive vice president and chief financial officer so i don t think it s a question of end markets or a technology shift so all regions all markets are down there is exposure to ag and construction like we ve talked about there s exposure to class seven and eight trucks there is exposure to india so it s more of a decline in just the end markets it s we re not losing share what drove the goodwill impairment the 63 million goodwill impairment is essentially the lower volume and the reduced cash flows going forward than what we had originally anticipated so in the whole approach of goodwill impairment if your carrying value is higher than fair value then you have to write down the asset in the case of our modeling we took a market approach combined with an income approach and an income approach means a discounted cash flow s approach when we model that out the math worked out to be a goodwill impairment chris moore cjs securities analyst got you last question just in terms of timing so it sounds like by the end of q2 you ll have that kind of the report done and is that likely something that would be talked about on the q2 call or that s a kind of summer of july type time frame when we would hear kind of the good bad and the ugly sara greenstein president and chief executive officer the expectation at this point chris is that we will certainly share the strategic view and that road map in the second half of this year i don t anticipate that coming out in the q2 call chris moore cjs securities analyst got it all right i appreciate guys operator duration 43 minutes
