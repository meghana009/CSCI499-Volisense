introduction foreign exchange reserves and their use for interventions in the foreign exchange market have played a notable and sometimes controversial role in the world economy and financial system this is partly because of their sheer size estimated at some us 11 trillion worldwide changes in holdings of foreign exchange reserves and in how they are invested can matter not just for exchange rates but potentially for a whole range of asset prices reserves are usually seen as an important element of self insurance that complements the access to financing provided to countries by the international monetary fund imf and other multilateral organizations in contrast canada s foreign exchange reserves stand out for their relatively modest size and their stability our reserves are about us 85 billion some 5 per cent of our gross domestic product gdp this compares with the 10 year average of about 13 per cent of gdp for other advanced economies and 20 per cent for emerging market economies a key reason canada s international reserves are nonetheless adequate is our freely floating exchange rate canada adopted a flexible exchange rate in 1950 and except for an eight year stretch in the 1960s our dollar has floated ever since we have not intervened to stabilize the canadian dollar for over two decades now this is a period that encompassed major changes in our exchange rate during the commodities supercycle the canadian dollar rose from 62 cents us in 2002 to 1 08 in 2007 during the global financial crisis it dropped sharply to as low as 76 cents us before settling above parity for almost five years it depreciated by about 25 per cent again with the collapse of oil prices in 2014 and has fluctuated around 75 cents us since then these exchange rate movements helped the economy adjust to the shocks such shifts are always painful for some and beneficial for others but the canadian economy is diverse and dynamic and over time able to achieve a new balance of growth among regions and sectors in my talk today i m going to expand on these points and explain why we stopped using our reserves to stabilize our dollar a central theme is that because we no longer use them routinely to intervene in foreign exchange markets we hold reserves mainly as a precaution against extreme tail events i ll discuss what we consider to be an adequate level of reserves and how we manage them why not intervene canada s foreign exchange reserves belong to the government of canada while in a number of other countries they are an asset of the central bank they are managed within the terms of an established governance framework by the department of finance and the bank of canada together we develop strategies and policies for the management of the reserves the bank as the government s fiscal agent carries out related market transactions most of the time exchange rate movements driven by the market have contributed to canada s economic stability helping our economy ride the rising and falling tides of the global economy as a commodity exporter canada has been subject to swings in world commodity prices which affect our terms of trade let me make a few observations related to recent experience to a certain extent movements in the canadian dollar reflect the comparative strengths of the canadian and us economies which are linked in turn to expectations for each country s monetary policy path we ve seen these forces shift significantly over time in particular the past year has seen an important change in the relative performance of the two economies despite the fact that the canadian economy is generally in a good place economic activity has been running close to potential for nearly two years and economic growth has been solid unemployment rates have been at historic lows employment creation has been strong and inflation has been hovering around our 2 per cent target in that context we took steps to move our policy interest rate upward by a cumulative 1Â¼ percentage points but uncertainty about us trade policies has been holding back canadian business investment below what our strong economic fundamentals would indicate lower oil prices in recent months have caused a deterioration of canada s terms of trade which in turn reduces domestic income and wealth housing investment and consumption spending have also softened the result has been a temporary slowing of canada s economic growth meanwhile the us economy has been powering ahead with the effects of the fiscal stimulus and in response the federal reserve has taken several steps over the last year to move interest rates toward their neutral level this combination of factors has been putting downward pressure on the canadian dollar the lower canadian dollar in turn will help support the economy through this period it s been almost half a century since we set a target for the exchange rate by and large the exchange rate movements delivered by the market have served canada well trying to hold the dollar constant would have given us larger fluctuations in unemployment output and inflation nonetheless for many years we did have a policy of routinely using our foreign reserves to resist in an automatic fashion any significant upward or downward pressure on the dollar for example between 1995 and 1998 we intervened roughly 150 times we weren t targeting a particular level for the exchange rate but simply smoothing its movements this reflected a belief at the time that markets did not function efficiently and could give rise to volatility that could be destabilizing but this view gradually gave way to the weight of evidence and experience by 1998 we had concluded that such interventions weren t particularly effective we saw the futility of attempting to moderate exchange rate movements caused by changes in the underlying fundamental factors trying to counter them was a bit like tapping on the brakes while skidding on ice it can help momentarily but not by much so where does that leave us we do have a policy framework that would allow us to intervene in the unlikely event that it s needed that could happen under two scenarios the first would be a market breakdown with extreme price volatility buyers or sellers would be increasingly unwilling to transact indicating a severe lack of liquidity in the canadian dollar market the second would be sharp currency movements that seriously threaten the conditions that support sustainable long term economic growth in a market breakdown intervention would aim to restore market functioning and would likely be quite short lived in extreme currency movements it s understood that intervention would be part of a broader set of policy changes to re establish confidence in canadian economy this framework is transparent it is posted on our website thus we are ready to intervene if necessary but as i said we have not seen the need to do so at any time throughout the past two often turbulent decades there have however been a couple of occasions over that period when canada participated in concerted intervention along with other countries in 2011 canada joined an action to stem excess volatility and disorderly movements in the exchange rate of the japanese yen following the earthquake and resulting tsunami and nuclear crisis at the fukushima nuclear plant the intervention involved selling the yen against our respective domestic currencies to send a clear signal that the goal was to weaken the yen and not to strengthen other currencies and in september 2000 we joined the european central bank the federal reserve bank of new york the bank of japan and the bank of england to support the euro these episodes were in response to exceptional developments affecting other currencies of global importance and were not specifically aimed at influencing the canadian dollar how much is enough how then should we think about canada s current level of foreign exchange reserves internationally a number of factors influence reserve holdings in some cases such as china movements in international reserves are largely a by product of the country s exchange rate regime and associated trade and capital flows a number of countries typically emerging market economies may choose to hold large reserves to offset volatility in capital flows and in some cases to ride out trade imbalances resulting from the fluctuations in the prices of their major exports among advanced economies switzerland accumulated large reserve holdings when it set a floor for its exchange rate in contrast our flexible exchange rate and non intervention policy allow us to keep a much smaller level of reserves given that we intervene so rarely why do we hold any reserves and how do we gauge whether they are adequate for our needs first we must be prepared to intervene in case of events that are even more severe and improbable than those we have experienced in recent decades we periodically examine such extreme scenarios and estimate the scale of intervention that would be required a second important purpose of our foreign exchange reserves is to ensure that the government of canada can meet its payment obligations in situations where normal access to funding markets may be disrupted or delayed reserves help insure against rollover risks for public borrowing while canada has not faced any such difficulties since the second world war the government of canada reassessed its own potential liquidity needs in the wake of the global financial crisis it opted for a larger buffer and accordingly beefed up both its demand deposits and its foreign exchange reserves third canada s foreign exchange reserves serve to reinforce confidence in the soundness of the canadian financial system they are among several factors that do so canadian banks manage their risks prudently and are well regulated and supervised even during the financial crisis banks remained in good financial health and did not have to rely on direct official support ten years later canada s financial institutions have ample buffers of capital and liquidity and the system remains resilient financial institutions are expected to take responsibility for managing their own foreign currency exposures they implement hedging and funding strategies to that end indeed so do other major canadian foreign currency borrowers such as provincial governments in the unlikely event that a canadian financial institution had exceptional needs for liquidity in us dollars or other foreign currencies the swap lines the bank of canada has established with other g7 central banks would enable us to obtain funds in any of four other currencies these lines were introduced in response to the global financial crisis they were renewed in response to market stresses in europe and later turned into standing agreements the bank of canada has never drawn on these swap lines nor has it faced a request to provide canadian dollars but these arrangements are available if needed even though it is very unlikely that canada s foreign exchange reserves would need to be drawn down for financial stability purposes their existence provides further reassurance of the safety and soundness of the canadian financial system such confidence in turn helps maintain stability in times of financial stress all this considered canada holds foreign exchange reserves as a precaution against extreme events even though canada has had no history of such events we know from international experience that they are possible so far i ve emphasized the role of canada s reserves in serving canadian purposes i should also mention the use of our reserves in our role as a good global citizen part of our official international reserves around us 10 billion are held at the imf canada like a number of other advanced economies also makes a portion of its reserves available for imf programs taking all these potential needs into consideration canada s level of liquid international reserves is set at a minimum of 3 per cent of nominal gdp a floor which it generally significantly exceeds this level is simple to communicate to the public credit rating agencies and investors while as i ve noted it is low relative to many countries it is in line with a set of similar countries such as the united kingdom and australia together with our department of finance we review this level periodically in light of various metrics and international comparisons and particularly with regard to extreme scenarios that would imply a draw on reserves the last such review completed in 2016 concluded that the 3 per cent minimum remains adequate to meet canada s needs even under such extreme conditions how do we manage our reserves given that the primary purpose of our international reserves is precautionary a key strategic objective in managing them is to maintain a high standard of liquidity under all circumstances the preservation of capital value and optimization of returns are also essential to maintain liquidity we hold reserves in assets that mature or can be sold on very short notice with minimal market impact to preserve value we minimize the risk of loss by holding a diversified portfolio of high quality assets managing liquid assets and liabilities on a matched basis we aim to achieve the highest return while respecting the objectives of liquidity and capital preservation to maintain both the liquidity and capital value of reserve assets the term to maturity of individual assets is limited currently to a maximum of 10Â½ years this reflects the fact that shorter term securities are typically more liquid and their value less sensitive to the interest rate than longer term securities by the same issuer and in the same currency while our liquid reserves are diversified across currencies more than half is held in us dollars because of the greater liquidity of us dollar markets and since potential foreign currency needs are most likely to be in us dollars the remainder is held in euros pound sterling and japanese yen we have explored the possibility of adding other currencies but decided against doing so because they were less liquid and there were fewer investment options let me expand on the point about asset liability matching our liquid foreign reserves are held primarily in the exchange fund account efa these assets are funded by government of canada liabilities denominated in or converted to foreign currencies they largely consist of foreign currency securities which are mostly government treasury bills and bonds and fixed income securities issued by sovereign supported issuers sub sovereign entities and supranational institutions other eligible assets include deposits with commercial banks central banks and the bank for international settlements the assets in the efa are matched in currency and duration to the government s liabilities that fund the liquid securities in order to minimize its exposure to currency and interest rate risks these matching requirements are part of our asset liability matching alm framework to my knowledge no other central bank exclusively manages reserves in this manner the alm framework which allows us to earn a positive net return is consistent with our floating currency indeed if we intervened continuously we would not be able to match assets to liabilities this approach has proven to be an effective way to minimize interest rate and foreign exchange risk to the government s fiscal position however there is still residual market risk that is derived from the credit spread exposures inherent in the assets and liabilities and the lack of perfect correlation between the two since the efa is predominantly funded with cross currency swaps there are non zero levels of basis risk there is also an element of credit risk both with regard to the issuers of reserve assets and swap counterparties we conduct our own risk assessments including credit risk which we have significantly enhanced in response to the financial stability board s call to reduce reliance on credit rating agencies in large measure the difference between our approach to reserve management and those of other reserve managers is related to the relatively small size of our reserves our alm framework and our focus on liquidity in their pursuit of higher returns many countries are pushed to explore alternative asset classes such as higher yielding bonds and equities moreover most countries have a net asset position which means they have outright exposure to currency movements this increases the need for diversification into other currencies because our portfolio is asset liability matched volatility in currency markets is a lesser concern to us i should say a brief word here about gold some countries continue to hold portions of their reserves in gold sometimes for symbolic reasons canada doesn t in 1980 the government implemented a policy of selling its gold at a gradual and controlled pace to enhance the return for the efa gold bullion is not considered as liquid as for example us treasury securities and to the extent that physical delivery may be involved could entail significant costs for secure transport and storage as such gold doesn t fit well within the asset matching framework proceeds from gold sales were invested in high quality interest bearing foreign currency assets while these assets may not have the reassuring physical heft of a gold bar we believe they are better suited to the purposes for which we hold reserves the last of the government s gold bullion was disposed of in 2003 the gold reserves that remained were coins which have also since been sold our dollar as a reserve currency one of the relatively recent developments for our dollar that we are monitoring closely is its use as a foreign reserve currency by other countries following the global financial crisis central banks and monetary authorities around the world began adding canadian dollar assets to their reserve portfolios reserves in canadian dollars now amount to around 200 billion close to 2 per cent of the global total the move to hold a portion of reserves in canadian dollars is part of a broader strategy of reserve diversification it is also in some sense a vote of confidence in canada reserve managers tell us they are attracted by canada s sound financial system and fiscal position as reflected in its high credit ratings even though the canadian dollar is only a small share of global reserves the total allocations to our dollar may be large relative to the size of our market combined with the fact that some reserve portfolios are buy and hold inflows from reserve managers may have a material impact on canada s financial markets particularly the government bond markets in which these flows are concentrated although the flows tend to be relatively stable they may put downward pressure on yields lowering the government s funding costs at the same time the increasing presence of these large buy and hold investors might negatively affect the markets liquidity because of the effects on secondary market trading and the availability of collateral we continue to assess the impact of such activity on the bond market and its potential implications for financial stability particularly since the government debt market and the associated market for repurchase agreements are core funding markets we also regularly review our market operations recognizing the influences of various holders and have implemented policies that aid in providing or enhancing liquidity via repo securities lending and our own balance sheet management finally the impact of our own reserves on the exchange rate is negligible because of our non intervention policy and asset liability matching however canadian dollar denominated reserves at foreign central banks as well as allocations to canadian dollar assets by foreign private investors may cause appreciation of our dollar during times of heavy portfolio inflows conclusion to conclude i would like to touch on the new canada united states mexico agreement cusma or usmca as it is known here which has been signed but not yet ratified in one chapter the parties are enjoined from manipulating their exchange rates to gain an unfair trade advantage this is not a controversial issue for us we have long relied on our market determined flexible exchange rate to absorb external shocks and cushion the economy from their impact this policy has served canada well without a freely floating currency prices wages and unemployment would fluctuate markedly creating havoc for people and businesses a flexible exchange rate is essential for us to be able to pursue an independent monetary policy we maintain a high standard of transparency both with regard to our framework for managing foreign exchange reserves and the publication of relevant data this speech is another step in making sure that our framework is well understood i would like to thank wendy chan eric chouinard mervin merkowsky and maksym padalko for their help in preparing this speech

of 3 sales excluding divestments was 5 51 billion in fy 2018 compared to 5 08 billion in fy 2017 an increase of more than 8 higher prices the upward revaluation of the euro against the dollar and higher sales volumes of flame retardants specialty fertilizers and dairy proteins more than offset lower sales volumes of potash commodity phosphates and specialty phosphates operating income operating income in q4 2018 was 166 million compared to 189 million in q4 2017 a decrease of 12 mainly due to a capital gain of 48 million recorded in the comparable period last year adjusted operating income excluding divestments which excludes the contribution of divested businesses provisions for prior periods royalties and for closure costs of the sallent mine in spain towards the site consolidation and as part of the restoration solution increased by 40 to 214 million the increase was driven by higher prices lower energy costs and favorable exchange rates devaluation of the euro israeli shekel and yuan decreased costs in dollar terms this was partially offset by higher marine transportation and raw material prices sulphur used in the phosphate value chain and raw materials used in the production of bromine and phosphorous flame retardants and other expenses which include insurance income in israel recorded in the corresponding quarter of 2017 inventory write offs and higher depreciation expenses the negative impact of sales volume derives from unfavorable product mix due to an increase in the sales of polysulphate and the sales of electricity surplus to third parties from the new power plant in sodom together with lower sales volumes of potash phosphate specialties and specialty fertilizers this was partially offset by an increase in the sales volume of bromine based industrial solutions operating income for fy 2018 was 1 519 million compared to 629 million for fy 2017 an increase of about 140 the increase in operating income is mainly attributed to a capital gain of 841 million from the sale of the fire safety and oil additives businesses adjusted operating income excluding divestments which mainly excludes capital gain and contribution from divestments to 2017 2018 results asset impairments and provisions for early retirement legal claims and site closure costs amounted to 750 million in 2018 compared to 530 million in 2017 an increase of 42 the increase is attributed to higher prices and the upward revaluation of the euro against the dollar these were partially offset by higher raw material and marine transportation prices lower sales volume insurance income in israel recorded in 2017 higher royalties and depreciation and inventory write offs financing expenses net the net reported financing expenses in q4 2018 amounted to 66 million compared to 25 million in the corresponding quarter in 2017 excluding expenses deriving from interest on past royalties recognized in the current period the net adjusted financing expenses amounted to 59 million compared to 28 million in q4 2017 which excludes an income in connection with a resolution of tax dispute in belgium interest expenses decreased by 4 million to 25 million the decrease was more than offset by an increase in hedging transaction provisions which derived mainly from the devaluation of the shekel against the dollar a decrease in interest rates and a sharp decrease in energy prices towards the end of the quarter net financial expenses for fy 2018 amounted to 158 million compared to 124 million excluding expenses deriving from interest on past royalties recognized in 2018 in the amount of 10 million the net adjusted financing expenses in 2018 amounted to 148 million a decrease in interest expenses in the amount of 11 million was more than offset mainly by lower financial income as a result of change in exchange rate differences and an increase in provisions for hedging transactions tax expenses tax expenses for q4 2018 amounted to 19 million compared to 13 million in q4 2017 excluding the tax impact of the adjustments to operating income and financial expenses adjusted tax expenses in q4 2018 amounted to 32 million which reflects an adjusted effective tax rate of 20 from adjusted income before tax compared to 2 million in q4 2017 which reflects an effective tax rate of 1 the unusually low tax rate in 2017 was driven by an adjustment of deferred taxes in respect of the change in the tax rate in the us in q4 2017 and a decrease in tax provisions in israel related to the natural resource tax law tax expenses for 2018 amounted to 129 million compared to 158 million in 2017 excluding the tax impact of the adjustments to operating income and financial expenses adjusted tax expenses in 2018 amounted to 136 million which reflects an adjusted effective tax rate of 22 from adjusted income before tax compared to 156 million in 2017 which reflects an adjusted effective tax rate of 30 the decrease in 2018 is attributed to lower profit deriving from the us following the divestitures lower tax rate in the us the devaluation of the shekel against the dollar during the year and a decrease in tax provisions in israel cash flow debt level in q4 2018 operating cash flow decreased by 53 million compared to the corresponding quarter in 2017 to 224 million this decrease derives primarily from a decrease of 30 million in working capital recorded in q4 2018 compared with a decrease of 57 million during q4 2017 this is attributed to a more moderate decrease in trade receivables as a result of the late signings of the potash supply contracts in china and india in addition operating cash flow was negatively impacted by payments of royalties to the israeli government in respect if prior periods and cash paid due to derivatives transactions these were partly offset by lower tax payments in this quarter compared with the corresponding quarter last year operating cash flow for 2018 amounted to 620 million compared to 847 million in 2017 the decrease is attributed to an increase in inventory and trade receivables cash flow used for the purchase of property plant equipment and intangible assets amounted to 179 million and 572 million in q4 2018 and fy 2018 respectively compared to 140 million and 457 million in q4 2017 and fy 2017 respectively the increase derives mainly from several infrastructure projects in icl s potash division the company s net financial liabilities at the end of 2018 amounted to 2 212 million a decrease of 825 million compared to december 31 2017 the significant decrease is mainly due to proceeds received from the sale of the fire safety and oil additives businesses review of operating segments industrial products icl s global leadership in the bromine industry is driven by its focus on delivering value to its customers rather than increasing volume icl is able to generate more value by leveraging its unique assets and know how and by fostering innovation through the development of new applications such as new bromine and phosphorus based flame retardants magnesia and salt products as well as other solutions icl continues to leverage its unique logistical advantages and unparalleled experience related to the safety and environmental aspects of its bromine business the industrial products segment recorded another strong quarter driven by higher prices across its bromine value chain as well as most of its complementary businesses and resulting in an all time record of annual segment profit higher prices drove an approximately 2 expansion in quarterly and annual segment profit margins industrial products accounted for 22 of sales and 30 of profit attributed to segments in q4 2018 compared to 22 of sales and 31 of profit attributed to segments in q4 2017 the segment accounted for 23 of sales and 35 of profit attributed to segments in 2018 compared to 22 of sales and 33 of profit attributed to segments in 2017 significant highlights and business environment during q4 2018 elemental bromine prices in china increased compared to q3 2018 and compared to q4 2017 as local bromine production was affected by strict environmental related regulatory pressure and the winter shutdown increased compared to q3 2018 and compared to q4 2017 as local bromine production was affected by strict environmental related regulatory pressure and the winter shutdown demand for bromine based flame retardants during q4 was lower compared to prior periods however the segment is benefitting from higher prices as a result of elevated bromine prices icl industrial products successfully secured several supply agreements for bromine compounds for 2019 mostly with higher prices and stable volumes icl continues its efforts to conclude additional agreements clear brine fluids sales were higher compared to the corresponding quarter mainly due to continuation of higher drilling activity in the gulf of mexico nevertheless sales in q4 2018 were moderately lower compared to the exceptional level in q2 and q3 2018 nevertheless sales in q4 2018 were moderately lower compared to the exceptional level in q2 and q3 2018 higher prices were recorded for phosphorous based flame retardants in icl s markets us and europe compared to the corresponding quarter as a result of continuous strict environmental related

annual results analysis in the appendix the increase in the segment s profit in q4 2018 over the corresponding period in 2017 resulted mainly from an increase in the selling prices of bromine based industrial solutions and flame retardants as well as phosphorous based flame retardants which overcompensated for higher raw material prices and an inventory write off the contribution of higher sales quantities is attributed to improved mix due to an increase in the quantities sold of bromine based industrial solutions mostly clear brine fluids the positive impact of exchange rates derives mainly from the devaluation of the israeli shekel against the dollar decreasing production costs partly offset by the devaluation of the euro against the dollar which decreased revenue on an annual basis the increase in segment profit is attributable to higher prices and sales volumes across most of the segment s products which overcompensated for a decrease in the sales quantities of bromine based industrial solutions mainly elemental bromine higher raw material prices higher labor costs and an inventory write off potash icl leverages its well positioned and unique potash assets as well as its logistical advantages to be among the three most competitive suppliers in its key target markets including brazil india china europe and southeast asia icl s cost competitiveness derives from lower logistics costs due to its facilities proximity to ports and customers as well as from continuous optimization of its potash production processes reducing costs and utilizing its capacity potential efficiently in addition icl s boulby mine in the uk is the world s first and sole supplier of polysulphate the potash segment recorded strong potash sales volumes during the fourth quarter the average realized sales price of potash increased by over 20 quarter over quarter to 292 tonne in q4 2018 and by 18 year over year to 278 tonne in fy 2018 sales volumes of approximately 1 5 million tonnes in q4 2018 resulted in record low inventory levels operational efficiencies measures led to record annual production of 3 8 million tonnes at icl dead sea and supported a shift to operating profit in icl s potash operations in spain on a macro basis ongoing delays in new global capacity ramp up are contributing to a balanced market reflected in solid pricing during the off season period the potash segment accounted for 33 of sales and 57 of profit attributed to segments in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 28 of sales and 50 of profit attributed to segments in q4 2017 the segment accounted for 27 of sales and 39 of profit attributed to segments in 2018 compared to 23 of sales and 31 of profit attributed to segments in 2017 significant highlights and business environment potash prices continued to increase during q4 2018 despite the agricultural season ending in key regions including brazil us and europe supported by low availability of product for spot sales this can be considered as a positive indication towards the first quarter of 2019 according to cru fertilizer week historical prices january 2019 the average price of granular potash imported to brazil for q4 2018 was 350 per tonne cfr up by 6 1 and 25 compared to q3 2018 and q4 2017 respectively us and supported by low availability of product for spot sales this can be considered as a positive indication towards the first quarter of 2019 according to cru fertilizer week historical prices the average price of granular potash imported to for q4 2018 was per tonne cfr up by 6 1 and 25 compared to q3 2018 and q4 2017 respectively the grain price index which peaked during q2 2018 remained quite steady during q4 as corn and soybean prices increased while wheat and rice prices decreased the increase in soybean price is explained by a decrease in its production in the us mainly due to the us china trade dispute resulting in a decrease in the us export to china this has led to an increase in chinese soybean imports from brazil while the us has increased its soybean export to other geographical markets the decrease in wheat prices is related mainly to higher exports from russia and an increase in the production in canada which were higher than the decrease in exports from australia due to a continuing drought in the latter according to the wasde world agricultural supply and demand estimates reports from november and december 2018 this has led to an increase in chinese soybean imports from while the us has increased its soybean export to other geographical markets the decrease in wheat prices is related mainly to higher exports from and an increase in the production in which were higher than the decrease in exports from due to a continuing drought in the latter according to the wasde world agricultural supply and demand estimates reports from november and based on the aforementioned reports the grains stock to use ratio for the 2018 2019 agricultural year is expected to decrease to 29 01 compared with 31 20 at the end of the 2017 2018 agricultural year and compared with 30 55 in the 2016 2017 agricultural year this trend of lower stock to use ratio may be supportive for fertilizer

according to the fai fertilizer association of india potash imports during 2018 amounted to 4 4 million tonnes a 1 increase over 2017 the moderate increase can be explained by low availability of potash potash imports during 2018 amounted to 4 4 million tonnes a 1 increase over 2017 the moderate increase can be explained by low availability of potash according to preliminary data potash

primarily by higher potash prices offset by an increase in marine transportation prices as well as an increase in operating and other expenses deriving mainly from an inventory write off in the uk higher depreciation and royalty expenses in israel and increased operational costs in spain and israel the moderate positive impact of sales quantities derived mainly from product mix due to increased share of sales of lower margin products such as polysulphate and electricity surplus sales to third parties from the new power plant in sodom the negative impact of exchange rates on sales due to the devaluation of the euro and the british pound against the dollar was more than offset by the devaluation of the israeli shekel which contributed to lower production costs in dollar terms the increase in the segment s profit in 2018 is attributed mainly to higher prices which overcompensated for unfavorable product mix mainly due to higher share of lower margin products such as polysulphate and electricity impact of exchange rates on production costs in dollar terms higher marine transportation prices and higher operating and other expenses mainly an increase in royalties expenses recorded

additional margins on top of the commodity margin phosphate solutions results in the fourth quarter of 2018 improved compared to the corresponding quarter last year the improved performance was supported by higher prices of phosphate commodities and specialties this was partly offset by an increase in raw materials prices mainly sulphur and an inventory write off in china the segment s profit margins increased from 5 in q4 2017 to 8 in q4 2018 and from 7 in 2017 to 10 in 2018 driven by synergy utilization and higher prices of specialty and commodity phosphates which more than compensated for an annual increase of 50 million in raw material costs the segment s ten year profit record for specialty phosphates was driven by its value over volume strategy the segment also significantly improved the performance of its yph jv which shifted to profitability during the year the phosphate solutions segment accounted for 33 of sales and 14 of profit attributed to segments in

million compared to 1 361 million in q4 2017 an increase of 4 sales excluding divestments increased by more than 8 from 1 301 million in q4 2017 higher prices across all of icl s value chains overcompensated for the negative impact of the devaluation of the euro and the chinese yuan against the us dollar fy 2018 sales increased to 5 56 billion compared to 5 42 billion in fy 2017 a growth of 3 sales excluding divestments was 5 51 billion in fy 2018 compared to 5 08 billion in fy 2017 an increase of more than 8 higher prices the upward revaluation of the euro against the dollar and higher sales volumes of flame retardants specialty fertilizers and dairy proteins more than offset lower sales volumes of potash commodity phosphates and specialty phosphates operating income operating income in q4 2018 was 166 million compared to 189 million in q4 2017 a decrease of 12 mainly due to a capital gain of 48 million recorded in the comparable period last year adjusted operating income excluding divestments which excludes the contribution of divested businesses provisions for prior periods royalties and for closure costs of the sallent mine in spain towards the site consolidation and as part of the restoration solution increased by 40 to 214 million the increase was driven by higher prices lower energy costs and favorable exchange rates devaluation of the euro israeli shekel and yuan decreased costs in dollar terms this was partially offset by higher marine transportation and raw material prices sulphur used in the phosphate value chain and raw materials used in the production of bromine and phosphorous flame retardants and other expenses which include insurance income in israel recorded in the corresponding quarter of 2017 inventory write offs and higher depreciation expenses the negative impact of sales volume derives from unfavorable product mix due to an increase in the sales of polysulphate and the sales of electricity surplus to third parties from the new power plant in sodom together with lower sales volumes of potash phosphate specialties and specialty fertilizers this was partially offset by an increase in the sales volume of bromine based industrial solutions operating income for fy 2018 was 1 519 million compared to 629 million for fy 2017 an increase of about 140 the increase in operating income is mainly attributed to a capital gain of 841 million from the sale of the fire safety and oil additives businesses adjusted operating income excluding divestments which mainly excludes capital gain and contribution from divestments to 2017 2018 results asset impairments and provisions for early retirement legal claims and site closure costs amounted to 750 million in 2018 compared to 530 million in 2017 an increase of 42 the increase is attributed to higher prices and the upward revaluation of the euro against the dollar these were partially offset by higher raw material and marine transportation prices lower sales volume insurance income in israel recorded in 2017 higher royalties and depreciation and inventory write offs financing expenses net the net reported financing expenses in q4 2018 amounted to 66 million compared to 25 million in the corresponding quarter in 2017 excluding expenses deriving from interest on past royalties recognized in the current period the net adjusted financing expenses amounted to 59 million compared to 28 million in q4 2017 which excludes an income in connection with a resolution of tax dispute in belgium interest expenses decreased by 4 million to 25 million the decrease was more than offset by an increase in hedging transaction provisions which derived mainly from the devaluation of the shekel against the dollar a decrease in interest rates and a sharp decrease in energy prices towards the end of the quarter net financial expenses for fy 2018 amounted to 158 million compared to 124 million excluding expenses deriving from interest on past royalties recognized in 2018 in the amount of 10 million the net adjusted financing expenses in 2018 amounted to 148 million a decrease in interest expenses in the amount of 11 million was more than offset mainly by lower financial income as a result of change in exchange rate differences and an increase in provisions for hedging transactions tax expenses tax expenses for q4 2018 amounted to 19 million compared to 13 million in q4 2017 excluding the tax impact of the adjustments to operating income and financial expenses adjusted tax expenses in q4 2018 amounted to 32 million which reflects an adjusted effective tax rate of 20 from adjusted income before tax compared to 2 million in q4 2017 which reflects an effective tax rate of 1 the unusually low tax rate in 2017 was driven by an adjustment of deferred taxes in respect of the change in the tax rate in the us in q4 2017 and a decrease in tax provisions in israel related to the natural resource tax law tax expenses for 2018 amounted to 129 million compared to 158 million in 2017 excluding the tax impact of the adjustments to operating income and financial expenses adjusted tax expenses in 2018 amounted to 136 million which reflects an adjusted effective tax rate of 22 from adjusted income before tax compared to 156 million in 2017 which reflects an adjusted effective tax rate of 30 the decrease in 2018 is attributed to lower profit deriving from the us following the divestitures lower tax rate in the us the devaluation of the shekel against the dollar during the year and a decrease in tax provisions in israel cash flow debt level in q4 2018 operating cash flow decreased by 53 million compared to the corresponding quarter in 2017 to 224 million this decrease derives primarily from a decrease of 30 million in working capital recorded in q4 2018 compared with a decrease of 57 million during q4 2017 this is attributed to a more moderate decrease in trade receivables as a result of the late signings of the potash supply contracts in china and india in addition operating cash flow was negatively impacted by payments of royalties to the israeli government in respect if prior periods and cash paid due to derivatives transactions these were partly offset by lower tax payments in this quarter compared with the corresponding quarter last year operating cash flow for 2018 amounted to 620 million compared to 847 million in 2017 the decrease is attributed to an increase in inventory and trade receivables cash flow used for the purchase of property plant equipment and intangible assets amounted to 179 million and 572 million in q4 2018 and fy 2018 respectively compared to 140 million and 457 million in q4 2017 and fy 2017 respectively the increase derives mainly from several infrastructure projects in icl s potash division the company s net financial liabilities at the end of 2018 amounted to 2 212 million a decrease of 825 million compared to december 31 2017 the significant decrease is mainly due to proceeds received from the sale of the fire safety and oil additives businesses review of operating segments industrial products icl s global leadership in the bromine industry is driven by its focus on delivering value to its customers rather than increasing volume icl is able to generate more value by leveraging its unique assets and know how and by fostering innovation through the development of new applications such as new bromine and phosphorus based flame retardants magnesia and salt products as well as other solutions icl continues to leverage its unique logistical advantages and unparalleled experience related to the safety and environmental aspects of its bromine business the industrial products segment recorded another strong quarter driven by higher prices across its bromine value chain as well as most of its complementary businesses and resulting in an all time record of annual segment profit higher prices drove an approximately 2 expansion in quarterly and annual segment profit margins industrial products accounted for 22 of sales and 30 of profit attributed to segments in q4 2018 compared to 22 of sales and 31 of profit attributed to segments in q4 2017 the segment accounted for 23 of sales and 35 of profit attributed to segments in 2018 compared to 22 of sales and 33 of profit attributed to segments in 2017 significant highlights and business environment during q4 2018 elemental bromine prices in china increased compared to q3 2018 and compared to q4 2017 as local bromine production was affected by strict environmental related regulatory pressure and the winter shutdown increased compared to q3 2018 and compared to q4 2017 as local bromine production was affected by strict environmental related regulatory pressure and the winter shutdown demand for bromine based flame retardants during q4 was lower compared to prior periods however the segment is benefitting from higher prices as a result of elevated bromine prices icl industrial products successfully secured several supply agreements for bromine compounds for 2019 mostly with higher prices and stable volumes icl continues its efforts to conclude additional agreements clear brine fluids sales were higher compared to the corresponding quarter mainly due to continuation of higher drilling activity in the gulf of mexico nevertheless sales in q4 2018 were moderately lower compared to the exceptional level in q2 and q3 2018 nevertheless sales in q4 2018 were moderately lower compared to the exceptional level in q2 and q3 2018 higher prices were recorded for phosphorous based flame retardants in icl s markets us and europe compared to the corresponding quarter as a result of continuous strict environmental related regulatory pressure in china which impacted chinese production and exports compared to the corresponding quarter as a result of continuous strict environmental related regulatory pressure in which

annual results analysis in the appendix the increase in the segment s profit in q4 2018 over the corresponding period in 2017 resulted mainly from an increase in the selling prices of bromine based industrial solutions and flame retardants as well as phosphorous based flame retardants which overcompensated for higher raw material prices and an inventory write off the contribution of higher sales quantities is attributed to improved mix due to an increase in the quantities sold of bromine based industrial solutions mostly clear brine fluids the positive impact of exchange rates derives mainly from the devaluation of the israeli shekel against the dollar decreasing production costs partly offset by the devaluation of the euro against the dollar which decreased revenue on an annual basis the increase in segment profit is attributable to higher prices and sales volumes across most of the segment s products which overcompensated for a decrease in the sales quantities of bromine based industrial solutions mainly elemental bromine higher raw material prices higher labor costs and an inventory write off potash icl leverages its well positioned and unique potash assets as well as its logistical advantages to be among the three most competitive suppliers in its key target markets including brazil india china europe and southeast asia icl s cost competitiveness derives from lower logistics costs due to its facilities proximity to ports and customers as well as from continuous optimization of its potash production processes reducing costs and utilizing its capacity potential efficiently in addition icl s boulby mine in the uk is the world s first and sole supplier of polysulphate the potash segment recorded strong potash sales volumes during the fourth quarter the average realized sales price of potash increased by over 20 quarter over quarter to 292 tonne in q4 2018 and by 18 year over year to 278 tonne in fy 2018 sales volumes of approximately 1 5 million tonnes in q4 2018 resulted in record low inventory levels operational efficiencies measures led to record annual production of 3 8 million tonnes at icl dead sea and supported a shift to operating profit in icl s potash operations in spain on a macro basis ongoing delays in new global capacity ramp up are contributing to a balanced market reflected in solid pricing during the off season period the potash segment accounted for 33 of sales and 57 of profit attributed to segments in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 28 of sales and 50 of profit attributed to segments in q4 2017 the segment accounted for 27 of sales and 39 of profit attributed to segments in 2018 compared to 23 of sales and 31 of profit attributed to segments in 2017 significant highlights and business environment potash prices continued to increase during q4 2018 despite the agricultural season ending in key regions including brazil us and europe supported by low availability of product for spot sales this can be considered as a positive indication towards the first quarter of 2019 according to cru fertilizer week historical prices january 2019 the average price of granular potash imported to brazil for q4 2018 was 350 per tonne cfr up by 6 1 and 25 compared to q3 2018 and q4 2017 respectively us and supported by low availability of product for spot sales this can be considered as a positive indication towards the first quarter of 2019 according to cru fertilizer week historical prices the average price of granular potash imported to for q4 2018 was per tonne cfr up by 6 1 and 25 compared to q3 2018 and q4 2017 respectively the grain price index which peaked during q2 2018 remained quite steady during q4 as corn and soybean prices increased while wheat and rice prices decreased the increase in soybean price is explained by a decrease in its production in the us mainly due to the us china trade dispute resulting in a decrease in the us export to china this has led to an increase in chinese soybean imports from brazil while the us has increased its soybean export to other geographical markets the decrease in wheat prices is related mainly to higher exports from russia and an increase in the production in canada which were higher than the decrease in exports from australia due to a continuing drought in the latter according to the wasde world agricultural supply and demand estimates reports from november and december 2018 this has led to an increase in chinese soybean imports from while the us has increased its soybean export to other geographical markets the decrease in wheat prices is related mainly to higher exports from and an increase in the production in which were higher than the decrease in exports from due to a continuing drought in the latter according to the wasde world agricultural supply and demand estimates reports from november and based on the aforementioned reports the grains stock to use ratio for the 2018 2019 agricultural year is expected to decrease to 29 01 compared with 31 20 at the end of the 2017 2018 agricultural year and compared with 30 55 in the 2016 2017 agricultural year this trend of lower stock to use ratio may be supportive for fertilizer demand according to preliminary data potash imports to china in 2018 reached 7 5 million tonnes a decrease of 1 compared to 2017 in 2018 reached 7 5 million tonnes a decrease of 1 compared to 2017 according to the fai fertilizer association of india potash imports during 2018 amounted to 4 4 million tonnes a 1 increase over 2017 the moderate increase can be explained by low availability of potash potash imports during 2018 amounted to 4 4 million tonnes a 1 increase over 2017 the moderate increase can be explained by low availability of potash according to preliminary data potash imports into brazil during 2018 were over 10 5 million tonnes surpassing last year s record by 8 during 2018 were over 10 5 million tonnes surpassing last year s record by 8 supply side developments

about 230 thousand tonne in the dead sea and spain overcompensating for a decrease of about 115 thousand tonnes in the uk the increased production in the dead sea derived mainly from efficiency measures throughout the production process the increase in spain derived mainly from an efficiency plan implemented at the beginning of 2018 and from higher ore grade in the area mined in the first quarter of 2018 the decrease in sales volumes derived mainly from icl s low inventory level in the beginning of 2018 which impacted product availability and resulted in lower sales volume to the

primarily by higher potash prices offset by an increase in marine transportation prices as well as an increase in operating and other expenses deriving mainly from an inventory write off in the uk higher depreciation and royalty expenses in israel and increased operational costs in spain and israel the moderate positive impact of sales quantities derived mainly from product mix due to increased share of sales of lower margin products such as polysulphate and electricity surplus sales to third parties from the new power plant in sodom the negative impact of exchange rates on sales due to the devaluation of the euro and the british pound against the dollar was more than offset by the devaluation of the israeli shekel which contributed to lower production costs in dollar terms the increase in the segment s profit in 2018 is attributed mainly to higher prices which overcompensated for unfavorable product mix mainly due to higher share of lower margin products such as polysulphate and electricity impact of exchange rates on production costs in dollar terms higher marine transportation prices and higher operating and other expenses mainly an increase in royalties expenses recorded in connection with dsw s collective labor agreement and higher depreciation expenses in israel and the uk phosphate solutions the phosphate solutions segment s strategy is to be a leading provider of value added specialty solutions based on phosphate for diversified industrial food and agriculture markets the goal is to outgrow the market by enhancing customer relationships and in parallel optimizing upstream capabilities directed towards specialty products the diversification into higher value added specialty products leverages icl s integrated business model and provides it with additional margins on top of the commodity margin phosphate solutions results in the fourth quarter of 2018 improved compared to the corresponding quarter last year the improved performance was supported by higher prices of phosphate commodities and specialties this was partly offset by an increase in raw materials prices mainly sulphur and an inventory write off in china the segment s profit margins increased from 5 in q4 2017 to 8 in q4 2018 and from 7 in 2017 to 10 in 2018 driven by synergy utilization and higher prices of specialty and commodity phosphates which more than compensated for an annual increase of 50 million in raw material costs the segment s ten year profit record for specialty phosphates was driven by its value over volume strategy the segment also significantly improved the performance of its yph jv which shifted to profitability during the year the phosphate solutions segment accounted for 33 of sales and 14 of profit attributed to segments in

total 926 689 at december 30 2018 order backlog was 926 million 34 higher than at december 31 2017 higher order backlog was primarily driven by increased order bookings in the life sciences and transportation markets in the first nine months of fiscal 2019 outlook the company s order bookings are generally variable and sensitive to changes in the major economies the company serves including the u s canada europe and asia the global economic environment has shown recent signs of slowing growth and geopolitical risks remain ongoing trade negotiations and disputes between various jurisdictions in which the company does business may impact its future sales and operations management will continue to closely monitor ongoing global trade discussions which could impact the company and identify mitigation opportunities funnel activity which includes customer requests for proposal and ats identified customer opportunities in life sciences remains strong opportunities in the electrification of vehicles have strengthened funnel activity in the transportation market funnel activity in energy is variable and this market provides niche opportunities for ats funnel activity in the consumer products electronics market has improved however it remains low relative to other customer markets overall the company s funnel remains significant however conversion of opportunities into order bookings is variable as customers are cautious in their approach to capital investment the company s sales organization continues to work to engage customers on enterprise type solutions enterprise orders are expected to provide ats with more strategic customer relationships better program control and workload predictability and less short term sensitivity to macroeconomic forces this approach to market and the timing of customer decisions on larger opportunities is expected to cause variability in order bookings from quarter to quarter and lengthen the performance period and revenue recognition for certain customer programs the company expects its order backlog of 926 million at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2019 to partially mitigate the impact of volatile order bookings on revenues in the short term the composition of the company s order backlog has changed materially in fiscal 2019 with the addition of several large enterprise programs that the company has won over the past 12 months these enterprise programs have longer periods of performance and therefore longer revenue recognition cycles the company s current order backlog of 926 million provides ats with significant visibility into revenues over the next several quarters with these changes in the composition of the company s order backlog in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 management expects order backlog conversion to be in the 30 to 35 range as a result of the longer periods of performance of the larger enterprise programs embedded in the company s current order backlog the services strategy is expected to add incremental revenues over time as the attach rate of services contracts on new equipment increases and as the penetration of the installed base improves the company is working to grow service revenues as a percentage of overall revenues over time which is expected to provide some balance to the capital expenditure cycle of the company s customers but may not fully offset capital spending volatility the company is deploying the abm across its divisions globally the initial roll out of the abm has been completed which included company wide training and deployment of tools to standardize problem solving and continuous improvement processes as the initial abm tools are implemented management will deploy additional tools as part of the ongoing advancement of the abm with the goal of driving growth and continuous sustained performance improvements across the company management expects that the abm will provide the company with a long term competitive advantage in delivering value to its customers and shareholders the company is pursuing several initiatives with the goal of expanding its adjusted earnings from operations margin over the long term including growing the company s higher margin after sales service business improving global supply chain management increasing the use of standardized platforms and technologies growing revenues while leveraging the company s current cost structure and the ongoing development and adoption of the abm the company seeks to expand its position in the global automation market organically and through

individual markets served by the company tend to be cyclical in nature operating performance quarter to quarter may also be affected by the timing of revenue recognition on large programs in order backlog which is impacted by such factors as customer delivery schedules and the timing of third party content and by the timing of acquisitions general economic trends product life cycles and product changes may impact revenues and operating performance ats typically experiences some seasonality with its order bookings revenues and earnings from operations due to summer plant shutdowns by its customers critical accounting estimates and assumptions the preparation of the company s interim condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the end of the reporting period uncertainty about these estimates judgments and assumptions could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset or liability affected in future periods the company based its assumptions on information available when the interim condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments may change due to market changes or circumstances arising beyond the control of the company such changes are reflected in the estimates as they occur in addition to the critical accounting estimates described in the company s fiscal 2018 md a acquisitions that meet the definition of a business combination require the company to recognize the assets acquired and liabilities at their fair market value on the date of the acquisition the calculation of fair value of the assets and liabilities may require the use of estimates and assumptions based on discounted cash flows market information and using independent valuations and management s best estimates accounting standard adopted in fiscal 2019 ifrs 15 revenue from contracts with customers effective april 1 2018 the company adopted ifrs 15 revenue from contracts with customers ifrs 15 in accordance with the modified retrospective transitional approach there were no transitional adjustments or changes to the company s revenue recognition policies required on the adoption of this standard as required in the interim consolidated statements of income the company disaggregated revenue recognized from contracts with customers into categories that depict how the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors ifrs 15 establishes a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers under ifrs 15 revenue is recognized at an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer the principles in ifrs 15 provide a more structured approach to measuring and recognizing revenue the standard also specifies the accounting for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract and the costs directly related to fulfilling a contract the standard requires contract assets and contract liabilities to be separately presented in the statement of financial position contract assets represent the right to consideration in exchange for goods or services that have been transferred to a customer contract liabilities represent the obligation to transfer goods and services to a customer for which the company has received consideration or an amount of consideration is due from the customer previously the company recognized contract assets as costs and earnings in excess of billings on contracts in progress and contract liabilities as billings in excess of costs and earnings on contracts in progress based on ifrs 15 contract assets and contract liabilities have been disclosed as current assets and current liabilities respectively in the statement of financial position accounting standards issued but not yet effective ifrs 16 leases in january 2016 the iasb issued ifrs 16 leases ifrs 16 which requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for most leases there are minimal changes to the existing accounting in ias 17 leases from the perspective of lessors the new standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after january 1 2019 with early adoption permitted provided ifrs 15 has been adopted or is adopted at the same date the company does not anticipate early adoption and plans to adopt the standard for the annual period beginning on april 1 2019 the company is currently assessing the impact of adopting this new standard on its consolidated financial statements but expects that the adoption of ifrs 16 will result in higher non current assets and non current liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial position controls and procedures the chief executive officer ceo and the chief financial officer cfo are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting for the company the control framework used in the design of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting is the

news analysis many attribute china s 2018 economic slowdown to the u s china trade war with a prospect of continued softness in 2019 many countries impatiently wait for the end of the trade war they look toward china s return to economic growth hoping that china will continue to be the engine of the global economy the biggest buyer of resources and the biggest consumer of products made by developed countries even in germany the engine of the european economy its business community also shares such hopes they do not realize it s purely wishful thinking in fact china s economy started to decline as early as 2015 and the current trade war has just accelerated the process china s overseas shopping spree stopped in the past 15 or 16 years chinese buyers have been a key driver of some countries economic growth there are two types of buyers one is investment including major mergers and acquisitions by china s state owned enterprises and overseas investments by the private sector the other is international tourism by chinese consumers accompanied by the purchase of luxury products china s overseas investments seem strong according to the 2017 statistical bulletin of china s outward foreign direct investment issued by china s ministry of commerce china s total foreign direct investment was 158 29 billion only behind the united states and japan its foreign direct investment was the world s second highest at 1 81 trillion from january to september 2018 china s overseas mergers and acquisitions were 1 07 trillion 11 2 percent higher than the previous year according to thomson one but in the meantime the privately owned businesses that have been buying assets overseas such as hna group dalian wanda group anbang insurance and fosun international have been selling their previous purchases with deep discounts and moving the money back to china the reason behind this is pressure from the chinese communist party government according to the financial times china s hna made more than 40 billion worth of overseas acquisitions between 2015 and 2017 now hna is selling its properties bit by bit at low prices from stocks real estate to even office buildings on dec 26 2018 during the china brand forum chen feng the chairman of hna said in an interview that it had sold over 300 billion yuan 44 billion of assets in 2018 alone setting a new world record these companies all have more than a 70 percent debt ratio their funds for the m a activity came from chinese bank loans or financial products they issued their shopping spree caused china s foreign exchange reserves to plummet at the end of 2016 china s foreign exchange reserves dropped below 3 trillion chinese premier li keqiang had to face the embarrassing reality right under my nose i watched hundreds and hundreds of billions of capital flowing away against this backdrop the china banking regulatory commission ordered a thorough overseas credit audit and risk analysis on businesses including wanda anbang hna fosun and zhejiang rossoneri focusing on m a and coercive lending an internal battle to protect foreign exchange reserves began as china s private sector giants move capital back to china and chinese buyers decline in number housing prices dropped in places like new york city and australia for many years soaring chinese capital had boosted housing price globally the trend has reversed since 2018 when the chinese government tightened control over capital outflows according to real capital analytics statistics chinese companies and organizational investors sold 233 million worth of real estate in europe including hotels office buildings and other commercial properties and purchased only 58 million of real estate in europe in the united states chinese investors sold more than 1 billion against purchases of only 231 million in australia the housing market is cooling down due to the declining number of chinese buyers analysts universally predict that the real estate market will continue to decline in 2019 china no longer a dream market for foreign investors in his article american entrepreneurs who flocked to china are heading home disillusioned wall street journal reporter james t areddy said that foreign entrepreneurs find it much tougher to do business in china due to soaring costs creeping taxation tightening political control and capricious regulation and that their best days were in the past the problems with the chinese investment environment discussed in the article have actually existed for a long time in addition to rising land and salary cost foreign investors are also burdened with regulation costs losses due to the lack of transparency in policy and law and external costs e g costs incurred to protect intellectual property or business credibility which are tightly connected to government policies the article specifically called out the external cost for intellectual property related challenges saying u s businesses had spent a lot of money and effort on intellectual lawsuits but was not even close to stopping infringement by chinese companies german and french companies also had chinese partners steal their technology and start their own businesses intellectual property infringement remains a major issue today and has become a trigger of the us china trade war the china market has attracted capital from around the world since the 1990s especially from japan the united states and europe not all foreign investments made a profit or even survived their first wave of capital retreat happened from 1999 to 2003 mainly industrial capital followed by the second wave from 2008 to 2013 that involved both manufacture and financing the current wave started at the end of 2015 i have been tracking foreign investments in china and found that all three waves of capital retreats happened for similar reasons namely cost land and labor costs taxation burdens and the regulatory environment billionaire li ka shing is among the early birds in the retreat though he had made quite some money in china he was ready to exit at the peak of his china business his hong kong based ck hutchinson conglomerate began to sell assets as early as 2008 and at the same time established a capital system in europe by the end of 2017 li had cashed out 150 billion yuan 22 billion over the decade and european business accounted for nearly 40 percent of his revenue while the greater china share dropped to about 30 percent taiwanese tycoon terry gou built his fortune in mainland china but he began to increase investment in other countries in 2015 chinese consumer demand crushed by housing debts lately apple s poor performance in china has received a lot of attention but the loss was just moved up a couple of years because the decline of chinese consumer buying power has already begun many external analysts ignored the fact that the buying power decline was not a result of the trade war but the consequence of china s economic structure and income distribution income disparity is worsening according to official statistics china s gini coefficient income inequality measurement has grown for three consecutive years since 2015 in 2017 the index reached 0 467 higher than the united nation s threshold for a dangerous level of 0 4 economic theories hold that the marginal consumption propensity of high income consumers is lower than that of mid low income consumers as a result a country s domestic consumption grows only when mid low income consumers spend more chinese consumers contributed to one third of the world s luxury goods sales in 2016 according to mckinsey s china luxury report 2017 a large part of luxury goods purchases happened overseas so it has very limited impact on china s domestic market chinese consumers leverage ratio remains high limiting the growth potential or consumer consumption the chinese academy of social sciences estimated that china s consumer leverage ratio consumers debts to gdp soared from 28 percent in 2011 to 49 percent in 2017 the per capita debt is 170 000 yuan approximately 25 000 according to official data in january 2018 some predicted the per capita ratio will be over 60 percent and personal housing loans will be the key driver of growing debts all other industries will feel the pressure simply because the heavy mortgage burdens will inevitably impact all other consumptions as china s homeowners struggle to pay their mortgages adjusting economic structure is better than fantasizing about china s rescue no matter how much foreign analysts wish to see china recover and continue to drive global economic growth the truth is that china s growth has come to an end as heavy handed as the chinese government is in controlling the economy it has no other strategy than to print more money and increase government spending the above facts show that china has long lost its charm as a dream market the trade war only reinforced foreign investors decision to leave china and made the situation more difficult for china lately apple s poor performance in china has received a lot of attention but the loss was just moved up a couple of years because the decline of chinese consumer buying power has already begun many external analysts ignored the fact that the buying power decline was not a result of the trade war but the consequence of china s economic structure and income distribution no matter how much foreign analysts wish to see china recover and continue to drive global economic growth the truth is that china s growth has come to an end as heavy handed as the chinese government is in controlling the economy it has no other strategy than to print more money and increase government spending in january 2019 china s central bank announced it would cut the bank reserve requirements by 1 percentage point to spur bank loans the move will inject 150 million yuan 22 million to the market this was the fifth time the central bank lowered bank reserve requirements in less than a year in the meantime china s macroeconomic management agency the national development and reform commission ndrc approved over 1 2 trillion yuan of infrastructure projects such as metro light rails showing infrastructure again became beijing s key approach to stabilize the economy for many years china s capital moved from the real economy to economic bubbles via real estate and the stock market a recent international monetary fund report said such credit stimulus has brought china to a point of diminishing returns since part of the new debts will be used to repay previous debts to realize the same growth as before the country will need three times as much debt therefore china s biggest challenge is to prevent loans from turning into bubbles the world is witnessing all sorts of frictions and turmoil that accompany the reversal of globalization president donald trump did not sabotage the existing global trade system instead he adjusted the structure into two separate systems a system of free trade between the united states and its traditional trade partners and another system outside of the free trade system that includes china so far neither system has been fully shaped but it is certain that china won t be able to serve as the engine for the global economy instead of looking to china for rescue i think western countries should adjust their own economic structure to fit into a world without china as the buyer and investor
pres trump thank you very much madam speaker vice president members of congress the first lady of the united states applause and my fellow americans we meet tonight at a moment of unlimited potential as we begin a new congress i stand here ready to work with you to achieve historic breakthroughs for all americans millions of our fellow citizens are watching us gathered in this great chamber hoping we will govern not as two parties but as one nation this type of unifying rhetoric directed from trump to the country as a whole rather than to his opponents or his supporters has been rare over the past two years it is not the tone trump was striking earlier today when he slammed senate minority leader chuck schumer by name and mocked him and democrats for their failure to take back the senate after spending a fortune applause the agenda i will lay out this evening is not a republican agenda or democrat agenda it is the agenda of the american people many of us have campaigned on the same core promises to defend american jobs and demand fair trade for american workers to rebuild and revitalize our nation s infrastructure to reduce the price of health care and prescription drugs to create an immigration system that is safe lawful modern and secure and to pursue a foreign policy that puts america s interests first there is a new opportunity in american politics if only we have the courage together to seize it trade the trump administration has argued since day one that the u s must make trade fair and balanced with its partners that process has included the renegotiation of the 25 year old north american free trade agreement and escalating trade tensions with china health care poll after poll says americans are angry about high health costs and the trump administration has repeatedly seen lowering those costs Ã¢ and prescription drug prices in particular Ã¢ as an opportunity for bipartisan legislation more to come on this later in the speech immigration trump has pursued an immigration crackdown since taking office from the border wall to family separations that democrats resoundingly oppose foreign policy trump is quite quickly making a reference to his foreign policy philosophy often branded as america first critics say it s more like america alone but trump supporters say it s about not letting other countries take advantage of the united states advertisement applause victory is not winning for our party victory is winning for our country applause this year america will recognize two important anniversaries that show us the majesty of america s vision and the power of american pride in june we marked 75 years since the start of what general dwight d eisenhower called the great crusade the allied liberation of europe in world war ii applause on d day june 6 1944 15 000 young american men jumped from the skies and 60 000 more stormed in from the sea to save our civilization from tyranny here with us tonight are three of those incredible heroes private first class joseph riley staff sergeant erving walker Ã¢ and sergeant sartman zeitcheck applause gentlemen we salute you in 2019 we also celebrate 50 years since brave young pilots flew 1 million miles through space to plant the american flag on the face of the moon half a century later we are joined by one of the apollo 11 astronauts who planted that flag buzz aldrin applause thank you buzz this year american astronauts will go back to space in american rockets advertisement applause in the 20th century america saved freedom transformed science redefined the middle class and when you get down to it there is nothing anywhere in the world that can compete with america applause now we must step boldly and bravely into the next chapter of this great american adventure we must create a new standard of living for the 21st century an amazing quality of life for all of our citizens is within reach we can make our communities safer our families stronger our culture richer our faith deeper and our middle class bigger and more prosperous than ever before applause but we must reject the politics of revenge resistance and retribution and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation compromise and the common good applause together we can break decades of political stalemate we can bridge all divisions heal old wounds build new coalitions forge new solutions and unlock the extraordinary promise of america s future the decision is ours to make we must choose between greatness or gridlock results or resistance vision or vengeance incredible progress or pointless destruction tonight i ask you to choose greatness this is similar to the tone trump struck in his first state of the union address last year when he called for one american family the white house said tonight s speech would be unifying but trump s critics are doubtful that this peacemaking attitude will last this is trumpÃ¢ s first state of the union address in an era of divided government the sharp polarization has become abundantly clear in the first four weeks culminating in the longest ever government shutdown that left lawmakers of both parties anxious about the two years ahead applause over the last two years my administration has moved with an urgency and historic speed to confront problems neglected by leaders of both parties over many decades in just over two years since the election we have launched an unprecedented economic boom a boom that has rarely been seen before there has been nothing like it we have created 5 3 million new jobs and importantly added 600 000 new manufacturing jobs something which almost everyone said was impossible to do but the fact is we are just getting started trade this is a common talking point among white house officials that trump has followed through on promises made but not kept by previous republican and democratic presidents his aides often point to last yearÃ¢ s opening of a u s embassy in jerusalem and more recently the bipartisan criminal justice reform bill he signed into law the economy the economy has continued to expand under trump following a trend that began under former president barack obama the u s gross domestic product increased 4 2 percent in the second quarter of 2018 Ã¢ touching trumpÃ¢ s goal for economic growth but obama surpassed that level four times during his presidency he even hit 5 percent growth in fiscal year 2014 advertisement applause wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades and growing for blue collar workers who promise to fight for they are growing faster than anyone else nearly 5 million americans have been lifted off food stamps applause the u s economy is growing almost twice as fast today as when i took office and we are considered far and away the hottest economy anywhere in the world not even close applause unemployment has reached the lowest rate in over half a century the economy in september unemployment fell to 3 7 percent the lowest it had been since december 1969 last month the unemployment rate was 4 percent applause african american hispanic american and asian american unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded applause unemployment for americans with disabilities has also reached an all time low advertisement applause more people are working now than at anytime in the history of our country 157 million people at work we passed a massive tax cut for working families and doubled the child tax credit taxes as recently as last month during a speech to farmers in new orleans trump said he was surprised by the popularity of the increased child tax credit something ivanka trump had pushed to include in the 2017 gop tax bill it turned out to be so popular he said on jan 14 applause we have virtually ended the estate tax or death tax that is Ã¢ as it is called for small businesses ranches and family farms applause we eliminated the very unpopular obamacare individual mandate penalty health care fact check true the individual mandate penalty was one of the least popular parts of the affordable care act and republicans got rid of it in their tax bill at the end of 2017 itÃ¢ s still not clear if the gop s move is helping or hurting health insurance enrollment applause and to give critically ill patients access to life saving cures we passed very importantly right to try that we know of only two patients have used the Ã¢ right to tryÃ¢ pathway passed in may to gain access experimental medicines itÃ¢ s not without controversy supporters say the law gives dying patients access to potentially life saving therapies but critics argue itÃ¢ s trying to roll back fda powers applause my administration has cut more regulations in a short period of time than any other administration during its entire tenure advertisement applause companies are coming back to our country in large numbers thanks to our historic reductions in taxes and regulations applause and we have unleashed a revolution in american energy the united states is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world the u s produced record amounts of oil and natural gas last year both of which are expected to grow through 2020 industry says the trump administrationÃ¢ s policies have buoyed production but most occurs on private and state land not federal but the boom in oil and gas production began a decade ago thanks to industry advances that well preceded trump s presidency the administration will in weeks unveil a five year plan that could allow oil and gas leasing in waters off the alaskan pacific and atlantic coasts and the eastern gulf of mexico applause and now for the first time in 65 years we are a net exporter of energy trade the u s isn t yet a net exporter of energy although the international energy agency expects the u s will be the worldÃ¢ s largest exporter of liquefied natural gas by the mid 2020s and be a net exporter of oil a few years later how much trump has mattered is debatable key policies expedited exports were set under former president barack obama such as ending a four decade ban on sending crude oil abroad in 2015 and establishing a process for natural gas exports applause after 24 months of rapid progress our economy is the envy of the world our military is the most powerful on earth by far and america foreign policy though trump and republicans succeeded in boosting defense spending and launching a major military buildup the u s armed forces were largely regarded as the most powerful in the world beforehand applause america is again winning each and every day advertisement applause members of congress the state of our union is strong applause crowd chanting usa that sounds so good laughter our country is vibrant and our economy is thriving like never before friday it was announced we added another 304 000 jobs last month alone almost double the number expected the economy the economy has continued to create jobs under trump including 304k jobs added in january Ã¢ a particularly strong showing however the job creation trend began under president obama who entered office during a recession applause an economic miracle is taking place in the united states and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars politics or ridiculous partisan investigations with their robust new majority house democratic leaders are launching a slew of investigations into trumpÃ¢ s personal business dealings the first in depth probe is expected to involve trumpÃ¢ s ties to the german lending giant deutsche bank applause if there is going to be peace in legislation there cannot be war and investigation it just does not work that way we must be united at home to defeat our adversaries abroad this new era of cooperation can start with finally confirming the more than 300 highly qualified nominees who are still stuck in the senate in some cases years and years waitingÃ¢ not right this remark is the first clear break with the bipartisan tone of the speech reiterating what trump said at his first press conference after the midterm election if democrats investigate him he will not cooperate with them on legislation trump seems to be implying here that the investigations facing his administration are a national security threat that they undermine america s ability to stand up to us adversaries but it s worth noting some of the investigations involve trump s relationship with russia a major us adversary advertisement applause the senate has failed to act on these nominations which is unfair to the nominees and very unfair to our country now is the time for bipartisan action believe it or not we have already proven that is possible in the last congress both parties came together to pass unprecedented legislation to confront the opioid crisis a sweeping new farm bill historic va reforms and after four decades of rejection we passed a va accountability so we can finally terminate those who mistreat our wonderful veterans congress previously passed and president barack obama signed legislation aimed at making it easier to discipline poor performing va employees in 2014 applause and just weeks ago all parties united for groundbreaking criminal justice reform they said it couldn t be done applause last year i heard through friends the story of alice johnson i was deeply moved in 1997 alice was sentenced to life in prison as a first time nonviolent drug offender over the next 22 years she became a prison minister inspiring others to choose a better path she had a big impact on that prison population and far beyond alice s story underscores the disparities and unfairness that can exist in criminal sentencing and the need to remedy this total injustice trumpÃ¢ s commutation of alice johnson speaks to how unusual this white house can seem at times one of the Ã¢ friendsÃ¢ the president repeatedly heard from was kim kardashian west who became familiar with johnsonÃ¢ s case and personally intervened to get her out of prison kardashian west and her husband rapper kanye west met separately with trump in the oval office last year she served almost 22 years and had expected to be in prison for the remainder of her life in june i commuted alice s sentence when i saw alice s beautiful family greet her at the prison gates hugging and kissing and crying and laughing i knew i did something right alice is with us tonight and she is a terrific woman terrific alice please applause alice thank you for reminding us that we always have that power to shapeÃ¢ the power to shape our own destiny thank you very much advertisement applause inspired by stories like alice s my administration worked closely with members of both parties to sign the first step act into law big deal that is a big deal applause this legislation reformed sentencing laws that have wrongly and disproportionately harmed the african american community the first step act gives nonviolent offenders the chance to reenter society as productive law abiding citizens now states across the country are following our lead america is a nation that believes in redemption the first step act is one of the most popular legislative items trump has signed into law in his first term a poll released last december found that 60 percent of americans approved of the bill which trump signed into law on dec 21 we are also joined tonight by matthew charles from tennessee in 1996 at the age of 30 matthew was sentenced to 35 years for selling drugs and related offenses over the next two decades he completed more than 30 bible studies became a law clerk and mentored many of his fellow inmates now matthew was the very first person to be released from prison under the first step act some lawmakers who helped shape congressÃ¢ s criminal justice bill including reps hakeem jeffries d n y and doug collins r ga have begun to talk about a second package looking to go further on sentencing and prison reforms in 2019 applause matthew please applause thank you matthew welcome home advertisement applause now republicans and democrats must join forces again to confront an urgent national crisis congress has 10 days left to pass a bill that will fund our government protect our homeland and secure are very dangerous southern border now is the time for congress to show the world that america is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes cartels drug dealers and human traffickers out of business applause as we speak large organized caravans are on the march to the united states we have just heard that mexican cities in order to remove the illegal immigrants from their communities are getting trucks and buses to bring them up to our country in areas where there is little border protection i have ordered another 3 750 troops to our southern border to prepare for this tremendous onslaught immigration many of the so called Ã¢ caravanÃ¢ migrants who recently arrived in northern mexico intend to seek asylum lawfully in the u s according to media reports a separate caravan that provoked trumpÃ¢ s ire in the run up to novemberÃ¢ s midterm elections did clash with mexican authorities when crossing into that country from guatemala but much of its travel was peaceful trump has deployed both national guard and active duty military troops to secure the border where they play a support role that allows more border patrol agents to move into the field in june politico reported that national guard troops in southern arizona were given assignments far away from the border including feeding and shoveling out manure from the stalls of the border patrolÃ¢ s horses this is a moral issue the lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety security and financial well being of all americans we have a moral duty to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens this includes our obligation to the millions of immigrants living here today who follow the rules and respected our laws legal immigrants enrich our nation and strengthen our society in countless ways immigration the effect of immigration Ã¢ both legal and illegal Ã¢ on the wages of native born workers is Ã¢ very small Ã¢ according to an extensive 2016 report by the national academies of sciences engineering and medicine the workers most likely to experience negative wage effects are prior immigrants or native born workers without a high school diploma immigration the trump administration hasnÃ¢ t just targeted illegal immigration Ã¢ itÃ¢ s moved to crack down on the legal immigration system too a series of policy changes have made it harder for employers to obtain foreign workers according to business groups and immigration attorneys applause i want people to come into our country in the largest numbers ever but they have to come in legally advertisement applause tonight i m asking you to defend our very dangerous southern border out of love and devotion to our fellow citizens and our country no issue better illustrates the divide between america s working class and america s political class than illegal immigration wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards immigration a gallup poll released this week found 60 percent of americans oppose building a wall along the u s mexico border Ã¢ trumpÃ¢ s signature immigration project and the impetus for a 35 day partial shutdown of the federal government a politico morning consult poll similarly found only a third of registered voters considered it Ã¢ very importantÃ¢ for trump to talk about the border wall in his address applause meanwhile working class americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal immigration reduced jobs lower wages overburdened schools hospitals that are so crowded you can t get in increased crime and a depleted social safety net immigration overall immigration increases the u s economic output but it can strain state and local governments due to the cost of educating children according to a 2016 report by the national academies of sciences engineering and medicine that said children of immigrants grow up to be some of the strongest economic contributors in the u s according to the researchers Ã¢ contributing more in taxes than either their parents or the rest of the native born population Ã¢ tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate it is actually very cruel applause one in three women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north smugglers use migrant children as human pawns to exploit our laws and gain access to our country immigration a 2017 report by doctors without borders found 31 percent of female migrants and 17 percent of male migrants said they had been sexually abused while traveling through mexico for the report the medical organization randomly surveyed 467 migrants in shelters that it supports in mexico Ã¢ what it called a snapshot in time based on the population available in the selected facilities human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the united states and to sell them into prostitution and modern day slavery immigration groups representing 80 anti trafficking organizations called trumpÃ¢ s recent statements about human trafficking Ã¢ dangerous and destructiveÃ¢ in a letter to members of congress before tuesday nightÃ¢ s address they argued that foreign trafficking victims primarily enter the u s on visas in recent weeks trump has repeated stories about trafficked women tied up with duct tape placed over their mouths but experts have said thatÃ¢ s closer to a hollywood movie than the reality of human smuggling tens of thousands of innocent americans are killed by lethal drugs that cross our border and flood into our cities including meth heroin cocaine and fentanyl immigration mexican cartels typically transport drugs over the border through ports of entry according to a 2015 threat assessment by the drug enforcement administration a similar dea report last year found that almost all heroin seized by border officials came through ports of entry the dea said high purity fentanyl a synthetic opioid that can be 100 times stronger than morphine tends to come directly from china the savage gang ms 13 now operates in at least 20 different american states and they almost all come through our southern border just yesterday an ms 13 gang member was taken into custody for a fatal shooting on a subway platform in new york city we are removing these gang members by the thousands but until we secure our border they are going to keep streaming right back in immigration ice said in a december report it removed 1 332 alleged ms 13 gang members and associates in fiscal year 2018 and a little more than 1 000 during the previous year which partly fell under former president barack obama year after year countless americans are murdered by criminal illegal aliens immigration studies show immigrants Ã¢ both legal and undocumented Ã¢ are less likely to commit crimes than native born americans a june 2018 report by the libertarian cato institute found undocumented immigrants were half as likely to be incarcerated as the native born i ve gotten to know many wonderful angel moms and dads and families no one should ever have to suffer the horrible heartache that they have had to endure immigration this is the second year in a row that trump has included a so called angel family on his sotu guest list last year he was joined by the parents of two young women nisa mickens and kayla cuevas who were murdered on long island by members of the transnational criminal group ms 13 here tonight is deborah bissell just three weeks ago her parents were burglarized and shot to death in their reno nevada home by an illegal alien they were in their 80s and are survived by four children 11 grandchildren and 20 great grandchildren also here tonight are gerald and sharon s granddaughter heather and great granddaughter madison to debra heather madison please stand few can understand your pain thank you and thank you for being here very much applause i will never forget and i will fight for the memory of gerald and sharon that it should never happen again not one more american life should be lost because our nation failed to control its very dangerous border in the last two years our brave ice officers made 266 000 arrests of criminal aliens including those charged or convicted of nearly 100 000 assaults 30 000 sex crimes and 4 000 killings or murders immigration ice officers have arrested 3 914 immigrants who have been either charged with or convicted of homicide according to the agency s annual enforcement reports however traffic offenses drug crimes or immigration violations were the most common reasons for an arrest we are joined tonight by one of those law enforcement heroes ice special agent elvin hernandez laughter applause thank you when elvin was a boy his family legally immigrated to the united states from the dominican republic at the age of eight he told his dad he wanted to become a special agent today he leads investigations into the scores of international sex trafficking he says that if i can make sure these young girls get their justice i ve really done my job thanks to his work and that of his incredible colleagues more than 300 women and girls have been rescued from the horror of this terrible situation and more than 1 500 sadistic traffickers have been put behind bars applause we will always support the brave men and women of law enforcement and i pledge to you tonight that i will never abolish our heroes from ice thank you applause my administration has sent to the congress a common sense proposal to end the crisis on our southern border it includes humanitarian assistance more law enforcement drug detection at our ports closing loopholes that enable child smuggling and plans for a new physical barrier or wall to secure the vast areas between our ports of entry in the past most of the people in this room voted for a wallÃ¢ but the proper wall never got built i ll get it built immigration trump is referring to the secure fence act of 2006 a bill signed by former president george w bush that bill included plans for a 700 mile fence though it did not include any money this 2006 bill has become a popular gop talking point since senate minority leader chuck schumer himself voted for the bill as did former sens hillary clinton and barack obama applause this is a smart strategic see through steel barrier Ã¢ not just a simple concrete wall it will be deployed in the areas identified by border agents as having the greatest need and as these agents will tell you where walls go up illegal crossings go way down applause san diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in the country in response a strong security wall was put in place this powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings the border city of el paso texas used to have extremely high rates of violent crimeÃ¢ one of the highest in the country and considered one of our nation s most dangerous cities now immediately upon its building with a powerful barrier in place el paso is one of our safest cities simply put walls work and walls save lives immigration it s interesting that trump cited san diego as a border sector where physical barriers have worked existing fencing along the u s mexico border in souther california is rapidly deteriorating and often compromised in november trump endorsed the use of tear gas against a crowd of central american migrants near this part of the border immigration house democratic leaders put forward their own border proposal last week which included zero dollars for physical barriers speaker nancy pelosi has repeatedly insisted that she will not fund a Ã¢ wallÃ¢ but other democratic negotiators have not ruled out some new money for fencing such as vehicle or pedestrian barriers congressional democrats have agreed to funding for some physical barriers in two previous funding deals with trump applause so let s work together compromise and reach a deal that will truly make america safe as we work to defend our people s safety we must also ensure our economic resurgence continues at a rapid pace no one has benefited more from our thriving economy than women who have filled 58 of the new jobs created in the last year applause you were not supposed to do that thank you very much thank you very much all americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before the economy this line likely came at the suggestion of first daughter and senior white house adviser ivanka trump she has been laser focused on issues involving equality for women in the workplace currently sheÃ¢ s working with bipartisan lawmakers to develop a national paid family leave program applause don t sit yet you are going to like this these remarks directed to newly elected female members of congress were not in the original script but are likely to wind up among the most replayed of the evening the president is at his best and worst when he veers off script laughter and exactly one century after congress passed the constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote we also have more women serving in congress than ever before applause chanting usa that s great laughter very great and congratulations that s great as part of our commitment to improving opportunity for women everywhere this thursday we are launching the first ever government wide initiative focused on economic empowerment for women in developing countries applause to build on our incredible economic success one priority is paramount Ã¢ reversing decades of calamitous trade policies so bad we are now making it clear to china that after years of targeting our industries and stealing our intellectual property the theft of american jobs and wealth has come to an end trade officials from the u s and china have been in negotiations with a hard march 1 deadline to deescalate trade tensions between the world s two largest economies applause therefore we recently imposed tariffs on 250 billion of chinese goods Ã¢ and now our treasury is receiving billions of dollars a month from Ã¢ but i don t blame china for taking advantage of us i blame our leaders and representatives for allowing this travesty to happen i have great respect for president xi and we are now working on a new trade deal with china but it must include real structural change to end unfair trade practices reduce our chronic trade deficit and protect american jobs trade trump often makes this claim but tariffs the ones heÃ¢ s referring to are not paid for by china most economists highlight that extra revenue is paid for by american companies importing chinese products into the united states plus china has retaliated with tariffs on 110 billion worth of u s goods such as pork and whiskey trump often mentions his positive relationship with china s president but he s also threatened to raise tariffs on 200 billion worth of chinese goods if they don t reach the march deadline trump also plans to meet with xi in the coming weeks in what is shaping up to be a crucial moment in the trade war trade the key word here is structural many u s china analysts have raised concerns over the last year that the trump administration would settle for a deal that only makes cosmetic changes to the bilateral relationship but those same analysts and some lawmakers have noted that getting china to make substantive structural reforms will go beyond the march deadline my colleague doug palmer and south china morning post s wendy wu recently did a great deep dive on what it will take trade trump often blames chinaÃ¢ s unfair trade practices for the huge u s trade deficit with china which is expected to have set a record in 2018 at more than 400 billion the president has long vowed to close the gap between how much the u s buys from and sells to other countries but instead it has reached record levels during his administration applause another historic trade blunder was the catastrophe known as nafta i have met the men and women of michigan ohio pennsylvania indiana new hampshire and many other states whose dreams were shattered by nafta for years politicians promised them they would negotiate for a better deal but no one ever tried Ã¢ until now our new u s mexico canada agreement Ã¢ or usmca Ã¢ will replace nafta and deliver for american workers like they have not had delivered to for a long time i hope you can pass the usmca into law so we can bring back our manufacturing jobs in greater numbers expand american agriculture protect intellectual property and ensure that more cars are proudly stamped with four beautiful words Ã¢ made in the usa trade notice what president trump didn t say here he didn t threaten to cancel the old nafta to force congress to pass the new one he may well yet but it s notable he let this occasion slide without raising the temperature trade well technically that s what president obama said tpp would do Ã¢ replace nafta for north american countries obviously that was a very different type of deal from usmca trade house democrats have already threatened to torpedo trumpÃ¢ s north american trade deal and are opposed to key labor and environmental provisions if trump s trade plan canÃ¢ t win approval from both chambers of congress trump may be forced to reopen thorny talks with both canada and mexico trade many lawmakers have raised concerns that his continued tariffs on steel and aluminum from mexico and canada arenÃ¢ t building much good will on the hill trade usmca does not include any provisions that specifically ensure that more cars are made in the united states the u s had originally proposed a requirement that a certain percentage of a car be made in the country but that was dropped before the u s mexico and canada came to a deal they did however agree to increase the requirements that govern how cars qualify for reduced tariffs in north america applause tonight i am also asking you to pass the united states reciprocal trade act so that if another country places an unfair tariff on an american product we can charge them the exact same tariff on the same product that they sell to us trade trump is talking about a house bill introduced last week by gop rep sean duffy which would give him broad authority to raise tariffs in response to actions taken by other countries the bill which has 18 co sponsors is widely seen as dead on arrival in congress plus thereÃ¢ s two other bipartisan backed measures gaining traction on capitol hill that would rein in the presidentÃ¢ s ability to impose tariffs on national security grounds applause both parties should be able to unite for a great rebuilding of america s crumbling infrastructure infrastructure the american society of civil engineersÃ¢ most recent report card published in 2017 gives the countryÃ¢ s infrastructure a d meanwhile federal spending on infrastructure has been flat for decades applause i know that congress is eager to pass an infrastructure bill Ã¢ and i am eager to work with you on legislation to deliver new and important infrastructure investment including investments in the cutting edge industries of the future this is not an option this is a necessity the next major priority for me and for all of us should be to lower the cost of health care and prescription drugs Ã¢ and to protect patients with pre existing conditions infrastructure in last yearÃ¢ s speech trump called for a 1 5 trillion infrastructure investment but the plan released by the white house a month later offered only 200 billion in direct federal spending relying heavily on state spending and private capital it failed to gain momentum in congress even when republicans still controlled both chambers applause already as a result of my administration s efforts in 2018 drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years health care price increases have slowed down in recent months but drugsÃ¢ posted prices havenÃ¢ t dropped and itÃ¢ s hard to say whatÃ¢ s driving the current slowdown Ã¢ price hikes also leveled in 2007 and 2012 and those proved temporary hereÃ¢ s a visual breakdown of the way trends have moved in the last five years applause but we must do more it is unacceptable that americans pay vastly more than people in other countries for the exact same drugs often made in the exact same place this is wrong unfair and together we can stop it and we will stop it fast health care this is a common refrain from the trump administration because european countries typically use national authorities to negotiate prices way lower than what the u s pays trump unveiled a plan in october that would tie government payments for medicare part b drugs to an index of european countriesÃ¢ prices that proposal quickly garnered blowback from the industry and conservative groups that said it bucked free market principles skeptics also question whether this would actually lower prices applause i am asking the congress to pass legislation that finally takes on the problem of global freeloading and delivers fairness and price transparency for american patients finally health care the administration has largely bypassed congress so far on drug pricing plans instead focusing on changes it can make itself to government programs like medicare but the next few steps Ã¢ like extending last weekÃ¢ s rebate rule to private plans Ã¢ need congress on board that could prove difficult house democrats have already slammed that rebate proposal and are increasingly skeptical about a bipartisan deal applause we should also require drug companies insurance companies and hospitals to disclose real prices to foster competition and bring costs down health care this could mean a number of things trump has proposed requiring drug companies to list prices in their ads heÃ¢ s also recently focused on surprise billing in hospitals Ã¢ two efforts that house democrats have also backed the recent proposed rebate rule could also reveal Ã¢ realÃ¢ prices that insurers pay for drugs Ã¢ which payers have argued could actually curb competition applause no force in history has done more to advance the human condition than american freedom in recent years we have made remarkable progress in the fight against hiv and aids applause in recent years we have made remarkable progress in the fight against hiv and aids scientific breakthroughs have brought a once distant dream within reach my budget will ask democrats and republicans to make the needed commitment to eliminate the hiv epidemic in the united states within 10 years we have made incredible strides incredible health care the presidentÃ¢ s laying out a new strategy to finally end hiv transmission which politico scooped on sunday and thereÃ¢ s real evidence that the u s can end hiv outbreaks Ã¢ in fact the world health organization has set the same goal of ending hiv transmission by 2030 mostly by making medicine and prevention like condoms more available health care more than 1 million americans have hiv another 40 000 people contract it every year Ã¢ and thousands still die from it and one reason this pledge is appearing in trumpÃ¢ s speech his staff believes that ending hiv outbreaks is a bipartisan win former president barack obama made a similar pledge just a few years ago applause together we will defeat aids in america and beyond health care but iÃ¢ ve heard a lot of skepticism about trumpÃ¢ s plan because this administration has repeatedly made moves that alarmed hiv advocates for instance efforts to repeal and replace obamacareÃ¢ s protections put patients with hiv aids at risk trumpÃ¢ s also tried to cut aids funding and the same team overseeing trumpÃ¢ s new hiv strategy is also considering a plan to get rid of fetal tissue research Ã¢ which hiv researchers say is necessary for a possible vaccine applause tonight i am also asking you to join me in another fight that all americans can get behind Ã¢ the fight against childhood cancer applause joining melania in the gallery this evening is a very brave 10 year old girl grace eline applause hi grace laughter every birthday since she was 4 grace asked her friends to donate to st jude children s research hospital she did not know that one day she might be a patient herself that is what happened last year grace was diagnosed with brain cancer immediately she began radiation treatment at the same time she rallied her community and raised more than 40 000 for the fight against cancer applause when grace completed treatment last fall her doctors and nurses cheered Ã¢ they love her they still love her with tears in their eyes as she hung up a poster that read last day of chemo applause thank you grace you are a great inspiration to everyone in this room thank you very much many childhood cancers have not seen new therapies in decades my budget will ask congress for 500 million over the next 10 years to fund this critical life saving research to help support working parents the time has come to pass school choice for america s children health care this is similar to president barack obamaÃ¢ s announcement in his last state of the union that he d put 1 billion toward the cancer moonshot program to Ã¢ cure cancer once and for all Ã¢ this is unlikely the trump administrationÃ¢ s efforts to expand school choice led by education secretary betsy devos gained little traction even in a gop controlled congress many newly empowered house democrats have vowed to fight devosÃ¢ agenda which they argue will divert money away from public schools applause i am also proud to be the first president to include in my budget a plan for nationwide paid family leaveÃ¢ so that every new parent has the chance to bond with their newborn child president trump first laid out his plan for six weeks of paid family leave in his budget in early 2018 it would have allowed states to create their own programs essentially using unemployment benefits the idea had some gop champions in congress led by sen marco rubio r fla but has gone nowhere applause there could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a mother holding her infant child than the chilling displays our nation saw in recent days lawmakers in new york cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother s womb moments before birth these are living feeling beautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and dreams with the world and then we had the case of the governor of virginia where he stated he would execute a baby after birth to defend the dignity of every person i am asking congress to pass legislation to prohibit the late term abortion of children who can feel pain in the mother s womb health care trump told aides ahead of his speech tonight that he saw an opening to reconnect with evangelical voters after new york gov andrew cuomo signed a new abortion bill into law last month some white house officials believe that addressing this issue may help trump with moderate voters too health care trump is referencing the controversy over virginia democratsÃ¢ abortion legislation which has sparked protests and put pressure on gov ralph northam Ã¢ who supports the bill and made eye catching comments about Ã¢ nonviableÃ¢ babies the episode has indirectly put northamÃ¢ s governorship at risk a Ã¢ concerned citizen Ã¢ reportedly angry over the governorÃ¢ s comments sent northamÃ¢ s controversial yearbook page to a reporter trump also spent five minutes railing about northamÃ¢ s comments in a private meeting in monday politico reported northam has said his comments were misinterpreted and democrats have countered that infantificide is already prohibited Ã¢ and that their virginia bill doesnÃ¢ t change current law about the timing of procedures applause let us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life applause and let us reaffirm a fundamental truth Ã¢ all children Ã¢ born and unbornÃ¢ are made in the holy image of god the final part of my agenda is to protect america s national security over the last 2 years we have begun to fully rebuild the united states militaryÃ¢ with 700 billion last year and 716 billion this year we are also getting other nations to pay their fair share applause finally applause for years the united states was being treated very unfairly by friends of ours by members of nato but now we have secured a 100 billion increase in defense spending from nato allies they said it could not be done defense nato secretary general jens stoltenberg recently credited trump s tough talk for the commitment by the alliance s member nations to boost their defense spending applause as part of our military build up the united states is developing a state of the art missile defense system under my administration we will never apologize for advancing america s interests for example decades ago the united states entered into a treaty with russia in which we agreed to limit and reduce our missile capabilities while we followed the agreement and the rules to the letter russia repeatedly violated its terms it has been going on for many years that is why i announced that the united states is officially withdrawing from the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty or inf treaty applause we really have no choice perhaps we can negotiate a different agreement adding china and others or perhaps we can t in which case we will outspend and out innovate all others by far defense trump is dangling the idea of negotiating a new multilateral nuclear arms control treaty while also being open to the idea of a new arms race the odds of a new treaty coming together anytime soon are slim to none applause as part of a bold new diplomacy we continue our historic push for peace on the korean peninsula our hostages have come home nuclear testing has stopped and there has not been a missile launch in 15 months if i had not been elected president of the united states we would right now in my opinion be in a major war with north korea defense this is a very charged claim even for trump he is suggesting that north korea would be willing to follow through on threats against the u s which has a far stronger military and more nuclear weapons most analysts believe north korea s top priority is its survival one reason it wants nuclear weapons as a deterrent trump also seems to suggest itÃ¢ s his personal existence thatÃ¢ s stopping a war is it possible he will use this as campaign spin for 2020 applause much work remains to be done but my relationship with kim jong un is a good one chairman kim and i will meet again on february 27 and 28 in vietnam trump took the chance here to let us know his plans to meet north korea s leader but no word yet on when or where his highly anticipated meeting with chinese president xi jinping will happen applause two weeks ago the united states officially recognized the legitimate government of venezuela and its new interim president juan guaido applause we stand with the venezuelan people in their noble quest for freedom Ã¢ and we condemn the brutality of the maduro regime whose socialist policies have turned that nation from being the wealthiest in south america into a state of abject poverty and despair foreign policy trump says venezuela s government failed because of its socialist policies the reality is more complicated nicolas maduroÃ¢ s opponents say his government has failed because it runs more like a corrupt narco mafia state applause here in the united states we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country booing america was founded on liberty and independence not government coercion domination and control applause we are born free and we will stay free watch for trump to repeat this line as we enter the 2020 cycle his riff against socialist policies appears to be aimed at the few democratic lawmakers and presidential aspirants who have called themselves democratic socialists applause chanting usa tonight we renew our resolve that america will never be a socialist country applause chanting usa one of the most complex set of challenges we face and have for many years is in the middle east our approach is based on principled realism Ã¢ not discredited theories that have failed for decades to yield progress for this reason my administration recognized the true capital of israel Ã¢ and proudly opened the american embassy in jerusalem applause our brave troops have now been fighting in the middle east for almost 19 years in afghanistan and iraq nearly 7 000 american heroes have given their lives more than 52 000 americans have been badly wounded we have spent more than 7 trillion in the middle east as a candidate for president i loudly pledged a new approach great nations do not fight endless wars defense afghanistan is not in the middle east estimates vary widely on the cost of u s war efforts but higher projections can include a host of national security spending including future costs of caring for veterans the defense department estimated its share of spending on wars in afghanistan iraq and syria to cost roughly 1 5 trillion from 9 11 through march 2018 applause when i took office isis controlled more than 20 000 square miles in iraq and syria just two years ago today we have liberated virtually all of that territory from the grip of these blood thirsty monsters now as we work with our allies to destroy the remnants of isis it is time to give our brave warriors in syria a warm welcome home i have also accelerated our negotiations to reach a political settlement in afghanistan the opposing side is also very happy to be negotiating our troops have fought with unmatched valor Ã¢ and thanks to their bravery we are now able to pursue a political solution to this long and bloody conflict defense note that trump does not specify a timeframe about a troop pullout from syria in december he suggested it was immediate since then he and his administration have suggested it will take several months but it remains unclear exactly when the final u s troops will leave syria applause in afghanistan my administration is holding constructive talks with a number of afghan groups including the taliban as we make progress in these negotiations we will be able to reduce our troop presence and focus on counterterrorism and we will indeed focus on counterterrorism we do not know whether we will achieve an agreement Ã¢ but we do know that after two decades of war the hour has come to at least try for peace and the other side would like to do the same thing it is time applause above all friend and foe alike must never doubt this nation s power and will to defend our people 18 years ago violent terrorists attacked the uss cole Ã¢ and last month american forces killed one of the leaders of the attack applause we are honored to be joined tonight by tom wibberley whose son navy seaman craig wibberley was one of the 17 sailors we tragically lost tom we vow to always remember the heroes of the uss cole applause my administration has acted decisively to confront the world s leading state sponsor of terror Ã¢ the radical regime in iran it is a radical regime they do bad bad things to ensure this corrupt dictatorship never acquires nuclear weapons i withdrew the united states from the disastrous iran nuclear deal trump s speech comes as iranians are marking the 40th anniversary of the revolution that brought to power an islamist regime in tehran applause and last fall we put in place the toughest sanctions ever imposed on a country we will not avert our eyes from a regime that chants death to america and threatens genocide against the jewish people foreign policy many have argued u s crude production allows the trump administration to take a harsher line against oil producing rivals like iran venezuela and russia the volume of u s supplies on the global market has kept prices relatively stable even with sanctions on and disruptions in other oil producing nations foreign policy this is a tough claim to fact check it depends on how you define a sanction a term that is actually rather vague sanctions can be applied to individuals as well as entire industrial sectors cuba for instance is under an official trade embargo does that count as one sanction myanmar was once a heavily sanctioned country north korea also remains under numerous u s sanctions applause we must never ignore the vile poison of anti semitism or those who spread its venomous creed with one voice we must confront this hatred anywhere and everywhere it occurs just months ago 11 jewish americans were viciously murdered in an anti semitic attack on the tree of life synagogue in pittsburgh swat officer timothy matson raced into the gunfire and was shot seven times chasing down the killer and he was very successful timothy has just had his 12th surgery and he is going in for many more but he made the trip to be here with us tonight officer matson please applause thank you we are forever grateful thank you very much tonight we are also joined by pittsburgh survivor judah samet he arrived at the synagogue as the massacre began but not only did judah narrowly escape death last fall Ã¢ more than seven decades ago he narrowly survived the nazi concentration camps today is judah s 81st birthday applause gallery sings happy birthday applause mr samet thank you laughter pres trump they would not do that for me judah laughter judah says he can still remember the exact moment nearly 75 years ago after 10 months in a concentration camp when he and his family were put on a train and told they were going to another camp suddenly the train screeched to a halt a soldier appeared judah s family braced for the worst then his father cried out with joy it s the americans applause thank you a second holocaust survivor who is here tonight joshua kaufman was a prisoner at dachau he remembers watching through a hole in the wall of a cattle car as american soldiers rolled in with tanks to me joshua recalls the american soldiers were proof that god exists and they came down from the sky they came down from heaven Ã¢ i began this evening by honoring three soldiers who fought on d day in the second world war one of them was herman zeitchik but there is more to herman s story a year after he stormed the beaches of normandy herman was one of those american soldiers who helped liberate dachau applause he was one of the americans who helped rescue joshua from that hell on earth almost 75 years later herman and joshua are both together in the gallery tonight Ã¢ seated side by side here in the home of american freedom herman and joshua your presence this evening is very much appreciated thank you very much applause thank you when american soldiers set out beneath the dark skies over the english channel in the early hours of d day 1944 they were just young men of 18 and 19 hurtling on fragile landing craft toward the most momentous battle in the history of war they did not know if they would survive the hour they did not know if they would grow old but they knew that america had to prevail their cause was this nation and generations yet unborn why did they do it they did it for america Ã¢ they did it for us everything that has come since Ã¢ our triumph over communism our giant leaps of science and discovery our unrivaled progress toward equality and justice Ã¢ all of it is possible thanks to the blood and tears and courage and vision of the americans who came before think of this capitol Ã¢ think of this very chamber where lawmakers before you voted to end slavery to build the railroads and the highways to defeat fascism to secure civil rights to face down evil empires here tonight we have legislators from across this magnificent republic you have come from the rocky shores of maine and the volcanic peaks of hawaii from the snowy woods of wisconsin and the red deserts of arizona from the green farms of kentucky and the golden beaches of california together we represent the most extraordinary nation in all of history what will we do with this moment how will we be remembered i ask the men and women of this congress look at the opportunities before us our most thrilling achievements are still ahead our most exciting journeys still await our biggest victories are still to come we have not yet begun to dream we must choose whether we are defined by our differences Ã¢ or whether we dare to transcend them we must choose whether we will squander our inheritance Ã¢ or whether we will proudly declare that we are americans we do the incredible we defy the impossible we conquered the unknown this is the time to reignite the american imagination this is the time to search for the tallest summit and set our sights on the brightest star this is the time to rekindle the bonds of love and loyalty and memory that link us together as citizens as neighbors as patriots this is our future Ã¢ our fate Ã¢ and our choice to make i am asking you to choose greatness no matter the trials we face no matter the challenges to come we must go forward together we must keep america first in our hearts we must keep freedom alive in our souls and we must always keep faith in america s destiny Ã¢ that one nation under god must be the hope and the promise and the light and the glory among all the nations of the world thank you god bless you god bless america thank you very much
foreign exchange reserves and their use for interventions in the foreign exchange market have played a notable and sometimes controversial role in the world economy and financial system this is partly because of their sheer size estimated at some us 11 trillion worldwide changes in holdings of foreign exchange reserves and in how they are invested can matter not just for exchange rates but potentially for a whole range of asset prices reserves are usually seen as an important element of self insurance that complements the access to financing provided to countries by the international monetary fund imf and other multilateral organizations in contrast canada s foreign exchange reserves stand out for their relatively modest size and their stability our reserves are about us 85 billion some 5 per cent of our gross domestic product gdp this compares with the 10 year average of about 13 per cent of gdp for other advanced economies and 20 per cent for emerging market economies a key reason canada s international reserves are nonetheless adequate is our freely floating exchange rate canada adopted a flexible exchange rate in 1950 and except for an eight year stretch in the 1960s our dollar has floated ever since we have not intervened to stabilize the canadian dollar for over two decades now this is a period that encompassed major changes in our exchange rate during the commodities supercycle the canadian dollar rose from 62 cents us in 2002 to 1 08 in 2007 during the global financial crisis it dropped sharply to as low as 76 cents us before settling above parity for almost five years it depreciated by about 25 per cent again with the collapse of oil prices in 2014 and has fluctuated around 75 cents us since then these exchange rate movements helped the economy adjust to the shocks such shifts are always painful for some and beneficial for others but the canadian economy is diverse and dynamic and over time able to achieve a new balance of growth among regions and sectors in my talk today i m going to expand on these points and explain why we stopped using our reserves to stabilize our dollar a central theme is that because we no longer use them routinely to intervene in foreign exchange markets we hold reserves mainly as a precaution against extreme tail events i ll discuss what we consider to be an adequate level of reserves and how we manage them why not intervene canada s foreign exchange reserves belong to the government of canada while in a number of other countries they are an asset of the central bank they are managed within the terms of an established governance framework by the department of finance and the bank of canada together we develop strategies and policies for the management of the reserves the bank as the government s fiscal agent carries out related market transactions most of the time exchange rate movements driven by the market have contributed to canada s economic stability helping our economy ride the rising and falling tides of the global economy as a commodity exporter canada has been subject to swings in world commodity prices which affect our terms of trade let me make a few observations related to recent experience to a certain extent movements in the canadian dollar reflect the comparative strengths of the canadian and us economies which are linked in turn to expectations for each country s monetary policy path we ve seen these forces shift significantly over time in particular the past year has seen an important change in the relative performance of the two economies despite the fact that the canadian economy is generally in a good place economic activity has been running close to potential for nearly two years and economic growth has been solid unemployment rates have been at historic lows employment creation has been strong and inflation has been hovering around our 2 per cent target in that context we took steps to move our policy interest rate upward by a cumulative 1Â¼ percentage points but uncertainty about us trade policies has been holding back canadian business investment below what our strong economic fundamentals would indicate lower oil prices in recent months have caused a deterioration of canada s terms of trade which in turn reduces domestic income and wealth housing investment and consumption spending have also softened the result has been a temporary slowing of canada s economic growth meanwhile the us economy has been powering ahead with the effects of the fiscal stimulus and in response the federal reserve has taken several steps over the last year to move interest rates toward their neutral level this combination of factors has been putting downward pressure on the canadian dollar the lower canadian dollar in turn will help support the economy through this period it s been almost half a century since we set a target for the exchange rate by and large the exchange rate movements delivered by the market have served canada well trying to hold the dollar constant would have given us larger fluctuations in unemployment output and inflation nonetheless for many years we did have a policy of routinely using our foreign reserves to resist in an automatic fashion any significant upward or downward pressure on the dollar for example between 1995 and 1998 we intervened roughly 150 times we weren t targeting a particular level for the exchange rate but simply smoothing its movements this reflected a belief at the time that markets did not function efficiently and could give rise to volatility that could be destabilizing but this view gradually gave way to the weight of evidence and experience by 1998 we had concluded that such interventions weren t particularly effective we saw the futility of attempting to moderate exchange rate movements caused by changes in the underlying fundamental factors trying to counter them was a bit like tapping on the brakes while skidding on ice it can help momentarily but not by much so where does that leave us we do have a policy framework that would allow us to intervene in the unlikely event that it s needed that could happen under two scenarios the first would be a market breakdown with extreme price volatility buyers or sellers would be increasingly unwilling to transact indicating a severe lack of liquidity in the canadian dollar market the second would be sharp currency movements that seriously threaten the conditions that support sustainable long term economic growth in a market breakdown intervention would aim to restore market functioning and would likely be quite short lived in extreme currency movements it s understood that intervention would be part of a broader set of policy changes to re establish confidence in canadian economy this framework is transparent it is posted on our website thus we are ready to intervene if necessary but as i said we have not seen the need to do so at any time throughout the past two often turbulent decades there have however been a couple of occasions over that period when canada participated in concerted intervention along with other countries in 2011 canada joined an action to stem excess volatility and disorderly movements in the exchange rate of the japanese yen following the earthquake and resulting tsunami and nuclear crisis at the fukushima nuclear plant the intervention involved selling the yen against our respective domestic currencies to send a clear signal that the goal was to weaken the yen and not to strengthen other currencies and in september 2000 we joined the european central bank the federal reserve bank of new york the bank of japan and the bank of england to support the euro these episodes were in response to exceptional developments affecting other currencies of global importance and were not specifically aimed at influencing the canadian dollar read more bank of canada boc content is for general information purposes only it is

washington in a leaked military manual on unconventional warfare recently highlighted by wikileaks the u s army states that major global financial institutions such as the world bank international monetary fund imf and the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd are used as unconventional financial weapons in times of conflict up to and including large scale general war as well as in leveraging the policies and cooperation of state governments the document officially titled field manual fm 3 05 130 army special operations forces unconventional warfare and originally written in september 2008 was recently highlighted by wikileaks on twitter in light of recent events in venezuela as well as the years long u s led economic siege of that country through sanctions and other means of economic warfare though the document has generated new interest in recent days it had originally been released by wikileaks in december 2008 and has been described as the military s regime change handbook what s happening with venezuela wikileaks publication of us coup manual fm3 05 130 unconventional warfare provides insight dos department of state ic intelligence community uwoa uw operations area arsof us army special operations forces pic twitter com ez0tgqhesw wikileaks wikileaks january 28 2019 wikileaks recent tweets on the subject drew attention to a single section of the 248 page long document titled financial instrument of u s national power and unconventional warfare this section in particular notes that the u s government applies unilateral and indirect financial power through persuasive influence to international and domestic financial institutions regarding availability and terms of loans grants or other financial assistance to foreign state and nonstate actors and specifically names the world bank imf and the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd as well as the bank for international settlements bis as u s diplomatic financial venues to accomplish such goals the manual also touts the state manipulation of tax and interest rates along with other legal and bureaucratic measures to open modify or close financial flows and further states that the u s treasury s office of foreign assets control ofac which oversees u s sanctions on other nations like venezuela has a long history of conducting economic warfare valuable to any arsof uw campaign this section of the manual goes on to note that these financial weapons can be used by the u s military to create financial incentives or disincentives to persuade adversaries allies and surrogates to modify their behavior at the theater strategic operational and tactical levels and that such unconventional warfare campaigns are highly coordinated with the state department and the intelligence community in determining which elements of the human terrain in uwoa are most susceptible to financial engagement the role of these independent international financial institutions as extensions of u s imperial power is elaborated elsewhere in the manual and several of these institutions are described in detail in an appendix to the manual titled the financial instrument of national power notably the world bank and the imf are listed as both financial instruments and diplomatic instruments of u s national power as well as integral parts of what the manual calls the current global governance system furthermore the manual states that the u s military understand that properly integrated manipulation of economic power can and should be a component of uw meaning that these weapons are a regular feature of unconventional warfare campaigns waged by the united states another point of interest is that these financial weapons are largely governed by the national security council nsc which is currently headed by john bolton the document notes that the nsc has primary responsibility for the integration of the economic and military instruments of national power abroad independent but controlled though the unconventional warfare manual is notable for stating so openly that independent financial institutions like the world bank and the imf are essentially extensions of u s government power analysts have noted for decades that these institutions have consistently pushed u s geopolitical goals abroad indeed the myth of world bank and imf independence is quickly eroded by merely looking at the structure and funding of each institution in the case of the world bank the institution is located in washington and the organization s president has always been a u s citizen chosen directly by the president of the united states in the world bank s entire history the institution s board of governors has never rejected washington s pick this past monday it was reported that president donald trump nominated former bear stearns economist david malpass to lead the world bank malpass had famously failed to foresee the destruction of his former employer during the 2008 financial crisis and is likely to limit world bank loans to china and to countries allied or allying with china given his well established reputation as a china hawk in addition to choosing its president the u s is also the bank s largest shareholder making it the only member nation to have veto rights indeed as the leaked unconventional warfare manual notes as major decisions require an 85 supermajority the united states can block any major changes to world bank policy or the services it offers furthermore the u s treasury secretary former goldman sachs banker and foreclosure king steve mnuchin functions as the world bank s governor though the imf is different from the world bank in several respects such as its stated mission and focus it too is largely dominated by u s government influence and funding for instance the imf is also based in washington and the u s is the company s largest shareholder the largest by far owning 17 46 percent of the institution and also pays the largest quota for the institution s maintenance paying 164 billion in imf financial commitments annually though the u s does not choose the imf s top executive it uses its privileged position as the institution s largest funder to control imf policy by threatening to withhold its imf funding if the institution does not abide by washington s demands as a consequence of the lopsided influence of the u s on these institutions behavior these organizations have used their loans and grants to trap nations in debt and have imposed structural adjustment programs on these debt saddled governments that result in the mass privatization of state assets deregulation and austerity that routinely benefit foreign corporations over local economies frequently these very institutions by pressuring countries to deregulate their financial sector and through corrupt dealings with state actors bring about the very economic problems that they then swoop in to fix guaidÃ³ hits up imf given the close relationship between the u s government and these international financial institutions it should come as little surprise that in venezuela the u s backed interim president juan guaidÃ³ has already requested imf funds and thus imf controlled debt to fund his parallel government this is highly significant because it shows that top among guaidÃ³ s objectives in addition to privatizing venezuela s massive oil reserves is to again shackle the country to the u s controlled debt machine as the grayzone project recently noted venezuela s previous elected socialist president hugo chÃ¡vez broke ties with the imf and world bank which he noted were dominated by us imperialism instead venezuela and other left wing governments in latin america worked together to co found the bank of the south as a counterbalance to the imf and world bank however venezuela is far from the only country in latin america being targeted by these financial weapons masquerading as independent financial institutions for instance ecuador whose current president has sought to bring the country back into washington s good graces has gone so far as to conduct an audit of its asylum of journalist and wikileaks publisher julian assange in order to win a 10 billion bailout from the imf ecuador granted assange asylum in 2012 and the u s has fervently sought his extradition for still sealed charges ever since in addition last july the u s threatened ecuador with punishing trade measures if it introduced a measure at the un to support breastfeeding over infant formula in a move that stunned the international community but laid bare the willingness of the u s government to use economic weapons against latin american nations beyond ecuador other recent targets of massive imf and world bank warfare include argentina which awarded the largest imf bailout loan in history just last year that loan package was unsurprisingly heavily pushed by the u s according to a statement from treasury secretary mnuchin released last year notably the imf was instrumental in causing the complete collapse of the argentinian economy in 2001 sending a poor omen for last year s approval of the record loan package though it was released over a decade ago this u s coup manual recently highlighted by wikileaks serves as a salient reminder that the so called independence of these financial institutions is an illusion and that they are among the many financial weapons regularly used by the u s government to bend countries to its will and even overthrow u s disfavored governments top photo a masked demonstrator wearing a detail of a 100 u s dollar bill protests the government s plans to make a deal with the imf and increase the price of utilities such as gas and electricity in buenos aires argentina may 14 2018 natacha pisarenko ap whitney webb is a staff writer for mintpress news and has contributed to several other independent alternative outlets

101 tells us high public debt is bad but what if the textbooks need updating photo by david kawai bloomberg article content andrew scheer keeps saying that a vote for justin trudeau this autumn will be a vote for higher taxes that s a reasonable deduction the budget deficit has increased to about 20 billion from zero in 2015 so the debt is growing that s bad according to most economics textbooks government borrowing puts upward pressure on interest rates and it crowds out private capital because investors prefer risk free government bonds to risky bets on entrepreneurs the situation can t be allowed to persist and since trudeau appears allergic to spending cuts debt dynamics will force him to raise taxes advertisement 2 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your

the peterson institute for international economics presented a paper that shows such a relationship tends to be the norm in major developed economies therefore a country such as the u s could reduce its debt burden simply by rolling over existing bonds because nominal growth will exceed the interest rate in a way there is no fiscal cost blanchard said in a lecture on jan 4 we can discuss the semantics but you can see what i have in mind you don t need to raise taxes to finance the additional debt you don t need to raise taxes to finance the additional debt olivier blanchard economist the trudeau government has been applying a variation of this theory since it decided to ditch its promise to run only small deficits for a few years the deficit is the equivalent of about one per cent of gdp which is still pretty small by most standards in canada nominal growth will average 3 9 per cent between 2018 and 2022 and the yield on the 10 year bond will average 2 9 per cent according to the mean estimate of the 14 outside economists who advised finance on the fall economic update the debt is on track to shrink as a share of gdp which matters more than the absolute level no tax increases required advertisement 4 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content nevertheless scheer appears to think that trudeau is vulnerable on debt and taxes on jan 29 the opposition forced the liberals to defeat a motion that called on the government to promise that it wouldn t raise taxes in the future it s a tweak of scheer s pre christmas assault which focused simply on the deficit as you evaluate the new critique keep in mind that the theory on which it is based hasn t really been updated for the post crisis low interest rate age in which we live for example jonathan ostry the canadian economist who is the deputy director of the international monetary fund s research department showed in 2015 that countries that can borrow relatively cheaply are better off living with their debts than adopting austerity for austerity s sake in 2016 stephen poloz the bank of canada governor published a paper that suggests the harper government s decision to balance the budget contributed to the surge in household debt a better policy mix would have allowed the central bank to raise interest rates avoiding the credit bubble and last month jason furman and lawrence summers harvard university economists who served in president barack obama s administration published an article in foreign affairs that calls on american politicians to get over their debt obsession advertisement 5 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content no one seriously argues that the cost of capital is holding back businesses from investing cutting the deficit then is unlikely to spur much private investment jason furman and lawrence summers harvard economists textbook economic theory holds that high levels of government debt make it more expensive for companies to borrow they wrote but these days interest rates are low stock market prices are high relative to company earnings and major companies hold large amounts of cash on their balance sheets no one seriously argues that the cost of capital is holding back businesses from investing cutting the deficit then is unlikely to spur much private investment that s a lot of brainpower amassed against the conservatives contention that trudeau s fiscal policy inevitably leads to higher taxes still team trudeau shouldn t feel smug blanchard said his research shouldn t be used as an excuse to pile on debt and furman and summers raised an important political economy concern the debt to gdp ratio that trudeau favours might be the right gauge but it s nuanced and nuance doesn t sell to keep the fiscal prudes from winning the political argument the former obama economists advise american policymakers to match new spending with program cuts or extra revenue except during recessions if something is truly worth doing it should be worth paying for they wrote dozens of countries use budget rules as a check on spending trudeau scrapped the one that harper had put in place if he wants to win the debt debate with scheer he may need to replace it the prime minister has tossed too many promises to run

the moneda palace in santiago is white and remarkably small i recognise it from photographs taken on 11 september 1973 in which the bombers close above seem small too like fat flies i must once have seen this building and found it large my father was british ambassador to chile from 1961 to 1966 as children in santiago we led supervised lives between the garden the austin princess and the alliance franÃ§aise school i had a faint sense of who salvador allende was in 1964 when he stood for president against eduardo frei montalva i m being taken to church and low on a wall there s a poster with sad looking crowds flags and exclamation marks and allende s massive spectacle frames in 1976 i was working for chile solidarity in leeds and getting a rapid political education some of the chilean refugees thought i was working for the cia they had suffered violence beyond the imagining of our well meaning spectrum of helpers from church groups and the labour party to the communists and international socialists the chileans mapped the discords of unidad popular fiercely onto our own local squabbles a decade later in 1987 i went back to chile during the preparations for a plebiscite on the continuation of the military junta i was joining my mother on a nostalgia trip she remembering the happiest of diplomatic postings i looking for my roots my old school so bleak in my memory hadn t changed but my eyes had it is a corbusierian gem the most feared of my teachers intercepted on perhaps his millionth entry to the same classroom growled that of course he remembered me our beautiful house had been converted into a computer centre there was no sign of the swimming pool that slopped out half its water during an earthquake and the spreading fig tree that once held my mirador was now a stump santiago felt eerie because of what i knew had happened there since i last saw it the city looked primped sedate i don t know what violence i expected on every corner by this time the dictator s civilian economists had come round to the view that there was more money to be made under a controlled democracy parts of the right along with the us were ready for change surely the vote against the junta would be substantial it wasn t there was harassment and assaults on pro democracy campaigners in an exhausted depoliticised society the result was close 55 per cent for booting out pinocho i returned again this september a few days before the 33rd anniversary of the military coup there has now been civilian government for 17 years exactly as long as the dictatorship lasted the democratic transition was officially declared over last year by the socialist president ricardo lagos after the reform of some of pinochet s most restrictive constitutional articles this january michelle bachelet also from the socialist party and the candidate of the centre left concertaciÃ³n coalition was elected president with 53 5 per cent of the vote after a run off against the right wing credit card billionaire sebastiÃ¡n piÃ±era i went back to celebrate her victory and to attempt to gauge what a woman president might signify in such a socially conservative country but my visit turned into a search using women as my guiding thread to understand the unexpected melancholy i sensed the inhibition and muffled frictions the government is already in trouble and the transition is far from over there are however plentiful images of how far chile has come people stroll through the moneda as a short cut ignored by the carabinero guards i was not searched or asked for id in any ministerial building an astounding symbol of free speech lies below ground in the moneda s culture centre where cut out figures of all the past presidents of chile from bernardo o higgins to lagos dangle from nooses over the caption chile s pay back they are part of a funny irascible show by the 92 year old anti poet nicanor parra the patriarch of a left wing arts dynasty though the centre s director was coincidentally removed the piece has stayed let s not get parranoid michelle bachelet laughed at the opening a working paediatrician who also studied at the inter american defense college in washington bachelet embodies a longed for spirit of reconciliation a reforging of the bond between military and democratic values that was once central to chile s myth of itself as lagos s defence minister from 2002 she was instrumental in getting a never again declaration out of the armed forces it was especially meaningful because her father had been an air force general who refusing to go into exile was tortured and murdered in 1974 for his loyalty to allende in 1975 the young socialist medical student and her mother were themselves arrested they spent several weeks in villa grimaldi santiago s most notorious torture centre until released through the intercession of friends of the family abroad bachelet has always kept silent about her mistreatment her style marks a refreshing change if lagos ruled like a high priest bachelet s manner is warm and unassuming her hobbies include dancing on the beach and holding girls nights with her ten ministras to the resentment of the men i m told and her agenda centres on social injustice in its choice of a woman whose platform included gender parity in the cabinet the country seems to be asking for a feminisation of the political culture yet bachelet s victory remains in some ways an aberration in genteel society where the old proprieties have survived every revolution almost everyone assured me of this chilean hypocrisy there is disapproval of her for being divorced rather than discreetly separated worse she is an avowed agnostic one of her children was born out of wedlock and she had an affair with a member of the manuel rodrÃ­guez patriotic front in the 1980s making her for some a terrorist s whore nor does her victory reflect the status of women at large one conservative friend i spoke to considers herself typical in mistrusting her own sex we prefer men for important matters we don t really believe in her we gloat when she goes wrong well women only got the vote in 1949 and divorce became legal after years of negotiation with the church in december 2004 before that those who separated because they couldn t afford annulment lawyers were barred from opening a bank account or starting a business in their own name shocking levels of domestic violence and child abuse across all classes are being uncovered by the family courts that opened last october about a third of women work some of them for half the equivalent male wage indeed in modern chile futuristic touches that stun the foreigner whether gender parity in the cabinet or total immersion advertising techniques that turn metro corridors and carriages into marketing art installations float high above a stratified society that seems mired in the 1950s the metro shuts down at 10 30 the strong women of a generation ago were not the product of an evolving society but created by events and i don t mean allende s experiment in which women were mostly helpmeets mÃ³nica gonzÃ¡lez the country s top investigative journalist who was jailed for her human rights stories in the 1980s credits the dictatorship for that brief awakening since the people killed imprisoned and disappeared were mostly men women had to confront authority as never before facing up to the army and the police in search of husbands or sons joining forces and speaking out politically going to work for the first time if a man did return from prison he usually couldn t get work and women continued to support the family during the banking crisis of 1981 83 whole industries were wiped out and the selective erosion of male authority was completed by labour schemes in which men were paid pennies to move piles of stones back and forth a deliberate humiliation in order to break the spirit of workers who d always been proud of what they created a taxi driver with whom i talked about those years told me that he went out begging for any menial occupation not for the wages but because my wife hated me pointless labour was an old military punishment turned into a national strategy after 1990 the lid went back on the box for the majority of women democracy was back so leave it all to daddy despite this some women often those whose sheltered lives hadn t been much changed by the coup now found liberation s a landscape designer who was stuck for 25 years in an abusive marriage to a rich man told me in the darkness of a night drive when that most violent of patriarchies was removed i and many women i knew suddenly realised we didn t have to put up with it any more that society was now on our side it was an alarming glimpse of what the elegant professional almost always separated women i was meeting might have gone through i could never have asked them to say more there s a reserve in chile that is usually ascribed to ancestry european that is the indigenous component more visible the lower you go down the social scale doesn t count a mixture of spanish basque pride and english stiff upper lip on the national level this reserve means that a feudal agrarian society suddenly found itself under attack first from the left and then from the right by angry forces it had convinced itself did not exist there they continue now to fight it out in whispers as it were many compromises overshadowed the democratic restoration over the dictator s laws which still resist essential reform the political right which was to continue running the economy while the centre left concertaciÃ³n coalition ran the enfeebled state compensating with palliative measures those who lost out under neo liberalism and the catholic church whose brave stand for human rights was to be rewarded by a resanctification of the traditional family the military were loudly unrepentant for having saved chile the real turning point came in 1998 with pinochet s arrest in london where he had gone for an operation and to close an arms deal people who felt oppressed by the continued military oversight of the transition epitomised by the dictator s controlling presence as senator for life describe it as a heavy weight falling from their shoulders the prestige of the armed forces collapsed overnight and soldiers took to wearing civvies in public to avoid harassment when the house of lords cravenly sent the faker home as mentally unfit to stand trial the frei ruiz tagle government having publicly pleaded that he should be tried in chile while seeking to rush through a law granting him permanent immunity was compelled to allow the trial to go ahead pinochet s parliamentary immunity was lifted by the supreme court in 2000 and the lawsuits erupted it s a slow insanely technical process by last september of 467 prosecutions brought against violators of human rights 99 convictions had been obtained pinochet who has excellent lawyers including pablo rodrÃ­guez grez the former leader of the fascist terrorist group patria y libertad was on bail while being investigated only for crimes in which there is evidence of his involvement the caravan of death 1973 when more than seventy dissidents were summarily executed by an army unit travelling through the provinces operation colombo the murder of 119 people camouflaged as internal score settling and a couple of other murders among them is the assassination in 1993 of eugenio berrÃ­os one of his own men berrÃ­os designed the bacteriological agent that allegedly killed the former president frei montalva in 1982 given the difficulties with the chilean system there seemed a better chance of nailing pinochet for the embezzlement tax evasion and passport forgery uncovered by the us senate in an anti terrorist bank trawl after 9 11 his assets had been frozen and he was having to sell his medals to pay the bills after i left chile however some long standing cases moved forward pinochet was indicted on 59 counts of kidnapping and torture at villa grimaldi and two days after his 91st birthday in november when for the first time he admitted political responsibility for all that was done a new indictment charged him with the kidnapping and murder of two of allende s bodyguards during the caravan of death he is now once more under house arrest pending bail and appeals mÃ³nica rodrÃ­guez whom i met on 11 september at a late night memorial meeting outside the national stadium where thousands were held and many executed in the weeks following the coup has spent 16 years fighting for a monument to female victims of the repression she yelled over the music that they are dragging out the legal niceties hoping that pinochet will die first at the meeting we were treated to unidad popular films and rousingly raised fists for the first time socialists and communists who have long been estranged were holding a joint do beyond the carnations and candles in the bars the grotesquely jolly disney figures of a funfair could be seen the right wing mayor of the commune had arranged this i was told as a way of giving this rally the finger the streets were deserted because here and there bands of young marginals were performing the rituals with which they always mark the anniversary torching cars putting up barricades and fighting with the police during the official procession hooded anarchists threw a molotov cocktail at the moneda flames leaping from a window in sinister reminder of what happened 33 years ago i attended a quiet devastating vigil in the ruins of villa grimaldi only the tall iron gates remain standing locked for ever the site planted with native trees silver birch ceibas and araucarias was dotted with candles burning beside small cartouches made from the mosaics of the old floors indicating where for example the chile houses had been cramped vertical closets where prisoners stood for days on end between sessions with the grill or the submarine trembling in the ghostly space that was once the women s cells an unknown woman began telling quiet stories of horror but also of love and solidarity this was not obstinate memory as in the title of patricio guzmÃ¡n s film in which he shows his own the battle of chile to uninformed schoolchildren but helpless memory the attempt to prosecute pinochet is more sincere than rodrÃ­guez and others believe but its slowness is painful and truth is mocked along with justice when those responsible won t say what happened to the 1197 disappeared in october however continuing international pressure to repeal one of the main instruments of impunity the amnesty law of 1978 led to serious discussions within the concertaciÃ³n raising the hope that hundreds of cases may one day be reopened what might the tilt towards female empowerment mean does it arise from a belief that men are incorrigible watchers of one another s backs a desire for human as well as macroeconomic progress it doesn t seem to reflect a second wave of female assertiveness despite the rush to get divorced 55 000 cases this year the majority brought by women which is more a matter of formalising old separations and obtaining the novel benefits of alimony and child maintenance 31 per cent of chilean households are headed by a woman and 58 per cent of children are born out of wedlock divorce has probably come too late to bring marriage back into vogue not least because men now have to support ex wives women are still not full juridical or cultural subjects as the national women s service recently admitted but at least the state now offers better physical protection if you ve taken out an injunction against a violent man and he shows up you call the carabineros and they are there in five minutes both working class poblaciÃ³n women and social workers assured me this was true i failed to find any working class women s organisations in santiago perhaps because of the revived importance of women s charities which operate in parallel with the government s endeavour to build a system of social protection founded on rights i was pointed to a project in la legua one of the city s most deprived and drug ridden poblaciones once a hive of socialist and communist militancy and savagely repressed by the secret police but it turned out to be a sponsored centre for herbal remedies i began to think that this combative politically aware society and especially its women had been so ruthlessly crushed it must start again from square one but we shouldn t forget the radical step represented by gender parity in the cabinet for clarisa hardy the elfin 60 year old minister of planning welfare the presence of women in positions of power means that politics is catching up with reality there s an explosion of citizens demands in which the diversity and heterogeneity of society are made visible she says liberal ideas are more common than we think cutting across the left right divide and setting the traditional conservative hegemonic discourse into its proper perspective presidents frei and lagos began to address the problems of female and family life and brought more women into high ranking posts but hardy reckons that at their tempo parity would have come in 2050 thanks to bachelet s determination not only has the government imposed fairer representation in terms of gender it has also challenged the reproduction of power opening it up to uncertainty and risk yasna provoste a pe teacher turned education minister exemplifies this readiness to contemplate appointments from beyond the inner circle she is young 36 of mixed race and modest background and one of a minority of ministers from the provinces as a regional administrator then governor she never felt overt discrimination from her peers but i can see she said that male politicians feel threatened by the emergence of women so they try to discredit us on some other pretext discrimination is never straightforward karen poniachik the mining and energy minister has been given a hard time by some on the pretext that since she s not a mining engineer she should at least have some political experience her career was built partly in the us in the media finance and investment i was warned by her male aide not to ask questions about her love life or shopping as interviewers apparently do but as i settled down beside this charmingly unceremonious 41 year old she started to tell me about her boyfriend poniachik enjoys the dual challenge of her post in charge both of the copper industry that generates chile s comfortable trade surplus and of the energy sector whose shortages make expansion and foreign investment a priority she too thinks that fairer representation for women is just the first step in bringing diversity to the decision making process while big business remains clubbish and unmeritocratic she says the public sector is sending a crucial signal by removing questions about gender age and so forth on job applications behind their technocratic language there s such fresh adventurous Ã©lan about these ministers that it seemed possible to ask whether women do exercise power differently even if the chilean experiment comes nowhere near providing an answer to this charged question congress is only 12 per cent female the senate 5 per cent the strength in numbers enjoyed by women leaders puts them in a good position to consider it a strong affirmative would come from the all female governors of the viith region an agricultural province not noted for its feminism in a magazine interview one of the four known as the coven for their weekly sisterly huddles said there was the need for a feminine sensibility for doing things out of love for authorities who don t behave like demi gods but like common mortals provoste and poniachik were more guarded citing some women s greater approachability talent for teamwork and administrative scruple but the most far sighted analysis is that of hardy who is a former psychologist and whose book about women and power in chile eliterazgo came out last year i doubt any of the men in a cabinet meeting are wondering if there s loo paper at home as i do there is a difference but it s not intrinsic women are socialised outside the brutal competitiveness of male power structures and bring these softer horizontal practices along when they get into power all of us help and advise each other but our support circle also includes outsider men if power could be made more democratic overall with more rotation this would undermine the traditional reproduction of power within a handful of families and networks requiring everyone to persuade rather than impose at present bachelet and the others are on trial we ll have made it when we re allowed to govern as badly as a man the presence of more outsiders in this administration is perhaps a factor in its perceived chaos and indecision are people already missing a strong hand bachelet s ratings fell from 62 per cent on election in january to 44 per cent in july the president s erratic handling of school demonstrations in june followed by a loss of face vis Ã  vis the traditionally detested argentina over gas prices and growth figures of only 4 5 per cent were pounced on by her opponents she has also lost popular support her notion of a citizens government one which invited the public to articulate their needs was derided from the right as more appropriate in a mother than a president her state of the nation speech in may included a list of female priorities targeting the problems of childhood and old age and the terrible state of housing there s a visionary pre school programme underway and the announcement of free healthcare for the over sixties was extremely popular however not only has this government been seen to bow to private interests just as its predecessors did dismissing citizens objections to ecologically and socially damaging projects such as the pascua lama gold mine or the celco pulp factory but recent negotiations with public sector unions have broken down people who believed her when she called on them to become the agents of their own destiny are pushing it further than the government can accept observed pamela pereira a human rights lawyer who was closely involved in the process that by criminalising the pinochet gang encouraged the people to express their discontent september saw strikes by teachers health workers and council workers bachelet s fourth priority was innovation and entrepreneurship and this rubric too implied a criticism of the country s economic course for while chile is ranked 20th in the world in terms of economic freedom it is ranked 50th for innovation this can t be unrelated to the passivity encouraged by the dominance of multinationals under whose onslaught the latest manufacturing figures have slumped again the invasion is visible under clumps of blue glass towers central santiago s landscape of peeling family houses and 1960s blocks is plastered with loud graphic designs that look as if they ve been cut out of magazines the labels of corporate consultancies investment services malls mobile phone providers and a staggering variety of banks the capitalist free for all accelerated under democracy has led to what some people bewail as a new neurosis of appearance from toting fake mobiles and parading large tins of caviar in their supermarket trolleys only to discard them before the till the middle class has progressed to accruing the highest level of personal debt on the continent the british of south america to the bitter end as though this society that once hated ostentation has been drowning its traumas in a cult of objects it neither produces nor can afford apart from high finance chile s development model relies on extraction mining and forestry the industrialised production of fish fruit and wine environmentalists like sara larraÃ­n deplore the logic of a colonial economy continued into the present the devaluation of creativity stifles cultural energies pinochet did his best to repress modern culture yet a striking art of resistance flourished it has not been succeeded by much that s worthwhile the artist livia marÃ­n was born on the day of the coup against allende and spent most of her childhood so it seems to her watching military parades and violent counter demonstrations from her window overlooking the plaza italia partly in reaction to this brutal theatre she began producing a minimal subtle art that found few echoes in chile she had to emigrate to london in order to develop her work the education market in chile marÃ­n claims has spawned a glut of flashy art colleges but the serious art world is tiny dominated by the generation of the 1970s and 1980s who cold shoulder any approach that isn t politically engaged chile s one great contemporary writer roberto bolaÃ±o who died in 2003 stayed away after the end of the dictatorship it is the business of a younger generation to find the idiom for a modern chilean culture i heard of uptown kids rapping over the music of the revolutionary icon violeta parra the situation isn t improved by the fact that books are extremely expensive astonished by the prices in a bookshop 15 for a slender paperback i discovered there s a huge tax on imported books which almost all of them are clandestine presses make cheap facsimiles which are sold from the back of a van if you re lucky enough to buy something before the van speeds off at the sight of a police car apart from these heroic pirates only the mini lending libraries in a few metro stations have looked to the city s intellectual health well over a million books were lent out in the last decade of which 96 per cent were returned too many i thought at last however a major public library has opened in santiago it is not immediately obvious to outsiders why so much of pinochet s legacy still remains or how so much progress has been achieved despite its constraints some labour regulation has been introduced leading to complaints that chile is turning into cuba and there has been a reduction in the number of those in poverty from 45 per cent in 1990 to 18 per cent today the web of complicities and conflicts that defines the incestuous world of chilean politics is confusing one friend annoyed by my constant attempts to identify ideological camps said it was no good being black and white i must think in the subjunctive to begin with the four coalition parties are internally at odds especially on moral issues where the other three face opposition from the christian democrats a party that originally supported the coup against its present bedfellows yet it s the christian democrats along with conservative elements on the right who are now calling for increased social spending the centre left coalition has constantly to woo the support of the opposition alianza por chile parties even though the concertaciÃ³n vote far outnumbers alianza s one reason for this deadlock is that since 1880 the leading media have been owned by men called agustÃ­n edwards in 1970 the edwards of the day fearful for his investments made a visit to nixon to ask for help in preventing allende s inauguration after that operation backfired el mercurio chile s paper of record co ordinated a sabotage campaign with the same efficiency as it later concealed pinochet s atrocities the concertaciÃ³n regularly increases police powers rather than address the deep causes of crime when faced by the right wing media s exaggeration of crime rates it is in fact forced onto the defensive on every progressive issue from making commercial overtures to other latin american countries that chile is held to have nothing in common with to prescribing the morning after pill for 14 year olds bachelet s tentative social policies hardly interfere with the free market course maintained by her finance minister andrÃ©s velasco but are pilloried in the right wing press as the cause of persistent unemployment and loss of investor confidence but the greatest obstacle to change is constitutional which amounts to saying unalterable for the chileans are a law loving people and even more attached to the proper forms since the recent destruction of all legality the dictator himself who dressed up every outrage in juridical hocus pocus lost his core support only when revealed to be a common thief the handover deal negotiated by the junta after it lost the 1988 plebiscite bound future governments to respect the 1980 constitution and the last minute tying acts it was agreed that no part of these could be changed without a majority varying from 4 7 to 2 3 one law the binominal act ensures that in an election the minority alianza always gets a seat alongside any concertaciÃ³n deputy thus making the requisite quorums unattainable governments have been confined to plucking at the edges of the straitjackets that keep chile s privatised health education and pension systems in place commissions are regularly convened to try and identify areas of wriggle room one is currently meeting to study the binominal act itself lately another commission examined the pension industry which leaves half the population unprotected while according to pereira the industry s directors wield more power than political parties result much hand wringing and no change though the state was advised to fund a universal pension of around 75 a month the most fascinating talking shop at present is the advisory council for quality in education forced into existence by a mass of fed up schoolchildren last summer thousands of such penguins some as young as 11 occupied their schools and the streets to protest against the system established by the dictator one day before he left power in the organic constitutional education act loce enshrining the wisdom of the market it created a tripartite system excellent private schools for 8 per cent of students subsidised private schools for another 42 per cent and underfunded municipal hangars for the remaining 50 per cent the education ministry s role was to pay up evenhandedly a peso to the councils a peso to the subsidised schools president frei tripled teachers pay and tried to improve their training while a reinflated ministry intervened to the extent that the act allows at the decentralised council level but the ministry can exert little control over these poorer classrooms as for the subsidised schools any sharpster with a high school diploma can set one up where they please with the result that more than sixty unprofitable communes offer no educational choice some of these education sellers true products of the consumerist wave falsify enrolment registers to get more money charge illegally for materials advertise non existent facilities the scandals mount but we can t touch it s as if we had no hands one ministry employee moaned although working class parents often get into debt in order to send their children to schools in the subsidised sector the results don t reward the sacrifice of students passing the university entrance exams in maths and spanish in 2005 58 per cent came from private schools 19 4 from council schools and only 22 5 from the middle tier enter the penguins at the start most of them were council pupils but the movement quickly spread to all classes and parties the children broadcast the discussions they held with the ministry in real time via borrowed mobiles and laptops to schools all over the country their representatives now sit on the advisory council set up to agonise over what is to be done but their key demands supported in a september survey by two thirds of the public repeal of the loce and a federal takeover of education are unlikely to be met because of the quorum problem the rebel children mistrust journalists and it took some pestering before i was allowed to attend an open air meeting of their co ordinating assembly rows of shivering teenagers settled on the steps of the santiago library to discuss the government s plea that they should demobilise until the council gives its report but according to the speeches i heard this was a ploy to fob them off until the december holidays when the more experienced leaders would leave school at this point two panda eyed girls came over daniela and josefa both 17 are training younger cadres in their schools to replace them instructing them in how to conduct meetings how to defuse partisanship and how to follow the rules of transparency both had been shunted around the system according to the changing fortunes of their parents leaving them angry about the bribery and personal contacts that condition access to schooling and critical of the materialism and racism encouraged by the market what about freedom of choice oh no schools choose us the girls feel part of a forgotten constituency the middle class suffers most josefa said the new rich are doing great with capitalism and the working class is bailed out by state subsidies we re the ones who are insecure they worry about a slide among their colleagues towards confrontation for the fun of it we need at least a card up our sleeve we need to be strategic sure enough in october sit ins whose purpose was less clear were forcibly dispersed and seventy pupils suspended for the year by the all powerful local authority provoste is trying to have this sentence reversed marÃ­a huerta the spokeswoman for the children s assembly dealt crisply with the idea that the ministry s hands are tied of course they could change the law they just lack the will in this she speaks for the real chile as reformers now call it whose citizens are challenging a government of women to look out of the boardroom into cramped homes violent marriages pointless classrooms and grasping hospitals further up the scale a new civil society is coming into being led by the intelligentsia on a march against a lucrative municipal building project the banners said

in yorkshire not much more can be done to mitigate the inequities of public services without tackling their cause and forcing constitutional change it s instructive coming from a britain that is moving in the opposite direction to observe how hard it is for a withered state to regain essential redistributive and regulatory functions yasna provoste has presented a bill calling for the establishment of a body to regulate education similar to the one attempting to regulate the abuses of the health system which would give more scope for quality control and allow heavier sanctions against cowboy entrepreneurs but it would be a costly bureaucratic stopgap the transition s compromises are coming under strain when camilo escalona the socialist party president referred to certain corporations as bloodsuckers there was an embarrassed shuffling this politicians of all parties said was the unhelpful language of a former time escalona retorted that it was time to cut the hypocrisy and reintroduce risk into the national debate harmony reigned at least over the preparations for chile s national day on 18 september when in city squares and parks traditional food rodeos and hanky

this article first appeared in forum the edge malaysia weekly on february 4 2019 february 10 2019 there has been overwhelming concern about china s economy in recent times this cannot be helped given that the world s second largest economy has been an important global growth contributor for several years now china has contributed roughly 25 to 30 to global growth in the past few years its dominance in the world economy has not gone unnoticed with some quarters fearing that it will one day become the undisputed economic superpower in fact some believe that the root cause of the ongoing trade war goes beyond the trade deficits that the us is incurring with china to its emergence as a global production and technology powerhouse that will rival america in the near future pessimists have for several years predicted a downturn in china s economy which has yet to materialise recent macro releases showing the china economy growing at its slowest pace since 1990 6 6 last year have magnified the voices of those who predict its impending collapse this is hardly surprising given that a deadly cocktail of high credit growth surging property market and astronomical debt could in theory spark off a lehman brothers episode in china at least according to some media reports china is said to be buying time to fix its system but many argue that the problems are just too huge to handle and the government is much too slow in addressing them more drastic measures are needed to fix the economy now such arguments have been around for a while those who went through the 1997 98 asian financial crisis will find that they resemble the arguments heard over two decades ago at the height of the crisis calls for countries to bite the bullet were echoed everywhere take a drastic approach clean up once and for all and start afresh was the resounding argument at the time standard economic templates from mainstream economists were forced down the throats of some asian economies then fiscal austerity is the right way went the argument despite the social disorder that erupted in many countries to restore market confidence budgets needed to be quickly balanced interest rates to be kept high and weak institutions to be shut down immediately this was despite knowing how fickle financial markets could be and the repercussions for financial markets and social order as seen in countries like indonesia after 16 commercial banks were shut down in november 1997 were taken for granted as economist and nobel laureate joseph stiglitz puts it this in my opinion applies to the current context of china sequencing and pacing are important measures can be good but if they are not implemented in the proper order or do not take into account the broader social context chaos will ensue in the case of the asian financial crisis the lack of institutional reforms and social safety nets in many of the troubled countries in the 1990s led to chaos especially when capital account liberalisation was done far too quickly while economic progress and development are important for social and economic stability the reverse is also true this is why asians tend to value stability as a whole and often consider it as a crucial ingredient for undisrupted development and prosperity malaysia for example took a drastic measure pegging its currency to the us dollar during the asian financial crisis one of the reasons for such a controversial move was to ensure a stable business environment which is possible if there is no extreme volatility in exchange rate movements an unstable currency makes business decisions extremely difficult resulting in massive cutbacks in spending and exacerbating any downturn in the economy to some extent forcing the economy to stabilise although this was highly criticised at the time facilitated business planning decisions social stability is also often considered an important element of a country s uninterrupted development and prosperity china deeply believes in this thus the argument for making sudden and swift moves to rebalance its economy from its perspective disregarding the importance of social stability should be taken with not a pinch but a spoonful of salt to be fair china has not gone without reforms reforms are ongoing but at a gradual pace something that is causing dissatisfaction among some quarters these modest reforms according to researchers at hoover institution stanford california in one of the economic working papers by xiang xu and alice siqi han last year are undertaken with an anti crisis approach in order to minimise instability in the economy the authorities also react swiftly to internal and external shocks through a combination of fiscal and monetary policies from a structural point of view the fact that social resources are controlled by the chinese authorities means that there is an implicit guarantee against potential collapses according to the working paper it is also argued that a high degree of political consolidation and china s economic structure which promotes a gradual move towards market oriented enterprises are key ingredients to prevent a soviet style collapse in the early 1990s china is also protected by its relatively closed capital account something that is often criticised but remains a relevant factor in ensuring the stability of its economy such a measure helps policymakers implement exchange rate policies that avoid the abrupt appreciation or depreciation of the renminbi given its massive reserves the government has adequate leeway in manoeuvring its fiscal policy that said the current economic and political backdrop have received greater attention from the authorities the world is learning to see china reach maturity on the economic ladder gone are the days of high single digit growth rates at the same time economic ammunition could be less effective than in the past macroeconomic imbalances are still overshadowing its economy no doubt about that and critical issues like infringement of intellectual property rights need to be addressed however from china s perspective the gradual approach to manoeuvring its economic development has its merits social and cultural factors cannot be ignored in the country s pursuit of economic stability and prosperity nor zahidi alias is chief economist at malaysian rating corp bhd the views expressed

is president trump blowing up the deficit and dooming the economy trump s big tax cuts and spending increases have substantially widened the deficit the annual gap between government income and expenses to nearly 1 trillion lending fresh urgency to a debate that seemed to have vanished from the halls of congress in recent years some economists and think tanks say the red ink could ultimately crimp the economy by pushing up borrowing costs for americans and hampering the government s ability to spend in a crisis that could mar trump s economic legacy much as a big debt run up in the 1980s tainted president reagan s meanwhile the sum of all annual deficits and surpluses the national debt is an eye popping 21 trillion the ratio of national debt held by the public which excludes things like social security to gross domestic product is at 78 percent the highest level in 70 years according to the committee for a responsible federal budget a nonpartisan nonprofit group the 35 day partial government shutdown resolved at least temporarily on jan 25 raised questions about whether a divided congress can pass a new spending deal this year that begins to tackle the budget gap in early january fitch ratings warned that a failure to grapple with the deficit could eventually prompt it to lower the nation s credit rating a move that would roil markets and the economy given that the president and congress can t agree on simply keeping the government open there is little prospect they can agree on addressing the nation s fiscal problems says mark zandi chief economist of moody s analytics also placing renewed focus on the deficit the economic lift fueled by the republican tax and spending measures is expected to fade this year that s sparking questions about whether the lingering hangover higher deficits will ultimately slow or derail an economy already set to cool other analysts downplay any tangible economic impact from the deficit they note interest rates remain low and bondholders seem to have a limitless appetite for financing u s borrowing especially when other countries are far less financially stable even with a big deficit the u s is still a pretty good bet for bondholders says economist paul ashworth of capital economics i m not sure why people will start to panic in another month or two or in a year tax guide when to file and what big changes to expect planning your finances why you need to create a financial planning calendar for the year during the great recession of 2007 09 and its aftermath when president obama spearheaded a 787 billion stimulus to resuscitate the economy republicans in congress grumbled routinely about the mounting debt burden but many of those deficit hawks have receded from the spotlight the loudest house speaker paul ryan r wis retired last month after embracing the trump tax and spending laws some economists however says the calm may belie a coming storm i think of the deficit like climate change zandi says we know if we don t do something it s coming but we don t know when it s corrosive deficit approaches 1 trillion the budget deficit is expected to reach 900 billion in fiscal 2019 and hover at about 1 trillion or above for the next decade up from 779 billion last year according to congressional budget office projections at least 40 percent of the increase can be traced to the tax and spending measures trump vowed that the sweeping tax cut would pay for itself by generating more economic growth that swells government coffers but that hasn t happened the tax cut passed in late 2017 is expected to cost the government 1 84 trillion over the next decade according to the committee for a responsible federal budget and the cbo while faster economic growth is forecast to generate about 570 billion in additional revenue that will be offset by higher interest payments on a bigger national debt the committee says deficit projections over the next decade are unrivaled by any time in our nation s history save for world war ii and the immediate aftermath of the great recession house budget committee chairman john yarmuth d ky said at a hearing recently all told the tax and spending laws are poised to add 2 1 trillion to 4 7 trillion to the debt over 10 years depending on whether they re extended beyond their current terms and so the u s debt held by the public as a share of gross domestic product is expected to rise from 78 percent to 93 to 105 percent over the next decade without the legislation debt to gdp would have climbed to 89 percent over that period the committee for a responsible budget says to be sure other expenses such as social security medicare and interest on the debt are also big drivers of the deficit the tax and spending legislation just made things worse says michael peterson ceo of the peter g peterson foundation which addresses u s fiscal challenges like trump reagan slashed taxes and sharply increased military spending nearly tripling the debt to 2 8 trillion by the time he left office in 1989 some economists say the initiatives helped dig the economy out of a double dip recession in the early 1980s others say they helped stoke inflation fears and federal reserve interest rate increases that contributed to the 1990 91 recession rising interest rates what does the bigger deficit mean higher costs for americans when the government has to borrow to pay its bills it issues treasury notes as the supply of those bonds increases their prices fall and yields rise to attract more buyers assuming demand is steady as a rule of thumb each percentage point increase in the debt to gdp ratio boosts treasury yields by about 04 percent point zandi says a jump in debt to gdp from 89 percent to 105 percent could increase treasury rates by 0 64 percentage point and since 10 year treasury yields now 2 73 percent directly affect loans such as 30 year fixed mortgages a monthly payment on a 200 000 mortgage could rise by up to 77 that could hurt the housing market and the broader economy another reason treasury rates could increase is that uncle sam has borrowed so much money that bondholders begin to doubt whether the government can pay it back as a result they demand a higher interest rate to offset the bigger risk here s the good news the part of 10 year treasury rates known as the term premium which reflects the risk of default the risk bondholders take by locking in the rate for a decade and the fluctuating supply and demand of treasurys has been roughly stable at about negative 0 5 percent since mid 2017 the rest of the 2 73 percent 10 year rate reflects expectations for short term rates based mostly on federal reserve moves treasurys offer safe haven in other words treasury bonds are so coveted by domestic and foreign investors that they re willing to pay a premium to own them rather than demand a premium as is typically the case that negative 0 5 percent term premium has been little changed even after congress passed the tax and spending bills ashworth says the deficit has gone up but investors aren t asking for more he says they re asking for less why in an increasingly uncertain global economy in which countries like italy turkey and argentina face financial crises the u s economy is a beacon and treasurys remain a rock solid investment also the dollar serves as the world s reserve currency for international transactions and many countries store their dollars in treasury bonds treasurys have been a safe haven says charlie ripley senior investment strategist and bond analyst for allianz investment management it doesn t really appear to us that the increase in the deficit has had a material effect on treasury yields but a closer look reveals that passage of the tax and spending bills in late 2017 and early 2018 did nudge treasury rates higher in the following weeks by about 0 2 percentage point zandi says although rates retreated during the stock market turbulence late last year as investors bought more stable assets including treasurys treasury rates are slightly higher than they would be without the legislation zandi says in other words the monthly payment on that 200 000 mortgage costs about 25 more that s still a modest impact but experts say investors may not always have the same appetite or risk tolerance for treasurys especially if congress doesn t begin to tame the deficit or continues to let it balloon there s no credible argument for why we should be able to run deficits at unsustainable levels indefinitely says maya macguineas president of the committee for a responsible budget and fitch ratings senior director charles seville says it s a bit early to say that interest rates won t rise as the budget deficit widens will congress s hands be tied in next recession the other way the deficit can hurt the economy is by making it harder for congress to fund a new stimulus package in case of a recession which many economists predict will occur in 2020 typically deficits fall during strong economies as tax revenue rises and they increase in downturns as tax income falls and the government spends more on unemployment insurance and stimulus programs it s virtually unprecedented for deficits to be this high while the nation is enjoying a strong economy and no major war as it is today according to the the committee for a responsible budget in fact the committee says the white house and congress should be taking advantage of the healthy economy to whittle down the deficit you have so little room to respond during the next crisis macguineas says in reality though it s unlikely bond investors will hesitate to finance additional u s spending to combat another downturn ashworth says after all he says even if u s debt to gdp approaches 100 percent that s still well below 130 percent plus ratios in countries such as italy and japan chris edwards senior fellow at the libertarian cato institute notes that while the u s debt to gdp ratio is lower its economy and debt level are much larger he calls the deficit buildup disastrous capital economics neil shearing is more worried about political resistance in congress to a massive stimulus if the nation s debt burden hits nosebleed levels zandi isn t concerned if we get into a mess policymakers will ignore the deficit and do what they need to do he says yet macguineas says the patience of bondholders and lawmakers eventually will run thin we don t know when that is and we don t want to try to find out
president donald trump delivered his second state of the union address on tuesday where he re enforced his immigration agenda slammed ridiculous partisan investigations and announced he would meet with north korea s kim jong un for a second time later this month nbc news fact checked his state of the union address as it happened claim trump s administration has created 600 000 manufacturing jobs trump s figure is close the u s has added 454 000 manufacturing jobs since trump took office in january 2017 some of the biggest gains in 20 years according to jobs data trump s numbers mark an acceleration of a trend that began in 2010 under president barack obama still after decades of automation and change to the industry in the u s manufacturing is a much smaller part of the country s economy than it was decades ago while 19 5 million people were employed in the manufacturing industry in 1979 there were 12 8 million americans in the industry in late 2018 claim trump says he launched an unprecedented economic boom in just over two years since the election we have launched an unprecedented economic boom a boom that has rarely been seen before trump said trump took office amid a booming economy and he s been taking credit for it since day one but there s no evidence he created this boom some economists argue he boosted growth with tax cuts turbocharging an already booming economy while others argue the government shutdown tariffs and trade war have slowed growth most can agree however that trump s economy something he touts among his biggest successes has been built upon the upward trajectory that began under obama and while america s economy is strong it has grown at a faster rate in earlier years in 1983 for example the nation s annual gdp was 7 9 percent in the second quarter of 2018 the gdp was 4 2 percent claim trump says unemployment is at its lowest rate in half a century trump s figure is accurate though it s notably a continuation of a strong growth trend begun after the recession ended in 2010 when unemployment ticked down to 3 7 percent in september 2018 that indeed marked the lowest jobless rate since december 1969 per the bureau of labor statistics but the jobless rate has since ticked back up to 4 0 in january which is above the 3 8 percent achieved in the clinton administration in april 2000 it s certainly true that the economy is in a much improved place now than it was a decade ago joblessness has steadily declined since the end of the economic recession in 2010 but it s a fuzzier picture when it comes to whether trump deserves credit for the low unemployment rate or whether he has continued a trend started by the obama administration in the 24 months since trump has been in office total non farm employment has grown by nearly 4 9 million over the same period of time 24 months at the end of obama s tenure total non farm employment grew by about 5 1 million claim trump boasts of energy revolution says u s is now no 1 producer of oil and natural gas trump said tuesday night that we have unleashed a revolution in american energy the united states is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world while it s true that u s is the leading producer of both oil and gas in the world the president is claiming undue credit that s been the case since the middle of the obama administration the u s energy information administration found that in 2017 the united states produced the most petroleum and dry natural gas of any country in the world but that s not a recent phenomenon either the u s has topped the production charts in both categories since 2013 for petroleum and 2011 for natural gas claim trump says nothing can compete with america s economy trump said tuesday night that there s nothing anywhere in the world that can compete with america before later saying the u s is experiencing an economic miracle while the u s economy has been strong overall it s not the fastest growing economy in the world and some argue that it s not actually the biggest either according to the international monetary fund s most recent estimates in its world economic outlook india is projected to have the highest rate of economic growth among major economies in 2019 and 2020 at somewhere around 7 5 to 7 7 percent gdp growth rate china is projected around 6 2 percent growth in 2019 and 2020 the united states meanwhile clocks in at just a 2 5 percent rate in 2019 and 1 8 percent in 2020 the united states does have the highest nominal gdp of any country in the world per the imf that measure does not take into account cost of living in various countries so many economists use also a measure called purchasing power parity which adjusts gross domestic product for lower consumer prices and standards of living using that measure china surpassed the united states as the biggest economy in the world back in 2014 claim trump takes credit for criminal justice reform both parties united for criminal justice reform they said it couldn t be done trump said tuesday night trump is correct that he signed the first major overhaul of prison sentencing in decades that legislation the first step act includes provisions for sentencing reform such as shortening some mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenses and addressing racial disparities in the federal prison system it s also true that lawmakers tried and failed to pass a similar package of reforms during obama s second term but it was republicans who blocked that bill despite general bipartisan support for the measure that consensus legislation was introduced by sen chuck grassley r iowa and sen dick durbin d ill in 2015 it had the support of then speaker of the house paul ryan the koch brothers and president barack obama but senate majority leader mitch mcconnell was reluctant to bring the issue up for a vote during the tumultuous 2016 election and a handful of gop lawmakers including sens tom cotton of arkansas and jeff sessions of alabama led the charge to argue that the bill would result in the release of violent criminals the bill never saw a vote during obama s presidency as a result in 2018 however trump with significant lobbying from his son in law jared kushner backed the bill prompting mcconnell to agree to bring the bill to the floor some advocates while still supportive of the effort argued that it does not go far enough for starters the bill only addresses the federal prison population which only makes up about 12 percent of incarcerated individuals in the u s claim trump says wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders trump underscored his pitch to address illegal immigration by claiming that wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards many democrats have called for reforming immigration enforcement in particular some have called for abolishing and rethinking immigration and customs enforcement but no prominent lawmakers have pushed for open borders democratic leaders amid the recent government spending fight that led to the longest shutdown in u s history consistently rejected trump s wall while still advocating for border security in general we all agree we need to secure our borders while honoring our values we can build the infrastructure and roads at our ports of entry we can install new technology to scan cars and trucks for drugs coming into our nation we can hire the personnel we need to facilitate trade and immigration at the border we can fund more innovation to detect unauthorized crossings house speaker nancy pelosi d calif said in january and while a meme shared by conservatives on social media alleged there is a wall around pelosi s california home and the president has asserted there is a wall around former president barack obama s washington home there is no wall encircling either the front of the obamas home is easily visible in photos and the walled off house pictured in the meme is not actually pelosi s politifact reported rating the claim pants on fire according to the washington post the obamas did add fencing and a guard booth former presidents have secret service protection for life claim trump says the state of the southern border is lawless threatening the security of all americans america s immigration system is broken that s something experts advocates and politicians across the spectrum can agree on but there s little evidence the southern border is experiencing a new state of emergency violence isn t spilling over the border and terrorists aren t being caught in droves trying to cross it illegal drugs largely come through legal ports of entry not unguarded parts of the border according to border authorities illegal border crossings have been dropping for years and while border apprehensions have risen in recent months they are still markedly lower than they were twenty years ago customs and border protection data shows and though trump has focused on the border illegal immigration in the u s is being driven by another factor people who overstay their visas more than 701 900 people overstayed their visas during fiscal year 2017 according to the department of homeland security people who overstay their visas usually enter the country through an airport not from the border claim trump says democrats voted for border barriers in the past this is true but trump dismissed the wall legislation democrats supported as inadequate dozens of democrats including senate minority leader chuck schumer of new york did vote for the secure fence act of 2006 which authorized building a fence along about 700 miles of the border between the united states and mexico trump derided that fencing in 2016 as such a little wall such a nothing wall claim we re taking in billions off chinese goods with tariffs trump vowed to right calamitous trade policies and said he is making it clear to china the theft of american jobs and wealth has come to an end he continued therefore we recently imposed tariffs on 250 billion of chinese goods and now our treasury is receiving billions of dollars the president portrays this as an american victory over foreign companies and while the u s government is taking in billions of dollars in tariffs it s not the chinese who are paying the bulk of these it s american consumers experts told nbc news in december that trump was misunderstanding tariffs the fee charged on foreign goods when they are imported american consumers typically end up footing the bill for those taxes not foreign companies while one expert said there is some evidence that chinese corporations may be reducing prices to absorb a fraction of the tariffs to stay more competitive in american markets consumers are expected to absorb the bulk of the fee claim san diego proves walls work to combat illegal immigration trump says when trump argues that the united states needs a wall along the southern border he likes to point to san diego s success san diego used to have the most illegal border crossing in the country trump said tuesday night in response a strong security wall was put in place this powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings the militarized border touching the communities of imperial beach san ysidro and otay mesa contributed to a 75 percent decline in crossings in the years immediately after fencing was installed in the 1990s according to u s customs and border protection data there double and triple barriers fortify the westernmost stretch of the nearly 2 000 mile u s mexico border as u s border patrol agents drive suvs along frontage roads and hover overhead in helicopters the hardened border however pushed migrants to remote areas that are more dangerous those experts contended arizona has become a hotbed of crossings but migrants often die of dehydration the mountains east of san diego have also become a crossing zone where migrants have died from hypothermia claim trump says drug prices have declined in 2018 already as a result of my administration s efforts in 2018 drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years trump said on tuesday the president first said drug prices would start dropping in may but an associated press investigation of drug prices in the first half of the year found that overall prices are still on the rise over the first seven months of 2018 the ap found that there were 96 price hikes for every price cut there were fewer price increases from january through july 2018 than during comparable time frames in years past but companies still hiked prices significantly more than they cut them at the end of may the president announced that drug companies would be voluntarily slashing prices within two weeks in the two months after that there were 395 price increases and 24 decreases in an interview with the ap at the time health secretary alex azar said that it would be awhile before drug prices actually fall he credited the complexity of the medicine market and incentives for drugmakers to boost prices in order to boost profits claim nafta was a historic blunder for america trump in urging congress to support his new trade agreement said he had met men and women across the country whose dreams were shattered by nafta there are many estimates for job losses due to the clinton era north american free trade agreement nafta but millions is higher than the number calculated by most groups from across the ideological spectrum robert e scott of the pro labor economic policy institute found that about 851 700 u s jobs were displaced by the u s trade deficit with mexico between 1993 shortly before nafta was implemented and 2014 that s a data point that was cited by bernie sanders during his 2016 campaign when he frequently decried job losses due to nafta a 2014 peterson institute for international economics study found that while nafta has caused about 203 000 jobs to be displaced by nafta related imports annually imports support 188 000 new jobs leading to a net loss of only about 15 000 annually and the nonpartisan congressional research service wrote in 2017 that in reality nafta did not cause the huge job losses feared by the critics or the large economic gains predicted by supporters the net overall effect of nafta on the u s economy appears to have been relatively modest primarily because trade with canada and mexico accounts for a small percentage of u s gdp claim trump says new york allows abortion moments before birth there could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a mother holding her infant child than the chilling displays our nation saw in recent days trump said speaking out against abortion that occurs later in pregnancy lawmakers in new york cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother s womb moments before birth this is false the state recently passed a law loosening restrictions on abortions in the state allowing abortions after 24 weeks if the fetus is not viable or when it s necessary to protect the life of the mother the president paints the picture of a healthy mother and child but an abortion would not be legal in that scenario after 24 weeks in new york state democratic gov andrew cuomo has pushed back at critics noting that it is just a mirror of the federal law the abortion rights enshrined in the supreme court decision roe v wade what s more abortions later in pregnancy are exceedingly rare the centers for disease control reports that just 1 3 percent of abortions in the u s in 2015 took place in or after the 21st week claim virginia gov ralph northam stated he would execute a baby after birth speaking about abortion trump said we had the case of governor of virginia where he stated he would execute a baby after birth a spokesman for the governor ralph northam disputed this characterization of confusing remarks he made days ago and it should be noted that northam was discussing a hypothetical procedure that would occur only in cases of severe deformities or nonviable pregnancy nonetheless northam caused a firestorm when he responded to a hypothetical question related to a proposed state law that would have made it somewhat easier for a woman to obtain an abortion later in a pregnancy for medical reasons asked on a radio program what happens when a woman who is going into labor desires a third trimester abortion northam noted that this kind of procedure only occurs in cases of severe deformities or a nonviable pregnancy he said that in this scenario the infant would be resuscitated if that s what the mother and the family desired and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother it s worth noting that the proposed virginia law which failed to pass the republican controlled legislature wasn t proposing legalizing abortions in the third trimester that is already legal in the state the bill proposed changing the number of physicians required for that kind of abortion s approval from three to one doctor it also proposed broadening the list of health concerns that would allow a woman to seek approval for such an abortion claim over the last two years we have begun to fully rebuild the united states military despite trump s frequent discussion of restoring and rebuilding america s military might the most recent legislation he signed to fund national defense came in at less than an obama signed bill in 2011 for fiscal year 2019 trump has signed into law national defense authorization legislation that provides 716 billion for national defense operations including 639 billion for the pentagon that s a smaller dollar number than the 726 billion provided by the 2011 national defense authorization act it s not clear yet what trump will ultimately propose for defense spending in fiscal year 2020 in a tweet on dec 4 he appeared to decry the amount of spending on defense saying the u s spent 716 billion dollars this year crazy he s referring to the same bill he signed into law but days after reports that he wanted to slash future spending to 700 billion the administration signaled that trump would instead agree to a request from then defense secretary jim mattis to boost that number to 740 billion claim trump says venezuela s collapse is a result of socialist policies since the swearing in of president nicolÃ¡s maduro whom much of the international community has called illegitimate many conservative critics have blamed the country s 21st century socialism for the unrest and protests in the country trump on tuesday night said that maduro s socialist policies have turned that nation from being the wealthiest in south america into a state of abject poverty and despair but it s a more complicated picture than just the s word the corruption of venezuelan leaders and the country s near complete dependence on oil are also important components of the country s downfall after maduro s predecessor hugo chÃ¡vez became president in 1999 he worked to use oil revenues from the then booming industry to fund national programs but when oil prices began to collapse in 2014 shortly after chÃ¡vez died and maduro took over the country lacked funds for those programs u s sanctions on the oil industry a result of charges of corruption and human rights abuses by venezuelan leaders have been another blow to the economy francisco toro a venezuelan journalist and an official with the latin american business organization group of 50 wrote in a washington post opinion article last year that all venezuela demonstrates is that if you leave implementation to the very worst most anti intellectual callous authoritarian and criminal people in society socialism can have genuinely horrendous consequences toro and others have pointed out that other countries with leftist or socialist leaning governments like denmark or sweden have not experienced similar unrest claim north korea hasn t tested a missile in 15 months our hostages have come home nuclear testing has stopped and there has not been a missile launch in 15 months much work remains to be done but my relationship with kim jong un is a good one trump said while trump is correct that north korea has not launched a missile in 15 months there s ample evidence that north korea is seeking to retain and hide their nuclear capabilities contradicting the president s past claims that he s made great progress in getting pyongyang to give up their nuclear weapons director of national intelligence dan coats said last week that it s unlikely north korea will try to denuclearize and the regime appears to be working to hide their efforts as nbc news reported on jan 21 researchers funded by the defense think tank center for strategic and international studies have discovered an undisclosed secret ballistic missile base in north korea and that there could be as many as 20 north korea has also refused to provide a detailed list of its nuclear and missile facilities despite the u s calls for it to do so a former senior u s official who has been briefed on the negotiations told nbc news that i can t find anybody in the u s who thinks the north koreans are denuclearizing vice president mike pence conceded earlier this month that the u s is still await concrete steps by north korea to dismantle the nuclear weapons that threaten our people and our allies in the region claim trump says u s has liberated virtually all of iraq and syria from isis it s accurate for trump to say that isis can claim just a fraction of the territory it once did all but about 1 percent of the territory that isis once controlled is now gone according to brett mcgurk the now former special presidential envoy to the coalition to defeat isis in syria and iraq but the center for strategic and international studies estimates that while islamic state territorial control has been reduced to minor pockets of rural iraq the group was still carrying out an average of 75 attacks per month in 2018 and in the annual worldwide threat assessment released in january u s intelligence officials concluded that isis still commands thousands of fighters in iraq and syria and it maintains eight branches more than a dozen networks and thousands of dispersed supporters around the world despite significant leadership and territorial losses one such attack is particularly raw four americans were among those killed by an explosion in manbij syria on january 16 isis claimed responsibility for that attack additionally military officials have warned that without sustained pressure from the u s isis could regain that lost territory in january nbc news reported on a draft pentagon report warning that isis is intent on reconstituting a physical caliphate and that the terror group could retake lost land in six to 12 months if there is no military pressure preventing them from doing so nobody is declaring mission accomplished in the fight against isis mcgurk said in early december then after trump announced on dec 19 that u s troops would withdraw from syria tweeting that isis had been defeated mcgurk resigned defense secretary jim mattis also resigned in the wake of that decision claim 1 in 3 women is sexually assaulted on the journey to america while it s difficult to estimate the rates at which it occurs it s true that sexual violence is a reality for many female migrants one amnesty international publication in 2010 reported that it is the widely held view of non profit and medical workers that as many as six in 10 migrant women are raped trump s estimate appears to be based on a may 2017 report by doctors without borders which found that about one third of female migrants out of a survey of 467 migrants total had experienced sexual abuse during their journey claim trump says we have more women serving in congress than at any time before trump earned big applause for this line we have more women serving in congress than at any time before he s correct but it s also true that those women are overwhelmingly democrats in fact the share of republican women in the house has gone down since the last congress according to the center for american women and politics at rutgers university of the 127 female voting members of the house and senate in the chamber tonight 106 are democrats and just 21 are republicans in fact in the house the share of republican women actually decreased from last congress to this one last congress there were 23 republican women serving in the house as voting members that s down to just 13 this congress the overall breakdown of female voting members is house 89 democrats 13 republicans senate 17 democrats 8 republicans claim trump says he s sending another 3 750 troops to the u s border this is true though those troops won t all deploy at the same time the department of homeland security request for assistance was approved in january by acting defense secretary patrick shanahan who agreed to send 3 750 more troops to string concertina wire man surveillance cameras and provide some airlift support however they won t all deploy to the border at once there will be an influx of about 2 000 to string 160 miles of concertina wire but then the number will go back down as the mission turns to manning surveillance cameras and supporting customs and border protection in other ways there are about 2 400 active duty there now and more will begin to deploy in mid february still the total deployed there is not expected to surpass about 4 400 at this point claim trump says mexican cities are paying for migrants to journey to u s in a section discussing illegal immigration trump said that mexican cities in order to remove the illegal immigrants from their communities are getting trucks and buses to bring them up to our country in areas where there is little border protection trump seems to be referring to a group of about 2 000 migrants who arrived at the port of entry in eagle pass texas this group made much of their journey by bus and a handful of cities and towns they passed through in mexico paid for the buses because they were not equipped to care for the immigrants however it s not clear what trump meant when he said there is little border protection texas sent state patrolmen and women to eagle pass today as reinforcements where federal and local law enforcement also had a larger than usual presence according to local news reports there is patrol at all times through the area so it s just a little heavier today than usual eagle pass mayor ramsey cantu told reporters on tuesday according to the local abc news affiliate department of homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen said that dhs will take all steps to ensure the safety of law enforcement personnel at the border claim the economy is growing twice as fast today as when trump took office the u s economy is growing almost twice as fast today as when i took office trump said tuesday night this is true when trump took office the rate of gdp growth was 1 8 percent for the first quarter of 2017 in the third quarter of 2018 the most recent data available it was 3 4 percent claim tens of thousands of americans are killed by drugs coming across the border it s correct that lethal drugs do come across the border and drug overdose deaths are up among men women all races and adults of nearly all ages according to the centers for disease control and prevention in 2017 70 237 people died from an overdose but trump in pushing for a border wall tends to ignore that the vast majority of hard drugs from mexican cartels come into the u s through legal ports of entry which wouldn t be affected by a wall according to a 2015 national drug threat assessment by the dea mexican drug cartels transport the bulk of their drugs over the southwest border through ports of entry poes using passenger vehicles or tractor trailers the drugs are typically secreted in hidden compartments when transported in passenger vehicles or commingled with legitimate goods when transported in tractor trailers in the 2018 version of the same publication dea said the most common method employed by these involves transporting illicit drugs through u s poes in passenger vehicles with concealed compartments or commingled with legitimate goods on tractor trailers the trump administration knows this then department of homeland security secretary john kelly who went on to become white house chief of staff until december 2018 said in april 2017 that illegal drug traffic mostly comes through the ports of entry claim trump says u s has more women in the workforce than ever before it s true that there are more women in the workforce than ever before but that s the continuation of a long term trend the bureau of labor statistics estimated in january that there were about 74 9 million women in the workforce but that number has long been trending upward and the overall growth of the u s population means that the raw number of women in the workforce has increased nearly every year since at least the early 1980s except for in years during which the country experienced a recession perhaps another metric to measure women s participation in the workforce would be the women s unemployment rate the unemployment rate for women over 16 stood at 3 9 percent in january that was up slightly from a low of 3 6 percent in may and september of last year but as with unemployment overall women s unemployment has been falling since the end of the recession claim trump says border fencing made el paso safer the border city of el paso texas used to have extremely high rates of violent crime one of the highest in the country and considered one of our nation s most dangerous cities trump claimed in his address now with a powerful barrier in place el paso is one of our safest cities in fact el paso s crime rate had been dropping for years when construction on border fence began in 2008 however the crime rate actually rose during construction and in the year after completion of a fence according to an analysis of fbi crime data by the el paso times the city s democratic sheriff richard wiles disputed trump s characterization as falsehoods used to justify the building of a 2 000 mile wall the facts are clear while it is true that el paso is one of the safest cities in the nation it has never been considered one of our nation s most dangerous cities wiles said in a statement provided to nbc news and el paso was a safe city long before any wall was built president trump continues to give a false narrative about a great city that truly represents what this great nation is all about claim trump says countless americans are murdered by criminal illegal aliens there isn t good data on homicides specifically in the united states but there s no evidence that immigrants commit more crimes than american born residents previous empirical research shows that immigrants do not increase local crime rates are less likely to cause crime than their native born peers and are less likely to be incarcerated than native born americans according to the libertarian leaning cato institute trump has previously circulated a claim backed by rep steve king r iowa that 63 000 americans have been killed by undocumented immigrants since 9 11 but that number has since been debunked politifact has extrapolated from existing data sources that the number of homicides committed by undocumented immigrants may fall between about 450 600 per year but again those are guesses not based on national data sources claim trump claims he s added 5 3 million jobs we have created 5 3 million new jobs trump said tuesday night this number needs context trump is taking credit for the job gains in the final months of his predecessor s administration starting the clock on job gains from his election not his inauguration since trump has been in office total nonfarm employment has grown by nearly 4 9 million the 5 3 million data point includes gains in between his election on nov 8 2016 and his inauguration on jan 20 2017

foodservice segment net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 declined 44 7 year over year to 43 1 million the decline was primarily a result of a 57 1 million increase in income tax expense

top line and gross profit growth and mix of business specifically within the independent restaurant channel net income declined 29 1 to 71 3 million for the first half of fiscal 2019 compared to the

financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with gaap including ebitda adjusted ebitda free cash flow and adjusted diluted eps such measures are not recognized terms under gaap should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with gaap and are not indicative of net income as determined under gaap ebitda adjusted ebitda free cash flow adjusted diluted eps and other non gaap financial measures have limitations that should be considered before using these measures to evaluate the pfg s liquidity or financial performance ebitda adjusted ebitda free cash flow and adjusted diluted eps as presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because of varying methods of calculation management measures operating performance based on pfg s ebitda defined as net income before interest expense interest income income taxes and depreciation and amortization pfg believes that the presentation of ebitda enhances an investor s understanding of pfg s performance pfg believes this measure is a useful metric to assess pfg s operating performance from period to period by excluding certain items that pfg believes are not representative of pfg s core business pfg also uses this measure to evaluate the performance of its segments and for business planning purposes in addition management uses adjusted ebitda defined as net income before interest expense interest income income and franchise taxes and depreciation and amortization further adjusted to exclude certain items we do not consider part of our core operating results such adjustments include certain unusual non cash non recurring cost reduction and other adjustment items permitted in calculating covenant compliance under the pfg s credit agreement and indenture other than certain pro forma adjustments permitted under our credit agreement and indenture relating to the adjusted ebitda contribution of acquired entities or businesses prior to the acquisition date under pfg s credit agreement and indenture pfg s ability to engage in certain activities such as incurring certain additional indebtedness making certain investments and making restricted payments is tied to ratios based on adjusted ebitda as defined in the credit agreement and indenture management also uses free cash flow which is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures purchases of property plant and equipment pfg also believes that the presentation of free cash flow enhances an investor s understanding of pfg s ability to make strategic investments and manage debt levels management also uses adjusted diluted eps which is calculated by adjusting the most directly comparable gaap financial measure by excluding the same items excluded in pfg s calculation of adjusted ebitda as well as certain one time income tax items to the extent that each such item was included in the applicable gaap financial measure pfg believes that the presentation of ebitda adjusted ebitda free cash flow and adjusted diluted eps is useful to investors because these metrics provide insight into underlying business trends and year over year results and are frequently used by securities analysts investors and other interested parties in their evaluation of the operating performance of companies in pfg s industry the following

welcome to this week s market wrap podcast i m mike gleason coming up axel merk of merk investments joins me for a terrific conversation about gold the fed stocks and the dollar and find out why he believes investors will soon realize that it does matter again about where you put your money don t miss my interview with axel merk coming up after this week s market update gold and silver markets closed out the month of january on a high note as the federal reserve signaled it would back off on further rate hikes on wednesday fed policymakers voted unanimously to leave the central bank s benchmark interest rate unchanged fed chairman jerome powell cited recent weakness in economic growth forecasts left unspoken was the recent pressure directed at the fed from the white house and wall street the stock market plunge in late december set off multiple alarm bells and even activated the treasury department s plunge protection team the fed got the message and wall street seems to be back on good terms with monetary planners stocks posted one of their best january performances on record on wednesday president donald trump celebrated the dow jones hitting 25 000 however he didn t mention that the best performing sector this week is the gold miners the hui gold mining index popped over 7 higher into thursday s close gold itself is up a more modest 1 1 this week to bring spot prices to 1 318 per ounce silver trades at 16 01 an ounce after rising 1 4 on the week platinum is putting in a weekly gain of 1 3 to trade at 833 and finally palladium is flat for the week to come in at 1 373 per ounce now just slightly ahead of gold well gold is at the center of a geopolitical crisis now playing out in venezuela the venezuelan government is scrambling to get ahold of its own gold reserves after the united states imposed economic sanctions on the country and the united kingdom refused to release 1 2 billion in gold held on behalf of the maduro regime the united states officially recognizes juan guaidÃ³ as the acting president of venezuela even though he hasn t yet formed a government or removed maduro from power the socialist incumbent maduro still has the backing of china and of russia he reportedly sent 20 tons of gold to russia on a cargo jet shrouded in mystery whether maduro is trying to steal the country s gold or prevent it from being stolen isn t clear the long suffering venezuelan people have certainly had much of their wealth stolen through hyperinflation that is now approaching 2 million percent as of this recording the bank of england is still freezing venezuela s gold the unprecedented action is raising grave concerns about trust and counterparty risk in the global financial system we in the united states are busily going through a multi year program to see whether the russians had some role in the united states nothing remotely like what the united states and perhaps now britain are doing inside of venezuela richard wolff and you can be sure that every government in the world is going to rethink putting any money in london as they used to do when they re watching this political manipulation it makes a mockery of every international agreement that we know of about non interference in the internal affairs of other countries neo conservative hawks within the trump administration are bent on toppling venezuelan president nicolÃ¡s maduro and aren t ruling out a military invasion secretary of state mike pompeo appointed elliott abrams one of the main architects of regime change in iraq to oversee regime change in venezuela the trump administration s hasty pivot towards regime change has drawn surprisingly little opposition from democrats perhaps that s because it is the deep state calling most of the shots on foreign policy and not president trump himself yet when it comes to domestic policy the hyper partisan environment in washington threatens to bring about another government shutdown or declaration of national emergency later this month one of the few genuine opportunities for bipartisanship would be an audit the fed bill in january representative thomas massie reintroduced the federal reserve transparency act with a democrat co sponsor this bill which would subject the board of governors of the federal reserve to a full audit has garnered a large congressional majority of support in the past it would probably win majorities in both the house and senate in spite of the existing partisan divide between them the problem has always been whether it can get through procedural hurdles put up by the fed s legislative shills house speaker nancy pelosi may simply refuse to put audit the fed up for a vote and in the senate where a filibuster proof majority is always hard to obtain chuck schumer is a master at blocking legislation on behalf of central bankers some progress on the sound money front continues to be made at the state level in january the arizona legislature took up the sound money stabilization act it would require that at least 10 of arizona s budget stabilization fund be held in precious metals in a secure depository in 2017 arizona removed all state income taxation on gold and silver last year saw the passage of the wyoming legal tender act it reaffirms gold and silver as constitutional money and removes all state taxation of them sound money advocates in wyoming and arizona legislatures are now pushing bills to provide that a small portion of state assets be held in the monetary metals it s still a major uphill battle to persuade states to protect themselves by holding gold and silver and a number anti gold naysayers in wyoming have already come out of the woodwork to oppose the idea even as they defend the state s devasting losses on investments in third world debt in west virginia legislators will have a chance to vote on the west virginia sound money act it would remove all taxation against gold and silver including sales and use tax property tax individual income tax and corporate income tax the sound money defense league and campaign for liberty are helping to garner public support for these and other sound money initiatives in states across the country well now without further delay let s get right to this week s exclusive interview mike gleason it is my privilege now to welcome axel merk president and chief investment officer of merk investment and author of the book sustainable wealth axel is a well known market commentator and money manager and is a highly sought after guest at financial conferences and on news outlets throughout the world and it s always great to have him back on with us axel it s always a pleasure and thanks for joining us again axel merk my pleasure mike gleason well axel we want to get your thoughts here as the market seemed to be in a bit of flux a few months ago pretty much everyone was looking at three or four rate hikes and for quantitative tightening the reduction of the central banks bond holdings to continue but then the higher rates and prospects of further tightening finally caught up to the equity markets we had three months of sustained selling in stocks late last year and suddenly fed officials are singing a very different tune today they are signaling a much more dovish policy however we ve seen a big rally in stocks it isn t clear what to expect since the equity market seems to be a major factor when it comes to fomc policy tell us what you re expecting here and before we get too much into fed policy moving forward which i ll ask you about in a moment tell us is the selling we saw in the fourth quarter all behind us or is this a bit of a sucker s rally in stocks axel merk sure well i think you re timing is right talking about the expectations we had the end of the third quarter last year about a lot of tightening and to talk market terms there were very substantial positions on short treasuries short bonds betting on higher rates and as investors then looked out towards this year 2019 they repositioned or you can say there was a short squeeze and you had a significant rally in treasuries suddenly this took on a life of its own and the media is never afraid of putting a story into market a move and say oh my god the world is falling apart and sure enough the scare made it all the way to the fed and our mr powell who was walking in his dark room and said alright alright the market once had it a certain way and now it doesn t and then the moment that switched the market then started on rallying a few things here the u s consumer is doing just fine maybe they re going to fall off a cliff we don t see that yet inflation impressions are increasing no matter what everybody is telling you wages are going up not just for the c o level but all the way down the corporate ladder yes there are issues in the rest of the world and yes we are late in the economic cycle and so what all of that means is that higher rates to me automatically translates to more volatility so the high volatility is just natural obviously it may have been exasperated you can blame the algos whatever you want but yes higher volatility is with us historically we don t have a bear market most of the time anyway unless there is a recession and i just said i don t think the recession is imminent now that doesn t mean there isn t a risk of one that doesn t mean volatility isn t high it doesn t mean investments aren t going to diversify but certainly long in the tooth on this expansion and so everybody may well be prudent to kind of trim things back on their risk exposure and that s exactly what s been happening but for the time being i do think this economic cycle is not over yet we are late in it i also happen to think i mentioned inflationary prices the fed is not done tightening we ve gone overboard on that and i think we will likely see two more rate hikes later this year so this back and forth is likely going to continue and it s going to be a bit of a rollercoaster because also i mentioned higher wages that obviously hits corporate earnings corporate america is exposed internationally so yes they ll have some headwinds but in the meantime the consumer seems to be spending happily maybe not on housing but on many other things mike gleason as we re talking here on wednesday afternoon fed chair powell just came out with his statement tell us what you took from that sounds like you re still expecting that we are going to see a couple more rate hikes this year talk about fed policy a bit more axel merk well yeah that was my view and of course my view doesn t matter it matters what mr powell thinks because he is the one who calls the shots right it s not me i just have my thoughts here obviously powell has backpedaled quite substantially and they re two things there is the rate path and then there s this wonderful thing called quantitative tightening you refer to and maybe let s talk about that first remember when yellen talked about paint drying on a wall when they started on this journey basically they decided the fed balance sheet is too large they want to get down but that s about all they decided they didn t make up their mind of where that journey is going to take them in my view they thought that they had until the end of this year or so before they can actually decide how low they want to take the balance sheet so sure enough the market threw a tantrum and powell said okay i get it we got to do something and at the fomc meeting he kind of said we still don t have a clue he didn t use those words but yeah we might consider doing something and that really shows that the fed doesn t have a plan with quantitative tightening they re in so called uncharted territory and there s no academic framework no past of framework other than listening to the markets and that s really dangerous because it s the fed that s supposed to set what the risk free asset is the regulatory risk free asset treasuries and so when the fed just says hey let the market dictate that it creates an interesting unstable back and forth i m not suggesting that wouldn t be better if he market did everything but with the fed in there with a bazooka that kind of creates odd dynamics on the other side of it with regard to raise remember we are still only just about maybe in neutral yet unemployment has been going down and wage prices have been going up at some point that s not going to work anymore and i think that ll have to take the foot further off the accelerator i happen to think that s still on there even though we ve had hiccups in the emerging markets where it matters accessibility to loans financial conditions are just fine in the u s and the whole point of hiking is to tighten financial conditions that hasn t happened unless you re in emerging markets unless you re in some bad areas or from a junk area a little bit but for mainstream america financial conditions have not tightened and that s why i think they will change their view later this year possibly as early as this summer and if you just take what the fed said that s part of what markets rallied that s why metals rallied is because rate hikes are off the table for now and god speed for you people are thinking maybe the economy is going to ease up some point mike gleason yeah happy days are here again i guess at least in the short term one of the reasons it s great to have you on is that we know you re always keeping a close eye on international markets as well there s a lot going on in both europe and china the chinese economy appears to be slowing and any serious recession there will have big impacts for all of us and the political turmoil in europe may also drive markets what do you see as the biggest developing story internationally that will impact investors her in the u s axel axel merk the biggest story may not always be what the biggest impact is you rightfully mentioned china first china is just so much bigger so what happens in china matters china clearly has had a slowdown they have all kinds of incentives along the way to try to boost that they re trying not to actually lower rates so they re actually lowering most of the reserve requirements and have tax cuts they don t like to lower rates because they don t like to mess with the exchange rates too much they like to keep that reasonably stable whatever that means these days with the yuan and so there is some slowing down if they quote unquote panic it means they ll open the floodgates of stimulus but for the time being they re reasonably confident that the stimulus will work its way through the quote unquote bigger story may well be brexit even powell referred to it keep in mind the good old great empire is about less than 3 of world gdp these days so yes brexit matters but it doesn t matter as much as some other things out there similarly italy that was the sideshow mostly a show and sure there are going to be elections in the european union and sure the populists are going to get more votes but none of that really changes the global dynamics obviously what does happen on global scale are the trade discussions the general perception is there are solutions they re not going to happen there tomorrow and if you listen to draghi the head of the european central bank he says oh we downgraded our outlook but it s not that we think that we going to be negative outcomes to these many risk scenarios that s what draghi said he actually thinks there s going to be positive outcomes to most of them but because of the uncertainty the sentiment has been impacted so that s dragging on things and obviously the sentiment is impacted and that s the same danger with the u s consumer of course is that that might actually then induce slower growth all these risks that are out there they re solvable brexit most people believe we re not going to haunt brexit to kick the can down the road heard that term before that s what strong leaders are best at it seems the world will be around tomorrow in the meantime american consumers are happily spending mike gleason let s get your thoughts on what all of this might mean for precious metals can you give us a quick summary of what you re expecting in the metals market as we move through the year axel merk yes sure on gold which is kind of the easiest because of the least industrial influence that s difficult enough to prognosticate about you ve got these two forces on the one end i see rising inflationary pressures that s a positive i see at some point rates are going to go down as a discounting mechanism the market seems to be giving a boost here to precious metals now with that said i do think rates will move higher later this year the main buyer in gold that i see these days is one that buys for diversification when you have higher volatility cash flow gets discounted more that means the risk assets stock market in particular is under pressure potentially but gold historically does well when the stock market doesn t do well there are exceptions like the early 80 s bear market and that s when real interest rates went up to through the roof but it is for diversification because gold is really one of the easiest diversifiers i say easier rather than best necessarily because it has the zero correlation to stocks and it s far easier to do than some long short strategy that gives you an uncorrelated return otherwise if you go to other metals and other commodities of course the dynamics are far more complex that s why i really try to stick to gold especially on a brief analysis mike gleason my guest last week talked about how gold is hitting all time highs in many different currencies talk about the currency side of things the dollar what you re expecting there because obviously gold is trading in reverse correlation to the dollar in many situations not always but in many situations give us your thoughts there axel merk well on the day we re talking the dollar index is plunging other currencies are rising versus the dollar because of this very dovish commentary and statement by the fed and the question really is and the world was divided on that and that s great because we make the market where s it going to be heading from here we ve had years of dollar going up the u s was the cleanest of the dirty shirts and what not and it increasingly appears that the market is looking forward to the next easing cycle whereas the other parts of the world and i include the eurozone here they re still thinking we re on the hiking cycle we have sweden who also negative rates for example other than the eurozone they hiked rates draghi is retiring at the end of this year out of the ecb i happen to think that as both yellen and bernanke were more hawkish towards the end of their terms so will draghi be and draghi is actually quite positive in a medium term the successor to draghi cannot be as dovish in my view as draghi is and then i happen to think the glass is half full on some of these inflation metrics on that note by the way we have low oil prices at the end of last year if oil prices are not depressed any of this year the year over year effects will show quite significant headline inflation in the eurozone by the way headline inflation is the mandate in the u s it s core inflation but if you look at longer term inflation expectations they happen to be very correlated to the price of oil it may not make much sense because obviously in the long run the price of oil of today doesn t really matter but as those changes are filtering through i think inflation expectations will rise wage prices will lead to higher wages inflation expectations so all of that will get other leaders around also to be a tad more hawkish and it appears to be that is in favor of world currencies versus the dollar that just had such a great ride for several years and so it appears to me that this long bull run in the dollar might be over mike gleason well as we begin to wrap up her axel give us any final thoughts that you may have for us today or maybe touch on anything else that you may be focusing on that perhaps we didn t get to already and then ultimately what kind of year do you envision 2019 is going to be for investors expand on any or all of that as we begin to close please axel merk well the short of it is higher volatility higher rates warrant higher volatility and at the risk if using a technical term that means higher dispersion of risk let me expand on that just briefly when you have quantitative easing the perceived risk was taken out of the market so you invested in junk barns and it was quote unquote not risky because the fed took care of it now fear is back and the good news of that is that it matters where you put your money that means active management will come back that means the making a choice is actually going to prove you re right or wrong whereas before you just bought the index and everything was great that doesn t mean that suddenly all the money will go back to active managers i think that s going to be a long process but i would not be surprised of this year active managers are going to significantly outperform the industry simply because of greater opportunities there with the greater volatility reference the sharks but i just look at interest rates because when interest rates are higher there will be more opportunities i think for the active manager mike gleason well we ll leave it there thanks as always axel we certainly appreciate your getting your very studied insights and greatly appreciate your time coming on with us once again now before we let you go like we always do please tell folks a little bit

specific mining companies down the road as well mike gleason yeah i think many folks here would be interested in that well excellent axel thanks so much for your time we look forward to checking back

president trump s state of the union speech once again was chock full of stretched facts and dubious figures many of these claims have been fact checked repeatedly yet the president persists in using them here in the order in which he made them are nearly 30 statements by the president as is our practice with live events we do not award pinocchio rankings which are reserved for complete columns we have created 5 3 million new jobs and importantly added 600 000 new manufacturing jobs trump often inflates the number of jobs created under his presidency by counting from election day rather than when he took the oath of office there have been almost 4 9 million jobs created since january 2017 according to the bureau of labor statistics of which 436 000 are manufacturing jobs according to the bls advertisement this is an impressive gain for almost two years under president barack obama about 900 000 manufacturing jobs were gained over seven years from the 2010 nadir after the great recession moreover despite the recent gains the number of manufacturing jobs is still nearly 1 million below the level at the start of the great recession in december 2007 wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades wages rose 3 1 percent from december 2017 to december 2018 according to the labor department s employment cost index for civilian workers a widely watched measure of pay that does not take inflation into account that is the biggest increase not adjusted for inflation since the year that ended in december 2008 but adjusted for inflation wages for all workers grew 1 3 percent from december 2017 to december 2018 making the increase only the largest since august 2016 according to the labor department advertisement it s worth noting that although real wage gains were higher in 2015 and 2016 that was a period of almost no inflation so trump can claim some credit for decent real wage growth now with inflation back at about 2 percent the economic policy institute a left leaning think tank says nominal wage growth has been below a 3 5 percent target during the recovery but the white house argues that traditional economic measures do not fully capture increases in compensation such as bonuses and so real wages have actually increased even more than shown in the economic data nearly 5 million americans have been lifted off food stamps about 3 6 million people not nearly 5 million have stopped receiving food stamps since february 2017 according to the latest data but experts say the improvement in the economy may not be the only reason for the decline advertisement several states have rolled back recession era waivers that allowed some adults to keep their benefits for longer periods of time without employment reports have also suggested immigrant families with citizen children have dropped out of the program fearing the administration s immigration policies moreover the number of people collecting benefits has been declining since fiscal 2014 the u s economy is growing almost twice as fast today as when i took office and we are considered far and away the hottest economy anywhere in the world not even close trump accurately says the most recent numbers showing 3 4 percent gdp growth in the third quarter of 2018 are roughly twice the 1 8 percent rate from his first quarter in office but gdp growth fluctuates it has gone up and down and into negative territory and then up again since the end of the great recession advertisement gdp growth has averaged 2 8 percent per quarter so far in trump s presidency not much higher than obama s average of 2 1 percent for his two terms in office trump has seen growth top 4 percent in one quarter but obama topped it three times during his term and in one quarter topped 5 percent unemployment has reached the lowest rate in half a century african american hispanic american and asian american unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded this is all in the past the bureau of labor statistics reported on friday that the unemployment rate increased to 4 percent in january the unemployment rate in december was no longer at a 49 year low but an 18 year low now it is merely the best since the beginning of 2018 the african american unemployment statistic has been in existence for less than 50 years it reached a low of 5 9 percent in may 2018 but rose to 6 8 percent in january the hispanic american unemployment statistic has been in existence for less than 50 years it reached a low of 4 4 percent in 2018 but rose to 4 9 percent in january the asian american statistic has been around for less than 20 years and while it reached a low of 2 1 percent in may 2018 it rose to 3 2 percent rate in january advertisement more people are working now than at any time in our history 157 million this is a pretty meaningless statistic the u s population is growing so of course more people would be employed we virtually ended the estate or death tax on small businesses ranchers and family farms this is an enormous stretch trump often claims he saved family farms and small businesses by gradually reducing the federal estate tax reducing the estate tax primarily benefits the wealthy the estate tax rarely falls on farms or small businesses since only those leaving behind more than 5 million pay it according to the tax policy center nearly 5 500 estates in 2017 out of nearly 3 million were subject to the tax of those only 80 taxable estates would be farms and small businesses we have unleashed a revolution in american energy the united states is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world advertisement the notion that a revolution in energy began under the trump administration is wrong the united states has led the world in natural gas production since 2009 crude oil production has been increasing rapidly since 2010 reaching record levels in august 2018 according to u s energy information administration data in september 2018 the united states passed both russia and saudi arabia to become the largest global crude oil producer it is expected to hold that position according to predictions from the international energy agency and now for the first time in 65 years we are a net exporter of energy the united states is not yet a net energy exporter although the energy information administration estimates it will become one in coming years trump overstates the impact of his energy policy advertisement correction we previously said the united states has been a net energy exporter since 2015 trump s claim is still inaccurate one in three women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north the white house attributes the 1 in 3 estimate to a 2017 report by doctors without borders but there s less to that number than meets the eye trump states as a fact that 1 out of 3 women traveling through mexico are sexually assaulted but the report did not conduct a random sample survey that could be applied to all migrant women instead the group interviewed nearly 500 people whom its doctors treated of those people 12 percent were women so the statistic is derived from the experiences of 56 women and cannot necessarily be considered representative of all migrant women in the interviews 31 4 percent of women said they were sexually abused on the journey not sexually assaulted as trump says considering only rape and other forms of direct sexual violence 10 7 percent of the women who were interviewed said they were affected during their journey advertisement the lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety security and financial well being of all americans we have a moral duty to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens by any available measure there is no new security crisis at the border apprehensions of people trying to cross the southern border peaked most recently at 1 6 million in 2000 and have been in decline since falling to just under 400 000 in fiscal 2018 the decline is partly because of technology upgrades tougher penalties in the wake of the 9 11 terrorist attacks a decline in migration rates from mexico and a sharp increase in the number of border patrol officers the fiscal 2018 number was up from just over 300 000 apprehensions at the u s mexico border for fiscal 2017 the lowest level in more than 45 years there are far more cases of travelers overstaying their visas than southern border apprehensions in fiscal 2017 the department of homeland security reported 606 926 suspected in country overstays or twice the number of southern border apprehensions in fiscal 2016 u s officials reported 408 870 southern border apprehensions and 544 676 suspected in country overstays the big issue at the southern border waves of thousands of central americans running from poverty and violence in their home countries and seeking entry to the united states but here s the catch any wall would be built a mile or so inland from the border many of those attempting to immigrate are central americans seeking asylum to petition for asylum a person needs to be on u s soil under current law so in theory immigrants could cross the border and file a legally valid petition for asylum before reaching trump s wall the incentive would still exist and so would the visa overstays president trump described immigration at the southern border as a tremendous onslaught and called on congress to protect our homeland on feb 5 video the washington post photo ricky carioti the washington post meanwhile working class americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration reduced jobs lower wages overburdened schools hospitals so crowded you can t get in increased crime and a depleted social safety net trump exaggerates the link between immigration and crime almost all research shows legal and illegal immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than the native born population in general economists say illegal immigration tends to affect less educated and low skilled american workers the most which disproportionately encompasses black men and recently arrived low educated legal immigrants including latinos the consensus among economic research studies is that the impact of immigration is primarily a net positive for the u s economy and to workers overall especially over the long term according to a comprehensive 2016 report by the national academies of sciences engineering and medicine on the economic impacts of the u s immigration system studies on the impact of immigration showed the seemingly paradoxical result that although larger immigration flows may generate higher rates of unemployment in some sectors overall the rate of unemployment for native workers declines the border city of el paso texas used to have extremely high rates of violent crime one of the highest in the country and considered one of our nation s most dangerous cities now with a powerful barrier in place el paso is one of our safest cities trump appears to be echoing comments he heard from texas attorney general ken paxton on jan 10 but this claim is wrong the el paso times in a fact check said some form of barrier has existed between el paso and ciudad juÃ¡rez mexico for decades though trump appeared to be referring to fencing that was completed in mid 2009 looking broadly at the last 30 years the rate of violent crime reached its peak in 1993 when more than 6 500 violent crimes were recorded between 1993 and 2006 the number of violent crimes fell by more than 34 percent and less than 2 700 violent crimes were reported the border fence was authorized by bush in 2006 but construction did not start until 2008 from 2006 to 2011 two years before the fence was built to two years after the violent crime rate in el paso increased by 17 percent the city had the third lowest violent crime rate among 35 u s cities with a population over 500 000 in 2005 2006 and 2007 before construction of a 57 mile long fence started in mid 2008 tens of thousands of innocent americans are killed by lethal drugs that cross our border and flood into our cities including meth heroin cocaine and fentanyl most drugs come into the united states across the southern border with mexico but a wall would not necessarily stanch the flow as much of these drugs are smuggled through legal ports of entry or underground tunnels trump mentioned meth heroin cocaine and fentanyl but leaves out that the death toll from drug abuse is mostly attributable to prescription and illicit drug overdoses which claim more lives than cocaine and heroin overdoses combined the savage gang ms 13 now operates in at least 20 different american states and they almost all come through our southern border we are removing these gang members by the thousands but until we secure our border they re going to keep streaming back in trump mentions 20 different states but experts say ms 13 is concentrated in three areas los angeles long island and the washington area his claim that ms 13 members are being removed by the thousands is dubious the trump administration is deporting hundreds of ms 13 members per year u s immigration and customs enforcement said it deported 1 332 members of ms 13 in fiscal 2018 and another 1 000 or so in the previous year fiscal 2017 which included part of obama s term in the last two years our brave ice officers made 266 000 arrests of criminal aliens including those charged or convicted of nearly 100 000 assaults 30 000 sex crimes and 4 000 killings these figures involve a mix of serious and nonviolent offenses such as immigration violations notice how trump switches quickly from the total for arrests over two years to the total for charges and convictions nearly 100 000 assaults 30 000 sex crimes and 4 000 killings these numbers for arrests and charges are apples and oranges by switching from one to the other trump confuses the issue and exaggerates the criminality in many cases the people arrested face multiple counts furthermore not all charges result in convictions my administration has sent to congress a common sense proposal to end the crisis on our southern border it includes humanitarian assistance more law enforcement drug detection at our ports closing loopholes that enable child smuggling and plans for a new physical barrier or wall to secure the vast areas between our ports of entry actually trump s proposal would not provide humanitarian assistance to central american children the purpose of his plan is to dissuade these children from attempting the trip to the united states but they could still be in danger in their home countries for many of them that s the whole point of seeking asylum in the united states escaping violence and poverty in the northern triangle of central america trump has proposed barring all minors from el salvador guatemala and honduras from being able to present asylum claims in person to u s officials at the border or in other parts inside the united states this could have a huge effect since thousands of such children show up each month at the border and claim asylum trump s proposal would limit asylum grants to minors from these three countries at 15 000 a year provided they apply while remaining in another country it would also impose a new fee for their asylum applications remove judicial review of asylum decisions by administration officials require that these minors already have a qualified parent or guardian in the united states and other limitations san diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in the country in response a strong security wall was put in place this powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings for san diego trump s comparison goes back 23 years to 1992 when a wall went up in that border area but the apprehension numbers are not just down in fenced parts of the border they re down everywhere including in border sections without these barriers u s customs and border protection officials reported 1 6 million southwest border apprehensions for fiscal 2000 in fiscal 2017 cbp reported nearly 304 000 that s an 81 5 percent decline overall according to the nonpartisan congressional research service the san diego fence that trump mentioned by itself did not have a discernible impact on the influx of unauthorized aliens coming across the border all americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before as a raw number this was correct in december it dropped slightly in january but it mainly reflects the increasing size of the u s population the number of overall workers is also at a high the more relevant figure the labor participation rate of women is not at a record high it stands at 57 5 percent well below the 60 3 percent reached in april 2000 therefore we recently imposed tariffs on 250 billion dollars of chinese goods and now our treasury is receiving billions of dollars treasury data show that there was an increase of 6 7 billion in customs duties collected in the fiscal year that ended in september and it s possible most of the increase is due to tariffs but the exporters do not pay the tariffs it is the importer who in turn passes it on to consumers a study by the council on foreign relations estimated that 115 percent of the money raised from tariffs is being used by the administration to aid farmers hurt by the tariffs so it s a net loser our new u s mexico canada agreement or usmca will replace nafta and deliver for american workers bringing back our manufacturing jobs expanding american agriculture protecting intellectual property and ensuring that more cars are proudly stamped with the four beautiful words made in the usa trump claims that he significantly overhauled the north american free trade agreement nafta it s not a total trade revolution as trump promised but usmca does make changes to modernize trade rules in effect from 1994 to 2020 and it gives some wins to u s farmers and blue collar workers in the auto sector economists and auto experts think usmca is going to cause car prices in the united states to rise and the selection to go down some elements of the deal were borrowed from the trans pacific partnership the trade deal trump scrapped at the start of his term the next major priority for me and for all of us should be to lower the cost of health care and prescription drugs and to protect patients with preexisting conditions the trump administration has refused to defend the affordable care act against a lawsuit that would end protection for patients with preexisting conditions when the district court ruled against the law trump celebrated the ruling already as a result of my administration s efforts in 2018 drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years the consumer price index for prescription drugs fell by 0 6 percent for the 12 months ending in december according to the bureau of labor statistics the decline is the first time in 46 years in the december to december time frame but there have been other 12 month periods with index declines mostly recently in 2013 the trump administration has made it less costly for companies to apply for generic approvals the fda says it set a record for generic approvals in fiscal 2018 september through october 781 breaking the record of 763 set in the previous fiscal year lawmakers in new york cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother s womb moments before birth and then we had the case of the governor of virginia where he stated he would execute a baby after birth the debate over abortion has moved to the forefront in recent weeks as many state legislatures where a majority of residents are in favor of abortion rights are moving to incorporate the roe v wade standards into state law now all but seven states have prohibitions on gestational limits from 20 to 24 weeks or the point of viability a woman is considered to have reached full term when she is between 37 42 weeks indeed only 1 3 percent of abortions or about 8 500 a year take place at or after 21 weeks according to 2014 data from the centers for disease control and prevention and the guttmacher institute the legislation in new york would not have allowed a baby to be ripped from the mother s womb moments before birth it states that a health care practitioner may perform an abortion when according to the practitioner s reasonable and good faith professional judgment based on the facts of the patient s case the patient is within twenty four weeks from the commencement of pregnancy or there is an absence of fetal viability or the abortion is necessary to protect the patient s life or health the now tabled bill in virginia would have reduced the number of doctors from three to one required to agree that the continuation of the pregnancy is likely to result in the death of the woman or impair the mental or physical health of the woman it would have also removed the phrase substantially and irremediably from the section describing the required conditions for a woman to have an abortion in other words continuing pregnancy would no longer have to substantially and irremediably impair a woman s physical or mental health it would simply need to impair it lastly the bill would have removed the 24 hour waiting period the bill also specifies that measures of life support shall be available and utilized if there is evidence of viability virginia gov ralph northam d was widely criticized for his comments on the bill after he told a radio show that the procedures are done in cases where there may be severe deformities there may be a fetus that s not viable so in this particular example if a mother s in labor i can tell you exactly what would happen the infant would be delivered the infant would be kept comfortable the infant would be resuscitated if that s what the mother and the family desired and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother critics suggested the governor was endorsing infanticide his office later said the governor was referring to medical treatment not ending the life of a baby for years the united states was being treated very unfairly by nato but now we have secured a 100 billion increase in defense spending from nato allies nato secretary general jens stoltenberg said last summer that nato allies had spent 41 billion more toward defense since trump took office he said in an interview with fox news on jan 27 that nato allies will have added 100 billion extra toward defense by the end of 2020 but the effort to push nato members to spend more on defense began well before trump took office at the 2014 nato summit in wales the obama administration secured an agreement by member nations to aim to increase their spending on defense to 2 percent of each nation s gross domestic product within 10 years when i took office isis controlled more than 20 000 square miles in iraq and syria today we have liberated virtually all of that territory from the grip of these bloodthirsty killers although the islamic state may no longer control wide swaths of land in iraq and syria that does not mean the group is defeated two recent independent reports from the united nations and the center for strategic and international studies estimate that 20 000 to 30 000 isis militants may remain in iraq and syria the group was far weaker a decade ago when u s forces last withdrew from iraq then cia director john o brennan said the group had been pretty much decimated with maybe 700 or so adherents left in other words the group is far larger now than before the last withdrawal plus obama set up virtually all the structure that did the key fighting against the islamic state under trump and more fighters were trained and munitions dropped under obama than under trump trump s claim of capturing 20 000 square miles is technically correct but under obama all iraqi cities with the exception of the western half of mosul held by isis such as eastern mosul fallujah ramadi and tikrit were retaken by end of his term as was much of the northeastern strip of syria along the turkish border the basic plan of attack in 2017 was also developed under obama though trump sped up the tempo by changing the rules of engagement to ensure this corrupt dictatorship never acquires nuclear weapons i withdrew the united states from the disastrous iran nuclear deal although some parts of the joint comprehensive plan of action jcpoa sunset over time gradually allowing iran to pursue more nuclear energy research the deal includes this permanent restriction iran reaffirms that under no circumstances will iran ever seek develop or acquire any nuclear weapons cia director gina haspel last month testified to congress that iran was technically in compliance with the terms of the deal other international agreements to which iran has committed itself also prohibit the development of such weapons iran also has agreed to let international monitors peer closely into its nuclear activities however critics of the jcpoa have voiced concerns that despite these strictures iran could keep working toward nuclear weapons capability under the guise of pursuing peaceful goals such as a nuclear energy program trump is alluding to the fact that the jcpoa gradually lifts restrictions on the types of nuclear activities and the level of uranium enrichment iran may conduct these and other provisions sunset over 10 15 20 or 25 years the president argues that easing these restrictions over time would open the door to iran s attaining nuclear weapons capability rendering the jcpoa ultimately ineffective but supporters of the iran deal dispute that and say the jcpoa at least buys time subjecting iran to strong constraints on its nuclear activities for 10 to 25 years without the jcpoa and if it changed its current policy and chose to do so iran could hasten development of nuclear weapons on an even shorter timeline than the one trump found unacceptable they say during his 2019 state of the union speech president trump said he would meet north korean leader kim jong un in vietnam for a second summit video the washington post photo ricky carioti the washington post if i had not been elected president of the united states we would right now in my opinion be in a major war with north korea trump exaggerates the possibility of war which had been heightened by his own harsh rhetoric the president indicates that north korea has let up its nuclear activities since he and kim jong un signed a vague joint statement on denuclearization june 12 but experts say and satellite imagery indicates north korea continues to pursue a nuclear program the washington post reported that u s spy agencies are seeing signs that north korea is constructing new missiles at a factory that produced the country s first intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching the united states in a worldwide threat assessment issued jan 29 the intelligence community concluded north korea retains its wmd capabilities and the ic continues to assess that it is unlikely to give up all of its wmd stockpiles delivery systems and production capabilities north korean leaders view nuclear arms as critical to regime survival we continue to observe activity inconsistent with full denuclearization we have spent more than 7 trillion dollars in the middle east trump started making a version of this claim shortly after taking office first saying 6 trillion but then quickly elevating it to 7 trillion trump acts as if the money has been spent but he is referring to a brown university study that included estimates of future obligations through 2056 for veterans care the study combines data for both george w bush s war in iraq 2003 and the war in afghanistan 2001 which is in central south asia not the middle east it also includes nearly 1 trillion for homeland security spending the cost of the combined wars will probably surpass 7 trillion by 2056 when interest on the debt is considered almost four decades from now the scene during president trump s second state of the union address 47 delayed by a week because of the partial government

president donald trump delivered his second state of the union address on tuesday where he re enforced his immigration agenda slammed ridiculous partisan investigations and announced he would meet with north korea s kim jong un for a second time later this month nbc news fact checked his state of the union address as it happened claim trump s administration has created 600 000 manufacturing jobs trump s figure is close the u s has added 454 000 manufacturing jobs since trump took office in january 2017 some of the biggest gains in 20 years according to jobs data trump s numbers mark an acceleration of a trend that began in 2010 under president barack obama still after decades of automation and change to the industry in the u s manufacturing is a much smaller part of the country s economy than it was decades ago while 19 5 million people were employed in the manufacturing industry in 1979 there were 12 8 million americans in the industry in late 2018 claim trump says he launched an unprecedented economic boom in just over two years since the election we have launched an unprecedented economic boom a boom that has rarely been seen before trump said trump took office amid a booming economy and he s been taking credit for it since day one but there s no evidence he created this boom some economists argue he boosted growth with tax cuts turbocharging an already booming economy while others argue the government shutdown tariffs and trade war have slowed growth most can agree however that trump s economy something he touts among his biggest successes has been built upon the upward trajectory that began under obama and while america s economy is strong it has grown at a faster rate in earlier years in 1983 for example the nation s annual gdp was 7 9 percent in the second quarter of 2018 the gdp was 4 2 percent claim trump says unemployment is at its lowest rate in half a century trump s figure is accurate though it s notably a continuation of a strong growth trend begun after the recession ended in 2010 when unemployment ticked down to 3 7 percent in september 2018 that indeed marked the lowest jobless rate since december 1969 per the bureau of labor statistics but the jobless rate has since ticked back up to 4 0 in january which is above the 3 8 percent achieved in the clinton administration in april 2000 it s certainly true that the economy is in a much improved place now than it was a decade ago joblessness has steadily declined since the end of the economic recession in 2010 but it s a fuzzier picture when it comes to whether trump deserves credit for the low unemployment rate or whether he has continued a trend started by the obama administration in the 24 months since trump has been in office total non farm employment has grown by nearly 4 9 million over the same period of time 24 months at the end of obama s tenure total non farm employment grew by about 5 1 million claim trump boasts of energy revolution says u s is now no 1 producer of oil and natural gas trump said tuesday night that we have unleashed a revolution in american energy the united states is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world while it s true that u s is the leading producer of both oil and gas in the world the president is claiming undue credit that s been the case since the middle of the obama administration the u s energy information administration found that in 2017 the united states produced the most petroleum and dry natural gas of any country in the world but that s not a recent phenomenon either the u s has topped the production charts in both categories since 2013 for petroleum and 2011 for natural gas claim trump says nothing can compete with america s economy trump said tuesday night that there s nothing anywhere in the world that can compete with america before later saying the u s is experiencing an economic miracle while the u s economy has been strong overall it s not the fastest growing economy in the world and some argue that it s not actually the biggest either according to the international monetary fund s most recent estimates in its world economic outlook india is projected to have the highest rate of economic growth among major economies in 2019 and 2020 at somewhere around 7 5 to 7 7 percent gdp growth rate china is projected around 6 2 percent growth in 2019 and 2020 the united states meanwhile clocks in at just a 2 5 percent rate in 2019 and 1 8 percent in 2020 the united states does have the highest nominal gdp of any country in the world per the imf that measure does not take into account cost of living in various countries so many economists use also a measure called purchasing power parity which adjusts gross domestic product for lower consumer prices and standards of living using that measure china surpassed the united states as the biggest economy in the world back in 2014 claim trump takes credit for criminal justice reform both parties united for criminal justice reform they said it couldn t be done trump said tuesday night trump is correct that he signed the first major overhaul of prison sentencing in decades that legislation the first step act includes provisions for sentencing reform such as shortening some mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenses and addressing racial disparities in the federal prison system it s also true that lawmakers tried and failed to pass a similar package of reforms during obama s second term but it was republicans who blocked that bill despite general bipartisan support for the measure that consensus legislation was introduced by sen chuck grassley r iowa and sen dick durbin d ill in 2015 it had the support of then speaker of the house paul ryan the koch brothers and president barack obama but senate majority leader mitch mcconnell was reluctant to bring the issue up for a vote during the tumultuous 2016 election and a handful of gop lawmakers including sens tom cotton of arkansas and jeff sessions of alabama led the charge to argue that the bill would result in the release of violent criminals the bill never saw a vote during obama s presidency as a result in 2018 however trump with significant lobbying from his son in law jared kushner backed the bill prompting mcconnell to agree to bring the bill to the floor some advocates while still supportive of the effort argued that it does not go far enough for starters the bill only addresses the federal prison population which only makes up about 12 percent of incarcerated individuals in the u s claim trump says wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders trump underscored his pitch to address illegal immigration by claiming that wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards many democrats have called for reforming immigration enforcement in particular some have called for abolishing and rethinking immigration and customs enforcement but no prominent lawmakers have pushed for open borders democratic leaders amid the recent government spending fight that led to the longest shutdown in u s history consistently rejected trump s wall while still advocating for border security in general we all agree we need to secure our borders while honoring our values we can build the infrastructure and roads at our ports of entry we can install new technology to scan cars and trucks for drugs coming into our nation we can hire the personnel we need to facilitate trade and immigration at the border we can fund more innovation to detect unauthorized crossings house speaker nancy pelosi d calif said in january and while a meme shared by conservatives on social media alleged there is a wall around pelosi s california home and the president has asserted there is a wall around former president barack obama s washington home there is no wall encircling either the front of the obamas home is easily visible in photos and the walled off house pictured in the meme is not actually pelosi s politifact reported rating the claim pants on fire according to the washington post the obamas did add fencing and a guard booth former presidents have secret service protection for life claim trump says the state of the southern border is lawless threatening the security of all americans america s immigration system is broken that s something experts advocates and politicians across the spectrum can agree on but there s little evidence the southern border is experiencing a new state of emergency violence isn t spilling over the border and terrorists aren t being caught in droves trying to cross it illegal drugs largely come through legal ports of entry not unguarded parts of the border according to border authorities illegal border crossings have been dropping for years and while border apprehensions have risen in recent months they are still markedly lower than they were twenty years ago customs and border protection data shows and though trump has focused on the border illegal immigration in the u s is being driven by another factor people who overstay their visas more than 701 900 people overstayed their visas during fiscal year 2017 according to the department of homeland security people who overstay their visas usually enter the country through an airport not from the border claim trump says democrats voted for border barriers in the past this is true but trump dismissed the wall legislation democrats supported as inadequate dozens of democrats including senate minority leader chuck schumer of new york did vote for the secure fence act of 2006 which authorized building a fence along about 700 miles of the border between the united states and mexico trump derided that fencing in 2016 as such a little wall such a nothing wall claim we re taking in billions off chinese goods with tariffs trump vowed to right calamitous trade policies and said he is making it clear to china the theft of american jobs and wealth has come to an end he continued therefore we recently imposed tariffs on 250 billion of chinese goods and now our treasury is receiving billions of dollars the president portrays this as an american victory over foreign companies and while the u s government is taking in billions of dollars in tariffs it s not the chinese who are paying the bulk of these it s american consumers experts told nbc news in december that trump was misunderstanding tariffs the fee charged on foreign goods when they are imported american consumers typically end up footing the bill for those taxes not foreign companies while one expert said there is some evidence that chinese corporations may be reducing prices to absorb a fraction of the tariffs to stay more competitive in american markets consumers are expected to absorb the bulk of the fee claim san diego proves walls work to combat illegal immigration trump says when trump argues that the united states needs a wall along the southern border he likes to point to san diego s success san diego used to have the most illegal border crossing in the country trump said tuesday night in response a strong security wall was put in place this powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings the militarized border touching the communities of imperial beach san ysidro and otay mesa contributed to a 75 percent decline in crossings in the years immediately after fencing was installed in the 1990s according to u s customs and border protection data there double and triple barriers fortify the westernmost stretch of the nearly 2 000 mile u s mexico border as u s border patrol agents drive suvs along frontage roads and hover overhead in helicopters the hardened border however pushed migrants to remote areas that are more dangerous those experts contended arizona has become a hotbed of crossings but migrants often die of dehydration the mountains east of san diego have also become a crossing zone where migrants have died from hypothermia claim trump says drug prices have declined in 2018 already as a result of my administration s efforts in 2018 drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years trump said on tuesday the president first said drug prices would start dropping in may but an associated press investigation of drug prices in the first half of the year found that overall prices are still on the rise over the first seven months of 2018 the ap found that there were 96 price hikes for every price cut there were fewer price increases from january through july 2018 than during comparable time frames in years past but companies still hiked prices significantly more than they cut them at the end of may the president announced that drug companies would be voluntarily slashing prices within two weeks in the two months after that there were 395 price increases and 24 decreases in an interview with the ap at the time health secretary alex azar said that it would be awhile before drug prices actually fall he credited the complexity of the medicine market and incentives for drugmakers to boost prices in order to boost profits claim nafta was a historic blunder for america trump in urging congress to support his new trade agreement said he had met men and women across the country whose dreams were shattered by nafta there are many estimates for job losses due to the clinton era north american free trade agreement nafta but millions is higher than the number calculated by most groups from across the ideological spectrum robert e scott of the pro labor economic policy institute found that about 851 700 u s jobs were displaced by the u s trade deficit with mexico between 1993 shortly before nafta was implemented and 2014 that s a data point that was cited by bernie sanders during his 2016 campaign when he frequently decried job losses due to nafta a 2014 peterson institute for international economics study found that while nafta has caused about 203 000 jobs to be displaced by nafta related imports annually imports support 188 000 new jobs leading to a net loss of only about 15 000 annually and the nonpartisan congressional research service wrote in 2017 that in reality nafta did not cause the huge job losses feared by the critics or the large economic gains predicted by supporters the net overall effect of nafta on the u s economy appears to have been relatively modest primarily because trade with canada and mexico accounts for a small percentage of u s gdp claim trump says new york allows abortion moments before birth there could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a mother holding her infant child than the chilling displays our nation saw in recent days trump said speaking out against abortion that occurs later in pregnancy lawmakers in new york cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother s womb moments before birth this is false the state recently passed a law loosening restrictions on abortions in the state allowing abortions after 24 weeks if the fetus is not viable or when it s necessary to protect the life of the mother the president paints the picture of a healthy mother and child but an abortion would not be legal in that scenario after 24 weeks in new york state democratic gov andrew cuomo has pushed back at critics noting that it is just a mirror of the federal law the abortion rights enshrined in the supreme court decision roe v wade what s more abortions later in pregnancy are exceedingly rare the centers for disease control reports that just 1 3 percent of abortions in the u s in 2015 took place in or after the 21st week claim virginia gov ralph northam stated he would execute a baby after birth speaking about abortion trump said we had the case of governor of virginia where he stated he would execute a baby after birth a spokesman for the governor ralph northam disputed this characterization of confusing remarks he made days ago and it should be noted that northam was discussing a hypothetical procedure that would occur only in cases of severe deformities or nonviable pregnancy nonetheless northam caused a firestorm when he responded to a hypothetical question related to a proposed state law that would have made it somewhat easier for a woman to obtain an abortion later in a pregnancy for medical reasons asked on a radio program what happens when a woman who is going into labor desires a third trimester abortion northam noted that this kind of procedure only occurs in cases of severe deformities or a nonviable pregnancy he said that in this scenario the infant would be resuscitated if that s what the mother and the family desired and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother it s worth noting that the proposed virginia law which failed to pass the republican controlled legislature wasn t proposing legalizing abortions in the third trimester that is already legal in the state the bill proposed changing the number of physicians required for that kind of abortion s approval from three to one doctor it also proposed broadening the list of health concerns that would allow a woman to seek approval for such an abortion claim over the last two years we have begun to fully rebuild the united states military despite trump s frequent discussion of restoring and rebuilding america s military might the most recent legislation he signed to fund national defense came in at less than an obama signed bill in 2011 for fiscal year 2019 trump has signed into law national defense authorization legislation that provides 716 billion for national defense operations including 639 billion for the pentagon that s a smaller dollar number than the 726 billion provided by the 2011 national defense authorization act it s not clear yet what trump will ultimately propose for defense spending in fiscal year 2020 in a tweet on dec 4 he appeared to decry the amount of spending on defense saying the u s spent 716 billion dollars this year crazy he s referring to the same bill he signed into law but days after reports that he wanted to slash future spending to 700 billion the administration signaled that trump would instead agree to a request from then defense secretary jim mattis to boost that number to 740 billion claim trump says venezuela s collapse is a result of socialist policies since the swearing in of president nicolÃ¡s maduro whom much of the international community has called illegitimate many conservative critics have blamed the country s 21st century socialism for the unrest and protests in the country trump on tuesday night said that maduro s socialist policies have turned that nation from being the wealthiest in south america into a state of abject poverty and despair but it s a more complicated picture than just the s word the corruption of venezuelan leaders and the country s near complete dependence on oil are also important components of the country s downfall after maduro s predecessor hugo chÃ¡vez became president in 1999 he worked to use oil revenues from the then booming industry to fund national programs but when oil prices began to collapse in 2014 shortly after chÃ¡vez died and maduro took over the country lacked funds for those programs u s sanctions on the oil industry a result of charges of corruption and human rights abuses by venezuelan leaders have been another blow to the economy francisco toro a venezuelan journalist and an official with the latin american business organization group of 50 wrote in a washington post opinion article last year that all venezuela demonstrates is that if you leave implementation to the very worst most anti intellectual callous authoritarian and criminal people in society socialism can have genuinely horrendous consequences toro and others have pointed out that other countries with leftist or socialist leaning governments like denmark or sweden have not experienced similar unrest claim north korea hasn t tested a missile in 15 months our hostages have come home nuclear testing has stopped and there has not been a missile launch in 15 months much work remains to be done but my relationship with kim jong un is a good one trump said while trump is correct that north korea has not launched a missile in 15 months there s ample evidence that north korea is seeking to retain and hide their nuclear capabilities contradicting the president s past claims that he s made great progress in getting pyongyang to give up their nuclear weapons director of national intelligence dan coats said last week that it s unlikely north korea will try to denuclearize and the regime appears to be working to hide their efforts as nbc news reported on jan 21 researchers funded by the defense think tank center for strategic and international studies have discovered an undisclosed secret ballistic missile base in north korea and that there could be as many as 20 north korea has also refused to provide a detailed list of its nuclear and missile facilities despite the u s calls for it to do so a former senior u s official who has been briefed on the negotiations told nbc news that i can t find anybody in the u s who thinks the north koreans are denuclearizing vice president mike pence conceded earlier this month that the u s is still await concrete steps by north korea to dismantle the nuclear weapons that threaten our people and our allies in the region claim trump says u s has liberated virtually all of iraq and syria from isis it s accurate for trump to say that isis can claim just a fraction of the territory it once did all but about 1 percent of the territory that isis once controlled is now gone according to brett mcgurk the now former special presidential envoy to the coalition to defeat isis in syria and iraq but the center for strategic and international studies estimates that while islamic state territorial control has been reduced to minor pockets of rural iraq the group was still carrying out an average of 75 attacks per month in 2018 and in the annual worldwide threat assessment released in january u s intelligence officials concluded that isis still commands thousands of fighters in iraq and syria and it maintains eight branches more than a dozen networks and thousands of dispersed supporters around the world despite significant leadership and territorial losses one such attack is particularly raw four americans were among those killed by an explosion in manbij syria on january 16 isis claimed responsibility for that attack additionally military officials have warned that without sustained pressure from the u s isis could regain that lost territory in january nbc news reported on a draft pentagon report warning that isis is intent on reconstituting a physical caliphate and that the terror group could retake lost land in six to 12 months if there is no military pressure preventing them from doing so nobody is declaring mission accomplished in the fight against isis mcgurk said in early december then after trump announced on dec 19 that u s troops would withdraw from syria tweeting that isis had been defeated mcgurk resigned defense secretary jim mattis also resigned in the wake of that decision claim 1 in 3 women is sexually assaulted on the journey to america while it s difficult to estimate the rates at which it occurs it s true that sexual violence is a reality for many female migrants one amnesty international publication in 2010 reported that it is the widely held view of non profit and medical workers that as many as six in 10 migrant women are raped trump s estimate appears to be based on a may 2017 report by doctors without borders which found that about one third of female migrants out of a survey of 467 migrants total had experienced sexual abuse during their journey claim trump says we have more women serving in congress than at any time before trump earned big applause for this line we have more women serving in congress than at any time before he s correct but it s also true that those women are overwhelmingly democrats in fact the share of republican women in the house has gone down since the last congress according to the center for american women and politics at rutgers university of the 127 female voting members of the house and senate in the chamber tonight 106 are democrats and just 21 are republicans in fact in the house the share of republican women actually decreased from last congress to this one last congress there were 23 republican women serving in the house as voting members that s down to just 13 this congress the overall breakdown of female voting members is house 89 democrats 13 republicans senate 17 democrats 8 republicans claim trump says he s sending another 3 750 troops to the u s border this is true though those troops won t all deploy at the same time the department of homeland security request for assistance was approved in january by acting defense secretary patrick shanahan who agreed to send 3 750 more troops to string concertina wire man surveillance cameras and provide some airlift support however they won t all deploy to the border at once there will be an influx of about 2 000 to string 160 miles of concertina wire but then the number will go back down as the mission turns to manning surveillance cameras and supporting customs and border protection in other ways there are about 2 400 active duty there now and more will begin to deploy in mid february still the total deployed there is not expected to surpass about 4 400 at this point claim trump says mexican cities are paying for migrants to journey to u s in a section discussing illegal immigration trump said that mexican cities in order to remove the illegal immigrants from their communities are getting trucks and buses to bring them up to our country in areas where there is little border protection trump seems to be referring to a group of about 2 000 migrants who arrived at the port of entry in eagle pass texas this group made much of their journey by bus and a handful of cities and towns they passed through in mexico paid for the buses because they were not equipped to care for the immigrants however it s not clear what trump meant when he said there is little border protection texas sent state patrolmen and women to eagle pass today as reinforcements where federal and local law enforcement also had a larger than usual presence according to local news reports there is patrol at all times through the area so it s just a little heavier today than usual eagle pass mayor ramsey cantu told reporters on tuesday according to the local abc news affiliate department of homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen said that dhs will take all steps to ensure the safety of law enforcement personnel at the border claim the economy is growing twice as fast today as when trump took office the u s economy is growing almost twice as fast today as when i took office trump said tuesday night this is true when trump took office the rate of gdp growth was 1 8 percent for the first quarter of 2017 in the third quarter of 2018 the most recent data available it was 3 4 percent claim tens of thousands of americans are killed by drugs coming across the border it s correct that lethal drugs do come across the border and drug overdose deaths are up among men women all races and adults of nearly all ages according to the centers for disease control and prevention in 2017 70 237 people died from an overdose but trump in pushing for a border wall tends to ignore that the vast majority of hard drugs from mexican cartels come into the u s through legal ports of entry which wouldn t be affected by a wall according to a 2015 national drug threat assessment by the dea mexican drug cartels transport the bulk of their drugs over the southwest border through ports of entry poes using passenger vehicles or tractor trailers the drugs are typically secreted in hidden compartments when transported in passenger vehicles or commingled with legitimate goods when transported in tractor trailers in the 2018 version of the same publication dea said the most common method employed by these involves transporting illicit drugs through u s poes in passenger vehicles with concealed compartments or commingled with legitimate goods on tractor trailers the trump administration knows this then department of homeland security secretary john kelly who went on to become white house chief of staff until december 2018 said in april 2017 that illegal drug traffic mostly comes through the ports of entry claim trump says u s has more women in the workforce than ever before it s true that there are more women in the workforce than ever before but that s the continuation of a long term trend the bureau of labor statistics estimated in january that there were about 74 9 million women in the workforce but that number has long been trending upward and the overall growth of the u s population means that the raw number of women in the workforce has increased nearly every year since at least the early 1980s except for in years during which the country experienced a recession perhaps another metric to measure women s participation in the workforce would be the women s unemployment rate the unemployment rate for women over 16 stood at 3 9 percent in january that was up slightly from a low of 3 6 percent in may and september of last year but as with unemployment overall women s unemployment has been falling since the end of the recession claim trump says border fencing made el paso safer the border city of el paso texas used to have extremely high rates of violent crime one of the highest in the country and considered one of our nation s most dangerous cities trump claimed in his address now with a powerful barrier in place el paso is one of our safest cities in fact el paso s crime rate had been dropping for years when construction on border fence began in 2008 however the crime rate actually rose during construction and in the year after completion of a fence according to an analysis of fbi crime data by the el paso times the city s democratic sheriff richard wiles disputed trump s characterization as falsehoods used to justify the building of a 2 000 mile wall the facts are clear while it is true that el paso is one of the safest cities in the nation it has never been considered one of our nation s most dangerous cities wiles said in a statement provided to nbc news and el paso was a safe city long before any wall was built president trump continues to give a false narrative about a great city that truly represents what this great nation is all about claim trump says countless americans are murdered by criminal illegal aliens there isn t good data on homicides specifically in the united states but there s no evidence that immigrants commit more crimes than american born residents previous empirical research shows that immigrants do not increase local crime rates are less likely to cause crime than their native born peers and are less likely to be incarcerated than native born americans according to the libertarian leaning cato institute trump has previously circulated a claim backed by rep steve king r iowa that 63 000 americans have been killed by undocumented immigrants since 9 11 but that number has since been debunked politifact has extrapolated from existing data sources that the number of homicides committed by undocumented immigrants may fall between about 450 600 per year but again those are guesses not based on national data sources claim trump claims he s added 5 3 million jobs we have created 5 3 million new jobs trump said tuesday night this number needs context trump is taking credit for the job gains in the final months of his predecessor s administration starting the clock on job gains from his election not his inauguration since trump has been in office total nonfarm employment has grown by nearly 4 9 million the 5 3 million data point includes gains in between his election on nov 8 2016 and his inauguration on jan 20 2017
long before the u s and europe embraced radical monetary policies last decade during the global financial crisis there was the bank of japan twenty years ago this month back when the american economy was running hot under federal reserve chairman alan greenspan and the euro was making its debut on the world stage the boj adopted zero interest rates taking central banking into uncharted waters barely two years later while benchmark rates in the u s and europe were around 5 percent it doubled down with a quantitative easing program to flood the banking system with cash the boj s strategies were seen as both extreme and peculiar to japan that is until the 2008 financial markets conflagration and resulting economic contractions forced the federal reserve and the european central bank down similar paths

is president trump blowing up the deficit and dooming the economy trump s big tax cuts and spending increases have substantially widened the deficit the annual gap between government income and expenses to nearly 1 trillion lending fresh urgency to a debate that seemed to have vanished from the halls of congress in recent years some economists and think tanks say the red ink could ultimately crimp the economy by pushing up borrowing costs for americans and hampering the government s ability to spend in a crisis that could mar trump s economic legacy much as a big debt run up in the 1980s tainted president reagan s advertisement advertisement meanwhile the sum of all annual deficits and surpluses the national debt is an eye popping 21 trillion the ratio of national debt held by the public which excludes things like social security to gross domestic product is at 78 percent the highest level in 70 years according to the center for a responsible federal budget a nonpartisan nonprofit group the 35 day partial government shutdown resolved at least temporarily on jan 25 raised questions about whether a divided congress can pass a new spending deal this year that begins to tackle the budget gap in early january fitch ratings warned that a failure to grapple with the deficit could eventually prompt it to lower the nation s credit rating a move that would roil markets and the economy given that the president and congress can t agree on simply keeping the government open there is little prospect they can agree on addressing the nation s fiscal problems says mark zandi chief economist of moody s analytics president donald trump is pictured speaking to reporters at the white house also placing renewed focus on the deficit the economic lift fueled by the republican tax and spending measures is expected to fade this year that s sparking questions about whether the lingering hangover higher deficits will ultimately slow or derail an economy already set to cool advertisement advertisement other analysts downplay any tangible economic impact from the deficit they note interest rates remain low and bondholders seem to have a limitless appetite for financing u s borrowing especially when other countries are far less financially stable even with a big deficit the u s is still a pretty good bet for bondholders says economist paul ashworth of capital economics i m not sure why people will start to panic in another month or two or in a year tax guide when to file and what big changes to expect planning your finances why you need to create a financial planning calendar for the year advertisement advertisement during the great recession of 2007 09 and its aftermath when president obama spearheaded a 787 billion stimulus to resuscitate the economy republicans in congress grumbled routinely about the mounting debt burden but many of those deficit hawks have receded from the spotlight the loudest house speaker paul ryan r wis retired last month after embracing the trump tax and spending laws some economists however says the calm may belie a coming storm i think of the deficit like climate change zandi says we know if we don t do something it s coming but we don t know when it s corrosive deficit approaches 1 trillion the budget deficit is expected to reach 900 billion in fiscal 2019 and hover at about 1 trillion or above for the next decade up from 779 billion last year according to congressional budget office projections at least 40 percent of the increase can be traced to the tax and spending measures trump vowed that the sweeping tax cut would pay for itself by generating more economic growth that swells government coffers advertisement advertisement but that hasn t happened the tax cut passed in late 2017 is expected to cost the government 1 84 trillion over the next decade according to the center for a responsible federal budget and the cbo while faster economic growth is forecast to generate about 570 billion in additional revenue that will be offset by higher interest payments on a bigger national debt the center says deficit projections over the next decade are unrivaled by any time in our nation s history save for world war ii and the immediate aftermath of the great recession house budget committee chairman john yarmuth d ky said at a hearing recently all told the tax and spending laws are poised to add 2 1 trillion to 4 7 trillion to the debt over 10 years depending on whether they re extended beyond their current terms and so the u s debt held by the public as a share of gross domestic product is expected to rise from 78 percent to 93 to 105 percent over the next decade without the legislation debt to gdp would have climbed to 89 percent over that period the budget responsibility center says to be sure other expenses such as social security medicare and interest on the debt are also big drivers of the deficit advertisement advertisement the tax and spending legislation just made things worse says michael peterson ceo of the peter g peterson foundation which addresses u s fiscal challenges like trump reagan slashed taxes and sharply increased military spending nearly tripling the debt to 2 8 trillion by the time he left office in 1989 some economists say the initiatives helped dig the economy out of a double dip recession in the early 1980s others say they helped stoke inflation fears and federal reserve interest rate increases that contributed to the 1990 91 recession rising interest rates what does the bigger deficit mean higher costs for americans when the government has to borrow to pay its bills it issues treasury notes as the supply of those bonds increases their prices fall and yields rise to attract more buyers assuming demand is steady as a rule of thumb each percentage point increase in the debt to gdp ratio boosts treasury yields by about 04 percent point zandi says advertisement advertisement a jump in debt to gdp from 89 percent to 105 percent could increase treasury rates by 0 64 percentage point and since 10 year treasury yields now 2 73 percent directly affect loans such as 30 year fixed mortgages a monthly payment on a 200 000 mortgage could rise by up to 77 that could hurt the housing market and the broader economy another reason treasury rates could increase is that uncle sam has borrowed so much money that bondholders begin to doubt whether the government can pay it back as a result they demand a higher interest rate to offset the bigger risk here s the good news the part of 10 year treasury rates known as the term premium which reflects the risk of default the risk bondholders take by locking in the rate for a decade and the fluctuating supply and demand of treasurys has been roughly stable at about negative 0 5 percent since mid 2017 the rest of the 2 73 percent 10 year rate reflects expectations for short term rates based mostly on federal reserve moves treasurys offer safe haven in other words treasury bonds are so coveted by domestic and foreign investors that they re willing to pay a premium to own them rather than demand a premium as is typically the case that negative 0 5 percent term premium has been little changed even after congress passed the tax and spending bills ashworth says advertisement advertisement the deficit has gone up but investors aren t asking for more he says they re asking for less why in an increasingly uncertain global economy in which countries like italy turkey and argentina face financial crises the u s economy is a beacon and treasurys remain a rock solid investment also the dollar serves as the world s reserve currency for international transactions and many countries store their dollars in treasury bonds treasurys have been a safe haven says charlie ripley senior investment strategist and bond analyst for allianz investment management it doesn t really appear to us that the increase in the deficit has had a material effect on treasury yields but a closer look reveals that passage of the tax and spending bills in late 2017 and early 2018 did nudge treasury rates higher in the following weeks by about 0 2 percentage point zandi says although rates retreated during the stock market turbulence late last year as investors bought more stable assets including treasurys treasury rates are slightly higher than they would be without the legislation zandi says in other words the monthly payment on that 200 000 mortgage costs about 25 more advertisement advertisement that s still a modest impact but experts say investors may not always have the same appetite or risk tolerance for treasurys especially if congress doesn t begin to tame the deficit or continues to let it balloon there s no credible argument for why we should be able to run deficits at unsustainable levels indefinitely says maya macguineas president of the federal budget responsibility center and fitch ratings senior director charles seville says it s a bit early to say that interest rates won t rise as the budget deficit widens will congress s hands be tied in next recession the other way the deficit can hurt the economy is by making it harder for congress to fund a new stimulus package in case of a recession which many economists predict will occur in 2020 advertisement advertisement typically deficits fall during strong economies as tax revenue rises and they increase in downturns as tax income falls and the government spends more on unemployment insurance and stimulus programs it s virtually unprecedented for deficits to be this high while the nation is enjoying a strong economy and no major war as it is today according to the budget responsibility center in fact the center says the white house and congress should be taking advantage of the healthy economy to whittle down the deficit you have so little room to respond during the next crisis macguineas says in reality though it s unlikely bond investors will hesitate to finance additional u s spending to combat another downturn ashworth says after all he says even if u s debt to gdp approaches 100 percent that s still well below 130 percent plus ratios in countries such as italy and

sink their teeth into mr lawler noted mr trump s focus remained on illegal immigration and his effort to build a wall along the southern border those that had been hoping that trump would offer fresh trade news with china were left empty handed he said concrete evidence of real progress in u s china trade talks is still lacking on bay street suncor energy inc shares will likely get some attention

downside in crude came prior to the release which unless it came in anticipating of a higher headline number would suggest traders were unmoved by the increase he said what may be concerning for the

america can t become great again without asia president xi jinping s announcement that china will accelerate its market opening to more american high tech goods and make greater efforts to protect foreign intellectual property is welcome news for american firms the stock market and global trade as a whole but we shouldn t confuse blips and trends advertisement the long term trajectory is clear asia is not just rising it is also decoupling from the us the past two decades have witnessed asia come out of its 1997 1998 financial crisis and rebuilding its economic fundamentals sufficiently to withstand the 2007 western financial crisis here are just a few metrics that indicate growing asian confidence and even self sufficiency from capital to capacity building asian countries generally have lower debt higher reserves trade weighted baskets all of the largest holdings of currency reserves are in asia japan and china have become the largest international creditors meanwhile asian central banks have boosted the liquidity of currency swap agreements and their governments have launched a new set of diplomatic frameworks such as the regional comprehensive economic partnership the belt and road initiative and the asian infrastructure investment bank local currency borrowing has displaced large outstanding us dollar debt obligations giving governments much more long term investment capacity with less concern for currency volatility not only have asia s developing economies thus weathered multiple taper tantrums the asian sphere of intensifying political and economic convergence stretches far beyond china from the gulf countries to japan and russia to australia this geographic asia is also the strategic asia with five billion people more than the rest of the world combined looking more toward each other than to europe or north america asia is not just rising it is also decoupling from the us advertisement there is currently 4 5 trillion annually traded in the northeast asian triangular among china japan and south korea and trade within asia represents more than 60 of total asian trade asia today is thus becoming what europe and north america already are a regional system in which members have more to do with each other than with states from other regions the great story of the 21st century is therefore not merely the rise of asia but the asianization of asia the obama administration attempted a pivot to asia its centerpiece being the trans pacific partnership tpp trade agreement which would have pried open asian markets further to american goods but with the trump administration pulling the us out of the tpp alienating its closest asian allies such as japan and south korea with his tariffs on steel and other vital goods it s not clear what america s role in asia will be in the decades ahead the return of afroeurasia asia in the 21st century most resembles asia of the 15th century the pre colonial era in which east asian empires indian dynasties arab caliphates indonesian maritime traders and mongolian steppe nomads all co existed in dynamic patterns of commerce conflict and cultural exchange before ferdinand magellan and the encroachment of portuguese spanish and dutch merchant navies asians ruled the indian ocean waves scholars of the more than thousand years of pre colonial history of this region refer to it as an afroeurasian realm of silk roads spanning land and sea with ethnic intermingling and trade networks spanning east africa to korea the trump administration s growing usage of the term indo pacific merely reflects the reemergence of this ancient reality advertisement the more trump digs in behind his america first campaign the more asians are wisely hedging against excessive dependence on the us market they are doing this by increasing trade with each other which is precisely what china japan and south korea agreed to last autumn unlike the us japan and south korea have relatively balanced trade with china south korea even has a significant surplus and while they are equally concerned with china s rapid moves up the value chain their strategy is to boost innovation and aggressively sell more into china it is worth noting that canada and mexico have enthusiastically joined tpp by the same logic despite their sizeable deficits with asian trade partners the tariff escalation between the us and china has convinced asians that they cannot rely on the us as a risk free supplier of critical goods the lesson chinese firms have taken away from trump s export controls on american firms is that they should permanently substitute american high tech imports with those from these nearer asian trading partners with whom they already trade more and have more leverage from semiconductors to soybeans permanent substitution has become asia s top priority indeed in the intervening years since chinese handset and telecom equipment manufacturers signed long term deals with qualcomm intel and other american firms china has decreased its dependency on us suppliers it now imports nearly 70 of its high tech goods from japan south korea taiwan singapore and europeans the logic of globalization dictates that the more trump tries to isolate china the more everyone else from canada to latin america and europe to japan will do their best to capture america s market share in china and asia more broadly advertisement from america first to america alone america first is not working for america retailers are raising the cost of goods to consumers and america s allies are gaining market share abroad at its expense america s manufacturing and agricultural sectors are going to feel the pain most acutely for reasons that pre date the trade war but will accelerate the longer it persists china s soybean importers now favor brazil and argentina leaving trump to spend taxpayer money bailing out american farmers the only consolation is that argentina has had to buy american soybeans and ship them onward to china in order to meet china s massive demand america s factory workers won t be so lucky since most american manufactured goods from steel and appliances to electronic equipment and aircraft can be much more readily substituted by competitors once foreigners stop buying american they re not likely to start again take the example of general motors at first asia was a bright spot for the us car manufacturer earlier this year gm recorded its highest level of car sales in china where car ownership is still expanding though not as rapidly as in recent years but with the recent headline that gm will be slashing thousands of jobs and closing several us plants gm will lack the capital to expand in asia to cope with demand and to keep pace with competition as companies from ford to chevy as well as european carmakers race ahead to capture the region s swelling electric car market advertisement american firms can only afford to employ more americans if they have strong global profits something that can t happen if american revenues in asia decline ge s plant closures and declining investment are no doubt a blow to trump s buy american agenda but he has only himself to blame tariffs on china have raised steel prices across the manufacturing sector while domestic demand is flat then there are the expanded rules of origin requirements in the new usmca agreement or nafta plus which were intended to benefit the auto sector but as the peterson institute points out these quotas will actually benefit cheaper steel and auto part manufacturers particularly from asia while reducing investment in the us and its neighbors there couldn t be a worse time to make access to asian markets harder for american firms asia is experiencing a surge in corporate patriotism from chinese smashing apple iphones in public and switching to huawei to grab taking over uber s operations across southeast asia and the luckin coffee chain challenging starbucks to succeed globally one has to manufacture and sell globally this is especially true given america s aging demographics weak infrastructure investment and saturated markets most fortune 500 american companies such as apple generate as much as half or even more of their global revenue from abroad the american market just isn t big enough as apple loses market share in asia to local competitors its market cap is feeling the pinch american manufacturing will continue to decline unless it embraces asia by going back to the tpp trade agreement and hope that china eventually joins it as well advertisement asia s decoupling is great news for asia but much less so for the us america s share of global trade will slide further below other regions on the one hand this reflects the fact that america does not need the rest of the world for its survival in geopolitics that is a blessed condition but in geoeconomics it means the us is actually much more dispensable than it thinks indeed china s most significant trade relationships are first and foremost other asians followed by europe with the us third most important from china s standpoint number three just launched a trade war against number one it has taken one short generation for asia to launch its decoupling from the us and the coming generation will witness even more couplings among asians themselves america first sounds like a great idea except when it actually means america alone this essay is adapted from the future is asian commerce conflict and culture in the 21st century simon schuster 2019 which came out this week

rate claim termination rate and other assumptions as a result of these updates the company increased ltc reserves by approximately 327 million pre tax resulting in an after tax charge to earnings of

testing were consistent with the updated assumptions used in the fourth quarter 2018 claim reserves these updated claim severity assumptions had a limited impact on the active life reserve margin

attributes of items unique to that segment such as foreign income the difference between the consolidated provision for income taxes and the sum of the provision for income taxes in each segment is reflected in corporate and other activities the company reports selected operating performance measures including sales and insurance in force or risk in force which are commonly used in the insurance industry as measures of operating performance management regularly monitors and reports sales metrics as a measure of volume of new business generated in a period sales refer to new insurance written

s u s mortgage insurance business is based on the coverage percentage applied to the estimated current outstanding loan balance the company considers insurance in force and risk in force to be measures of its operating performance because they represent measures of the size of its business at a specific date which will generate revenues and profits in a future period rather than measures of its revenues or profitability during that period management also regularly monitors and reports a loss ratio for the company s businesses for the mortgage insurance businesses the loss ratio is the ratio of benefits and other changes in policy reserves to net earned premiums the company considers the loss ratio to be a measure of underwriting performance in these businesses and helps to enhance

corporate activities and for certain other items see below for a summary of the other items not allocated to segments venezuela operations prior to the deconsolidation of our venezuelan subsidiaries effective june 30 2018 we excluded from our segment results all of our venezuela operating results due to the venezuelan government s restrictions that have prevented us from repatriating funds as a result the chief executive officer the company s chief operating decision maker codm has assessed segment performance and has made resource decisions by segment excluding venezuela operating results reorganization and restructuring 2016 restructuring in the fourth quarter of 2016 management implemented restructuring actions across our global business operations and our corporate functions as a result of these actions we recognized charges of 18 1 million in 2016 an additional 17 3 million in 2017 and 13 0 million in 2018 the actions under this program were substantially completed in 2018 with cumulative pretax charges of approximately 48 million other restructurings management routinely implements restructuring actions in targeted sections of our business as a result of these actions we recognized charges of 4 6 million in 2017 and 7 6 million in 2018 primarily severance costs for the current restructuring actions we expect to incur additional costs of up to 1 million in future periods due to the unique circumstances around these charges these management directed items have not been allocated to segment results and are excluded from non gaap results acquisitions and dispositions certain acquisition and disposition items that are not considered part of the ongoing activities of the business and are special in nature are consistently excluded from non gaap results these items are described below 2018 acquisitions and dispositions amortization expense for acquisition related intangible assets was 17 7 million in 2018 integration costs in 2018 related to

6 million related to acquisitions of new businesses in 2017 we recognized currency transaction gains of 1 8 million related to acquisition activity in 2017 argentina highly inflationary impact beginning in the third quarter of 2018 we designated argentina s economy as highly inflationary for accounting purposes as a result argentine peso denominated monetary assets and liabilities are now remeasured at each balance sheet date to the currency exchange rate then in effect with currency remeasurement gains and losses recognized in earnings in addition nonmonetary assets retain a higher historical basis when the currency is devalued the higher historical basis results in incremental expense being recognized when the nonmonetary assets are consumed in the second half of 2018 we recognized 8 0 million in pretax charges related to highly inflationary accounting including currency remeasurement losses of 6 2 million reporting compliance certain third party costs incurred related to the implementation and adoption of asu 2016 02 the new lease accounting standard effective for us january 1 2019 2 7 million and the mitigation of material weaknesses 1 8 million are excluded from non gaap results the brink s company and subsidiaries non gaap results reconciled to gaap unaudited in millions except for percentages and per share amounts non gaap results described in this press release are financial measures that are not required by or presented in accordance with u s generally accepted accounting principles gaap the purpose of the non gaap results is to report financial information from the primary operations of our business by excluding the effects of certain income and expenses that do not reflect the ordinary earnings of our operations the specific items excluded have not been allocated to segments are described in detail on pages 8 9 and in more detail in our form 10 k and are reconciled to comparable gaap measures below in addition we refer to non gaap constant currency amounts which represent current period results and forecasts at prior period exchange rates non gaap results adjust the quarterly non gaap tax rates so that the non gaap tax rate in each of the quarters is equal to the full year estimated non gaap tax rate the full year non gaap tax rate in both years excludes certain pretax and income tax amounts amounts reported for prior periods have been updated in this report to present information consistently for all periods presented the 2019 non gaap outlook amounts for provision for income taxes income loss from continuing operations eps from continuing operations effective income tax rate and adjusted ebitda cannot be reconciled to gaap without unreasonable effort we cannot reconcile these amounts to gaap because we are unable to accurately forecast the impact of highly inflationary accounting on our argentina operations or other potential non gaap adjusting items for which the timing and amounts are currently under review such as future restructuring actions the impact of highly inflationary accounting and other potential non gaap adjusting items could be significant to our gaap results the non gaap financial measures are intended to provide investors with a supplemental comparison of our operating results and trends for the periods presented our management believes these measures are also useful to investors as such measures allow investors to evaluate our performance using the same metrics that our management uses to evaluate past performance and prospects for future performance we do not consider these items to be reflective of our core operating performance due to the variability of such items from period to period in terms of size nature and significance additionally non gaap

dividend of 0 42 per share an increase of 17 and also approved a further share repurchase program of up to 2 0 billion financial results operating earnings suncor s fourth quarter 2018 operating earnings were 580 million 0 36 per common share compared to 1 310 billion 0 79 per common share in the prior year quarter the decrease was primarily a result of unfavourable western canadian crude oil differentials including a substantial widening of synthetic crude oil sco differentials which resulted in the following a decrease in oil sands price realizations partially offset by improved refining margins and an unfavourable first in first out fifo inventory valuation adjustment in r m on declining feedstock costs partially offset by a realization of intersegment profit on inventory in the corporate energy trading and eliminations segment other factors reducing operating earnings included the addition of operating and transportation costs for new production from growth projects and acquisitions a decrease in oil sands operations sco production lower overall exploration and production e p sales volumes and a decrease in the capitalization of borrowing costs these factors were partially offset by a recovery of share based compensation costs compared to an expense in the prior year quarter and increased overall upstream production driven by 94 plant utilization at fort hills record production at syncrude and the continued ramp up of operations at hebron net loss earnings the net loss was 280 million 0 18 per common share in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to net earnings of 1 382 billion 0 84 per common share in the prior year quarter in addition to the factors explained in operating earnings above net earnings for the fourth quarter of 2018 included a 637 million unrealized after tax foreign exchange loss on the revaluation of united states u s dollar denominated debt as well as a non cash impairment loss on one of the company s equity investments net earnings in the prior year quarter included a net 124 million deferred income tax recovery related to a decrease in the u s corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 an unrealized after tax foreign exchange loss of 91 million on the revaluation of u s dollar denominated debt after tax property damage insurance proceeds of 55 million an after tax loss of 18 million for early repayment of debt and a net after tax gain of 2 million on interest rate swaps associated with debt issued in the fourth quarter of 2017 funds from operations and cash flow provided by operating activities funds from operations were 2 007 billion 1 26 per common share in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 3 016 billion 1 83 per common share in the fourth quarter of 2017 and were influenced by the same factors impacting operating earnings noted above excluding the recovery of non cash share based compensation as well as unrealized gains on crude optimization activities cash flow provided by operating activities was 3 040 billion 1 90 per common share for the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 2 755 billion 1 67 per common share for the fourth quarter of 2017 with changes in non cash working capital representing a source of cash to the company in the fourth quarter of 2018 as compared to a use of cash in the prior year period the source of cash in the company s non cash working capital balances was primarily due to the declining crude price environment in the fourth quarter and the associated decrease in accounts receivable balances as well as the decline in refinery inventory value as the company replaced crude feedstock inventories purchased in the prior period with less expensive crude operating results suncor s total upstream production represents a new quarterly record at 831 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day boe d during the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 736 400 boe d in the prior year quarter with the increase primarily due to the addition of fort hills production improved reliability and an additional working interest at syncrude and the continued ramp up of operations at hebron fort hills achieved plant utilization of 94 for the quarter exceeding our accelerated target of 90 and production from syncrude was strong with the assets attaining a new quarterly record said mark little president and chief operating officer our refining assets continue to outperform due to continued reliability achieving a new quarterly throughput record and allowing us to maximize the impact of strong refining margins oil sands operations production was 432 700 bbls d in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 446 800 bbls d in the prior year quarter the decrease was primarily due to lower sco volumes as a result of planned and unplanned maintenance at upgrader 2 partially offset by an increased volume of non upgraded bitumen from the company s in situ properties with firebag and mackay river continuing to achieve solid reliability planned maintenance at upgrader 2 which commenced in the third quarter of 2018 was completed during the fourth quarter and the unplanned maintenance was resolved by the end of the quarter upgrader utilization in the fourth quarter of 2018 was 79 compared to 93 in the prior year period as a result of the maintenance discussed above oil sands operations cash operating costs per barrel were 24 50 in the fourth quarter of 2018 and were comparable to the prior year period of 24 20 with lower overall production being offset by lower operating selling and general expense after adjusting for non cash items suncor s share of production from fort hills averaged 98 500 bbls d for the fourth quarter of 2018 which represents 94 utilization as a result of the increase in production fort hills cash operating costs per barrel decreased to 24 85 in the fourth quarter of 2018 and were 31 20 for the year suncor s share of syncrude production was a record 209 600 bbls d in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 174 400 bbls d in the prior year quarter the increase in production was primarily due to strong reliability as well as the additional 5 working interest in syncrude acquired earlier in 2018 upgrader utilization at syncrude was 101 in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 94 in the prior year quarter syncrude cash operating costs per barrel were 31 75 in the fourth quarter of 2018 a decrease from 32 80 in the prior year quarter as a result of higher production production volumes at e p were 90 200 boe d in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 115 200 boe d in the prior year quarter in addition to natural declines the decrease in production was due to a temporary production interruption at the company s east coast canada assets as a result of a major storm system in the period as well as an unplanned outage at buzzard in the united kingdom partially offset by the addition of production from hebron the production interruption at the white rose field extended into 2019 with partial production restarting at the end of january 2019 refinery crude throughput achieved a new quarterly record of 467 900 bbls d and refinery utilization was 101 in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 432 400 bbls d and a utilization rate of 94 in the prior year quarter the increase was due to strong reliability at all of the company s refineries in addition to the prior year quarter being impacted by a third party power outage strategy update suncor s 2018 capital program was focused on improving the safety long term reliability and efficiency of the company s operating assets including execution of major turnarounds in addition to the effective and efficient ramp up at both of suncor s major growth projects fort hills and hebron the company spent 1 119 billion on capital expenditures excluding capitalized interest during the fourth quarter of 2018 a decrease from 1 444 billion in the prior year quarter primarily due to the decrease in growth capital with the commissioning of fort hills and hebron sustaining capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of 2018 were comparable to the prior year quarter we remain focused on capital discipline and ensuring safe and reliable operations across our business said williams through our integrated model and the value driven investments we ve made in our business suncor is well positioned to continue to grow production and cash flow and to increase returns to shareholders across a wide range of market conditions downstream integration continues to be a fundamental component of suncor s strategy and the overall impact of wider crude differentials in alberta was partially mitigated by a combination of improved refining margins driven by lower feedstock costs and the company s favourable market access position which allows a significant portion of bitumen sales to be moved to the u s gulf coast where higher prices are realized however due to the impact of the fifo method of inventory valuation the full benefit of lower feedstock costs at r m has not yet been realized due to the time lag associated with processing higher value crude inventory drilling activity at hebron is ongoing and production continues to ramp up the fourth production well came online during the fourth quarter and contributed to increased volumes other e p activity in the fourth quarter included development drilling at hebron hibernia white rose and buzzard and development work on the west white rose project and the norwegian oda and fenja projects development of the oda project has progressed ahead of schedule and first oil is now anticipated in the second quarter of 2019 as compared to the original target of the third quarter of 2019 during the fourth quarter of 2018 suncor and its joint venture partners reached an agreement in principle for interconnecting pipelines between syncrude s mildred lake site and suncor s oil sands base plant the lines will transfer bitumen and gas oils between the two plants providing increased operational flexibility and enabling higher reliability and utilization the pipelines are expected to be operational by the end of 2020 subject to finalized commercial terms and regulatory approval subsequent to the end of the quarter the company received 300 million in risk mitigation proceeds for its libyan assets approximately 260 million after tax the proceeds may be subject to a provisional repayment which is dependent on the future performance and cash flows from suncor s libyan assets following the approval from the board in the third quarter of 2018 to increase the company s share repurchase program from 2 15 billion to 3 0 billion the toronto stock exchange accepted a notice filed by suncor during the fourth quarter of 2018 to increase the maximum number of shares the company may purchase pursuant to its normal course issuer bid the increase to the program reinforces the company s ongoing ability to generate cash flow and return value to shareholders under suncor s expanded normal course issuer bid the company repurchased and cancelled 1 166 billion of its own shares in the fourth quarter of 2018 subsequent to the end of the quarter suncor s board of directors approved a further share repurchase program of up to 2 0 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018 suncor continued to return value to shareholders through dividends of 574 million and subsequent to the end of the quarter suncor s board of directors approved a quarterly dividend of 0 42 per share which represents an increase of 17 over the prior quarter dividend in addition during the fourth quarter as part of the company s commitment to debt reduction suncor repurchased us 83 million of 7 75 senior notes due in 2019 2019 notes that were acquired as part of the acquisition of canadian oil sands

rba governor philip lowe s address to the national press club of australia thank you for the opportunity to address the national press club it is an honour to have been invited the media and the rba have a special relationship most people in the community hear the rba s messages through the media you report on what we say you filter it and you critique it we also help you with your work the rba is a reliable source of information and analysis on issues that your audiences care about including interest rates housing prices and jobs this means we have a strong mutual interest in understanding one another i hope that today will help strengthen that understanding this is my first public speech for 2019 so i would like to talk about the year ahead and some of the key issues that the rba will be focusing on i will first discuss the global economy and then turn to the australian economy and particularly the outlook for household spending i will finish with a few remarks on the outlook for monetary policy at the outset i want to emphasise that we don t have a crystal ball that allows us to see the future with certainty i know many of you are looking for definitive answers to questions like where will the cash rate be this time next year how much will housing prices fall when will wages growth reach 3 per cent they are all good questions the reality though is that the future is uncertain none of us can say with certainty what will happen what the rba can do though is highlight the issues that are likely to shape the future explain how we are thinking about those issues and discuss how they fit into our decision making framework that is what i hope to do today the global economy i will start with the global economy because what happens overseas has a major bearing on what happens in australia my main point here is that while some of the downside risks have increased the central scenario for the world economy still looks to be supportive of growth in australia it is worth recalling that 2018 was a good year for the world economy growth in the advanced economies was above trend in the first half of the year unemployment rates reached their lowest levels in many decades inflation was low and financial systems were stable graph 1 these are positive outcomes we should not lose sight of this graph 1 there was though a change in momentum in the global economy late in the year this change was particularly evident in europe and it was also evident in china it has been widely reported in the media but it is important to keep things in perspective some slowing in global growth was expected given that labour markets are fairly tight and the policy tightening in the united states was aimed at achieving a more sustainable growth rate so i have been a little surprised at some of the reaction to the lowering of forecasts for global growth which has been quite negative we need to remember that the imf s central forecast is still for the global economy to expand by 3 5 per cent in 2019 and by 3 6 per cent in 2020 graph 2 if achieved these would be reasonable outcomes and not too different from the recent past graph 2 what is of more concern though is the accumulation of downside risks many of these risks are related to political developments the trade tensions between the united states and china the brexit issue the rise of populism globally and the reduced support from the united states for the liberal order that has supported the international system and contributed to a broad based rise in living standards one could add to this list the adjustments in china as the authorities rein in shadow financing the origins of these diverse issues are complex but there is a common economic element to some of them that is the extended period of little or no growth in real incomes for many people in a number of countries growth in real wages has been weak or negative for years advances in technology and greater competition as a result of globalisation also mean that many people worry about their own future and that of their children politicians understandably are responding to these concerns time will tell though whether the various responses help or not i suspect that some of them will not over recent months the accumulation of downside risks has been evident in business and consumer surveys it was also evident in increased volatility in financial markets around the turn of the year with declines in equity prices and an increase in credit spreads graph 3 since then though markets have been more settled and some of the earlier decline in equity prices has been reversed this has been partly on the back of a reassessment of the path of monetary policy in the united states with markets no longer pricing in further increases in us interest rates there has also been a noticeable fall in long term government bond yields graph 3 the adjustments in financial markets over our summer sometimes generated reporting that to me seemed overly excitable i lost count of how many times i read the words crash plunge and dive yet there is a positive side to some of these adjustments which gets less reported on the risks associated with stretched valuations in some equity markets have lessened so too have concerns that very low credit spreads could lead to an excessive build up of risk and risks in many emerging market economies have also receded helped by the lower global interest rates and lower oil prices so it is important to look at the whole picture for australia what happens in china is especially important growth there has slowed from a medium term perspective this has a positive side as it mainly reflects efforts to rein in risky financial practices and stabilise debt levels but the slowing is probably faster than the government had hoped for with the economy feeling the effects of the trade dispute with the united states and the squeezing of finance to the private sector the authorities have responded by easing policy in some areas but they are walking a fine line between supporting the economy and addressing the debt problem there is also the question of how the economy responds to the policy easing more broadly we cannot insulate ourselves completely from the global risks but keeping our house in order can go a long way to assist our floating exchange rate and the flexibility we have on both monetary and fiscal policies provide us with a degree of insulation so too does our flexible labour market ensuring that we have predictable and consistent economic policies credible public institutions and a reform agenda that supports a strong economy can also help in an uncertain world the domestic outlook i would now like to turn to the outlook for the australian economy much as is the case globally the downside risks have increased although we still expect the australian economy to grow at a reasonable pace over the next couple of years the australian economy is benefiting from strong growth in infrastructure investment and an upswing in other areas of investment the labour market is also strong with many people finding jobs this year we will also benefit from a further boost to liquefied natural gas lng exports the lower exchange rate and a lift in some commodity prices are also assisting against this generally positive picture the major domestic uncertainty is the strength of consumption and the housing market we will be releasing a full updated set of forecasts in the statement on monetary policy smp on friday close readers of the smp will notice that we will now be publishing forecasts for a wider set of variables than has previously been the case we hope that this helps people understand the various forces shaping the economy today i can give you a summary of the key numbers our central forecast is for the australian economy to expand by around 3 per cent over 2019 and 2Â¾ per cent over 2020 graph 4 for 2018 the outcome is expected to be a bit below 3 per cent this type of growth should be sufficient to see further gradual progress in lowering unemployment graph 4 these forecasts are lower than the ones we published three months ago for 2018 the outcome is affected by the surprisingly soft gdp number in the september quarter and the abs s downward revisions to estimates of growth earlier in the year we are expecting a stronger gdp outcome in the december quarter with other indicators of economic activity painting a stronger picture than suggested by the september quarter national accounts for 2019 and 2020 the forecasts have been revised down by around Â¼ percentage point largely reflecting a modest downgrading of the outlook for household consumption and residential construction i will talk more about this in a moment the outlook for the labour market remains positive the national unemployment rate currently stands at 5 per cent the lowest in over seven years graph 5 in new south wales and victoria the unemployment rate is around 4Â¼ per cent you have to go back to the early 1970s to see sustained lower rates of unemployment in these two states the forward looking indicators of the labour market also remain positive the number of job vacancies is at a record high and firms hiring intentions remain strong our central scenario is that growth will be sufficient to see a modest further decline in unemployment to around 4Â¾ per cent over the next couple of years graph 5 the other important element of the labour market is how fast wages are increasing for some time we have been expecting wages growth to pick up but to do so gradually the latest data are consistent with this with a turning point now evident in the wage price index graph 6 through our discussions with business we are also hearing more reports of firms finding it difficult to find workers with the necessary skills in time this should lead to larger wage rises this would be a positive development graph 6 given this outlook we continue to expect a gradual pick up in underlying inflation as spare capacity in the economy diminishes graph 7 however the lower forecast for growth means that this pick up is expected to occur a bit later than we d previously thought underlying inflation is now expected to increase to about 2 per cent later this year and to reach 2Â¼ per cent by the end of 2020 the latest cpi data were consistent with this outlook the headline cpi number was however a bit lower than we had previously expected reflecting the decline in petrol prices that started late last year we expect headline inflation to decline further this year as the full effect of lower petrol prices shows up in the figures graph 7 so that is the summary of the key numbers as always there is a range of uncertainties many of which will be discussed in the smp on friday today though i would like to focus on the outlook for household spending which is closely linked to the housing market and the prospects for growth in household income before i do that i would like to touch on one related uncertainty that we have been paying attention to that is the supply of credit this is because a strong economy requires access to finance on reasonable terms over recent years there has been a needed tightening of credit standards but the right balance needs to be struck as lenders have sought to find that balance we have had some concerns that the pendulum may have swung too far the other way especially for small business in that context i welcome the report of the royal commission and the government s response the commission s recommendations that bear on credit provision are balanced and sensible and should remove some uncertainty i also welcome the commission s focus on the importance of service as opposed to sales in the financial sector the necessity of dealing properly with conflict of interest issues and the importance of accountability when things go wrong these are all issues i have spoken about on previous occasions addressing them is central to rebuilding the all important trust in our financial system housing prices and household income but back to household consumption and the housing market you might recall that 18 months ago one of the most talked about issues in the country was the high and rising cost of housing this was understandable in some of our cities purchasing a home had become a very difficult stretch for many people and this had become a major social issue today the talk is about prices falling in our two largest cities we have moved almost seamlessly from worrying that prices were going up to worrying that they are going down there is no single reason for this change but rather it is the result of a number of factors coming together one is that housing prices simply increased to the point in sydney and melbourne where demand tailed off as purchasing a home had become very expensive and less attractive as an investment a second is that the building boom over recent times significantly increased the supply of dwellings it took a number of years before the rate of home construction picked up in response to faster population growth but eventually it did pick up this explains much of the cycle a third factor is that the demand from overseas investors softened partly in response to the chinese authorities making it more difficult to move money out of china and a fourth factor is that lending standards have been tightened and credit has become more difficult to obtain importantly unlike most other housing price corrections this one has not been associated with rising unemployment or higher interest rates instead mainly structural factors relating to the underlying balance of supply and demand in our largest cities have been at work the question is what effect will this change have on household spending here my earlier observation about not having a crystal ball is relevant at this point though what we are seeing looks to be a manageable adjustment in the housing market it is not expected to derail economic growth the previous trends in debt and housing prices were becoming unsustainable and some correction was appropriate we recognise that this correction will have an effect on parts of the economy but our economy should be able to handle this and it will put the housing market on a more sustainable footing there are a few considerations here the first is that the recent housing price declines follow very large increases in prices graph 8 even after the recent declines in sydney prices are still 75 per cent higher over the decade in melbourne they are 70 per cent higher while the price falls are no doubt difficult for some including people who purchased in the past couple of years there are many people sitting on very significant capital gains and there are others who now will find it easier to purchase a home and of course in a number of cities and much of regional australia things have been more stable graph 8 a second consideration is that most households do not change their consumption in response to short term changes in their wealth sensibly many people tend to take a longer term perspective during the recent upswing in housing prices the strategy of borrowing against the extra equity in your home looked less sensible than it once was especially as debt levels rose some home owners also see themselves as being part of the bank of mum and dad this meant that they refrained from spending the extra equity so that they were able to help their children purchase their own property a third and perhaps the most important consideration is that household income growth is expected to pick up and income growth usually matters more for consumption than changes in wealth for some years growth in nominal aggregate household income has been unusually slow averaging just 2Â¾ per cent since 2016 graph 9 for some home owners rising housing prices have provided an offset to this even though the effect may have been smaller than in the past as a result aggregate consumption has grown faster than income for the past few years but a shift is now taking place over the next year we are expecting a pick up in household disposable income to provide a counterweight to the wealth effects of lower housing prices graph 9 labour market outcomes are key to this assessment continued employment growth and higher wages growth should boost disposable incomes the announced tax cuts should also help here in our central scenario consumption is expected to grow at around 2Â¾ per cent over the next couple of years broadly in line with expected growth in disposable income this is a bit lower than our earlier forecast for consumption there are of course other possible outcomes continued low income growth together with falling housing prices would be an unwelcome combination and would make for a softer outlook for the economy some australian households have high levels of debt so there is a degree of uncertainty about how they would respond to this combination so we are monitoring things closely the adjustment in the housing market is also affecting the economy through residential construction activity and the spending that occurs when people move homes residential construction activity is currently around its peak level and the large pipeline of approved projects is expected to support activity for a while developers though are finding it more difficult to sell apartments off the plan and lenders are less willing to provide finance sales of new detached dwellings have also slowed the central forecast is for dwelling investment to decline by about 10 per cent over the next two and a half years putting all this together our economy is going through an adjustment following the turn in the housing markets in our largest cities it is important that we keep this in perspective though the correction in the housing market follows an extended period of strength it is largely due to structural supply and demand factors and is occurring against the backdrop of a robust economy and an expected pick up in income growth our financial institutions are also in a strong position to deal with the adjustment indeed lending standards were strengthened as the upswing went on from this perspective the adjustment in the housing market is manageable for the financial system and the economy this adjustment will also help increase the affordability of housing for many people even so given the uncertainties we are paying very close attention to how things evolve monetary policy this brings me to monetary policy the cash rate has been held steady at 1Â½ per cent since august 2016 this setting has helped support the economy the reserve bank board has sought to be a source of stability and confidence while our economy adjusted to the end of the mining investment boom and responded to the shifting sands of the global economy over the past couple of years economic conditions have been moving in the right direction the labour market has strengthened and the unemployment rate has fallen and a further decline is expected inflation is also above its earlier trough although it has not changed much over the past year our expectation has been and continues to be that the tighter labour market and reduced spare capacity will see underlying inflation rise further towards the midpoint of the target range given this we have maintained a steady setting of monetary policy while the labour market strengthens and inflation increases looking forward there are scenarios where the next move in the cash rate is up and other scenarios where it is down over the past year the next move is up scenarios were more likely than the next move is down scenarios today the probabilities appear to be more evenly balanced we will be monitoring developments in the labour market closely if australians are finding jobs and their wages are rising more quickly it is reasonable to expect that inflation will rise and that it will be appropriate to lift the cash rate at some point on the other hand given the uncertainties it is possible that the economy is softer than we expect and that income and consumption growth disappoint in the event of a sustained increased in the unemployment rate and a lack of further progress towards the inflation objective lower interest rates might be appropriate at some point we have the flexibility to do this if needed the board will continue to assess the outlook carefully it does not see a strong case for a near term change in the cash rate we are in the position of being able to maintain the current policy setting while we assess the shifts in the global economy and the strength of household spending it has long been the board s approach to avoid reacting to the high frequency ebb and flow of news instead we have sought to keep our eye on the medium term and put in place a setting of monetary policy that helps deliver on our objectives of full employment an inflation rate that averages between 2 and 3 per cent and financial stability thank you for listening i look forward to answering your questions

of 2019 to the directly comparable gaap financial measure because applicable information for future periods on which this reconciliation would be based is not readily available due to uncertainty regarding and the potential variability of depreciation and amortization share based compensation expense changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other items conference call details ceridian

software company dayforce our flagship cloud hcm platform provides human resources payroll benefits workforce management and talent management functionality our platform is used to optimize management of the entire employee lifecycle including attracting engaging paying deploying and developing people ceridian has solutions for organizations of all sizes use of non gaap financial measures we use certain non gaap financial measures in this release including adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin revenue growth in a constant currency revenue retention rate and arr we believe that adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin non gaap financial measures are useful to management and investors as supplemental measures to evaluate our overall operating performance adjusted ebitda is a component of our management incentive plan and adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are used by management to assess performance and to compare our operating performance to our competitors we define adjusted ebitda as net income or loss before interest taxes depreciation and amortization as adjusted to exclude net income or loss from discontinued operations sponsor management fees non cash charges for asset impairments gains or losses on assets and liabilities held in a foreign currency other than the functional currency of a company subsidiary share based compensation expense severance charges restructuring consulting fees transaction costs and environmental reserve charges adjusted ebitda margin is determined by calculating the percentage adjusted ebitda is of total revenue management believes that adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are helpful in highlighting management performance trends because adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin exclude the results of decisions that are outside the normal course of our business operations our presentation of adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are intended as supplemental measures of our performance that are not required by or presented in accordance with gaap adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin should not be considered as alternatives to operating profit loss net income loss earnings per share or any other performance measures derived in accordance with gaap or as measures of operating cash flows or liquidity our presentation of adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin should not be construed to imply that our future results will be unaffected by similar items to those eliminated in this presentation adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are included in this discussion because they are key metrics used by management to assess our operating performance adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are not defined under gaap are not measures of net income operating income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with gaap and are subject to important limitations our use of the terms adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies in our industry and are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with gaap adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin have important limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under gaap some of these limitations are adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin do not reflect changes in or cash requirements for our working capital needs adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin do not reflect any charges for the assets being depreciated and amortized that may need to be replaced in the future adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin do not reflect the impact of share based compensation upon our results of operations adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin do not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt and adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin do not reflect our income tax expense or the cash requirements to pay our income taxes in evaluating adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to those eliminated in this presentation we present revenue growth in a constant currency to assess how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations which we believe is useful to management and investors we calculate percentage change in revenue on a constant currency basis by applying a fixed rate of 1 30 canadian dollar to 1 00 u s dollar foreign exchange rate to revenues originally booked in canadian dollars for all applicable historical periods our annual cloud revenue retention rate measures the percentage of revenues that we retain from our existing cloud customers we use this retention rate as an indicator of customer satisfaction and future revenues we calculate the annual cloud revenue retention rate as a percentage where the numerator is the cloud annualized recurring revenue for the prior year less the cloud annualized recurring revenue from lost cloud customers during that year and the denominator is the cloud annualized recurring revenue for the prior year we set annual targets for cloud revenue retention rate and monitor progress toward those targets on a quarterly basis by reviewing known customer losses and anticipated future customer losses our cloud revenue retention rate may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including the mix of cloud solutions used by customers the level of customer satisfaction and changes in the number of users live on our cloud solutions we have not reconciled the annual cloud revenue retention rate because there is no directly comparable gaap financial measure we derive the majority of our cloud revenues from recurring fees primarily pepm subscription charges we also derive recurring revenue from fees related to the rental and maintenance of clocks charges for once a year services such as year end tax statements and investment income on our customer funds held in trust before such funds are remitted to taxing authorities customer employees or other third parties to calculate cloud arr we start with recurring revenue at year end subtract the once a year charges annualize the revenue for customers live for less than a full year to reflect the revenue that would have been realized if the customer had been live for a full year and add back the once a year charges we set annual targets for cloud arr and monitor progress toward those targets on a quarterly basis we have not reconciled the cloud arr because there is no directly comparable gaap financial measure forward looking statements this press release contains forward looking

release references to oil sands operations exclude suncor s interests in fort hills and syncrude calgary alberta feb 05 2019 globe newswire suncor generated funds from operations of 2 billion in the fourth quarter as our integrated downstream business and market access helped to mitigate upstream crude price volatility including the further widening of the differentials for canadian crude said steve williams chief executive officer we continued to return value to our shareholders through nearly 1 2 billion in share repurchases and 574 million in dividends paid during the quarter funds from operations were 2 007 billion 1 26 per common share in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 3 016 billion 1 83 per common share in the prior year quarter cash flow provided by operating activities which includes changes in non cash working capital was 3 040 billion 1 90 per common share compared to 2 755 billion 1 67 per common share in the prior year quarter operating earnings were 580 million 0 36 per common share and the company had a net loss of 280 million 0 18 per common share in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to operating earnings of 1 310 billion 0 79 per common share and net earnings of 1 382 billion 0 84 per common share in the prior year quarter total oil sands production attained a new quarterly record of 740 800 barrels per day bbls d close to 90 000 bbls d ahead of the previous record primarily as a result of achieving 94 plant utilization at fort hills and record production at syncrude refining and marketing r m delivered record quarterly crude throughput of 467 900 bbls d which represents refinery utilization of 101 hebron production in the fourth quarter averaged 15 700 bbls d net to the company and is continuing to ramp up following the completion of the fourth production well during the quarter the company distributed 574 million in dividends to shareholders and repurchased an additional 1 166 billion of shares in the fourth quarter of 2018 the existing 3 0 billion share repurchase program is expected to be completed by the end of february 2019 subsequent to the end of the quarter suncor s board of directors the board approved a quarterly dividend of 0 42 per share an increase of 17 and also approved a further share repurchase program of up to 2 0 billion financial results operating earnings suncor s fourth quarter 2018 operating earnings were 580 million 0 36 per common share compared to 1 310 billion 0 79 per common share in the prior year quarter the decrease was primarily a result of unfavourable western canadian crude oil differentials including a substantial widening of synthetic crude oil sco differentials which resulted in the following a decrease in oil sands price realizations partially offset by improved refining margins and an unfavourable first in first out fifo inventory valuation adjustment in r m on declining feedstock costs partially offset by a realization of intersegment profit on inventory in the corporate energy trading and eliminations segment other factors reducing operating earnings included the addition of operating and transportation costs for new production from growth projects and acquisitions a decrease in oil sands operations sco production lower overall exploration and production e p sales volumes and a decrease in the capitalization of borrowing costs these factors were partially offset by a recovery of share based compensation costs compared to an expense in the prior year quarter and increased overall upstream production driven by 94 plant utilization at fort hills record production at syncrude and the continued ramp up of operations at hebron net loss earnings the net loss was 280 million 0 18 per common share in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to net earnings of 1 382 billion 0 84 per common share in the prior year quarter in addition to the factors explained in operating earnings above net earnings for the fourth quarter of 2018 included a 637 million unrealized after tax foreign exchange loss on the revaluation of united states u s dollar denominated debt as well as a non cash impairment loss on one of the company s equity investments net earnings in the prior year quarter included a net 124 million deferred income tax recovery related to a decrease in the u s corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 an unrealized after tax foreign exchange loss of 91 million on the revaluation of u s dollar denominated debt after tax property damage insurance proceeds of 55 million an after tax loss of 18 million for early repayment of debt and a net after tax gain of 2 million on interest rate swaps associated with debt issued in the fourth quarter of 2017 funds from operations and cash flow provided by operating activities funds from operations were 2 007 billion 1 26 per common share in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 3 016 billion 1 83 per common share in the fourth quarter of 2017 and were influenced by the same factors impacting operating earnings noted above excluding the recovery of non cash share based compensation as well as unrealized gains on crude optimization activities cash flow provided by operating activities was 3 040 billion 1 90 per common share for the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 2 755 billion 1 67 per common share for the fourth quarter of 2017 with changes in non cash working capital representing a source of cash to the company in the fourth quarter of 2018 as compared to a use of cash in the prior year period the source of cash in the company s non cash working capital balances was primarily due to the declining crude price environment in the fourth quarter and the associated decrease in accounts receivable balances as well as the decline in refinery inventory value as the company replaced crude feedstock inventories purchased in the prior period with less expensive crude operating results suncor s total upstream production represents a new quarterly record at 831 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day boe d during the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 736 400 boe d in the prior year quarter with the increase primarily due to the addition of fort hills production improved reliability and an additional working interest at syncrude and the continued ramp up of operations at hebron fort hills achieved plant utilization of 94 for the quarter exceeding our accelerated target of 90 and production from syncrude was strong with the assets attaining a new quarterly record said mark little president and chief operating officer our refining assets continue to outperform due to continued reliability achieving a new quarterly throughput record and allowing us to maximize the impact of strong refining margins oil sands operations production was 432 700 bbls d in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 446 800 bbls d in the prior year quarter the decrease was primarily due to lower sco volumes as a result of planned and unplanned maintenance at upgrader 2 partially offset by an increased volume of non upgraded bitumen from the company s in situ properties with firebag and mackay river continuing to achieve solid reliability planned maintenance at upgrader 2 which commenced in the third quarter of 2018 was completed during the fourth quarter and the unplanned maintenance was resolved by the end of the quarter upgrader utilization in the fourth quarter of 2018 was 79 compared to 93 in the prior year period as a result of the maintenance discussed above oil sands operations cash operating costs per barrel were 24 50 in the fourth quarter of 2018 and were comparable to the prior year period of 24 20 with lower overall production being offset by lower operating selling and general expense after adjusting for non cash items suncor s share of production from fort hills averaged 98 500 bbls d for the fourth quarter of 2018 which represents 94 utilization as a result of the increase in production fort hills cash operating costs per barrel decreased to 24 85 in the fourth quarter of 2018 and were 31 20 for the year suncor s share of syncrude production was a record 209 600 bbls d in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 174 400 bbls d in the prior year quarter the increase in production was primarily due to strong reliability as well as the additional 5 working interest in syncrude acquired earlier in 2018 upgrader utilization at syncrude was 101 in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 94 in the prior year quarter syncrude cash operating costs per barrel were 31 75 in the fourth quarter of 2018 a decrease from 32 80 in the prior year quarter as a result of higher production production volumes at e p were 90 200 boe d in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 115 200 boe d in the prior year quarter in addition to natural declines the decrease in production was due to a temporary production interruption at the company s east coast canada assets as a result of a major storm system in the period as well as an unplanned outage at buzzard in the united kingdom partially offset by the addition of production from hebron the production interruption at the white rose field extended into 2019 with partial production restarting at the end of january 2019 refinery crude throughput achieved a new quarterly record of 467 900 bbls d and refinery utilization was 101 in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 432 400 bbls d and a utilization rate of 94 in the prior year quarter the increase was due to strong reliability at all of the company s refineries in addition to the prior year quarter being impacted by a third party power outage strategy update suncor s 2018 capital program was focused on improving the safety long term reliability and efficiency of the company s operating assets including execution of major turnarounds in addition to the effective and efficient ramp up at both of suncor s major growth projects fort hills and hebron the company spent 1 119 billion on capital expenditures excluding capitalized interest during the fourth quarter of 2018 a decrease from 1 444 billion in the prior year quarter primarily due to the decrease in growth capital with the commissioning of fort hills and hebron sustaining capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of 2018 were comparable to the prior year quarter we remain focused on capital discipline and ensuring safe and reliable operations across our business said williams through our integrated model and the value driven investments we ve made in our business suncor is well positioned to continue to grow production and cash flow and to increase returns to shareholders across a wide range of market conditions downstream integration continues to be a fundamental component of suncor s strategy and the overall impact of wider crude differentials in alberta was partially mitigated by a combination of improved refining margins driven by lower feedstock costs and the company s favourable market access position which allows a significant portion of bitumen sales to be moved to the u s gulf coast where higher prices are realized however due to the impact of the fifo method of inventory valuation the full benefit of lower feedstock costs at r m has not yet been realized due to the time lag associated with processing higher value crude inventory drilling activity at hebron is ongoing and production continues to ramp up the fourth production well came online during the fourth quarter and contributed to increased volumes other e p activity in the fourth quarter included development drilling at hebron hibernia white rose and buzzard and development work on the west white rose project and the norwegian oda and fenja projects development of the oda project has progressed ahead of schedule and first oil is now anticipated in the second quarter of 2019 as compared to the original target of the third quarter of 2019 during the fourth quarter of 2018 suncor and its joint venture partners reached an agreement in principle for interconnecting pipelines between syncrude s mildred lake site and suncor s oil sands base plant the lines will transfer bitumen and gas oils between the two plants providing increased operational flexibility and enabling higher reliability and utilization the pipelines are expected to be operational by the end of 2020 subject to finalized commercial terms and regulatory approval subsequent to the end of the quarter the company received 300 million in risk mitigation proceeds for its libyan assets approximately 260 million after tax the proceeds may be subject to a provisional repayment which is dependent on the future performance and cash flows from suncor s libyan assets following the approval from the board in the third quarter of 2018 to increase the company s share repurchase program from 2 15 billion to 3 0 billion the toronto stock exchange accepted a notice filed by suncor during the fourth quarter of 2018 to increase the maximum number of shares the company may purchase pursuant to its normal course issuer bid the increase to the program reinforces the company s ongoing ability to generate cash flow and return value to shareholders under suncor s expanded normal course issuer bid the company repurchased and cancelled 1 166 billion of its own shares in the fourth quarter of 2018 subsequent to the end of the quarter suncor s board of directors approved a further share repurchase program of up to 2 0 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018 suncor continued to return value to shareholders through dividends of 574 million and subsequent to the end of the quarter suncor s board of directors approved a quarterly dividend of 0 42 per share which represents an increase of 17 over the prior quarter dividend in addition during the fourth quarter as part of the company s commitment to debt reduction suncor repurchased us 83 million of 7 75 senior notes due in 2019 2019 notes that were acquired as part of the acquisition of canadian oil sands

compared to current gaap further the new standard will result in changes to the timing of ceridian s revenue recognition compared to current gaap in compliance with the new standard a contract asset will be reflected on the consolidated balance sheets and will be amortized over the contract period which is generally three years ceridian will have changes to the timing of certain incremental selling general and administrative expenses as the new standard will also require capitalizing and amortizing certain selling expenses such as commissions and bonuses paid to the sales force these sales expenses will be amortized over the period of benefit generally five years we have included in the financial schedules attached to this press release the retrospective financial impacts to the specific revenue and operating profit loss line items as well as our fully adjusted financial results reflecting the adoption of asc 606 retrospectively for the quarterly periods ended in fiscal years 2017 and 2018 business outlook based on information available as of february 6 2019 ceridian is issuing guidance for the first quarter and full year of 2019 as indicated below please note that this

million adjusted ebitda is expected to be in the range of 46 0 million to 48 0 million we have not reconciled the adjusted ebitda ranges for the first quarter of 2019 or the full fiscal year of 2019 to the directly comparable gaap financial measure because applicable information for future periods on which this reconciliation would be based is not readily available due to uncertainty regarding and the potential variability of depreciation and amortization share based compensation expense changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other items conference call details ceridian will host a

dayforce our flagship cloud hcm platform provides human resources payroll benefits workforce management and talent management functionality our platform is used to optimize management of the entire employee lifecycle including attracting engaging paying deploying and developing people ceridian has solutions for organizations of all sizes use of non gaap financial measures we use certain non gaap financial measures in this release including adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin revenue growth in a constant currency revenue retention rate and arr we believe that adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin non gaap financial measures are useful to management and investors as supplemental measures to evaluate our overall operating performance adjusted ebitda is a component of our management incentive plan and adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are used by management to assess performance and to compare our operating performance to our competitors we define adjusted ebitda as net income or loss before interest taxes depreciation and amortization as adjusted to exclude net income or loss from discontinued operations sponsor management fees non cash charges for asset impairments gains or losses on assets and liabilities held in a foreign currency other than the functional currency of a company subsidiary share based compensation expense severance charges restructuring consulting fees transaction costs and environmental reserve charges adjusted ebitda margin is determined by calculating the percentage adjusted ebitda is of total revenue management believes that adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are helpful in highlighting management performance trends because adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin exclude the results of decisions that are outside the normal course of our business operations our presentation of adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are intended as supplemental measures of our performance that are not required by or presented in accordance with gaap adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin should not be considered as alternatives to operating profit loss net income loss earnings per share or any other performance measures derived in accordance with gaap or as measures of operating cash flows or liquidity our presentation of adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin should not be construed to imply that our future results will be unaffected by similar items to those eliminated in this presentation adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are included in this discussion because they are key metrics used by management to assess our operating performance adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are not defined under gaap are not measures of net income operating income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with gaap and are subject to important limitations our use of the terms adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies in our industry and are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with gaap adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin have important limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under gaap some of these limitations are adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin do not reflect changes in or cash requirements for our working capital needs adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin do not reflect any charges for the assets being depreciated and amortized that may need to be replaced in the future adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin do not reflect the impact of share based compensation upon our results of operations adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin do not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt and adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin do not reflect our income tax expense or the cash requirements to pay our income taxes in evaluating adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to those eliminated in this presentation we present revenue growth in a constant currency to assess how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations which we believe is useful to management and investors we calculate percentage change in revenue on a constant currency basis by applying a fixed rate of 1 30 canadian dollar to 1 00 u s dollar foreign exchange rate to revenues originally booked in canadian dollars for all applicable historical periods our annual cloud revenue retention rate measures the percentage of revenues that we retain from our existing cloud customers we use this retention rate as an indicator of customer satisfaction and future revenues we calculate the annual cloud revenue retention rate as a percentage where the numerator is the cloud annualized recurring revenue for the prior year less the cloud annualized recurring revenue from lost cloud customers during that year and the denominator is the cloud annualized recurring revenue for the prior year we set annual targets for cloud revenue retention rate and monitor progress toward those targets on a quarterly basis by reviewing known customer losses and anticipated future customer losses our cloud revenue retention rate may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including the mix of cloud solutions used by customers the level of customer satisfaction and changes in the number of users live on our cloud solutions we have not reconciled the annual cloud revenue retention rate because there is no directly comparable gaap financial measure we derive the majority of our cloud revenues from recurring fees primarily pepm subscription charges we also derive recurring revenue from fees related to the rental and maintenance of clocks charges for once a year services such as year end tax statements and investment income on our customer funds held in trust before such funds are remitted to taxing authorities customer employees or other third parties to calculate cloud arr we start with recurring revenue at year end subtract the once a year charges annualize the revenue for customers live for less than a full year to reflect the revenue that would have been realized if the customer had been live for a full year and add back the once a year charges we set annual targets for cloud arr and monitor progress toward those targets on a quarterly basis we have not reconciled the cloud arr because there is no directly comparable gaap financial measure forward looking statements this press release contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and

this article provides an impact assessment of the fomc march 19 20 meeting and a possible rise in the federal funds rate ffr to 2 75 the federal reserve held the target range for ffr at 2 25 2 5 percent during its first policy meeting of january 2019 and reaffirmed its position to be patient about further policy firming in light of recent global economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures the current ffr situation is shown in the chart below what happens when the fed changes rates a movement of the ffr has three broad impacts bank lending costs on required reserves interest burden on private debt interest on newly issued treasury deposits interest paid on excess reserves also known as the support rate these four impacts will be looked at in turn bank lending costs the stock of private debt is shown in the chart below as a percentage of gdp one sees the most current level of private debt to gdp is 202 8 for 2017 the table below shows the impact of the rate hike on bank reserves advanced by the fed via the discount window when a bank makes a loan source author calculations based on trading economics gdp measure the new level is shown in highlighted in green loans create deposits and generate reserves at the fed the fed creates the reserves on demand as part of the federal payments system if not able to access reserve funds from other commercial banks on the interbank market a bank can always access reserves from the fed at the ffr the interbank rate is shown in the chart below and shows that at present commercial banks would be better off obtaining their required reserves from the fed discount window at 2 5 rather than the current 2 7 interbank rate every 0 25 rate movement changes the cost of loan funds by 10 billion the private banks then pass on this rate change to the customer if they can an ffr increase can be seen as a giant economy wide tax on borrowers and lenders each time the fed raises 0 25 it moves 10 billion from the private sector to the government sector the fed is the national government s bank and remits its profits to the national government in the same way that taxes are remitted from the private sector to the government the national government is the issuer of the dollar it has as many dollars as it wishes to create and does not need to get them from an outside source the 10 billion income stream to the government from a fed rate rise is deleted from existence in the same way as national taxes it is a net reduction in the money supply it exists on no measure of any money supply after remittance not m1 m2 or m3 this is a contractionary and deflationary impact at the macro level interest burden on private debt the following table shows the impact of the rate on the stock of private debt in absolute terms and as a percentage of gdp the likely new ffr is highlighted in green the chart shows that with each 0 25 ffr rise 98 billion or 0 53 of gdp is transferred from the household and business sector to the finance sector in a macro intersectoral income transfer at present just over 5 of gdp goes to banks as interest on loans money that might have been spent on real goods and services at the macro level this has no impact on the net money supply as it stays the same the biggest impact is the transfer of income from businesses and households to the banking sector this transfer of income causes what professor michael hudson terms debt deflation and is also known as secular stagnation debt deflation the financial stage following debt leveraged asset price inflation which leaves a residue of debt once new lending stops and repayment time arrives the term was coined in 1933 by irving fisher to explain how bankruptcies and the difficulty of paying debts wiped out bank credit and hence the ability of economies to invest and hire new workers paying debt service diverts spending away from consumer goods and new business investment hudson michael j is for junk economics a guide to reality in an age of deception kindle locations 1728 1733 islet verlag kindle edition it is this factor that leads to fed induced recessions from rate rises treasury deposits another impact of a rate change is on treasuries also known as government debt if there is a general rate rise then the yield on treasuries will also rise as new treasuries issue at the new higher rate and existing ones trade on secondary markets for lower face values under current institutional arrangements governments around the world voluntarily issue debt into the private bond markets to match for their net spending flows in each period a sovereign government within a fiat currency system does not have to issue any debt and could run continuous fiscal deficits that is forever with a zero public debt source professor william mitchell 2015 the following table shows the generalized impact of the rate rise on the stock of treasuries source author calculations based on trading economics government debt measure the new treasury rate is shown highlighted in green government debt in the united states increased to 21974096 million in december from 21850094 million in november of 2018 the debt level is out of date due to the partial federal government shutdown causing financial reporting such as this to stop the table above shows that with each 0 25 rate rise some 55 billion of new money enters the private sector from the government sector the positive side of the equation is that more dollars in the economy grow the economy the treasury can pay any amount authorized by the national government a monetarily sovereign national government creates money ad hoc as it spends it is done simply by marking up bank accounts at the federal reserve bank if all the treasury deposits were at the new rate of 2 75 then the government would add about 604 billion to the economy each year from treasury interest payments alone the entire national debt is a historical record of all the dollars the government spends into the economy that are not taxed back and are currently being held in the form of u s government securities called treasuries actually she said the national debt clock is an asset clock source professor stephanie kelton 2018 this gives the banks more income as part of the fed s monetary operations it is required to swap bank reserves for treasury deposits until reaching its target rate of 2 75 an interest rate increase may lift the demand for treasury deposits while domestically this is only a portfolio shift it might improve the current account balance when foreigners buy more treasuries which in turn drives demand for the us dollar a treasury is a us dollar with an interest coupon a us dollar is a zero coupon bond and the cost of holding it is the interest rate charged by banks on credit money the usd could well rise as demand for it grows relative to other currencies uup interest on excess reserves this is the fourth and last impact of an increase in the ffr a phenomenon coming out of the 2007 global financial crisis gfc boom bust was the federal reserve would pay interest on excess bank reserves ioer held by commercial banks that had beforehand received no interest this aspect receives almost no press coverage and yet the implications are huge the chart below shows the stock of excess bank reserves this is over 1 5 trillion the chart below shows the interest paid on excess bank reserves one can see that the interest on excess reserves mirrors the ffr closely the implications of this are twofold 1 the ffr will never fall below the ioer the ioer is a support rate that sets a floor under interest rates the implication is that instead of setting a target rate and selling and buying treasuries to achieve the target rate the same objective could be more easily achieved by setting the support rate where the central bank wanted it to be 2 banks receive free money there are over 1 5 trillion of excess reserves sitting in the reserve accounts of us banks and this earns them 36 billion per annum of income this is again money created by marking up bank accounts and is therefore high powered sovereign money as opposed to debt based credit money each time ffr is raised the ioer is raised to just underneath it most likely an increase in ffr will lead to a rise in the support rate to 2 65 and this will add a further 3 75 billion of money into the economy and bring the total paid per annum to 39 75 billion this income adds to the bank s capital base which in turn means it can increase its lending if creditworthy borrowers wish for a loan or it could be paid out in dividends stock buybacks or lavish executive remuneration on balance what does this all mean there are winners and losers from a fed rate rise banks on the one hand banks must pay more for their borrowed reserves from the fed when they make a loan this is bad news for those that hold a lot of fixed rate loans as their margin gets squeezed on the other hand those banks that hold a lot of adjusting rate mortgage arm loans are anticipating or enjoying the triggering of exploding rates that are much more than the actual ffr rise banks slowly devour a larger and larger share of gdp with each rate rise for no additional effort and no actual production of a good or service bank stocks can be expected to rise due to the added income from increased loan interest from households and businesses on the existing loan book of over 200 of gdp interest on treasuries bought in exchange for excess reserves by the federal reserve interest paid on excess reserves by the federal reserve bank borrowers they suffer when rates rise and benefit when they fall borrowers in the household and business sector get slowly squeezed with each rate rise more and more income is devoted to debt service and the appetite for more debt is reduced aggregate demand falls and unemployment and recession follow the macro economy the impact on the macro money supply is shown in the following table source author s calculations based on fred statistics and trading economics dot com statistics more money added to the economy grows the economy especially if matched to value creation and productive capacity the latter tends not to happen as the income distribution is skewed to the financial sector which in turn tends to inflate the value of paper assets instead of creating real assets one can have too much of a good thing and the interest rate can go too high as the table below shows source author s calculations based on trading economics dot com statistics five to six percent seems to be the limit judging from the last two boom bust events and the amount of private debt what stands out at present as compared to the pre boom peaks of 2000 and 2007 is that credit creation is much weaker as the table below shows source author s calculations based on trading economics dot com statistics perhaps a credit boom is still coming where to invest to take advantage of this trend was discussed in this article and the findings still stand and are reinforced by current trends diversified exposure to the american

management routinely implements restructuring actions in targeted sections of our business as a result of these actions we recognized charges of 4 6 million in 2017 and 7 6 million in 2018 primarily severance costs for the current restructuring actions we expect to incur additional costs of up to 1 million in future periods due to the unique circumstances around these charges these management directed items have not been allocated to segment results and are excluded from non gaap results acquisitions and dispositions certain acquisition and disposition items that are not considered part of

severance costs of 4 0 million related to our acquisitions in argentina and brazil transaction costs were 2 6 million related to acquisitions of new businesses in 2017 we recognized currency transaction gains of 1 8 million related to acquisition activity in 2017 argentina highly inflationary impact beginning in the third quarter of 2018 we designated argentina s economy as highly inflationary for accounting purposes as a result argentine peso denominated monetary assets and liabilities are now remeasured at each balance sheet date to the currency exchange rate then in effect with currency remeasurement gains and losses recognized in earnings in addition nonmonetary assets retain a higher historical basis when the currency is devalued the higher historical basis results in incremental expense being recognized when the nonmonetary assets are consumed in the second half of 2018 we recognized 8 0 million in pretax charges related to highly inflationary accounting including currency remeasurement losses of 6 2 million reporting compliance certain third party costs incurred related to the implementation and adoption of asu 2016 02 the new lease accounting standard

exchange rates non gaap results adjust the quarterly non gaap tax rates so that the non gaap tax rate in each of the quarters is equal to the full year estimated non gaap tax rate the full year non

presented the 2019 non gaap outlook amounts for provision for income taxes income loss from continuing operations eps from continuing operations effective income tax rate and adjusted ebitda cannot be reconciled to gaap without unreasonable effort we cannot reconcile these amounts to gaap because we are unable to accurately forecast the impact of highly inflationary accounting on our argentina operations or other potential non gaap adjusting items for which the timing and amounts are currently under review such as future restructuring actions the impact of highly inflationary accounting and other potential non gaap adjusting items could be significant to our gaap results the non gaap financial measures are intended to provide investors with a supplemental comparison of our operating results and trends for the periods presented our management believes these measures are also useful to investors as such measures allow investors to evaluate our performance using the same metrics that our management uses to evaluate past performance and prospects for future performance we do not consider these items to be reflective of our core operating performance due to the variability of such items from period to period in terms of size nature and significance additionally non gaap results are utilized as performance measures in certain management incentive compensation plans non gaap

release references to oil sands operations exclude suncor s interests in fort hills and syncrude calgary alberta feb 05 2019 globe newswire suncor generated funds from operations of 2 billion in the fourth quarter as our integrated downstream business and market access helped to mitigate upstream crude price volatility including the further widening of the differentials for canadian crude said steve williams chief executive officer we continued to return value to our shareholders through nearly 1 2 billion in share repurchases and 574 million in dividends paid during the quarter funds from operations were 2 007 billion 1 26 per common share in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 3 016 billion 1 83 per common share in the prior year quarter cash flow provided by operating activities which includes changes in non cash working capital was 3 040 billion 1 90 per common share compared to 2 755 billion 1 67 per common share in the prior year quarter operating earnings were 580 million 0 36 per common share and the company had a net loss of 280 million 0 18 per common share in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to operating earnings of 1 310 billion 0 79 per common share and net earnings of 1 382 billion 0 84 per common share in the prior year quarter total oil sands production attained a new quarterly record of 740 800 barrels per day bbls d close to 90 000 bbls d ahead of the previous record primarily as a result of achieving 94 plant utilization at fort hills and record production at syncrude refining and marketing r m delivered record quarterly crude throughput of 467 900 bbls d which represents refinery utilization of 101 hebron production in the fourth quarter averaged 15 700 bbls d net to the company and is continuing to ramp up following the completion of the fourth production well during the quarter the company distributed 574 million in dividends to shareholders and repurchased an additional 1 166 billion of shares in the fourth quarter of 2018 the existing 3 0 billion share repurchase program is expected to be completed by the end of february 2019 subsequent to the end of the quarter suncor s board of directors the board approved a quarterly dividend of 0 42 per share an increase of 17 and also approved a further share repurchase program of up to 2 0 billion financial results operating earnings suncor s fourth quarter 2018 operating earnings were 580 million 0 36 per common share compared to 1 310 billion 0 79 per common share in the prior year quarter the decrease was primarily a result of unfavourable western canadian crude oil differentials including a substantial widening of synthetic crude oil sco differentials which resulted in the following a decrease in oil sands price realizations partially offset by improved refining margins and an unfavourable first in first out fifo inventory valuation adjustment in r m on declining feedstock costs partially offset by a realization of intersegment profit on inventory in the corporate energy trading and eliminations segment other factors reducing operating earnings included the addition of operating and transportation costs for new production from growth projects and acquisitions a decrease in oil sands operations sco production lower overall exploration and production e p sales volumes and a decrease in the capitalization of borrowing costs these factors were partially offset by a recovery of share based compensation costs compared to an expense in the prior year quarter and increased overall upstream production driven by 94 plant utilization at fort hills record production at syncrude and the continued ramp up of operations at hebron net loss earnings the net loss was 280 million 0 18 per common share in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to net earnings of 1 382 billion 0 84 per common share in the prior year quarter in addition to the factors explained in operating earnings above net earnings for the fourth quarter of 2018 included a 637 million unrealized after tax foreign exchange loss on the revaluation of united states u s dollar denominated debt as well as a non cash impairment loss on one of the company s equity investments net earnings in the prior year quarter included a net 124 million deferred income tax recovery related to a decrease in the u s corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 an unrealized after tax foreign exchange loss of 91 million on the revaluation of u s dollar denominated debt after tax property damage insurance proceeds of 55 million an after tax loss of 18 million for early repayment of debt and a net after tax gain of 2 million on interest rate swaps associated with debt issued in the fourth quarter of 2017 funds from operations and cash flow provided by operating activities funds from operations were 2 007 billion 1 26 per common share in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 3 016 billion 1 83 per common share in the fourth quarter of 2017 and were influenced by the same factors impacting operating earnings noted above excluding the recovery of non cash share based compensation as well as unrealized gains on crude optimization activities cash flow provided by operating activities was 3 040 billion 1 90 per common share for the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 2 755 billion 1 67 per common share for the fourth quarter of 2017 with changes in non cash working capital representing a source of cash to the company in the fourth quarter of 2018 as compared to a use of cash in the prior year period the source of cash in the company s non cash working capital balances was primarily due to the declining crude price environment in the fourth quarter and the associated decrease in accounts receivable balances as well as the decline in refinery inventory value as the company replaced crude feedstock inventories purchased in the prior period with less expensive crude operating results suncor s total upstream production represents a new quarterly record at 831 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day boe d during the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 736 400 boe d in the prior year quarter with the increase primarily due to the addition of fort hills production improved reliability and an additional working interest at syncrude and the continued ramp up of operations at hebron fort hills achieved plant utilization of 94 for the quarter exceeding our accelerated target of 90 and production from syncrude was strong with the assets attaining a new quarterly record said mark little president and chief operating officer our refining assets continue to outperform due to continued reliability achieving a new quarterly throughput record and allowing us to maximize the impact of strong refining margins oil sands operations production was 432 700 bbls d in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 446 800 bbls d in the prior year quarter the decrease was primarily due to lower sco volumes as a result of planned and unplanned maintenance at upgrader 2 partially offset by an increased volume of non upgraded bitumen from the company s in situ properties with firebag and mackay river continuing to achieve solid reliability planned maintenance at upgrader 2 which commenced in the third quarter of 2018 was completed during the fourth quarter and the unplanned maintenance was resolved by the end of the quarter upgrader utilization in the fourth quarter of 2018 was 79 compared to 93 in the prior year period as a result of the maintenance discussed above oil sands operations cash operating costs per barrel were 24 50 in the fourth quarter of 2018 and were comparable to the prior year period of 24 20 with lower overall production being offset by lower operating selling and general expense after adjusting for non cash items suncor s share of production from fort hills averaged 98 500 bbls d for the fourth quarter of 2018 which represents 94 utilization as a result of the increase in production fort hills cash operating costs per barrel decreased to 24 85 in the fourth quarter of 2018 and were 31 20 for the year suncor s share of syncrude production was a record 209 600 bbls d in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 174 400 bbls d in the prior year quarter the increase in production was primarily due to strong reliability as well as the additional 5 working interest in syncrude acquired earlier in 2018 upgrader utilization at syncrude was 101 in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 94 in the prior year quarter syncrude cash operating costs per barrel were 31 75 in the fourth quarter of 2018 a decrease from 32 80 in the prior year quarter as a result of higher production production volumes at e p were 90 200 boe d in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 115 200 boe d in the prior year quarter in addition to natural declines the decrease in production was due to a temporary production interruption at the company s east coast canada assets as a result of a major storm system in the period as well as an unplanned outage at buzzard in the united kingdom partially offset by the addition of production from hebron the production interruption at the white rose field extended into 2019 with partial production restarting at the end of january 2019 refinery crude throughput achieved a new quarterly record of 467 900 bbls d and refinery utilization was 101 in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 432 400 bbls d and a utilization rate of 94 in the prior year quarter the increase was due to strong reliability at all of the company s refineries in addition to the prior year quarter being impacted by a third party power outage strategy update suncor s 2018 capital program was focused on improving the safety long term reliability and efficiency of the company s operating assets including execution of major turnarounds in addition to the effective and efficient ramp up at both of suncor s major growth projects fort hills and hebron the company spent 1 119 billion on capital expenditures excluding capitalized interest during the fourth quarter of 2018 a decrease from 1 444 billion in the prior year quarter primarily due to the decrease in growth capital with the commissioning of fort hills and hebron sustaining capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of 2018 were comparable to the prior year quarter we remain focused on capital discipline and ensuring safe and reliable operations across our business said williams through our integrated model and the value driven investments we ve made in our business suncor is well positioned to continue to grow production and cash flow and to increase returns to shareholders across a wide range of market conditions downstream integration continues to be a fundamental component of suncor s strategy and the overall impact of wider crude differentials in alberta was partially mitigated by a combination of improved refining margins driven by lower feedstock costs and the company s favourable market access position which allows a significant portion of bitumen sales to be moved to the u s gulf coast where higher prices are realized however due to the impact of the fifo method of inventory valuation the full benefit of lower feedstock costs at r m has not yet been realized due to the time lag associated with processing higher value crude inventory drilling activity at hebron is ongoing and production continues to ramp up the fourth production well came online during the fourth quarter and contributed to increased volumes other e p activity in the fourth quarter included development drilling at hebron hibernia white rose and buzzard and development work on the west white rose project and the norwegian oda and fenja projects development of the oda project has progressed ahead of schedule and first oil is now anticipated in the second quarter of 2019 as compared to the original target of the third quarter of 2019 during the fourth quarter of 2018 suncor and its joint venture partners reached an agreement in principle for interconnecting pipelines between syncrude s mildred lake site and suncor s oil sands base plant the lines will transfer bitumen and gas oils between the two plants providing increased operational flexibility and enabling higher reliability and utilization the pipelines are expected to be operational by the end of 2020 subject to finalized commercial terms and regulatory approval subsequent to the end of the quarter the company received 300 million in risk mitigation proceeds for its libyan assets approximately 260 million after tax the proceeds may be subject to a provisional repayment which is dependent on the future performance and cash flows from suncor s libyan assets following the approval from the board in the third quarter of 2018 to increase the company s share repurchase program from 2 15 billion to 3 0 billion the toronto stock exchange accepted a notice filed by suncor during the fourth quarter of 2018 to increase the maximum number of shares the company may purchase pursuant to its normal course issuer bid the increase to the program reinforces the company s ongoing ability to generate cash flow and return value to shareholders under suncor s expanded normal course issuer bid the company repurchased and cancelled 1 166 billion of its own shares in the fourth quarter of 2018 subsequent to the end of the quarter suncor s board of directors approved a further share repurchase program of up to 2 0 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018 suncor continued to return value to shareholders through dividends of 574 million and subsequent to the end of the quarter suncor s board of directors approved a quarterly dividend of 0 42 per share which represents an increase of 17 over the prior quarter dividend in addition during the fourth quarter as part of the company s commitment to debt reduction suncor repurchased us 83 million of 7 75 senior notes due in 2019 2019 notes that were acquired as part of the acquisition of canadian oil sands

the trump administration knows that a key source of us economic leverage is the dollar s role as the world s dominant reserve currency us president donald trump is using economic warfare to pursue his foreign policy objectives in august 2018 his administration announced that it would double tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from turkey in order to pressure the turkish authorities to release an american pastor detained for two years on espionage charges at the beginning of december the us also ratcheted up unilateral sanctions against iran the trump administration knows that a key source of us economic leverage is the dollar s role as the world s dominant reserve currency countering america s disproportionate power to destabilise the global economy thus requires reducing the share of international trade conducted in dollars can the euro serve as a credible alternative climbing the currency ladder the euro is the world s second largest reserve currency but it still lags far behind the us dollar two thirds of all loans issued by local banks in foreign currencies are denominated in dollars compared with just 20 percent in euros similar proportions apply to global foreign exchange reserves countering america s disproportionate power to destabilise the global economy requires reducing the share of international trade conducted in dollars european commission president jean claude juncker is eager to change this in september he declared it absurd that europe pays for 80 percent of its energy import bill worth 300bn a year in us dollars even though only about two percent of the eu s energy imports come from the us he then called for the euro to become the instrument of a new more sovereign europe and promised to present initiatives to strengthen the international role of the euro juncker is not alone among european leaders in recognising how powerful a tool the single currency can be when it comes to projecting power german foreign minister heiko maas has proposed that the european union establish its own international payments system but these proposals while ambitious may overlook what is really needed to elevate the euro s status if the euro s role in international trade increased so would foreign companies holdings of euro denominated assets and the total volume of euro denominated loans more global trade in euros could lead foreign banking systems to become heavily exposed to the currency that means that in the event of a crisis the european central bank ecb would have to take action much as the us federal reserve has done in the past during the 2008 global financial crisis the fed served as de facto global lender of last resort agreeing to unsecured swap lines not only with reserve currency central banks like the ecb and the swiss national bank but also with emerging economies like mexico and brazil the goal was to stabilise the global economy but the liquidity also helped to prevent domestic disturbances from foreign sales of dollar assets and to stop foreign banks from scrambling to buy dollars lend like the fed the ecb adopted a much more restrictive approach in late 2008 it began to provide euros to the central banks of hungary latvia and poland but required them to put up euro denominated securities as collateral the ecb wanted to guard its balance sheet against unsecured exposure to the hungarian forint or polish zÅoty but these countries held too few eligible securities to obtain enough euros under the ecb s initial terms it took another year for the ecb under pressure from austria and other countries to establish proper swap lines against foreign currency collateral with the hungarian and polish central banks the european central bank has good reason to be cautious it lacks a political counterpart akin to the fed s us treasury secretary even now the ecb will provide euro liquidity only to countries considered systemically relevant for the eurozone this risk averse approach contrasts with that of the fed and more tellingly with that of the people s bank of china which in recent years has established an extensive network of swap lines to promote the renminbi s use in trade and thus its standing as an international currency if juncker s vision is to be realised the ecb will have to abandon this parochial mindset and adopt a fed style role as international lender of last resort yet it remains unclear whether the ecb actually would be willing to leave part of its balance sheet exposed to the fate of non eurozone countries whatever it takes the ecb has good reason to be cautious it lacks a political counterpart akin to the fed s us treasury secretary with no eurozone finance minister with whom to coordinate in times of crisis a decision by the ecb to help third countries even eu countries could be met with strong resistance the ecb s reluctance to establish a swap line with hungary may be a case in point hungary was already distancing itself from the eu eventually the ecb did resolve to do whatever it takes to save the euro but if european leaders want to advance juncker s vision of strengthening eu sovereignty by boosting the euro s international role they cannot rely on the ecb to repeat that approach without proper institutional support instead eurozone leaders should complete the reforms of the currency union s architecture and provide a political counterpart to the ecb that would support centralised monetary policy this is the best initial response to trump s economic attacks anything else would be putting the cart before the horse yet again project syndicate 2019
washington ap president donald trump exaggerated perils at the border flubbed food stamp numbers and the length of wars and told partial truths on drug prices in his state of the union speech trump also celebrated a couple of workforce measures that have little to do with him and almost everything to do with a growing population in her democratic response to the speech stacey abrams reflected a recent and misleading talking point by her party when she slammed the trump administration for choosing to cage children at the border ignoring a practice also employed by the obama administration to hold migrant children in facilities with chain link fencing here s a look at some of the statements from state of the union night labor force trump all americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before trump more people are working now than at any time in the history of our country one hundred fifty seven million people at work the facts yes but that s because the population has grown it s more than doubled since 1950 and in recent months it s been increasing by 150 000 to nearly 200 000 per month births are the primary driver of population growth with immigration also contributing in 2030 that s expected to change with immigration overtaking the natural increase from births exceeding deaths as for women the big question is whether greater percentages of them are working or searching for a job than at any point in history and on this count women have enjoyed better times women s labor force participation rate right now is 57 5 percent according to the labor department the rate has ticked up recently but it was higher in 2012 and peaked in 2000 at roughly 60 percent overall 63 2 percent of americans are working or looking for work that s a few ticks higher than when trump was inaugurated when it was 62 9 percent but far below the 2000 peak of 67 3 percent the rate has declined partly because of aging as a wave of baby boomers retire but even among younger workers it s below where it was nearly two decades ago border el paso trump the border city of el paso texas used to have extremely high rates of violent crime one of the highest in the entire country and considered one of our nation s most dangerous cities now immediately upon its building with a powerful barrier in place el paso is one of the safest cities in our country simply put walls work and walls save lives the facts that s a distorted picture of el paso where trump is going to showcase his push for a border wall el paso has never been considered one of the nation s most dangerous cities in fact its murder rate was less than half the national average in 2005 the year before the start of its border fence the city has experienced ebbs and flows in violent crime but they have largely mirrored national trends and been under national averages for decades border security trump the lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety and security and financial well being of all america the facts whether the border is sufficiently secure or not cuts to the core of a heated national debate but it s far from lawless the number of people arrested for crossing illegally has plunged in the last decade and is near its lowest level since the mid 1990s illustrating a substantial downward trend in the number of migrants trying to sneak in border patrol personnel detection technology and physical barriers have increased in that time do walls work trump these border agents will tell you where walls go up illegal crossings go way way down san diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in our country in response a strong security wall was put in place this powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings simply put walls work and walls save lives the facts it s a lot more complicated than that yes border patrol arrests in the san diego sector plummeted 96 percent from nearly 630 000 in 1986 to barely 26 000 in 2017 a period during which walls were built but the crackdown pushed illegal crossings to less patrolled and more remote arizona deserts where thousands died in the heat arrests in tucson in 2000 nearly matched san diego s peak critics say the water balloon effect build a wall in one spot and migrants will find an opening elsewhere undermines trump s argument though proponents say it only demonstrates that walls should be extended the government accountability office reported in 2017 that the u s has not developed metrics that demonstrate how barriers have contributed to border security legal immigration trump i want people to come into our country in the largest numbers ever but they have to come in legally the facts his policy recommendations to date do not reflect this wish the plan he proposed upon taking office would have sharply limited the ability of citizens and permanent residents to bring in family which he derisively called chain migration the cato institute which favors more open immigration policies estimated his plan would cut the number of legal immigrants by up to 44 percent the largest cut to legal immigration since the 1920s according to data from the homeland security department about 750 000 of more than 1 1 million people who obtained green cards in 2017 or two thirds did so through family relations trump s plan called for limiting family based green cards to spouses and minor children of u s citizens and green card holders a dramatic cut he s also slashed the number of refugees the u s will accept for two straight years and he wants to eliminate diversity visas he s talked about switching to merit based instead of family based immigration and said at times that he wants to make it easier for temporary workers to work and graduates from top colleges to stay in the country but researchers have said the net effect of his proposals would be fewer legal immigrants middle east wars trump our brave troops have now been fighting in the middle east for almost 19 years the facts trump exaggerated the length of the wars in iraq and afghanistan the war in afghanistan began in october 2001 in the aftermath of the sept 11 attacks the invasion of iraq was in march 2003 the u s has been at war for a bit more than 17 years also he refers to fighting in the middle east iraq is in the middle east but afghanistan is in central asia food stamps trump describing progress over the last two years nearly 5 million americans have been lifted off food stamps the facts the number of people receiving food stamps actually hasn t declined that much government data show there were 44 2 million people participating in the supplemental nutrition and assistance program in 2016 before trump took office in 2018 there were 40 3 million people participating in snap that s a decline of 3 9 million not the 5 million that trump talked about the number of people participating in the snap program peaked in 2013 and has been going down since that time trump s last budget proposed cutting snap by 213 billion over 10 years the administration also has been pushing to give states more flexibility in implementing the program including tightening work requirements for recipients abrams economy abrams the republican tax bill rigged the system against working people rather than bringing back jobs plants are closing layoffs are looming and wages struggle to keep pace with the actual cost of living the facts the economy is doing better after the introduction of trump administration s tax cuts than abrams suggests the number of people seeking unemployment benefits a proxy for layoffs briefly fell to a five decade low last month and average hourly pay is running ahead of inflation tariffs trump we recently imposed tariffs on 250 billion of chinese goods and now our treasury is receiving billions of dollars the facts this is misleading yes money from tariffs is going into the federal treasury but it s largely coming from u s businesses and consumers it s not foreign countries that are paying these import taxes by cutting a check to the government his reference to money coming into the treasury now belies the fact that tariffs go back to the founding of the country this revenue did not start with his increased tariffs on some goods from china tariffs did produce 41 3 billion in tax revenues in the last budget year according to the treasury department but that is a small fraction of a federal budget that exceeds 4 1 trillion the tariffs paid by u s companies also tend to result in higher prices for consumers which is what happened for washing machines after the trump administration imposed import taxes trade nafta trump our new u s mexico canada agreement or usmca will replace nafta and deliver for american workers bringing back our manufacturing jobs expanding american agriculture protecting intellectual property and ensuring that more cars are proudly stamped with the four beautiful words made in the usa the facts it s unlikely to do all those things since the new agreement largely preserves the structure and substance of nafta in addition the deal has not been ratified and its chances in congress are uncertain in one new feature the deal requires that 40 percent of cars contents eventually be made in countries that pay autoworkers at least 16 an hour that is in the united states or canada but not in mexico it also requires mexico to pursue an overhaul of labor law to encourage independent unions that will bargain for higher wages and better working conditions for mexicans still just before the agreement was signed general motors announced that it would lay off 14 000 workers and close five plants in the united states and canada philip levy senior fellow at the chicago council on global affairs and a trade official in republican president george w bush s white house says president trump has seriously overhyped this agreement drug pricing trump already as a result of my administration s efforts in 2018 drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years the facts trump is selectively citing statistics to exaggerate what seems to be a slowdown in prices a broader look at the data shows that drug prices are still rising but more moderately some independent experts say criticism from trump and congressional democrats may be causing pharmaceutical companies to show restraint the consumer price index for prescription drugs shows a o 6 percent reduction in prices in december 2018 when compared with december 2017 the biggest drop in nearly 50 years the government index tracks a set of medications including brand drugs and generics however that same index showed a 1 6 percent increase when comparing the full 12 months of 2018 with the entire previous year the annualized number gives you a better picture said economist paul hughes cromwick of altarum a nonprofit research organization it could be that something quirky happened in december separately an analysis of brand name drug prices by the associated press shows there were 2 712 price increases in the first half of this january as compared with 3 327 increases during the same period last year the size of this year s increases was not as pronounced both this year and last the number of price cuts was minuscule the information for the analysis was provided by the health data firm elsevier wages trump wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades and growing for blue collar workers who i promised to fight for they re growing faster than anyone else thought possible the facts this is an unsupported statement because the data on hourly wages for private workers only go back to 2006 not decades but data on wages for production workers date back to 1939 and trump s claim appears to be unfounded average hourly earnings for production and nonsupervisory workers are up 3 4 percent over the past year according to the labor department those wage gains were higher as recently as early 2009 and they were averaging roughly 4 percent before the start of the great recession in late 2007 there are other ways to track wage gains and those don t work in trump s favor either adjusted for inflation median weekly wages rose just 0 6 percent in 2018 the gains in weekly wages were 2 1 percent in 2015 abrams migrant children abrams in the democratic response we know bipartisanship could craft a 21st century immigration plan but this administration chooses to cage children and tear families apart the facts the cages that abrams mentions are actually chain link fences and the obama administration used them too children are held behind them inside holding border patrol facilities under the trump administration as well obama s administration detained large numbers of unaccompanied children inside chain link fences in 2014 images that circulated online of children in cages during the height of trump s family separations controversy were actually from 2014 when president barack obama was in office children are placed in such areas by age and sex for safety reasons and are held for up to 72 hours by the border patrol the department of homeland security inspector general visited five detention facilities for unaccompanied children on the texas border with mexico in late june during the height of the furor over family separations and found they appeared to comply with detention standards the government watchdog reported that cleanliness was inconsistent but that the children had access to toilets food drinks clean bedding and hygiene items at the height of the family separations about 2 400 children were separated since then 118 children were separated immigration officials are allowed to take a child from a parent in certain cases serious criminal charges against a parent concerns over the health and welfare of a child or medical concerns that policy has long been in place and is separate from the now suspended zero tolerance trump administration policy that saw children separated from parents only because they had crossed illegally minority unemployment trump african american hispanic american and asian american unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded the facts what he s not saying is that the unemployment rates for all three groups have gone up since reaching record low levels black unemployment reached a record low 5 9 percent in may but rose to 6 8 percent in january latino unemployment fell to 4 4 percent its lowest ever last october and asian unemployment fell to a record low of 2 2 percent in may but latino and asian unemployment also have increased in part because of the government shutdown which elevated unemployment last month the african american rate is still nearly double the jobless rate for whites at 3 5 percent the most dramatic drop in black unemployment came under obama when it fell from a recession high of 16 8 percent in march 2010 to 7 8 percent in january 2017 human trafficking trump human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the united states and to sell them into prostitution and modern day slavery the facts his administration has not supplied evidence that women and girls are smuggled by the thousands across remote areas of the border for these purposes what has been established is nearly 80 percent of international trafficking victims cross through legal ports of entry a flow that would not be stopped by a border wall trump distorts how often trafficking victims come from the southern border according the counter trafficking data collaborative a global hub for trafficking statistics with data contributed by organizations from around the world the national human trafficking hotline a venture supported by federal money and operated by the anti trafficking group polaris began tracking individual victim records in 2015 from january through june 31 2018 it tracked 35 000 potential victims of those there was a near equal distribution between foreigners on one hand and u s citizens and legal permanent residents on the other most of the labor trafficking victims were foreign and most of the sex trafficking victims were u s citizens of foreign nationals mexico had the most frequently trafficked economy trump in just over two years since the election we have launched an unprecedented economic boom a boom that has rarely been seen before there s been nothing like it an economic miracle is taking place in the united states the facts the president is vastly exaggerating what has been a mild improvement in growth and hiring the economy is healthy but not nearly one of the best in u s history the economy expanded at an annual rate of 3 8 percent last spring and summer a solid pace but it was just the fastest in four years in the late 1990s growth topped 4 percent for four straight years a level it has not yet reached under trump and growth even reached 7 2 percent in 1984 almost all independent economists expect slower growth this year as the effect of the trump administration s tax cuts fade trade tensions and slower global growth hold back exports and higher interest rates make it more expensive to borrow to buy cars and homes energy trump we have unleashed a revolution in american energy the united states is now the no 1 producer of oil and natural gas in the world the facts true if we means trump and his recent predecessors it s not all to trump s credit the government says the u s became the world s top natural gas producer in 2013 under the obama administration the u s now leads the world in oil production too under trump that s largely because of a boom in production from shale oil which also began under obama ___ associated press writers hope yen josh boak ricardo alonso zaldivar ellen knickmeyer jill colvin and lolita c baldor in washington

trump laced his state of the union speech with puffed up numbers and partial truths tuesday as he hailed an economic miracle warned of human traffickers flooding across the border and appeared to

into the united states and to sell them into prostitution and modern day slavery the facts his administration has not supplied evidence that women and girls are smuggled by the thousands across remote areas of the border for these purposes what has been established is nearly 80 percent of international trafficking victims cross through legal ports of entry a flow that would not be stopped by a

percent according to the labor department the rate has ticked up recently but it was higher in 2012 and peaked in 2000 at roughly 60 percent energy trump we have unleashed a revolution in american energy the united states is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world the facts true if we means trump and his recent predecessors it s not all to trump s credit the government says the u s became the world s top natural gas producer in 2013 under barack obama s administration the u s now leads the world in oil production too under trump that s largely because of a boom in

a wave of liberal economic populism has caught a number of left leaning billionaires and wall street executives off guard and they are scrambling to beat back tax and regulatory proposals that could have profound implications for the economy so far there have been only a few outspoken critics of the aggressive democratic agenda which has been led by lawmakers including rep alexandria ocasio cortez d n y and sen elizabeth warren d mass but the tension which has escalated rapidly in the past week shows how business leaders are struggling to come to grips with a party that has lost many of its corporate friendly voices the clinton and obama administrations had strong ties to wall street and california technology leaders but an emerging group of liberal leaders has rejected such relations advertisement leading the resistance so far are two potential 2020 presidential candidates former starbucks chief executive howard schultz and former new york mayor michael bloomberg as well as former goldman sachs chief executive lloyd blankfein each has spoken out in recent days about what they view as overly liberal proposals on taxation and regulation from prominent democrats all three have criticized president trump but are warning that some proposals from democrats risk pushing the country too far left and alienating broad swaths of voters their complaints have mostly been met with mockery and scorn from liberal lawmakers it should come as no surprise that a few billionaires want to continue to hoard as much wealth as possible increasing their corrupting influence over our political system said rep ilhan omar d minn the reality is we cannot make progress on the greatest challenges of our time whether climate change student debt or health care costs unless we ask those with the most to give in our society to contribute more advertisement the crux of many of the new proposals is an attempt to realign economic policy in a way that raises taxes on the wealthiest americans and in some cases forces companies to share more income with their workers instead of with their shareholders democrats propose to spend some of that new revenue on programs they believe would help lower income and middle class americans such as by expanding government run health care and assisting with college tuition the white house has sought to seize on these proposals in recent days alleging that democrats are working to tilt the country into socialism america will never be a socialist country trump said during his state of the union speech tuesday technology executives and venture capitalist have also expressed increasing concern in the past few weeks about democrats denigration of business leaders said rep ro khanna d calif whose district includes silicon valley advertisement they re open to higher marginal taxes and increasing the estate tax which you may find counterintuitive but they do say don t make us the villain khanna said they re less concerned with their net worth than they are with their social status alice rivlin who was a top economic official during bill clinton s presidency said democrats risk overestimating the public s willingness to back some of their proposals and could create a backlash that costs them political support i think the left is very energized right now but i m worried about it because the country is quite cautious and centrist she said so far few of these new proposals have even universal support among democrats and small groups of lawmakers are testing their party to gauge support many of the ideas have emerged in the past few weeks advertisement rep jan schakowsky d ill a member of the house budget committee said she is working with ocasio cortez on revising schakowsky s existing proposal to raise marginal tax rates and treat capital gains like ordinary income and other tax changes schakowsky s bill would create a new top rate of 49 percent but she said the enthusiasm for ocasio cortez s proposal may lead the bill to include much higher rates i am definitely buoyed by the fact the american people like the idea of much higher taxes for the very wealthy schakowsky said stressing that talks with ocasio cortez on the plan were preliminary it absolutely could be a big deal i think the atmosphere in which we re working has changed warren who is running for president has proposed a 2 percent annual tax on wealth above 50 million and a 3 percent annual tax on wealth above 1 billion advertisement the united states has never had a federal wealth tax and the proposal could face a court challenge on constitutional grounds if it were enacted share this article share sen bernie sanders i vt who is also expected to run for president followed warren by releasing a proposal to dramatically increase the estate tax his plan includes a 77 percent rate on the portion of estates worth more than 1 billion sanders s plan would also move the threshold at which the estate tax kicks in from about 11 million to 3 5 million and in a sign that the proposals have only begun sen brian schatz d hawaii is working on a plan whose provisions include a financial transaction tax that could hit banks for each stock trade democrats have worked on similar proposals in the past but schatz aims to design his to impose much steeper costs on financial companies advertisement senate minority leader charles e schumer n y and sanders are working on a bill that would prohibit companies from buying back their own stock and potentially limit dividend payments unless the companies first pay workers higher wages and offer a range of employment benefits at an event in new hampshire last weekend bloomberg likened warren s tax proposal to the type of policy that destroyed venezuela s economy we need a healthy economy and we shouldn t be embarrassed about our system he told reporters schultz has called a number of the ideas from democrats ridiculous and blankfein wrote tuesday on twitter that the schumer and sanders proposal to limit stock buybacks was misguided a company used to be encouraged to return money to shareholders when it couldn t reinvest in itself for a good return he wrote the money doesn t vanish it gets reinvested in higher growth businesses that boost the economy and jobs is that bad advertisement there has long been a tension between different factions of the democratic party as some of its most outspoken members are close with wall street while others are sympathetic to the occupy wall street movement democratic lawmakers have sought to bridge this divide by characterizing republican economic policies as unfairly tilted toward corporations and the wealthy this coexistence though is being put to the test even as policymakers fail to reverse income inequality the richest 1 percent of americans now control as much wealth as the bottom 95 percent according to research by emmanuel saez and gabriel zucman two left leaning economists at the university of california at berkeley only five of 36 nations in the organization for economic cooperation and development have higher levels of income inequality than the united states according to the oecd s ranking advertisement meanwhile the number of billionaires globally rose from 470 in 2000 to 2 208 in 2018 according to forbes democrats are seizing on the issue of income inequality as they fight to design the party s economic agenda ahead of the 2020 elections jeffrey sachs a columbia university economist predicted that these proposals are likely to resonate with a broad swath of americans who think both parties have done too little to help expand the middle class i think the billionaires are not panicking so much as expressing their normal bravado that we just utter the words and this will be dismissed as a rant of the left he said i think that s wrong actually and there are signs that some wall street executives are seeking out other prominent democrats who might not support the types of tax and regulatory proposals that have emerged in recent weeks larry fink chief executive of blackrock one of the world s largest asset management companies recently met with former vice president joe biden who is considering his own presidential run and in the past has urged more bipartisanship a key component of trump s appeal during the 2016 election was outreach to middle class americans particularly in the midwest who felt economically left behind and stuck with stagnant wages he floated ideas that would break up big banks impose steep taxes on hedge fund advisers and rip up trade deals he abandoned the bank proposal and ended up cutting taxes for wealthy americans but he has worked to rewrite trade relations with numerous countries something that remains popular with his supporters the economy has grown since trump took office and the unemployment rate has fallen but a number of progressives think they can reframe the economic message ahead of next year s election in a way that puts a democrat in the white house we respect the intellect of the public enough to trust them to understand what we have to say ocasio cortez said wednesday it is through fighting for working class issues while educating the public that we can win back a very wide base this has forced a number of the party s wealthiest supporters to try to intervene fearful that if they wait much longer it could be too late you don t want to get to 2020 and have some democrat look you in the eye and say hey you never said anything said douglas holtz eakin who was a top campaign adviser to republican john mccain in 2008 why are you complaining now

washington ap president donald trump hailed an economic miracle warned of human traffickers flooding across the border claimed a drop in drug prices not seen in half a century and promised the bountiful benefits from a trade deal in last night s state of the union address for her part democrat stacey abrams slammed the trump administration with a claim officials chose to cage children at the border here s an analysis from the associated press on the statements made by both speakers for truthfulness middle east wars trump our brave troops have now been fighting in the middle east for almost 19 years the facts trump exaggerated the length of the wars in iraq and afghanistan the war in afghanistan began in october 2001 in the aftermath of the sept 11 attacks the invasion of iraq was in march 2003 the u s has been at war for a bit more than 17 years also he refers to fighting in the middle east iraq is in the middle east but afghanistan is in south and central asia food stamps trump describing progress over the last two years nearly 5 million americans have been lifted off food stamps the facts the number of people receiving food stamps actually hasn t declined that much government data show there were 44 2 million people participating in the supplemental nutrition and assistance program in 2016 before trump took office in 2018 there were 40 3 million people participating in snap that s a decline of 3 9 million not the 5 million that trump talked about the number of people participating in the snap program peaked in 2013 and has been going down since that time trump s last budget proposed cutting snap by 213 billion over 10 years the administration also has been pushing to give states more flexibility in implementing the program including tightening work requirements for recipients abrams economy abrams the republican tax bill rigged the system against working people rather than bringing back jobs plants are closing layoffs are looming and wages struggle to keep pace with the actual cost of living the facts the economy is doing better in the wake of the trump administration s tax cuts than abrams suggests the number of people seeking unemployment benefits a proxy for layoffs briefly fell to a five decade low last month and average hourly pay is running ahead of inflation border wall trump these border agents will tell you where walls go up illegal crossings go way way down san diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in our country in response a strong security wall was put in place this powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings simply put walls work and walls save lives the facts it s a lot more complicated than that yes border patrol arrests in the san diego sector plummeted 96 percent from nearly 630 000 in 1986 to barely 26 000 in 2017 a period during which walls were built but the crackdown pushed illegal crossings to less patrolled and more remote arizona deserts where thousands died in the heat arrests in tucson in 2000 nearly matched san diego s peak critics say the water balloon effect build a wall in one spot and migrants will find an opening elsewhere undermines trump s argument though proponents say it only demonstrates that walls should be extended the government accountability office reported in 2017 that the u s has not developed metrics that demonstrate how barriers have contributed to border security tariffs trump we recently imposed tariffs on 250 billion of chinese goods and now our treasury is receiving billions of dollars the facts this is misleading yes money from tariffs is going into the federal treasury but it s largely coming from u s businesses and consumers it s not foreign countries that are paying these import taxes by cutting a check to the government his reference to money coming into the treasury now belies the fact that tariffs go back to the founding of the country this revenue did not start with his increased tariffs on some goods from china tariffs did produce 41 3 billion in tax revenues in the last budget year according to the treasury department but that is a small fraction of a federal budget that exceeds 4 1 trillion the tariffs paid by u s companies also tend to result in higher prices for consumers which is what happened for washing machines after the trump administration imposed import taxes trade nafta trump our new u s mexico canada agreement or usmca will replace nafta and deliver for american workers bringing back our manufacturing jobs expanding american agriculture protecting intellectual property and ensuring that more cars are proudly stamped with the four beautiful words made in the usa the facts it s unlikely to do all those things since the new agreement largely preserves the structure and substance of nafta in addition the deal has not been ratified and its chances in congress are uncertain in one new feature the deal requires that 40 percent of cars contents eventually be made in countries that pay autoworkers at least 16 an hour that is in the united states or canada but not in mexico it also requires mexico to pursue an overhaul of labor law to encourage independent unions that will bargain for higher wages and better working conditions for mexicans still just before the agreement was signed general motors announced that it would lay off 14 000 workers and close five plants in the united states and canada philip levy senior fellow at the chicago council on global affairs and a trade official in republican president george w bush s white house says president trump has seriously overhyped this agreement drug pricing trump already as a result of my administration s efforts in 2018 drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years the facts trump is selectively citing statistics to exaggerate what seems to be a slowdown in prices a broader look at the data shows that drug prices are still rising but more moderately some independent experts say criticism from trump and congressional democrats may be causing pharmaceutical companies to show restraint the consumer price index for prescription drugs shows a o 6 percent reduction in prices in december 2018 when compared with december 2017 the biggest drop in nearly 50 years the government index tracks a set of medications including brand drugs and generics however that same index showed a 1 6 percent increase when comparing the full 12 months of 2018 with the entire previous year the annualized number gives you a better picture said economist paul hughes cromwick of altarum a nonprofit research organization it could be that something quirky happened in december separately an analysis of brand name drug prices by the associated press shows there were 2 712 price increases in the first half of this january as compared with 3 327 increases during the same period last year the size of this year s increases was not as pronounced both this year and last the number of price cuts was minuscule the information for the analysis was provided by the health data firm elsevier wages trump wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades and growing for blue collar workers who i promised to fight for they re growing faster than anyone else thought possible the facts this is an unsupported statement because the data on hourly wages for private workers only go back to 2006 not decades but data on wages for production workers date back to 1939 and trump s claim appears to be unfounded average hourly earnings for production and non supervisory workers are up 3 4 percent over the past year according to the labor department those wage gains were higher as recently as early 2009 and they were averaging roughly 4 percent before the start of the great recession in late 2007 there are other ways to track wage gains and those don t work in trump s favor either adjusted for inflation median weekly wages rose just 0 6 percent in 2018 the gains in weekly wages were 2 1 percent in 2015 abrams migrant children abrams in the democratic response we know bipartisanship could craft a 21st century immigration plan but this administration chooses to cage children and tear families apart the facts the cages that abrams mentions are actually chain link fences and the obama administration used them too children are held behind them inside holding border patrol facilities under the trump administration as well obama s administration detained large numbers of unaccompanied children inside chain link fences in 2014 images that circulated online of children in cages during the height of trump s family separations controversy were actually from 2014 when obama was in office children are placed in such areas by age and sex for safety reasons and are held for up to 72 hours by the border patrol the department of homeland security inspector general visited five detention facilities for unaccompanied children on the texas border with mexico in late june during the height of the furor over family separations and found they appeared to comply with detention standards the government watchdog reported that cleanliness was inconsistent but that the children had access to toilets food drinks clean bedding and hygiene items at the height of the family separations about 2 400 children were separated since then 118 children were separated immigration officials are allowed to take a child from a parent in certain cases serious criminal charges against a parent concerns over the health and welfare of a child or medical concerns that policy has long been in place and is separate from the now suspended zero tolerance trump administration policy that saw children separated from parents only because they had crossed illegally minority unemployment trump african american hispanic american and asian american unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded the facts what he s not saying is that the unemployment rates for all three groups have gone up since reaching record low levels black unemployment reached a record low 5 9 percent in may but rose to 6 8 percent in january latino unemployment fell to 4 4 percent its lowest ever last october and asian unemployment fell to a record low of 2 2 percent in may but latino and asian unemployment also have increased in part because of the government shutdown which elevated unemployment last month the african american rate is still nearly double the jobless rate for whites at 3 5 percent the most dramatic drop in black unemployment came under president barack obama when it fell from a recession high of 16 8 percent in march 2010 to 7 8 percent in january 2017 human trafficking trump human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the united states and to sell them into prostitution and modern day slavery the facts his administration has not supplied evidence that women and girls are smuggled by the thousands across remote areas of the border for these purposes what has been established is nearly 80 percent of international trafficking victims cross through legal ports of entry a flow that would not be stopped by a border wall trump distorts how often trafficking victims come from the southern border according the counter trafficking data collaborative a global hub for trafficking statistics with data contributed by organizations from around the world the national human trafficking hotline a venture supported by federal money and operated by the anti trafficking group polaris began tracking individual victim records in 2015 from january through june 31 2018 it tracked 35 000 potential victims of those there was a near equal distribution between foreigners on one hand and u s citizens and legal permanent residents on the other most of the labor trafficking victims were foreign and most of the sex trafficking victims were u s citizens of foreign nationals mexico had the most frequently trafficked economy trump in just over two years since the election we have launched an unprecedented economic boom a boom that has rarely been seen before there s been nothing like it an economic miracle is taking place in the united states the facts the president is vastly exaggerating what has been a mild improvement in growth and hiring the economy is healthy but not nearly one of the best in u s history the economy expanded at an annual rate of 3 8 percent last spring and summer a solid pace but it was just the fastest in four years in the late 1990s growth topped 4 percent for four straight years a level it has not yet reached under trump and growth even reached 7 2 percent in 1984 almost all independent economists expect slower growth this year as the effect of the trump administration s tax cuts fade trade tensions and slower global growth hold back exports and higher interest rates make it more expensive to borrow to buy cars and homes women in workforce trump all americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before the facts of course there are more women working than ever before but that s due to population growth and not something that trump can credit to any his policies the big question is whether a greater percentage of women is working or searching for a job than at any point in history and on this count women have enjoyed better times women s labor force participation rate right now is 57 5 percent according to the labor department the rate has ticked up recently but it was higher in 2012 and peaked in 2000 at roughly 60 percent energy trump we have unleashed a revolution in american energy the united states is now

percent in january latino unemployment fell to 4 4 percent its lowest ever last october and asian unemployment fell to a record low of 2 2 percent in may but latino and asian unemployment also have increased in part because of the government shutdown which elevated unemployment last month the african american rate is still nearly double the jobless rate for whites at 3 5 percent the most dramatic drop in black unemployment came under president barack obama when it fell from a recession high of 16 8 percent in march 2010 to 7 8 percent in january 2017 human trafficking trump human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the united states and to sell them into prostitution and modern day slavery the facts his administration has not supplied evidence that women and girls are smuggled by the thousands across remote areas of the border for these purposes what has been established is nearly 80 percent of international trafficking victims cross through legal ports of entry a flow that would not be stopped by a border wall trump distorts how often trafficking victims come from the southern border according the counter trafficking data collaborative a global hub for trafficking statistics with data contributed by organizations from around the world the national

have launched an unprecedented economic boom a boom that has rarely been seen before there s been nothing like it an economic miracle is taking place in the united states the facts the president is vastly exaggerating what has been a mild improvement in growth and hiring the economy is healthy but not nearly one of the best in u s history the economy expanded at an annual rate of 3 8 percent last spring and summer a solid pace but it was just the fastest in four years in the late 1990s growth topped 4 percent for four straight years a level it has not yet reached under trump and growth even reached 7 2 percent in 1984 almost all independent economists expect slower growth this year as the effect of the trump administration s tax cuts fade trade tensions and slower global growth hold

before the facts of course there are more women working than ever before but that s due to population growth and not something that trump can credit to any his policies the big question is whether a

washington ap president donald trump laced his state of the union speech with puffed up numbers and partial truths tuesday as he hailed an economic miracle warned of human traffickers flooding across the border and appeared to place afghanistan in the middle east instead of where it is asia trump used information selectively in claiming a drop in drug prices not seen in half a century and promised the nation it would see bountiful benefits from a trade deal that hasn t been approved might not be and in any event makes only modest changes from the status quo for her part democrat stacey abrams reflected a recent and misleading talking point by her party when she slammed the trump administration for choosing to cage children at the border ignoring a practice also employed by the obama administration to hold migrant children in facilities with chain link fencing here s a look at some of the statements from state of the union night middle east wars trump our brave troops have now been fighting in the middle east for almost 19 years the facts trump exaggerated the length of the wars in iraq and afghanistan the war in afghanistan began in october 2001 in the aftermath of the sept 11 attacks the invasion of iraq was in march 2003 the u s has been at war for a bit more than 17 years also he refers to fighting in the middle east iraq is in the middle east but afghanistan is in south and central asia food stamps trump describing progress over the last two years nearly 5 million americans have been lifted off food stamps the facts the number of people receiving food stamps actually hasn t declined that much government data show there were 44 2 million people participating in the supplemental nutrition and assistance program in 2016 before trump took office in 2018 there were 40 3 million people participating in snap that s a decline of 3 9 million not the 5 million that trump talked about the number of people participating in the snap program peaked in 2013 and has been going down since that time trump s last budget proposed cutting snap by 213 billion over 10 years the administration also has been pushing to give states more flexibility in implementing the program including tightening work requirements for recipients abrams economy abrams the republican tax bill rigged the system against working people rather than bringing back jobs plants are closing layoffs are looming and wages struggle to keep pace with the actual cost of living the facts the economy is doing better in the wake of the trump administration s tax cuts than abrams suggests the number of people seeking unemployment benefits a proxy for layoffs briefly fell to a five decade low last month and average hourly pay is running ahead of inflation border wall trump these border agents will tell you where walls go up illegal crossings go way way down san diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in our country in response a strong security wall was put in place this powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings simply put walls work and walls save lives the facts it s a lot more complicated than that yes border patrol arrests in the san diego sector plummeted 96 percent from nearly 630 000 in 1986 to barely 26 000 in 2017 a period during which walls were built but the crackdown pushed illegal crossings to less patrolled and more remote arizona deserts where thousands died in the heat arrests in tucson in 2000 nearly matched san diego s peak critics say the water balloon effect build a wall in one spot and migrants will find an opening elsewhere undermines trump s argument though proponents say it only demonstrates that walls should be extended the government accountability office reported in 2017 that the u s has not developed metrics that demonstrate how barriers have contributed to border security tariffs trump we recently imposed tariffs on 250 billion of chinese goods and now our treasury is receiving billions of dollars the facts this is misleading yes money from tariffs is going into the federal treasury but it s largely coming from u s businesses and consumers it s not foreign countries that are paying these import taxes by cutting a check to the government his reference to money coming into the treasury now belies the fact that tariffs go back to the founding of the country this revenue did not start with his increased tariffs on some goods from china tariffs did produce 41 3 billion in tax revenues in the last budget year according to the treasury department but that is a small fraction of a federal budget that exceeds 4 1 trillion the tariffs paid by u s companies also tend to result in higher prices for consumers which is what happened for washing machines after the trump administration imposed import taxes trade nafta trump our new u s mexico canada agreement or usmca will replace nafta and deliver for american workers bringing back our manufacturing jobs expanding american agriculture protecting intellectual property and ensuring that more cars are proudly stamped with the four beautiful words made in the usa the facts it s unlikely to do all those things since the new agreement largely preserves the structure and substance of nafta in addition the deal has not been ratified and its chances in congress are uncertain in one new feature the deal requires that 40 percent of cars contents eventually be made in countries that pay autoworkers at least 16 an hour that is in the united states or canada but not in mexico it also requires mexico to pursue an overhaul of labor law to encourage independent unions that will bargain for higher wages and better working conditions for mexicans still just before the agreement was signed general motors announced that it would lay off 14 000 workers and close five plants in the united states and canada philip levy senior fellow at the chicago council on global affairs and a trade official in republican president george w bush s white house says president trump has seriously overhyped this agreement drug pricing trump already as a result of my administration s efforts in 2018 drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years the facts trump is selectively citing statistics to exaggerate what seems to be a slowdown in prices a broader look at the data shows that drug prices are still rising but more moderately some independent experts say criticism from trump and congressional democrats may be causing pharmaceutical companies to show restraint the consumer price index for prescription drugs shows a o 6 percent reduction in prices in december 2018 when compared with december 2017 the biggest drop in nearly 50 years the government index tracks a set of medications including brand drugs and generics however that same index showed a 1 6 percent increase when comparing the full 12 months of 2018 with the entire previous year the annualized number gives you a better picture said economist paul hughes cromwick of altarum a nonprofit research organization it could be that something quirky happened in december separately an analysis of brand name drug prices by the associated press shows there were 2 712 price increases in the first half of this january as compared with 3 327 increases during the same period last year the size of this year s increases was not as pronounced both this year and last the number of price cuts was minuscule the information for the analysis was provided by the health data firm elsevier wages trump wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades and growing for blue collar workers who i promised to fight for they re growing faster than anyone else thought possible the facts this is an unsupported statement because the data on hourly wages for private workers only go back to 2006 not decades but data on wages for production workers date back to 1939 and trump s claim appears to be unfounded average hourly earnings for production and non supervisory workers are up 3 4 percent over the past year according to the labor department those wage gains were higher as recently as early 2009 and they were averaging roughly 4 percent before the start of the great recession in late 2007 there are other ways to track wage gains and those don t work in trump s favor either adjusted for inflation median weekly wages rose just 0 6 percent in 2018 the gains in weekly wages were 2 1 percent in 2015 abrams migrant children abrams in the democratic response we know bipartisanship could craft a 21st century immigration plan but this administration chooses to cage children and tear families apart the facts the cages that abrams mentions are actually chain link fences and the obama administration used them too children are held behind them inside holding border patrol facilities under the trump administration as well obama s administration detained large numbers of unaccompanied children inside chain link fences in 2014 images that circulated online of children in cages during the height of trump s family separations controversy were actually from 2014 when obama was in office children are placed in such areas by age and sex for safety reasons and are held for up to 72 hours by the border patrol the department of homeland security inspector general visited five detention facilities for unaccompanied children on the texas border with mexico in late june during the height of the furor over family separations and found they appeared to comply with detention standards the government watchdog reported that cleanliness was inconsistent but that the children had access to toilets food drinks clean bedding and hygiene items at the height of the family separations about 2 400 children were separated since then 118 children were separated immigration officials are allowed to take a child from a parent in certain cases serious criminal charges against a parent concerns over the

the objection raised most frequently when it comes to a green new deal is its cost it s preposterous it s too expensive we just can t afford it but before scoffing at the prospect of the wealthiest nation in the history of the world funding such a project it s worth taking a look at what one of the country s poorest states was recently able to spend south carolina in a bid to expand its generation of nuclear power in recent years dropped 9 billion on a single project and has nothing to show for it the boondoggle which was covered widely in the palmetto state press but got little attention nationally sheds light on just how much money is genuinely available for an industrial level energy transformation if only the political will were there there are no firm figures tied to a green new deal but former green party presidential candidate jill stein s proposed version of the project would have cost between 700 billion and 1 trillion the new plan being crafted with the help of progressive groups like the sunrise movement and pushed to the top of the house legislative agenda by alexandria ocasio cortez and other progressives promises more substantial change on a much shorter schedule in addition to moving the u s to 100 percent renewable energy in 10 years upgrading all residential and industrial buildings for energy efficiency and eliminating greenhouse gases from manufacturing and agriculture it includes a jobs guarantee and a recognition of the rights of tribal nations ocasio cortez and massachusetts sen ed markey are planning to introduce legislation for the plan this week axios reported in south carolina lawmakers greenlighted a multibillion dollar energy project and stuck utility customers with the tab in the private sector former nuclear regulatory commissioner gregory jaczko told the intercept you would never be able to justify this the saga and related nuclear project failures calls into question the role of new nuclear energy production in the effort to decarbonize the economy new plants jaczko said take too long to build for the urgency of the climate crisis and simply aren t cost effective given advances in renewable energy i don t see nuclear as a solution to climate change jaczko said it s too expensive and would take too long if it could even be deployed there are cheaper better alternatives and even better alternatives that are getting cheaper faster the nuclear boondoggle it started in 2008 sce g and santee cooper announced plans to add two nuclear reactors to the v c summer nuclear station in jenkinsville south carolina and contracted westinghouse electric company owned by toshiba to handle construction the state s public service commission psc approved the plan in early 2009 with construction slated to begin in 2012 and the first reactor set to begin operating in 2016 in late 2011 sce g announced the project s first delay in a quarterly report to the office of regulatory staff which represents utilities in front of the psc citing module redesign production issues manpower issues and quality assurance and quality control qa qc issues the company estimated an 11 month setback and said its contractor the shaw group operating out of a facility in louisiana reported that the issues had been resolved but sce g said they were still monitoring the situation carefully and considered it to be a focus area for the project the shaw facility would later face a federal probe over unrelated allegations that workers broke protocol and falsified records which employees admitted to the company alerted more delays in mid 2013 citing manufacturing issues soon santee cooper asked sce g to bring in another company to manage the project not long after that both companies announced the project would cost 1 2 billion more than they d expected again they pushed back the project s completion date documents released as the project unraveled show that both sce g and santee cooper were well aware of shortcomings mismanagement and lack of oversight that eventually made the reactors impossible to complete years before westinghouse declared bankruptcy and both companies pulled out they were allowed to charge the customers for all the money that they spent plus a return jaczko explained even though they failed to deliver the project only 48 percent of south carolinians know about the failed program according to an october statewide poll surveying electric ratepayers the utilities are incredibly powerful political lobbies in the state jaczko said it s now 2 3 billion that they re gonna be able to get he said and that doesn t include the rate of return dominion says it s entitled to it s insane for a project that s done nothing and never will and is just a giant hole in the ground he said well a filled in hole now at this point v c summer nuclear station s unit two s turbine right and containment unit center are shown under construction near jenkinsville s c on sept 21 2016 photo chuck burton ap left with the tab thanks to a state law passed in 2007 residents in south carolina are footing the bill for a massive failed nuclear reactor program that cost a total of 9 billion analysts say that corporate mismanagement and poor oversight means residents and their families will be paying for that failed energy program which never produced a watt of energy for the next 20 years or more south carolina attorney general alan wilson has since called parts of the law the base load review act constitutionally suspect and state senators have voted to overturn it but that wouldn t necessarily get ratepayers off the hook for paying for the failed project both the justice department and the securities and exchange commission opened separate investigations into the failed project and at least 19 lawsuits have been filed against one company involved the two south carolina companies south carolina electric gas and santee cooper a state owned utility spent 9 billion on a plan to build two nuclear reactors and eventually canceled it due to a series of cost miscalculations and corporate buyouts that left one construction company bankrupt and sent shockwaves all the way to japanese tech giant toshiba dominion energy an energy giant in the region has since bought out sce g s parent company scana corp for 7 9 billion almost the entire cost of the failed project pledged to partially refund ratepayers and cut electricity rates which sce g hiked at least nine times throughout the project s first eight years in order to pay for it when asked about the failed project south carolina republican rep william timmons laughed he said ratepayers would still pay a substantial portion of the bill the scana portion which is approximately half has been substantially dealt with with their restructuring and the purchase of dominion he told the intercept what s left now is the santee cooper portion and i think that s still yet to be decided it is a major issue that the legislature s dealing with timmons said the congressman didn t have any updates on how or when the remainder of the bill would resolved after dominion bought out scana and settled their portion of the bill ratepayers are still responsible for about 2 3 billion for nothing they get nothing jaczko told the intercept they basically pay money up front for a project that never materialized and now are still gonna be asked to pay for it and that is a significant break from the way that traditional rate recovery used to work he said it used to be that you didn t start charging for a plant unless it was done and operating whether it was a nuclear plant or a coal plant or any other kind of thing but because nuclear power involves heavier upfront capital costs and financing charges jaczko explained states looking to revive nuclear power tried to bypass those extra costs by passing laws allowing companies to save money by recovering the cost of financing the projects during the period of construction even the law that was written in south carolina envisioned the fact that the project could get canceled but of course everybody promised that that wouldn t happen jaczko said sen tim scott told the intercept that it was hard to pin the blame for the disastrous project on any one entity but certainly the westinghouse bid coming back three times higher than their original estimation made the likelihood of success challenging and then all the decisions that were made pending that being an accurate price all fell apart he said he did not answer a question of whether ratepayers would have to pay 2 3 billion for nothing for conservatives and corporate friendly democrats the idea of spending absurd amounts of money on a comprehensive national plan to wean the economy off dirty energy and create sustainable jobs is out of the question it s an idea much easier to swallow when its stated purpose is corporate profit as in south carolina or at the federal level national defense president donald trump signed into law last summer a 717 billion defense bill up from 600 billion in 2016 and around 300 billion in 2000 in december the president tweeted that u s military spending was crazy for scale the national deficit for fiscal year 2019 is just shy of 1 trillion of the 4 4 trillion federal budget military spending across agencies makes up close to 800 billion the federal government spent about 1 1 trillion on health care in 2018 the latest government shutdown cost the u s an estimated 11 billion the congressional budget office reported trump requested 5 7 billion for a border wall and republicans in the house found it but 9 billion and zero nuclear reactors later ratepayers in south carolina have no say after their legislators played with the state s resources and lost if one state can throw away 9 billion on a project that never happened legislators in washington will have a difficult time claiming that they can t find federal dollars to finance a plan that 81 percent of registered voters support we can pay for a green new deal in the same way we pay for whether it s wars or tax cuts or any of the other great social programs that we have greg carlock told the intercept he s a senior adviser at data for progress where he authored a report outlining policy proposals for the green new deal unlike ocasio cortez carlock says he disagrees with the argument that you have to tax the wealthy or the middle class to pay for a green new deal instead he argues congress should just authorize new spending like it does for everything else there has been a really well crafted narrative to bring up fears about deficit spending and the debt carlock said i think that we one have to just break out of this fear that somehow this number that we call debt is a bad thing because it s not the same kind of debt that a household has or that a business has he said the driver of inflation is not how many ones and zeros we ve put out there carlock said the driver of inflation is the availability of limited biophysical resources that that money is trying to go out and buy and that s why when you think about this from a sustainability perspective a green new deal that tries to improve the sustainability of our natural resources is actually meant as a deflationary role the greatest threat to our economy and inflation is not the debt it s the climate crisis he added which will put an even greater strain on our resources the whole point of a green new deal is to mitigate those threats and it will be cheaper than the cost of future climate disasters investing in clean energy sustainable jobs and a basic standard of health care would actually save money in the long run tens to hundreds of billions of dollars per year according to a climate assessment released under the trump administration this year the argument that the money isn t there just doesn t hold up any politician whose first question about the green new deal is how to pay for it isn t taking seriously the millions who will die if we fail to take action on the scale scientists say we need stephen hanlon communications director for the sunrise movement said in a statement to the intercept what we are talking about is a putting millions of people to work so they can buy food for their families etc this is the greatest investment in the american economy in generations and that kind of investment pays substantial dividends hanlon said we will pay for this the same way we paid for the wwii sic and the original new deal deciding it s a priority as a nation and that we can t afford not to take action meanwhile a 28 billion nuclear project in georgia is headed for a similar fate
flickr we re not going to barter lower prescription drug costs for inaction in the rest of the health care industry the presentation was a broad look at the health care environment and some of house democrats legislative priorities over the next two years in a period of gop control of the senate and white house speaker pelosi has ensured that medicare for all will have hearings in the house and tapped congressman brian higgins to take the lead on medicare buy in legislation for the first time house committees will be seriously examining and tackling some of the questions and possible solutions raised by medicare for all legislation said connelly the biggest obstacles facing medicare for all right now are mitch mcconnell and donald trump he added but in the near term there is a window for democrats to press trump to help pass aggressive legislation to negotiate down the skyrocketing price of prescription drugs i was carrying around single payer signs probably before you were born so i you know i understand that aspiration this is an idea that if we had a tabula rasa if we were just starting clean would be the most cost effective way to go forward we don t have that over 120 or 150 million people in our country have employer based access to their health coverage and insurance so right now i m going to be crude now we re in my living room so i can be crude it isn t helpful to tinkle all over the aca right now right now we need to support the affordable care act and defeat what the republicans are doing pete s prophetic voice on the importance of fiscal sustainability brought together generations of policymakers no matter their political background pelosi said his legacy will endure in many ways but especially through the work of the peterson foundation which continues to focus on solutions to america s fiscal and economic challenges the u s dollar is no longer tethered to gold which means the federal government is not constrained in its spending by the need to raise revenue the federal government cannot run out of dollars this should be painfully obvious but the gold standard mentality continues to grip many lawmakers the federal government as the issuer of the u s dollar can create all the money that is needed to guarantee health care for all of its people it s the rest of us who merely use the dollar who have to worry about costs and where to come up with the money to pay a huge medical bill when our private insurer refuses to cover the cost of care about the author ryan grim is the author of the forthcoming book we ve got people the end of big money and the rise of a movement less than a month after democrats many of them running on medicare for all won back control of the house of representatives in november the top health policy aide to then prospective house speaker nancy pelosi met with blue cross blue shield executives and assured them that party leadership hadaccording to sources familiar with the meeting pelosi adviser wendell primus detailed five objections to medicare for all and said thatprimus pitched the insurers on supporting democrats on efforts to shrink drug prices specifically byprimus in a slide presentation obtained by the intercept criticized single payer on the basis of cost monies are needed for other priorities opposition stakeholders are against creates winners and losers and implementation challenges we have recreated the slides for source protection purposes he made his presentation to the blue cross executives on december 4 we don t discuss private meetings if there was such a meeting said a bcbs spokesperson primus said that he did not discuss any kind of deal with the insurers henry connelly a spokesperson for pelosi said that the assessment of single payer was not related to any dealmaking with the industry the debate over medicare for all is playing out on a number of different levels with no clear consensus over how the government run single payer health plan ought to take shape presidential candidates are arguing over whose plan is stronger and gets to full medicare for all faster with a debate raging over whether private insurance should be banned outright or operate in addition to universal medicare coverage in the house even as the idea has picked up momentum with voters and members of the democratic caucus democratic leadership has remained deeply skeptical pelosi s consistent messaging instead has been around protecting the affordable care act and lowering prescription drug prices primus concluded his presentation with a bullet point that summarized pelosi s mission on health care lower your health care costs and prescription drug prices that puts insurers and pelosi at least in one sense in alignment as both have an interest in lower costs indeed insurers regularly negotiate to lower their health care costs but in practice their efforts have had little effect on the general trend in costs even where insurers have been able to negotiate lower prices for their own customers that has done little to shrink the list price of drugs for the public at the briefing that pelosi a california democrat sees toward lower drug prices sources said the first the creates act is bipartisan legislation strongly opposed by big pharma that would make it easier for generic drug companies to get access to a sufficient quantity of medications needed to produce generics the second measure addresses what s known asin which a drug company pays a generic manufacturer to not produce a generic version of an expensive drug democratic leadership wants to ban that practice the third revolves around the issue ofwhich is a pharmaceutical industry practice of extending patent protection for a particular drug through a variety of practices democrats want to restrict evergreening to encourage cheaper generics make it to the market faster primus s approach has a strong political logic to it as taking on every health care stakeholder at once is arguably more difficult than singling out one industry and hammering away even if the effort is out of step with where progressive energy is at the moment publicly she has long said that she supports it aspirationally during an interview in 2017 with tv host joy reid she said at the time her objection to medicare for all was that it distracted from the fight to defend the aca which republicans were trying to gut pelosi said at other moments she has said that single payer isn t popular arguing also in 2017 that the comfort level with a broader base of the american people is not there yet the democratic congressional campaign committee which operates under pelosi in 2017 presented house democrats with survey data claiming that it showed that single payer was a political loser and that democrats should focus their messaging on lowering drug prices and protecting the aca yet a significant number of democrats who flipped republican districts blue in 2018 were publicly supportive of medicare for all suggesting that it isn t necessarily the albatross pelosi and the dccc believe it to be a poll from october found that more than half of republicans support the concept pelosi s agreement to hold house hearings on medicare for all came after pressure from the congressional progressive caucus yet the hearings will be held by the budget committee which unlike the powerful ways and means and energy and commerce committees would not have final jurisdiction over medicare for all in the event of a genuine attempt to pass it that the debt and deficit are among the gravest threats facing the country when peterson a billionaire who spent hundreds of millions of dollars to push washington policymakers toward austerity died in 2018 pelosi delivered a floor speech that praised him and his vision effusively speaking of the man as if he d dedicated his life to eradicating child malnutrition or curing cancer rather than as pete was a clarion voice for fiscal responsibility and a strong moral conscience in washington pelosi said in her house floor eulogy of peterson who by 2012 had already spent half a billion dollars targeting social security medicare and other spending programs two of primus s five objections to single payer before the blue cross audience related to such alleged fiscal challenges that argument though runs headlong into a surge of new interest among democrats in modern monetary theory the idea that policymakers are still constrained by a mindset that was justifiable when the u s was on the gold standard but is no longer defensible now that the u s issues a currency independent of its gold reserves proponents of mmt say this zero sum mentality has no place in a post bretton woods world said economist stephanie kelton in reaction to primus s argument that spending on medicare for all would foreclose other priorities post bretton refers to the global agreement that the dollar will be the global economy s reserve currency ultimately decoupled from gold as long as inflation remains low the government can continue to authorize additional spending that s not so much an argument as it is simply an observation of the post gold standard reality that austerity advocates like peterson have spent billions to distort said kelton a former adviser to the senate budget committee when it was chaired by sen bernie sanders this reality has been recognized by former federal reserve chairs alan greenspan and ben bernanke as well the united states can pay any debt it has because we can always print money to do that so there is zero probability of default greenspan once said
calvin woodward christopher rugaber and colleen long the associated press washington president donald trump laced his state of the union speech with puffed up numbers and partial truths tuesday as he hailed an economic miracle warned of human traffickers flooding across the border and appeared to place afghanistan in the middle east instead of where it is asia trump used information selectively in claiming a drop in drug prices not seen in half a century and promised the nation it would see bountiful benefits from a trade deal that hasn t been approved might not be and in any event makes only modest changes from the status quo for her part democrat stacey abrams reflected a recent and misleading talking point by her party when she slammed the trump administration for choosing to cage children at the border ignoring a practice also employed by the obama administration to hold migrant children in facilities with chain link fencing here s a look at some of the statements from state of the union night middle east wars trump our brave troops have now been fighting in the middle east for almost 19 years the facts trump exaggerated the length of the wars in iraq and afghanistan the war in afghanistan began in october 2001 in the aftermath of the sept 11 attacks the invasion of iraq was in march 2003 the u s has been at war for a bit more than 17 years also he refers to fighting in the middle east iraq is in the middle east but afghanistan is in south and central asia food stamps trump describing progress over the last two years nearly 5 million americans have been lifted off food stamps the facts the number of people receiving food stamps actually hasn t declined that much government data show there were 44 2 million people participating in the supplemental nutrition and assistance program in 2016 before trump took office in 2018 there were 40 3 million people participating in snap that s a decline of 3 9 million not the 5 million that trump talked about the number of people participating in the snap program peaked in 2013 and has been going down since that time trump s last budget proposed cutting snap by 213 billion over 10 years the administration also has been pushing to give states more flexibility in implementing the program including tightening work requirements for recipients abrams economy abrams the republican tax bill rigged the system against working people rather than bringing back jobs plants are closing layoffs are looming and wages struggle to keep pace with the actual cost of living the facts the economy is doing better in the wake of the trump administration s tax cuts than abrams suggests the number of people seeking unemployment benefits a proxy for layoffs briefly fell to a five decade low last month and average hourly pay is running ahead of inflation border wall trump these border agents will tell you where walls go up illegal crossings go way way down san diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in our country in response a strong security wall was put in place this powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings simply put walls work and walls save lives the facts it s a lot more complicated than that yes border patrol arrests in the san diego sector plummeted 96 percent from nearly 630 000 in 1986 to barely 26 000 in 2017 a period during which walls were built but the crackdown pushed illegal crossings to less patrolled and more remote arizona deserts where thousands died in the heat arrests in tucson in 2000 nearly matched san diego s peak critics say the water balloon effect build a wall in one spot and migrants will find an opening elsewhere undermines trump s argument though proponents say it only demonstrates that walls should be extended the government accountability office reported in 2017 that the u s has not developed metrics that demonstrate how barriers have contributed to border security tariffs trump we recently imposed tariffs on 250 billion of chinese goods and now our treasury is receiving billions of dollars the facts this is misleading yes money from tariffs is going into the federal treasury but it s largely coming from u s businesses and consumers it s not foreign countries that are paying these import taxes by cutting a check to the government his reference to money coming into the treasury now belies the fact that tariffs go back to the founding of the country this revenue did not start with his increased tariffs on some goods from china tariffs did produce 41 3 billion in tax revenues in the last budget year according to the treasury department but that is a small fraction of a federal budget that exceeds 4 1 trillion the tariffs paid by u s companies also tend to result in higher prices for consumers which is what happened for washing machines after the trump administration imposed import taxes trade nafta trump our new u s mexico canada agreement or usmca will replace nafta and deliver for american workers bringing back our manufacturing jobs expanding american agriculture protecting intellectual property and ensuring that more cars are proudly stamped with the four beautiful words made in the usa the facts it s unlikely to do all those things since the new agreement largely preserves the structure and substance of nafta in addition the deal has not been ratified and its chances in congress are uncertain in one new feature the deal requires that 40 percent of cars contents eventually be made in countries that pay autoworkers at least 16 an hour that is in the united states or canada but not in mexico it also requires mexico to pursue an overhaul of labor law to encourage independent unions that will bargain for higher wages and better working conditions for mexicans still just before the agreement was signed general motors announced that it would lay off 14 000 workers and close five plants in the united states and canada philip levy senior fellow at the chicago council on global affairs and a trade official in republican president george w bush s white house says president trump has seriously overhyped this agreement drug pricing trump already as a result of my administration s efforts in 2018 drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years the facts trump is selectively citing statistics to exaggerate what seems to be a slowdown in prices a broader look at the data shows that drug prices are still rising but more moderately some independent experts say criticism from trump and congressional democrats may be causing pharmaceutical companies to show restraint the consumer price index for prescription drugs shows a o 6 percent reduction in prices in december 2018 when compared with december 2017 the biggest drop in nearly 50 years the government index tracks a set of medications including brand drugs and generics however that same index showed a 1 6 percent increase when comparing the full 12 months of 2018 with the entire previous year the annualized number gives you a better picture said economist paul hughes cromwick of altarum a nonprofit research organization it could be that something quirky happened in december separately an analysis of brand name drug prices by the associated press shows there were 2 712 price increases in the first half of this january as compared with 3 327 increases during the same period last year the size of this year s increases was not as pronounced both this year and last the number of price cuts was minuscule the information for the analysis was provided by the health data firm elsevier wages trump wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades and growing for blue collar workers who i promised to fight for they re growing faster than anyone else thought possible the facts this is an unsupported statement because the data on hourly wages for private workers only go back to 2006 not decades but data on wages for production workers date back to 1939 and trump s claim appears to be unfounded average hourly earnings for production and non supervisory workers are up 3 4 percent over the past year according to the labor department those wage gains were higher as recently as early 2009 and they were averaging roughly 4 percent before the start of the great recession in late 2007 there are other ways to track wage gains and those don t work in trump s favor either adjusted for inflation median weekly wages rose just 0 6 percent in 2018 the gains in weekly wages were 2 1 percent in 2015 abrams migrant children abrams in the democratic response we know bipartisanship could craft a 21st century immigration plan but this administration chooses to cage children and tear families apart the facts the cages that abrams mentions are actually chain link fences and the obama administration used them too children are held behind them inside holding border patrol facilities under the trump administration as well obama s administration detained large numbers of unaccompanied children inside chain link fences in 2014 images that circulated online of children in cages during the height of trump s family separations controversy were actually from 2014 when obama was in office children are placed in such areas by age and sex for safety reasons and are held for up to 72 hours by the border patrol the department of homeland security inspector general visited five detention facilities for unaccompanied children on the texas border with mexico in late june during the height of the furor over family separations and found they appeared to comply with detention standards the government watchdog reported that cleanliness was inconsistent but that the children had access to toilets food drinks clean bedding and hygiene items at the height of the family separations about 2 400 children were separated since then 118 children were separated immigration officials are allowed to take a child from a parent in certain cases serious criminal charges against a parent concerns over the health and welfare of a child or medical concerns that policy has long been in place and is separate from the now suspended zero tolerance trump administration policy that saw children separated from parents only because they had crossed illegally minority unemployment trump african american hispanic american and asian american unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded the facts what he s not saying is that the unemployment rates for all three groups have gone up since reaching record low levels black unemployment reached a record low 5 9 percent in may but rose to 6 8 percent in january latino unemployment fell to 4 4 percent its lowest ever last october and asian unemployment fell to a record low of 2 2 percent in may but latino and asian unemployment also have increased in part because of the government shutdown which elevated unemployment last month the african american rate is still nearly double the jobless rate for whites at 3 5 percent the most dramatic drop in black unemployment came under president barack obama when it fell from a recession high of 16 8 percent in march 2010 to 7 8 percent in january 2017 human trafficking trump human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the united states and to sell them into prostitution and modern day slavery the facts his administration has not supplied evidence that women and girls are smuggled by the thousands across remote areas of the border for these purposes what has been established is nearly 80 percent of international trafficking victims cross through legal ports of entry a flow that would not be stopped by a border wall trump distorts how often trafficking victims come from the southern border according the counter trafficking data collaborative a global hub for trafficking statistics with data contributed by organizations from around the world the national human trafficking hotline a venture supported by federal money and operated by the anti trafficking group polaris began tracking individual victim records in 2015 from january through june 31 2018 it tracked 35 000 potential victims of those there was a near equal distribution between foreigners on one hand and u s citizens and legal permanent residents on the other most of the labor trafficking victims were foreign and most of the sex trafficking victims were u s citizens of foreign nationals mexico had the most frequently trafficked economy trump in just over two years since the election we have launched an unprecedented economic boom a boom that has rarely been seen before there s been nothing like it an economic miracle is taking place in the united states the facts the president is vastly exaggerating what has been a mild improvement in growth and hiring the economy is healthy but not nearly one of the best in u s history the economy expanded at an annual rate of 3 8 percent last spring and summer a solid pace but it was just the fastest in four years in the late 1990s growth topped 4 percent for four straight years a level it has not yet reached under trump and growth even reached 7 2 percent in 1984 almost all independent economists expect slower growth this year as the effect of the trump administration s tax cuts fade trade tensions and slower global growth hold back exports and higher interest rates make it more expensive to borrow to buy cars and homes women in workforce trump all americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before the facts of course there are more women working than ever before but that s due to population growth and not something that trump can credit to any his policies the big question is whether a greater percentage of women is working or searching for a job than at any point in history and on this count women have enjoyed better times women s labor force participation rate right now is 57 5 percent according to the labor department the rate has ticked up recently but it was higher in 2012 and peaked in 2000 at roughly 60 percent energy trump we have unleashed a revolution in american energy the united states is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world the facts true if we means trump and his recent predecessors it s not all to trump s credit the government says the u s became the world s top natural gas producer in 2013 under barack obama s administration the u s now leads the world in oil production too under trump that s largely because of a boom in production from shale oil which also began under obama ___ contributed by associated press writers hope yen josh boak ricardo alonso

the effects of u s trade unknowns lower oil prices and weaker housing and consumer spending are behind the recent deceleration in economic growth a bank of canada deputy governor said in a speech wednesday to help the economy get through this temporary soft patch timothy lane is expecting the lower canadian dollar to provide support lane told a washington audience that the loonie has been influenced by these factors as well as the indirect effects related to fiscal stimulus that has energized the american economy the results have led the u s federal reserve to raise interest rates he added this combination of factors has been putting downward pressure on the canadian dollar lane said in his address to the peterson institute for international economics the lower canadian dollar in turn will help support the economy through this period last month bank of canada governor stephen poloz kept his benchmark interest rate unchanged at 1 75 per cent as the economy navigates what he described as a temporary period of softness created by a recent sharp decline in world oil prices poloz said the central bank will continue raising rates once canada the economy builds new momentum a stronger economy has prompted him to hike the rate target five times since mid 2017 to keep inflation from running too hot on wednesday lane also said uncertainty related to u s trade policies has kept business investment lower than where it should be at this point given the overall strength in the canadian economy lane s speech focused on explaining how canada manages its foreign reserves which he noted are about us 85 billion or five per cent of the country s gross domestic product he described the size of canada s foreign reserves as modest yet adequate because the country has a freely floating exchange rate lane noted that other central banks and monetary authorities have started adding canadian dollar assets to their reserve portfolios following the global financial crisis about a decade ago reserves in canadian dollars are now about 200 billion he said the move to hold a portion of reserves in canadian dollars is part of a broader strategy of reserve diversification he said it is also in some sense a vote of confidence in canada reserve managers tell us they are attracted by canada s sound financial system and fiscal position as reflected in its high credit ratings
in a country that is used to turmoil the month of january will go down as a period when we literally shot ourselves in the foot in a country that is used to turmoil the month of january will go down as a period when we literally shot ourselves in the foot guest column by eddie cross the 2017 november coup brought to a close 38 years of dictatorial administration under former president robert mugabe associated with genocide human rights abuses violations of the rule of law non compliance with constitutional dictates and near total international isolation the coup was accompanied by massive popular support for the army and the small team around then fired vice president emmerson mnangagwa who engineered the whole thing the new regime was given a cautious welcome by the international community led by britain which argued that the leadership should be given the opportunity to put their house in order and thereby secure international recognition and support in july 2018 we held elections which although they were flawed resulted in a narrow victory for the incumbent president and his team however the elections also produced a house of assembly which although controlled by a majority in the ruling party was in fact deeply divided between the warring factions in zanu pf the reality is that mnangagwa went into the election and came out of it as a national leader with scant support in existing political structures the conflict in the cockpit of the state was clearly visible from the early days of the mnangagwa government centred on a struggle for power and influence between the military both political and professional and the presidential team in fact of the cabinet that governed the country between november 2017 and july 2018 the president only had minority control and influence making decisions on major issues very difficult in addition to these problems of a political nature the deeply embedded corruption that involves virtually everyone in government proved to be both resilient and capable of defending itself despite the formation of a commission to investigate and prosecute corruption virtually no prosecutions have taken place the president found it necessary to dismiss his prosecutor general ray goba simply because of non performance but of greater significance was the rush by those who control the corruption and the proceeds thereof to support the individuals in the new government who had the capacity to protect their interests the consequence was an intensification of the conflict in government and in zanu pf with those responsible for state capture using their money not only to protect their interests but to try and direct the affairs of state the new government formed after the elections was more coherent however the new executive contained five individuals without any significant political roots and while the rest constituted individuals loyal to the president unlike the first executive formed in 2017 they also represented constituencies with little national standing the president successfully removed from the executive the old guard which then was virtually parked at the zanu pf headquarters in the capital the problems facing mnangagwa are deep rooted and well established they include a highly militarised civil service and entrenched interests in all the pillars of the state and the economy associated with corruption on a scale which severely constrains national growth and stability the presidential team is tiny constituting no more than a handful of individuals loyal to mnangagwa the forces ranged against him are formidable including a powerful mdc minority in parliament which is implacably opposed to his rule and the disaffected elements in the ruling party that he has had to push aside in order to take power in addition to these problems he has to deal with individuals who are ambitious and wish not only to retain their posts in government at all costs but to seek greater control over affairs of the state these elements are hostile to the reforms which western governments consider essential in the pursuit of recognition and re engagement these conditions lay the foundation for the situation which confronted the new president when he was planning a state visit to russia and several former russian satellites intelligence had informed mnangagwa of the potential for nationwide disturbances and an effort to secure control over the state itself while he was out of the country not sufficient recognition has been given to the new regime for the many changes which have taken place since november 2017 these include reforms in the way future elections will be conducted changes in the media sector and most significantly changes in the security sector in respect to the latter the joint operations command which was essentially a dual administration under mugabe has been de politicised and restructured so that the armed forces and the security services are now led by professional officers without political authority or influence the new structures are totally loyal to the new president the thousands of retired military officers who under mugabe were fully integrated into the civil service as a third force to ensure compliance with presidential orders and dictates is being slowly unravelled the police and central intelligence organisation have been completely restructured under the new management however mnangagwa has not been able to significantly curb corruption and has turned to his finance minister mthuli ncube who is not a politician but a well respected economist with a mandate to bring back a free market economy and fiscal and monetary stability ncube has mapped out a programme of reform which involves dealing with the fiscal deficit liberalising imports and giving control over foreign exchange income to the individuals and companies involved reforms involving a reduction in the retention of foreign earnings by the reserve bank of zimbabwe rbz and a move away from the rbz mantra of an exchange rate which puts the bond note on a par with the united states dollar to a system where 80 to 100 of all foreign earnings will be retained by the individuals and companies concerned and the central bank paying a market related exchange rate for the 1 billion or so that is going to be swept into the rbz account each year what remains outstanding in this programme of reform is the demonetisation of the bond note and the adoption and implementation of a new currency controlled and administered by a professional independent monetary policy committee i expect that process to be completed by mid 2019 the effects of these reforms have been to bring zimbabwean macroeconomic fundamentals back into sound territory to devalue existing stocks of real time gross settlement and bond currencies to a more manageable level and to float the local currency against the us and the south african rand another consequence has been a rapid escalation of inflation now at hyperinflation levels and will remain at this level until the monetary situation stabilises my own view is that once all foreign inflows are valued at a market rate the rate of exchange to the us will settle down at 2 1 or 3 1 against the us as i have said on several occasions recently this will make the new currency for local transactions the strongest in the region once stability is reached in the exchange rate and people are able to buy and sell foreign exchange freely on the open market i would expect inflation levels to decline sharply and resume a more normal growth pattern of 3 to 4 per annum what is unavoidable is another massive reduction in the real value of accumulated financial assets not as extreme as that of 2008 but nevertheless reducing the value of money balances by as much as two thirds zimbabweans will have to rebuild their liquid assets using the more stable currency as they did in 2009 13 this leaves the president with the task of dealing with the conflict in the cockpit over the way forward and the prospect of instability because of rising prices and reduced living standards the last minute decision to increase fuel prices to open market levels to curb consumption was the straw that broke the camel s back the president left zimbabwe for russia and two days later mayhem broke out on the streets in the cities and towns of zimbabwe acting president constantino chiwenga reacted by attending the meeting of security heads on monday morning demanding the imposition of a state of emergency what his intentions were are not clear as the situation hardly required such extreme measures the security chiefs refused to comply but the army moved in immediately to restore order and control the internet shutdown completed the task and zimbabwe literally ground to a halt for three days hundreds of civilians were arrested amid reports of widespread looting burning vehicles and buildings and human rights abuses even torture the consequences have been catastrophic for the new administration from a public and international relations point of view this is not being assisted in any way by the manner in which the authorities responded to the crises mnangagwa was forced to cancel his davos visit and flew home to take charge upon his return conditions rapidly improved and life in zimbabwe returned to normal but the damage was done has the conflict in the cockpit been addressed i think so will it enable more rapid reform i hope so
president donald trump laced his state of the union speech with puffed up numbers and partial truths tuesday as he hailed an economic miracle warned of human traffickers flooding across the border and appeared to place afghanistan in the middle east instead of where it is asia washington ap president donald trump laced his state of the union speech with puffed up numbers and partial truths tuesday as he hailed an economic miracle warned of human traffickers flooding across the border and appeared to place afghanistan in the middle east instead of where it is asia trump used information selectively in claiming a drop in drug prices not seen in half a century and promised the nation it would see bountiful benefits from a trade deal that hasn t been approved might not be and in any event makes only modest changes from the status quo for her part democrat stacey abrams reflected a recent and misleading talking point by her party when she slammed the trump administration for choosing to cage children at the border ignoring a practice also employed by the obama administration to hold migrant children in facilities with chain link fencing here s a look at some of the statements from state of the union night middle east wars trump our brave troops have now been fighting in the middle east for almost 19 years the facts trump exaggerated the length of the wars in iraq and afghanistan the war in afghanistan began in october 2001 in the aftermath of the sept 11 attacks the invasion of iraq was in march 2003 the u s has been at war for a bit more than 17 years also he refers to fighting in the middle east iraq is in the middle east but afghanistan is in south and central asia food stamps trump describing progress over the last two years nearly 5 million americans have been lifted off food stamps the facts the number of people receiving food stamps actually hasn t declined that much government data show there were 44 2 million people participating in the supplemental nutrition and assistance program in 2016 before trump took office in 2018 there were 40 3 million people participating in snap that s a decline of 3 9 million not the 5 million that trump talked about the number of people participating in the snap program peaked in 2013 and has been going down since that time trump s last budget proposed cutting snap by 213 billion over 10 years the administration also has been pushing to give states more flexibility in implementing the program including tightening work requirements for recipients abrams economy abrams the republican tax bill rigged the system against working people rather than bringing back jobs plants are closing layoffs are looming and wages struggle to keep pace with the actual cost of living the facts the economy is doing better in the wake of the trump administration s tax cuts than abrams suggests the number of people seeking unemployment benefits a proxy for layoffs briefly fell to a five decade low last month and average hourly pay is running ahead of inflation border wall trump these border agents will tell you where walls go up illegal crossings go way way down san diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in our country in response a strong security wall was put in place this powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings simply put walls work and walls save lives the facts it s a lot more complicated than that yes border patrol arrests in the san diego sector plummeted 96 percent from nearly 630 000 in 1986 to barely 26 000 in 2017 a period during which walls were built but the crackdown pushed illegal crossings to less patrolled and more remote arizona deserts where thousands died in the heat arrests in tucson in 2000 nearly matched san diego s peak critics say the water balloon effect build a wall in one spot and migrants will find an opening elsewhere undermines trump s argument though proponents say it only demonstrates that walls should be extended the government accountability office reported in 2017 that the u s has not developed metrics that demonstrate how barriers have contributed to border security tariffs trump we recently imposed tariffs on 250 billion of chinese goods and now our treasury is receiving billions of dollars the facts this is misleading yes money from tariffs is going into the federal treasury but it s largely coming from u s businesses and consumers it s not foreign countries that are paying these import taxes by cutting a check to the government his reference to money coming into the treasury now belies the fact that tariffs go back to the founding of the country this revenue did not start with his increased tariffs on some goods from china tariffs did produce 41 3 billion in tax revenues in the last budget year according to the treasury department but that is a small fraction of a federal budget that exceeds 4 1 trillion the tariffs paid by u s companies also tend to result in higher prices for consumers which is what happened for washing machines after the trump administration imposed import taxes trade nafta trump our new u s mexico canada agreement or usmca will replace nafta and deliver for american workers bringing back our manufacturing jobs expanding american agriculture protecting intellectual property and ensuring that more cars are proudly stamped with the four beautiful words made in the usa the facts it s unlikely to do all those things since the new agreement largely preserves the structure and substance of nafta in addition the deal has not been ratified and its chances in congress are uncertain in one new feature the deal requires that 40 percent of cars contents eventually be made in countries that pay autoworkers at least 16 an hour that is in the united states or canada but not in mexico it also requires mexico to pursue an overhaul of labor law to encourage independent unions that will bargain for higher wages and better working conditions for mexicans still just before the agreement was signed general motors announced that it would lay off 14 000 workers and close five plants in the united states and canada philip levy senior fellow at the chicago council on global affairs and a trade official in republican president george w bush s white house says president trump has seriously overhyped this agreement drug pricing trump already as a result of my administration s efforts in 2018 drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years the facts trump is selectively citing statistics to exaggerate what seems to be a slowdown in prices a broader look at the data shows that drug prices are still rising but more moderately some independent experts say criticism from trump and congressional democrats may be causing pharmaceutical companies to show restraint the consumer price index for prescription drugs shows a o 6 percent reduction in prices in december 2018 when compared with december 2017 the biggest drop in nearly 50 years the government index tracks a set of medications including brand drugs and generics however that same index showed a 1 6 percent increase when comparing the full 12 months of 2018 with the entire previous year the annualized number gives you a better picture said economist paul hughes cromwick of altarum a nonprofit research organization it could be that something quirky happened in december separately an analysis of brand name drug prices by the associated press shows there were 2 712 price increases in the first half of this january as compared with 3 327 increases during the same period last year the size of this year s increases was not as pronounced both this year and last the number of price cuts was minuscule the information for the analysis was provided by the health data firm elsevier wages trump wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades and growing for blue collar workers who i promised to fight for they re growing faster than anyone else thought possible the facts this is an unsupported statement because the data on hourly wages for private workers only go back to 2006 not decades but data on wages for production workers date back to 1939 and trump s claim appears to be unfounded average hourly earnings for production and non supervisory workers are up 3 4 percent over the past year according to the labor department those wage gains were higher as recently as early 2009 and they were averaging roughly 4 percent before the start of the great recession in late 2007 there are other ways to track wage gains and those don t work in trump s favor either adjusted for inflation median weekly wages rose just 0 6 percent in 2018 the gains in weekly wages were 2 1 percent in 2015 abrams migrant children abrams in the democratic response we know bipartisanship could craft a 21st century immigration plan but this administration chooses to cage children and tear families apart the facts the cages that abrams mentions are actually chain link fences and the obama administration used them too children are held behind them inside holding border patrol facilities under the trump administration as well obama s administration detained large numbers of unaccompanied children inside chain link fences in 2014 images that circulated online of children in cages during the height of trump s family separations controversy were actually from 2014 when obama was in office children are placed in such areas by age and sex for safety reasons and are held for up to 72 hours by the border patrol the department of homeland security inspector general visited five detention facilities for unaccompanied children on the texas border with mexico in late june during the height of the furor over family separations and found they appeared to comply with detention standards the government watchdog reported that cleanliness was inconsistent but that the children had access to toilets food drinks clean bedding and hygiene items at the height of the family separations about 2 400 children were separated since then 118 children were separated immigration officials are allowed to take a child from a parent in certain cases serious criminal charges against a parent concerns over the health and welfare of a child or medical concerns that policy has long been in place and is separate from the now suspended zero tolerance trump administration policy that saw children separated from parents only because they had crossed illegally minority unemployment trump african american hispanic american and asian american unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded the facts what he s not saying is that the unemployment rates for all three groups have gone up since reaching record low levels black unemployment reached a record low 5 9 percent in may but rose to 6 8 percent in january latino unemployment fell to 4 4 percent its lowest ever last october and asian unemployment fell to a record low of 2 2 percent in may but latino and asian unemployment also have increased in part because of the government shutdown which elevated unemployment last month the african american rate is still nearly double the jobless rate for whites at 3 5 percent the most dramatic drop in black unemployment came under president barack obama when it fell from a recession high of 16 8 percent in march 2010 to 7 8 percent in january 2017 human trafficking trump human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the united states and to sell them into prostitution and modern day slavery the facts his administration has not supplied evidence that women and girls are smuggled by the thousands across remote areas of the border for these purposes what has been established is nearly 80 percent of international trafficking victims cross through legal ports of entry a flow that would not be stopped by a border wall trump distorts how often trafficking victims come from the southern border according the counter trafficking data collaborative a global hub for trafficking statistics with data contributed by organizations from around the world the national human trafficking hotline a venture supported by federal money and operated by the anti trafficking group polaris began tracking individual victim records in 2015 from january through june 31 2018 it tracked 35 000 potential victims of those there was a near equal distribution between foreigners on one hand and u s citizens and legal permanent residents on the other most of the labor trafficking victims were foreign and most of the sex trafficking victims were u s citizens of foreign nationals mexico had the most frequently trafficked economy trump in just over two years since the election we have launched an unprecedented economic boom a boom that has rarely been seen before there s been nothing like it an economic miracle is taking place in the united states the facts the president is vastly exaggerating what has been a mild improvement in growth and hiring the economy is healthy but not nearly one of the best in u s history the economy expanded at an annual rate of 3 8 percent last spring and summer a solid pace but it was just the fastest in four years in the late 1990s growth topped 4 percent for four straight years a level it has not yet reached under trump and growth even reached 7 2 percent in 1984 almost all independent economists expect slower growth this year as the effect of the trump administration s tax cuts fade trade tensions and slower global growth hold back exports and higher interest rates make it more expensive to borrow to buy cars and homes women in workforce trump all americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before the facts of course there are more women working than ever before but that s due to population growth and not something that trump can credit to any his policies the big question is whether a greater percentage of women is working or searching for a job than at any point in history and on this count women have enjoyed better times women s labor force participation rate right now is 57 5 percent according to the labor department the rate has ticked up recently but it was higher in 2012 and peaked in 2000 at roughly 60 percent energy trump we have unleashed a revolution in american energy the united states is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world the facts true if we means trump and his recent predecessors it s not all to trump s credit the government says the u s became the world s top natural gas producer in 2013 under barack obama s administration the u s now leads the world in oil production too under trump that s largely because of a boom in production from shale oil which also began under obama trump citing legislation in new york and virginia in calling on congress to ban late term abortion and then we had the case of the governor of virginia where he stated he would execute a baby after birth the facts that s not what virginia gov ralph northam said northam told a radio interviewer that he supported state legislation that would allow late term abortions and noted that the procedures were usually done if the fetus had severe deformities or wasn t viable describing a hypothetical situation he said if a woman were to desire an abortion as she s going into labor the baby would be delivered and resuscitated if that s what the mother and the family desired and then a discussion would ensue between doctors and the mother some republicans said that showed northam a democrat was supporting infanticide the governor s spokeswoman said northam a pediatric neurologist was only trying to describe the tragic or difficult circumstances involved in a late term abortion ___ contributed by associated press writers hope yen josh boak ricardo alonso

japan is currently enjoying its longest economic expansion since world war ii with the lowest jobless rate in decades record corporate profits and rising wages yet the world s third largest economy is seen posting only around 1 percent gross domestic product gdp growth in 2019 amid sluggish inflation high public debt and headwinds including october s planned consumption tax hike the u s china trade war and a slowing global economy pacific money spoke to tokyo based economist wisdomtree japan s jesper koll on what to expect in the year of the pig a year which will also see the imperial succession upper house elections and japan s hosting of the g20 summit meeting along with the rugby world cup pacific money japan s consumption tax rate increases this october to 10 percent from 8 percent each of the last three times the rate has gone up the economy has fallen into recession what will prevent this happening in 2019 jesper koll that s correct it s been three hikes for three recessions abe is very cognizant of that also remember it s actually the first vat hike that abe has to take full responsibility for the previous one was part of the agreement that got the democrats out of power he did actually postpone it once and now he s committed to it but the bottom line is the budget for 2019 has almost the equivalent of the revenue raised from the vat being spent on households they re making education free for preschoolers they re increasing transfers to households there will be gift coupons there will still be economic volatility with people buying ahead and not buying afterwards but i think the risk of recession because of the vat hike is actually very low looking at key risks for 2019 a survey of japanese business leaders by the yomiuri shimbun pointed to the u s china trade war as the top concern do you agree japanese firms export dependency is very high overseas earnings average 61 percent of total earnings of which 25 percent is from the u s and 15 percent from china more important for japan with the u s china trade war is it has created an enormous amount of uncertainty among businesspeople people need to build new factories they need to add capacity in asia as asia is growing now business leaders are thinking where do i build a new factory because of uncertainty over tariffs a lot of japanese and asian companies have simply put their investment plans on hold on monetary policy when can we expect a tightening from the bank of japan boj this is the most boring conversation five years ago i said it wouldn t happen until after the 2020 olympics kuroda is very clear he said three months ago the risk has become asymmetric with external factors pointing to downside risk so for the boj monetary policy is a most boring debate what people miss is that fiscal policy is much more complicated it s like making sausage it s a bloody and messy business but there s a lot of fiscal spending that is happening they ve just passed the highest budget ever the borrowing requirements continue to go up debt is now at over 260 percent of gdp is that debt level a concern as an economist you would say of course it s a concern normally you would say with such a debt there s a risk of a currency crisis but the yen is not exactly in free fall looking at the debt is not going to help me make money either as a businessperson or as an investor in yen assets the most interesting story the most important one is that japan is the only country where a new middle class is rising due to demographics a middle class rising can you explain that given japan s shrinking population it s simple demand and supply the number of high school and university graduates is falling every year by about 50 000 kids this means the value of those kids is going to be bid up average wages are rising by 2 to 2 5 percent but starting salaries for university graduates are rising by almost 6 percent you and i want to be reborn as a 23 year old japanese now that s the interesting thing as a businessperson is the japanese market a market of opportunity the answer is absolutely yes because the purchasing power of the people is actually going up the boj will never achieve its 2 percent inflation target and that s a good thing who wants 2 percent inflation i want wages growth remember that in japan about 40 percent of all prices are regulated by the government and the government is ruthless in cutting regulated prices to keep purchasing power high such as in the case of the telcos six months ago they called in the ceos of the telcos showed them a chart and showed them that the japanese price of a mobile phone contract is basically 40 percent higher than anywhere else in the world go and cut it and that s awesome that s good government healthcare same thing for this year 2019 healthcare costs pharmaceutical costs are ordered to fall by 8 5 percent as a person that is awesome especially the older generation japan is now in its longest period of growth since world war ii how are you seeing the outlook japan is not a high growth economy the run rate is about 1 to 1 25 percent then you add or subtract almost a full percentage point based on the world economy if the world economy is slowing from about 3 5 percent growth to 2 5 percent japan is going to bear some brunt of it that s why the best place to hide from a global recession is japanese small and medium sized companies concerning abenomics how is it progressing with the third arrow of structural reforms the answer is there are aspects of structural reform that are working well you ve got this incredible increase in the female participation rate so womenomics that part of structural reform is huge as it goes into empowerment the way companies are run and consumer behavior so it s a big impact corporate governance too when you look at share buybacks dividends that s all working in ways that even five to six years ago you would have thought japan would never do this the missing link i think is the corporate mindset looking at only their small little world the world of mitsubishi or sumitomo rather than being more lateral thinkers and being more open that still requires a lot of work the final point a positive thing which the government is helping is entrepreneurship if you look at start ups venture capital that ecosystem in japan has gotten better so for example they ve given some tax incentives for angel investment not huge but at the margin it helps the abe administration recently announced plans to increase immigration how much is this going to help a declining population regarding immigration the japanese are very pragmatic one in three working at convenience stores are now non japanese but the more interesting question is integrating non japanese opinions and leadership at the top level at the board level and there obviously japanese companies are struggling there are many aspects about the ghosn saga but this is obviously one of the elements the real issue to me is not whether there will be more construction workers that s an interesting issue and the government is dealing with it but will you ever see an australian german american or chinese in the c suite of one of the fortune 50 japanese companies looking at prime minister abe he will be in power until at least 2021 what would you like him to achieve before then i think his legacy is going to be actually righting the japan china relationship last year they had the first bilateral summit in beijing this year there will be one possibly two bilateral summits there s a lot more going on now between japan and china ironically the implosion of the u s works in favor of that my dream is that abe persuades xi to join the tpp for the tpp the real issue is ip and state owned enterprises in china they ve just announced a state entity to deal with ip that s huge and to get into the tpp is very easy you don t have to do it now just show a path so mark my words if trump gets re elected china will join the tpp
feature article 06 02 2019 listen president akufo addo during his campaign in ayawasu west wuogon by election on 29 january 2019 president akufo addo proudly showed a paper which he claimed to have

convince electorates about the promises they gave when you ask them they will point to free shs teachers and nurses allowance as 2020 is approaching they have schemed a plan called white wash that is listing anything across as promise fulfilment about half of the 41 claimed fulfilled promises were are not even in their manifestoes even if they were are putting them under scrutiny it comes to light

calvin woodward christopher rugaber and colleen long the associated press washington president donald trump laced his state of the union speech with puffed up numbers and partial truths tuesday as he hailed an economic miracle warned of human traffickers flooding across the border and appeared to place afghanistan in the middle east instead of where it is asia trump used information selectively in claiming a drop in drug prices not seen in half a century and promised the nation it would see bountiful benefits from a trade deal that hasn t been approved might not be and in any event makes only modest changes from the status quo for her part democrat stacey abrams reflected a recent and misleading talking point by her party when she slammed the trump administration for choosing to cage children at the border ignoring a practice also employed by the obama administration to hold migrant children in facilities with chain link fencing here s a look at some of the statements from state of the union night middle east wars trump our brave troops have now been fighting in the middle east for almost 19 years the facts trump exaggerated the length of the wars in iraq and afghanistan the war in afghanistan began in october 2001 in the aftermath of the sept 11 attacks the invasion of iraq was in march 2003 the u s has been at war for a bit more than 17 years also he refers to fighting in the middle east iraq is in the middle east but afghanistan is in south and central asia food stamps trump describing progress over the last two years nearly 5 million americans have been lifted off food stamps the facts the number of people receiving food stamps actually hasn t declined that much government data show there were 44 2 million people participating in the supplemental nutrition and assistance program in 2016 before trump took office in 2018 there were 40 3 million people participating in snap that s a decline of 3 9 million not the 5 million that trump talked about the number of people participating in the snap program peaked in 2013 and has been going down since that time trump s last budget proposed cutting snap by 213 billion over 10 years the administration also has been pushing to give states more flexibility in implementing the program including tightening work requirements for recipients abrams economy abrams the republican tax bill rigged the system against working people rather than bringing back jobs plants are closing layoffs are looming and wages struggle to keep pace with the actual cost of living the facts the economy is doing better in the wake of the trump administration s tax cuts than abrams suggests the number of people seeking unemployment benefits a proxy for layoffs briefly fell to a five decade low last month and average hourly pay is running ahead of inflation border wall trump these border agents will tell you where walls go up illegal crossings go way way down san diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in our country in response a strong security wall was put in place this powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings simply put walls work and walls save lives the facts it s a lot more complicated than that yes border patrol arrests in the san diego sector plummeted 96 percent from nearly 630 000 in 1986 to barely 26 000 in 2017 a period during which walls were built but the crackdown pushed illegal crossings to less patrolled and more remote arizona deserts where thousands died in the heat arrests in tucson in 2000 nearly matched san diego s peak critics say the water balloon effect build a wall in one spot and migrants will find an opening elsewhere undermines trump s argument though proponents say it only demonstrates that walls should be extended the government accountability office reported in 2017 that the u s has not developed metrics that demonstrate how barriers have contributed to border security tariffs trump we recently imposed tariffs on 250 billion of chinese goods and now our treasury is receiving billions of dollars the facts this is misleading yes money from tariffs is going into the federal treasury but it s largely coming from u s businesses and consumers it s not foreign countries that are paying these import taxes by cutting a check to the government his reference to money coming into the treasury now belies the fact that tariffs go back to the founding of the country this revenue did not start with his increased tariffs on some goods from china tariffs did produce 41 3 billion in tax revenues in the last budget year according to the treasury department but that is a small fraction of a federal budget that exceeds 4 1 trillion the tariffs paid by u s companies also tend to result in higher prices for consumers which is what happened for washing machines after the trump administration imposed import taxes trade nafta trump our new u s mexico canada agreement or usmca will replace nafta and deliver for american workers bringing back our manufacturing jobs expanding american agriculture protecting intellectual property and ensuring that more cars are proudly stamped with the four beautiful words made in the usa the facts it s unlikely to do all those things since the new agreement largely preserves the structure and substance of nafta in addition the deal has not been ratified and its chances in congress are uncertain in one new feature the deal requires that 40 percent of cars contents eventually be made in countries that pay autoworkers at least 16 an hour that is in the united states or canada but not in mexico it also requires mexico to pursue an overhaul of labor law to encourage independent unions that will bargain for higher wages and better working conditions for mexicans still just before the agreement was signed general motors announced that it would lay off 14 000 workers and close five plants in the united states and canada philip levy senior fellow at the chicago council on global affairs and a trade official in republican president george w bush s white house says president trump has seriously overhyped this agreement drug pricing trump already as a result of my administration s efforts in 2018 drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years the facts trump is selectively citing statistics to exaggerate what seems to be a slowdown in prices a broader look at the data shows that drug prices are still rising but more moderately some independent experts say criticism from trump and congressional democrats may be causing pharmaceutical companies to show restraint the consumer price index for prescription drugs shows a o 6 percent reduction in prices in december 2018 when compared with december 2017 the biggest drop in nearly 50 years the government index tracks a set of medications including brand drugs and generics however that same index showed a 1 6 percent increase when comparing the full 12 months of 2018 with the entire previous year the annualized number gives you a better picture said economist paul hughes cromwick of altarum a nonprofit research organization it could be that something quirky happened in december separately an analysis of brand name drug prices by the associated press shows there were 2 712 price increases in the first half of this january as compared with 3 327 increases during the same period last year the size of this year s increases was not as pronounced both this year and last the number of price cuts was minuscule the information for the analysis was provided by the health data firm elsevier wages trump wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades and growing for blue collar workers who i promised to fight for they re growing faster than anyone else thought possible the facts this is an unsupported statement because the data on hourly wages for private workers only go back to 2006 not decades but data on wages for production workers date back to 1939 and trump s claim appears to be unfounded average hourly earnings for production and non supervisory workers are up 3 4 percent over the past year according to the labor department those wage gains were higher as recently as early 2009 and they were averaging roughly 4 percent before the start of the great recession in late 2007 there are other ways to track wage gains and those don t work in trump s favor either adjusted for inflation median weekly wages rose just 0 6 percent in 2018 the gains in weekly wages were 2 1 percent in 2015 abrams migrant children abrams in the democratic response we know bipartisanship could craft a 21st century immigration plan but this administration chooses to cage children and tear families apart the facts the cages that abrams mentions are actually chain link fences and the obama administration used them too children are held behind them inside holding border patrol facilities under the trump administration as well obama s administration detained large numbers of unaccompanied children inside chain link fences in 2014 images that circulated online of children in cages during the height of trump s family separations controversy were actually from 2014 when obama was in office children are placed in such areas by age and sex for safety reasons and are held for up to 72 hours by the border patrol the department of homeland security inspector general visited five detention facilities for unaccompanied children on the texas border with mexico in late june during the height of the furor over family separations and found they appeared to comply with detention standards the government watchdog reported that cleanliness was inconsistent but that the children had access to toilets food drinks clean bedding and hygiene items at the height of the family separations about 2 400 children were separated since then 118 children were separated immigration officials are allowed to take a child from a parent in certain cases serious criminal charges against a parent concerns over the health and welfare of a child or medical concerns that policy has long been in place and is separate from the now suspended zero tolerance trump administration policy that saw children separated from parents only because they had crossed illegally minority unemployment trump african american hispanic american and asian american unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded the facts what he s not saying is that the unemployment rates for all three groups have gone up since reaching record low levels black unemployment reached a record low 5 9 percent in may but rose to 6 8 percent in january latino unemployment fell to 4 4 percent its lowest ever last october and asian unemployment fell to a record low of 2 2 percent in may but latino and asian unemployment also have increased in part because of the government shutdown which elevated unemployment last month the african american rate is still nearly double the jobless rate for whites at 3 5 percent the most dramatic drop in black unemployment came under president barack obama when it fell from a recession high of 16 8 percent in march 2010 to 7 8 percent in january 2017 human trafficking trump human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the united states and to sell them into prostitution and modern day slavery the facts his administration has not supplied evidence that women and girls are smuggled by the thousands across remote areas of the border for these purposes what has been established is nearly 80 percent of international trafficking victims cross through legal ports of entry a flow that would not be stopped by a border wall trump distorts how often trafficking victims come from the southern border according the counter trafficking data collaborative a global hub for trafficking statistics with data contributed by organizations from around the world the national human trafficking hotline a venture supported by federal money and operated by the anti trafficking group polaris began tracking individual victim records in 2015 from january through june 31 2018 it tracked 35 000 potential victims of those there was a near equal distribution between foreigners on one hand and u s citizens and legal permanent residents on the other most of the labor trafficking victims were foreign and most of the sex trafficking victims were u s citizens of foreign nationals mexico had the most frequently trafficked economy trump in just over two years since the election we have launched an unprecedented economic boom a boom that has rarely been seen before there s been nothing like it an economic miracle is taking place in the united states the facts the president is vastly exaggerating what has been a mild improvement in growth and hiring the economy is healthy but not nearly one of the best in u s history the economy expanded at an annual rate of 3 8 percent last spring and summer a solid pace but it was just the fastest in four years in the late 1990s growth topped 4 percent for four straight years a level it has not yet reached under trump and growth even reached 7 2 percent in 1984 almost all independent economists expect slower growth this year as the effect of the trump administration s tax cuts fade trade tensions and slower global growth hold back exports and higher interest rates make it more expensive to borrow to buy cars and homes women in workforce trump all americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before the facts of course there are more women working than ever before but that s due to population growth and not something that trump can credit to any his policies the big question is whether a greater percentage of women is working or searching for a job than at any point in history and on this count women have enjoyed better times women s labor force participation rate right now is 57 5 percent according to the labor department the rate has ticked up recently but it was higher in 2012 and peaked in 2000 at roughly 60 percent energy trump we have unleashed a revolution in american energy the united states is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world the facts true if we means trump and his recent predecessors it s not all to trump s credit the government says the u s became the world s top natural gas producer in 2013 under barack obama s administration the u s now leads the world in oil production too under trump that s largely because of a boom in production from shale oil which also began under obama ___ contributed by associated press writers hope yen josh boak ricardo alonso

and the length of wars and told partial truths on drug prices in his state of the union speech trump also celebrated a couple of workforce measures that have little to do with him and almost everything to do with a growing population in her democratic response to the speech stacey abrams reflected a recent and misleading talking point by her party when she slammed the trump administration for choosing to cage children at the border ignoring a practice also employed by the obama administration to hold migrant children in facilities with chain link fencing here s a look at some of the statements from state of the union night labor force trump all americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before trump more people are working now than at any time in the history of our country one hundred fifty seven million people at work the facts yes but that s because the population has grown it s more than doubled since 1950 and in recent months it s been increasing by 150 000 to nearly 200 000 per month births are the primary driver of population growth with immigration also contributing in 2030 that s expected to change with immigration overtaking the natural increase from births exceeding deaths as for women the big question is whether greater percentages of them are working or searching for a job than at any point in history and on this count women have enjoyed better times women s labor force participation rate right now is 57 5 percent according to the labor department the rate has ticked up recently but it was higher in 2012 and peaked in 2000 at roughly 60 percent overall 63 2 percent of americans are working or looking for work that s a few ticks higher than when trump was inaugurated when it was 62 9 percent but far below the 2000 peak of 67 3 percent the rate has declined partly because of aging as a wave of baby boomers retire but even among younger workers it s below where it was nearly two decades ago border el paso trump the border city of el paso texas used to have extremely high rates of violent crime one of the highest in the entire country and considered one of our nation s most dangerous cities now immediately upon its building with a powerful barrier in place el paso is one of the safest cities in our country simply put walls work and walls save lives the facts that s a distorted picture of el paso where trump is going to showcase his push for a border wall el paso has never been considered one of the nation s most dangerous cities in fact its murder rate was less than half the national average in 2005 the year before the start of its border fence the city has experienced ebbs and flows in violent crime but they have largely mirrored national trends and been under national averages for decades border security trump the lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety and security and financial well being of all america the facts whether the border is sufficiently secure or not cuts to the core of a heated national debate but it s far from lawless the number of people arrested for crossing illegally has plunged in the last decade and is near its lowest level since the mid 1990s illustrating a substantial downward trend in the number of migrants trying to sneak in border patrol personnel detection technology and physical barriers have increased in that time do walls work trump these border agents will tell you where walls go up illegal crossings go way way down san diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in our country in response a strong security wall was put in place this powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings simply put walls work and walls save lives the facts it s a lot more complicated than that yes border patrol arrests in the san diego sector plummeted 96 percent from nearly 630 000 in 1986 to barely 26 000 in 2017 a period during which walls were built but the crackdown pushed illegal crossings to less patrolled and more remote arizona deserts where thousands died in the heat arrests in tucson in 2000 nearly matched san diego s peak critics say the water balloon effect build a wall in one spot and migrants will find an opening elsewhere undermines trump s argument though proponents say it only demonstrates that walls should be extended the government accountability office reported in 2017 that the u s has not developed metrics that demonstrate how barriers have contributed to border security legal immigration trump i want people to come into our country in the largest numbers ever but they have to come in legally the facts his policy recommendations to date do not reflect this wish the plan he proposed upon taking office would have sharply limited the ability of citizens and permanent residents to bring in family which he derisively called chain migration the cato institute which favors more open immigration policies estimated his plan would cut the number of legal immigrants by up to 44 percent the largest cut to legal immigration since the 1920s according to data from the homeland security department about 750 000 of more than 1 1 million people who obtained green cards in 2017 or two thirds did so through family relations trump s plan called for limiting family based green cards to spouses and minor children of u s citizens and green card holders a dramatic cut he s also slashed the number of refugees the u s will accept for two straight years and he wants to eliminate diversity visas he s talked about switching to merit based instead of family based immigration and said at times that he wants to make it easier for temporary workers to work and graduates from top colleges to stay in the country but researchers have said the net effect of his proposals would be fewer legal immigrants middle east wars trump our brave troops have now been fighting in the middle east for almost 19 years the facts trump exaggerated the length of the wars in iraq and afghanistan the war in afghanistan began in october 2001 in the aftermath of the sept 11 attacks the invasion of iraq was in march 2003 the u s has been at war for a bit more than

including tightening work requirements for recipients abrams economy abrams the republican tax bill rigged the system against working people rather than bringing back jobs plants are closing layoffs

year results and finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2019 that will then take more details of both our fourth quarter performance and forecast for the year revenues for the fourth quarter of 2018 were 6 1 billion an increase of 12 compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 with growth in all of our operation segments and major geographic markets ebitda was 896 million or 14 6 compared to 769 million or 14 a year ago ebitda increased as a percent of sales due to the benefit of higher volumes improved pricing lower working costs and the absence of tax reform impact on jv earnings in the fourth quarter last year these positive factors more than offset an increase in research and engineering to support new product development and the negative impact of tariffs for the full year cummins sales were a record 23 8 billion up 16 year over year our ebitda margins were 14 6 compared to 14 8 in 2017 with the impact of higher sales improved pricing and the benefit of cost reduction programs offset by product campaign charges in the first half of the year and the increase in research and engineering ebitda dollars were a record 3 5 billion advertisement advertisement engine business sales increased by 18 in 2018 due to stronger production of heavy and medium duty in north america and higher demand for construction equipment globally ebitda was 13 7 compared to 12 8 in 2017 due to the positive impact of higher revenues and improved pricing partially offset by product campaign charges sales for our distribution business grew by 11 driven by increased demand in north america and europe full year ebitda was 7 2 compared to 7 1 in 2017 with the benefit of improved pricing offset by the impact of strong us dollar and currency volatility in africa full year revenues for the component segment increased by 22 due to higher truck production in north america europe india and brazil the automated transmission business contributed 6 to segment growth for the full year ebitda was 14 4 compared to 15 6 in 2017 as the benefits of higher sales and material cost reduction programs were more than offset by product campaign costs and the dilutive effect of the new automated transmission business the automated transmission business delivered revenues of 543 million in 2018 driven by stronger demand in the north american heavy duty truck market as well as higher than expected penetration rates of automatic manual transmissions which reached 73 of new heavy duty trucks in 2018 customer feedback on the new endurant transmission has been very positive and joint venture profitability is benefiting from transitioning to selling the new and improved products power systems sales increased by 14 in 2018 driven by higher demand for power generation equipment and an increase in sales to oil and gas and mining customers ebitda was 13 3 compared to 10 1 in 2017 driven by the positive impact of higher sales lower warranty costs and improved pricing while ebitda margins improved significantly for the full year they were below our expectations in the fourth quarter due to stronger than anticipated demand for power generation equipment our alternator business which is still in the restructuring process incurred additional production costs and premium freight to meet deliver commitments ebitda percent in the fourth quarter was also negatively impacted by lower joint venture earnings in africa the impact of tariffs and a lower mix of parts sales we do though expect to grow earnings in 2019 as a result of stronger power generation sales improved pricing and sustained improvement in our alternator operations all of which will offset weaker demand from oil and gas customers in our electrified power business full year ebitda was a loss of 90 million in line with our forecast we continue our targeted investments in areas which we expect to see broad market adoption primarily in urban and short range applications included in the fourth quarter results were two non recurring items with combined negative impact of 58 million of ebitda these items were costs related to closing a start up electronic logging device business and the impact of marking to market assets that underpin our non qualified benefit plans the mark to market loss was driven by volatility in debt and equity markets in the fourth quarter advertisement advertisement the eld business was part of our strategy effort to increase digital services to customers and included the design of the smartphone voiced app that helped truckers meet electronic logging requirements in the us while this specific market didn t materialize as we expected we continue to launch new digital products that serve our end customers needs now i will comment on some of our key markets in 2018 starting with north america and then i ll comment on some of our largest international markets our revenues in north america increased 19 in 2018 primarily due to higher levels of truck production we also experienced growth in sales of engines and parts to customers in oil and gas construction and mining markets as well as the full year impact of the automated transmission business industry production of heavy duty trucks increased to 286 000 units an increase of 29 from 2017 levels supported by strong freight rates improved fuel economy in new trucks our market share was 34 for the full year up from 33 in 2017 the market size for medium duty trucks was 132 000 units in 2018 an increase of 9 from 2017 and the highest level of production in over a decade we maintained our clear leadership in the market with a full year market share of 80 up from 78 a year ago 2018 marked another strong year for pickup truck sales in north america we shipped 150 000 engines to pickup truck in 2018 and recently unveiled the next generation 6 7l turbo diesel engine boasting a first in class 1 000 feet pound of torque in a ram truck at the detroit auto show 2019 marks the 30th anniversary of cummins availability in ram trucks engine sales to construction customers in north america increased by 31 driven by record levels of non residential construction and the strongest year of residential construction spending since 2006 engine shipments to high horsepower markets in north america increased by 18 from last year driven by demand from oil and gas and mining customers while power generation revenues increased by 10 year over year with particular strength in demand from data center customers our international revenues increased 12 in 2018 full year revenues in china including joint ventures were 4 8 billion down 2 compared with 2017 with lower sales in on highway markets partially offset by strong construction markets industry demand for medium and heavy duty trucks in china decreased by 2 from the record level experience in 2017 within the truck market construction related dump truck and specialty vehicle sales were up 45 in 2018 while tractor and flatbed sales utilized primarily for line haul applications were down 10 our market share in 2018 was 12 7 down from 14 8 in 2017 due to lower market share at our oem partners mostly driven by the change in market mix toward construction related vehicles advertisement advertisement the light duty market in china grew 10 in 2018 and our share ended the year at 7 in line with our guidance industry demand for excavators set a new record of 203 000 units in 2018 an increase of 45 from 2017 levels our market share ended the year at 15 1 5 higher than in 2017 due to market share gains made by several of our key domestic oem partners revenues for our power systems business in china increased by 29 due to increased demand for power generation equipment and growth in industrial engine shipments to mining customers full year revenues in india including joint ventures were 2 2 billion a 23 increase over 2017 industry truck production was a record in 2018 and increased 22 from the year previous our truck market share ended at 40 which was flat compared to last year sales in our component segment increased more than 40 due to increased content associated with the transition to bs4 emission standards in the truck market beginning in april last year strong economic growth and infrastructure investment also led to a 10 increase in power generation sales during the year in brazil our revenues increased by 27 mainly driven by a 27 increase in truck production advertisement advertisement now let me provide an overall outlook for 2019 and then comment on some individual regions and end markets we are forecasting total company revenues for 2019 to be flat to up 4 from 2018 driven by an increase in heavy and medium duty truck production in north america and brazil as well as increased demand in power generation markets we expect most of our end markets in china to decline in 2019 while european and indian end markets are expected to remain relatively flat industry production for heavy duty trucks in north america is projected to be 292 000 units in 2019 a 2 increase year over year the industry enters 2019 with a record backlog and high visibility of production levels in the first half of the year we expect our market share to be in the range of 32 34 in the medium duty truck market we expect market size to be 134 000 units a 2 increase from 2018 with our market share projected to be in the range of 74 76 our engine shipments for pickup trucks in north america are expected to be flat compared to a very strong 2018 in china we project domestic revenues including joint ventures to be flat in 2019 we are currently projecting a 10 reduction in heavy and medium duty truck demand and a 7 reduction in light duty truck demand we expect our market share in the medium and heavy duty truck market to be in the range of 13 14 in 2019 up from 2018 our share in the light duty market will be 8 9 up from 7 with growth coming from our new joint venture with jac which became operational in december there continues to be uncertainty around the adoption of national standard 6 in china this year our projection for industry truck sales to decline by 10 in 2019 assumes low industry demand for ns6 compliant products with adoption concentrated in urban use vehicles for tier 1 fittings in the event that the enforcement of ns6 standards accelerates adoption we anticipate that overall truck sales could decline an additional 10 below our current forecast but our content per engine would increase industry sales of excavators in china are expected to decline 25 from record levels in 2018 while 2019 demand will be down it will still represent the third highest year of sales on record advertisement advertisement in india we project total revenue including joint ventures to be flat in 2019 we anticipate industry demand for trucks to be 5 lower than the record levels experienced in 2018 demand will be muted in the first half of 2019 as elections take place but we expect strong growth in the second half of 2019 ahead of the planned implementation of bharat stage 6 standards in april of 2020 we also expect 5 10 growth in construction and power generation markets as continued infrastructure investment drives incremental demand we expect to see growth in all of our businesses in brazil this year due to improved economic conditions we expect truck production to be up 13 in 2019 and power generation demand to increase 15 we project our global high horsepower engine shipments to be flat in 2019 with a 5 improvement in new engine orders from mining customers as they replace aging equipment demand for new oil and gas engines is expected to decline by 40 with sales continuing at levels experienced in the second half of 2018 following robust fleet replacement in the first half of last year in summary we expect full year sales to be flat to up 4 and ebitda to be in the range of 15 75 16 25 of sales the improvement in ebitda this year will be driven by positive pricing material cost reduction lower warranty and variable compensation costs partially offset by metal markets and tariffs we returned a record 1 9 billion in cash to shareholders in 2018 in the form of dividends and share repurchases and currently plan to return 75 of operating cash flow to shareholders in 2019 as well before moving on to pat who will discuss our financial results in more detail i d like to take a few minutes to share some of the progress that s been made in our electrified power business unit this year 2018 marked the first full year of operations of our electrified power business unit in 2018 we announced partnerships of on and off highway oem and are working on electrification solutions in products ranging from bus to medium duty trucks light commercial vehicles excavators and dredge trucks vehicles with cummins electrification content were on display at several industry events and to date we have over 11 million miles of testing and development on vehicles with our electrified power technology they have begun selling battery electric powertrain systems to bluebird for use in school bus markets in the united states and are progressing toward launches with additional customers including gillig for transit buses later this year we are continually assessing and innovating across a broad portfolio of power solutions from diesel to natural gas fuel cells hybrid and full electric options we plan to provide our customers with the right technical solutions for their application at the right time and to continue to be the leader in power for commercial and industrial equipment as we begin 2019 and the 100th anniversary of our company we continue to see the benefit of our leadership in diesel technology as well the next generation 6 7l turbo diesel engine in dodge ram pickup trucks boasts a first in class 1 000 foot pound of torque and was announced at the detroit auto show in january the new lightweight cummins x12 engine will be available on a number of chassis in 2019 including several of daimler trucks north america customer demand for our industry leading isx 15l engine remains strong and we are producing at all time record levels finally amtrak announced on december 21st that it would be purchasing 75 charger locomotives for delivery starting in 2021 equipped with our qsk95 engine advertisement advertisement i

good morning everyone i will start with a review of our fourth quarter results before moving on to the full year 2018 performance and then finishing up with outlook for 2019 fourth quarter revenues were 6 1 billion an increase of 12 from a year ago and a record fourth quarter for the company sales in north america increased 17 as a result of higher commercial truck production and improved demand for construction and power generation equipment international sales grew by 6 mainly driven by stronger demand in europe and asia pacific from power generation and construction customers a stronger us dollar negatively impacted international sales by 4 gross margins were 25 2 of sales ten basis points higher than a year ago the positive impact of higher volumes favorable pricing and lower warranty expense were offset by increased supply chain and operational costs along with a less favorable mix of sales in our power systems segment while selling development costs of 887 million increased by 36 million with all the increase coming in research and development we were 100 basis points lower as a percent of sales joint venture income of 79 million was 23 million higher than last year due to the absence 40 million tax charge related to the tax cuts and jobs act passed in december of 2017 excluding that tax charge earnings declined mainly due to reduced sales at our on highway joint ventures in china earnings before interest and tax depreciation and amortization were 896 million or 14 6 of sales for the quarter compared to 769 million or 14 of sales last year as tom just mentioned included in the fourth quarter ebitda results were a 24 million write off of an investment in our very own electronic data logging company and a 44 million adjustment of mark to market losses in job and company owned life insurance investments which we used to fund our non qualified benefit plans experienced in financial markets in the fourth quarter net earnings for the quarter were 579 million or 3 63 per diluted share and included a 0 43 negative impact from the two investment losses i just mentioned partially offset by a 0 15 benefit related to the 2017 tax legislation and other discrete tax items this compares to net earnings last year of 503 million or 3 03 per diluted share excluding the 777 million in one time charges related to tax legislation our tax rate in the quarter was 14 1 which included 51 million or 0 33 per share of variable discrete tax items excluding the discrete items the operational rate was 21 3 in the quarter now let me comment on our full year results and provide some more details on our performance full year revenues for the company were a record 23 8 billion an increase of 16 compared to the prior year sales improved in each of our operating segments driven by higher commercial truck production in north america strong demand in global construction and power generation markets as well as improved demand in oil and gas and the mining markets north american revenues increased by 19 in 2018 and represented 51 of our total revenues international revenues improved by 4 with higher sales in most regions including europe brazil china india japan and australia gross margins of 24 1 were 90 basis points lower than last year the 368 million after treatment campaign in the first half of 2018 and headwinds from were partially offset by higher volumes favorable pricing actions and material cost reductions selling admin and research and development costs increased by 156 million with almost all the increase coming from increased investments in research and development and about 160 basis points lower as a percent of sales joint venture income increased by 47 million compared to last year the 2017 joint venture income included a 39 million tax charge related to the tax legislation that i discussed earlier excluding that tax charge 2018 joint venture income results were flat year over year other income was 97 million lower than 2017 as a result of the mark to market losses incurred on company owned life insurance investments recorded on the sale of assets in 2017 and some losses in total ebitda was a record 3 5 billion or 14 6 of sales compared to 3 billion or 14 8 a year ago net earnings were 2 1 billion or 13 15 per diluted share both full year records for the company this compares to 1 8 billion or 10 62 per share in 2017 excluding the 777 million in one time charges related to tax legislation the operating tax rate for the full year excluding 14 million of discrete benefits was 21 1 compared to 58 last year or 24 5 adjusted for the tax legislation moving on to the operating segments let me summarize their performance in the quarter and for the full year 2018 and then provide a forecast for 2019 i ll then review the full year cash flow and conclude with the company s revenue and profitability expectations for the upcoming year in the engine segment revenues were 2 7 billion in the quarter an increase of 18 from last year on highway revenues grew by 17 from higher heavy and medium duty truck engine sales primarily in north america off highway revenues increased by 21 as a result of stronger demand for construction equipment in china north america and in europe segment ebitda in the quarter was 393 million or 14 6 of sales this compares to 271 million or 11 8 of sales a year ago the improvement in ebitda percent was driven by benefits from the highway volumes and from favorable pricing actions so for the full year revenues increased 18 from a year ago and ebitda increased from 12 8 to 13 7 of sales for 2019 we expect revenues to be flat to up 4 with growth in north american truck markets and improving demand in brazil partially offset by more construction demand in china ebitda is projected to be in the range of 14 5 15 5 compared to 13 7 of sales in 2018 driven primarily by lower warranty expense for the distribution segment fourth quarter revenues were a record 3 1 billion increasing 6 compared to last year the growth in sales was primarily driven by stronger demand for power generation equipment and parts and service in north america partially offset by reduced demand for engines in oil and gas markets ebitda for the fourth quarter was 140 million or 6 8 of sales compared to last year the fourth quarter ebitda margin increased by 50 basis points as a result of higher sales and favorable pricing actions partially offset by the negative impact of a stronger us dollar for 2018 the distribution segment concluded with record sales and ebitda sales grew by 11 compared to last year and ebitda increased by 13 to 563 million or 7 2 of sales we expect 2019 revenues in the segment to be flat to up 4 primarily due to increased demand for parts and service and power generation in north america along with favorable pricing partially offset by the impact of a stronger us dollar ebitda margins are projected to be in the range of 7 8 of sales compared to 7 2 in 2018 for the components segment revenues were 1 8 billion in the fourth quarter an increase of 14 from a year ago sales in north america increased by 23 due to higher heavy and medium duty truck production and the impact of the automated transmission business international sales grew by 3 with lower demand in china more than offset by standard sales in europe and india segment ebitda was 278 million or 15 7 of sales compared to 314 million or 13 7 of sales a year ago ebitda improved driven by the benefits from the higher sales lower warranty expense and material cost reductions for 2018 our components segment delivered record revenue which grew by 22 due to stronger on highway demand in north america europe and india in addition to the impact of revenues from the automated transmission business ebitda decrease from 15 6 last year to 14 4 in 2018 primarily driven by higher warranty costs recorded in the first half of the year for 2019 we expect components revenue to increase 1 5 as a result of growth in north american and brazilian on highway truck markets partially offset by weaker demand in china the ebitda margin is projected to be in the range of 15 16 of sales up from 14 4 in 2018 more warranty expense will be partially offset by increased investment and preparation for the upcoming india bharat stage 6 and china national standard 6 emission regulations in the power systems segment fourth quarter revenues were 1 3 billion up 9 from a year ago power generation sales grew by 14 driven by increased demand for power generation equipment in north america asia pacific and in india investor sales were unchanged compared to last year ebitda margins were 10 3 in the quarter down from 11 3 last year the ebitda margin decline year over year is primarily due to the increased supply chain and operational costs that along with a less favorable mix of sales and lower joint venture earnings 2018 was a record year for our power systems segment in terms of revenues which grew by 14 primarily driven by increased demand for power generation equipment and stronger demand in mining and oil and gas markets ebitda increased by 49 to 640 million with margins expanding from 10 1 to 13 3 of sales driven by the higher volumes lower warranty expense and favorable pricing for 2019 revenues are expected to increase 3 7 with growth in data center markets increased military revenue and higher demand for mining engines partially offset by lower demand in oil and gas markets ebitda is projected to be in the range of 14 15 of sales up from 13 3 in 2018 primarily due to the positive impact of standard returns standard revenues and the benefits of actions taken in 2018 to rationalize the manufacturing footprint of our automated business in the electrified power segment ebitda losses were 29 million in the fourth quarter and 90 million for the full year in line with our guidance for 2019 we expect a net expense of 120 150 million as we continue to make targeted investments in this space and as tom mentioned we re now projecting total company revenues to be flat to up 4 in 2019 increased demand globally for power generation equipment primarily at data centers and improvements in truck production in north america and latin america drive the majority of the growth in revenue foreign are expected to negatively impact revenues by approximately 300 million income from our joint ventures is expected to decline approximately 5 as a result of lower demand for heavy and medium duty trucks in china and in india ebitda margins are projected to be between 15 75 16 35 of sales for 2019 up from the 14 6 recorded in 2018 we expect ebitda margins in the first quarter will be at the low point for the year due to seasonal weak demand in our power systems and distribution businesses if reduced warranty and variable compensation expense along with pricing and material cost improvement will positively impact margins partially offset by tariffs and investments in the automated transmission business electrified power segment and in components primarily related to china national standard 6 and india bharat stage 6 emissions we re currently projecting our effective tax rate to be 21 5 in 2019 excluding any discrete items turning to cash flow cash generated from operations was 990 million in the fourth quarter and a record 2 4 billion for the full year we anticipate operating cash flow in 2019 will be within our long term guidance range of 10 15 of sales capital expenditure for the full year was 709 million and we expect our 2019 capital investments will be in the range of 650 700 million in 2019 we ll return a record 9 1 billion to our shareholders or 78 of operating cash flow we repurchased almost 8 million shares and increased our dividend by 5 6 our capital allocation plans remain consistent with what we ve told you previously we will maintain a strong financial position to sustain us across cycles and variation in business levels we will focus on growth targeting high return investments both organic and inorganic and for 2019 we plan to return 75 of the operating cash flow to shareholders we are pleased with the record sales ebitda and operating cash flow in 2018 and the returns on invested capital were top quarter that being said there are clearly areas where we could have done better and you can see from our guidance that we expect improvement in operating margins in2019 and just before i finish i do want to thank you all for your interest in cummins throughout my time there as cfo the company is in a very strong position and i look forward to following cummins continuing success as a shareholder now let me turn it back over to james james hopkins executive director of investor relations thanks pat out of consideration to others on the call i d ask that you limit yourselves to one question and a related follow up and if you have additional questions please rejoin the queue chelsea we re now ready for our first question questions and answers operator certainly ladies and gentlemen if you have a question at this time please press the then the no 1 key on your telephone keypad if your question has been answered or you wish to remove yourself from the queue please press the key to prevent any background noise we do ask that you please place your line on mute once your question has been stated thank you and our first question comes from the line of alex potter with piper jaffray your line is open alex potter piper jaffray analyst hi guys i guess first of all it sounds like pricing has been a tailwind in 2018 across a number of your segments you called it out multiple times just wondering the extent to which you expect that to be a tailwind again in 2019 and which areas do you think the biggest opportunities are thanks rich freeland president and chief operating officer yeah alex it s rich you have a tailwind in 2018 in fact it ll be a bigger tailwind in 2019 and the primary areas where we re able to get some pricing is in the parts business and some of our prior generation markets again some of that will be needed to offset the impact of tariffs that we have also coming into our 2019 alex potter piper jaffray analyst okay thanks also i was wondering if you could comment on nissan you mentioned the big that monster diesel engine you re putting in the ram pickup if you can comment i guess on both of those platforms both ram and nissan how those have developed relative to your initial expectations and what the outlook is there over not just in 2019 but over the next couple years diesel penetration for that type of vehicle as well as cummins market share thanks rich freeland president and chief operating officer okay thanks let me start with the chrysler so we re really excited about this we re gonna be in the lead in the torque with this engine and that market remains strong it was 150 000 last year and we see that continuing i mean we re basically it s the supply chain trying to keep up to produce them we will see that in q1 will be the low point though so it ll be lower than that run rate in q1 as we go through the model year change and the transition there and some issues in working that out but we re excited and basically the whole industry s trying to add capacity to meet the demand on the nissan front that one still remains below our expectations what would be our projections someone correct me here but we re in the 15 20 000 engine range for that which has been relatively flat so that one continues to has not gotten the traction that we wanted on the 5l v 8 and so i d say from a chrysler standpoint we see only upside in 19 and continuing as we get into gross share and the nissan relatively flat at the low levels alex potter piper jaffray analyst okay great that s very helpful and congratulations pat patrick ward chief financial officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of jerry revich with goldman sachs your line is open jerry revich goldman sachs analyst hi good morning everyone and pat and mark congratulations we ll miss working with you i m wondering tom if you can talk about the major electric rotation product milestones that you expect over the next year you mentioned something about the highlights on a trailing basis can you just talk about the number of new platforms that you folks are going to be participating on over the next 12 months what your win rate has been to get on additional platforms and then any updated thoughts on when the revenue contributions here will accelerate obviously they provided guidance for 19 but i m wondering if your longer term thoughts have developed at all tom linebarger chairman and chief executive officer yeah thanks a lot jerry so big milestones this year of course are the transit bus launch with gillig that s something we been working to really since the beginning of the business we see the transit bus market as kind of the maybe the most obvious adopter the one where there s significant incentives in the cities to drive toward electrification the application lends itself toward electrification either pure bevs or potentially with a small engine to get you back to base so we think it s a good application for electric vehicles so that s where we re targeting the gillig launch is a big one we ve got a good order for that and so we re pretty excited about that and pretty focused on that i mentioned dredge trucks and frankly dredge trucks have a very similar application in terms of their relatively short range pretty easy to charge loads are pretty predictable so we think that s another area that s gonna go we ve got a launch partner there i don t want to announce ahead of them so i think those are really our major two platform milestones i mentioned that we re already working with bluebird and we are trying to get some more launch partners on the school bus side all those just reflect the ones that we think will early adopt and kind of one level lower jerry there s a pretty big milestone for us to have our battery pack that we re developing meet the performance standards at least for a first generation that we re looking for that s a pretty big deal too so we ve got a milestone related to our battery pack then related to the entire electrical system launch further out there s a number of applications we re looking at that i would say we re pretty strongly focused on these year term milestones there s a lot of development work going on it s a big effort for us to get right and then we ll look for and with regard to revenues i would say we re still in the market development phase i d be remiss to give you a good view on revenues i think market adoption in the markets that i mentioned is likely to move with some steadiness but still i ve heard people project that the transit buses which i ve mentioned is one of the best markets might be 50 electric in ten or more years that s a long time and that s for new buses which means you ve got all the diesel buses still selling so i m still loath to call the transitions i think what we re thinking about is trying to get our products ready to convert in these markets that are moving fast and then see what kind of adoption rates we get and then we ll be able to start calling more of the financial side about what we think ramp our revenues i know that s a little dissatisfying it is to me anyway but we re still trying to manage these launches and make sure that we re available and then we ll be able to figure out where launches go jerry revich goldman sachs analyst okay i really appreciate the color and on the x12 i m wondering if you can update us on any traction with additional oems nice to hear the data point on daimler how close are you to rolling out with the others and do i remember correctly you had spoken about that platform potentially adding two to four points of market shares that still the way to think about it when it s rolled out rich freeland president and chief operating officer hi jerry this is rich we ve added daimler of course we ll let oems make their own announcements on that but currently it is daimler and some smaller distributer oems that we ve signed up and tom linebarger chairman and chief executive officer and autocar rich you know autocar is the refuse specialty vehicle and they re kind of using the isx12 as the big launch vehicle for them and they launched the engine for them on some new platforms and they re pretty excited about it too so i think that and it the isx12 fits their applications really well so i think that will be another important launch for us rich freeland president and chief operating officer yeah and so we re looking at close to 5 000 this year jerry and so i think the market share gain of a couple points i think that s still out there i think it s kind of a couple years out there though where we d need to add some more jerry revich goldman sachs analyst okay thank you rich freeland president and chief operating officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of david raso with evercore isi your line is open david raso evercore isi analyst hi good morning and congrats to both pat and mark regarding the comment about north america tom not to nitpick on the choice of words but i thought it was interesting you said visibility to the first half of 2019 some of your key customers are saying visibility with the backlog as far as it is kinda the late half of 2019 and so i m just trying to clarify how you re viewing the current backlog how long it can carry us what do you think of orders and any thoughts around american truck production in the back half of the year tom linebarger chairman and chief executive officer yeah i ll let rich talk about that rich freeland president and chief operating officer i ll start that and then you can chime in here tom yeah the backlog s big it s close to 300 000 units and we re projecting a 290 market with our projections so i think it s just our we might be being a bit conservative because we did strong through the whole year we re just gonna pay attention to what s going on with cancellations what s going on with freight rates but i would say we don t have any insight beyond that it actually looks pretty strong and i d say there s growing confidence we had projected a bit of a reduction in the second half of the year a slight one there s more and more confidence that could fill in though jerry so we re just paying attention to it and so you know what our assumptions are is what we try to do here tom linebarger chairman and chief executive officer i think your question about the words is a good one we weren t trying to call a difference between us and the truck makers it s just that we are always we ve seen a lot of these cycles before and we ve seen sometimes when order board cancellations start they can happen fast we don t have any reason to think that s gonna happen here but we re watching the truck orders just like you guys are and we got two not such great orders and we just wanna keep our eyes on it but we are planning that this as we said that the year s gonna be a good year and definitely the order board s filling up if we don t see cancellations that we ll have a terrific year david raso evercore isi analyst okay i appreciate the clarification and also on truck in china we all know you re not that exposed to the dump truck market you re more about freight flatbed so within that industry baseline view you have of down ten where you re more exposed the freight haul kinda flatbed market can you help us with the mix like how do you view that market which is obviously the more relevant one for you tom linebarger chairman and chief executive officer we re not forecasting a big mix shift year over year i mean again one of the things that has to happen is in china they re clearly stimulating construction growth and there was also some changes in regs inside the truck market which drove more of those construction trucks so you ve got stimulus and this change in regs which drove this mix it s pretty dramatic i mean normally the mix shift is just not something that we would call out but frankly these two things combined shifted a bunch and as you said our engines are more for these longer range things so we got negatively surprised on market share that s what happened and so we were disappointed with the market share so we re thinking to ourselves that there may be a little mix shift back because of we won t have these special factors anymore but we re not thinking that there s a big there s certainly not any negative trends if anything the mix trend should be slightly positive for us the big news in china really is how does ns6 get enforced so what s gonna happen with the standard how tightly do they enforce it on the first day we were thinking we were heading into a time where now all these enforcements would be launched they d all be enforced aggressively across the country but because of the economic situation in china it looks like that s not gonna happen and we re gonna move back to some of those old enforcement plans where the cities ll go first and things ll move slower which means we ll be in a fair bit of uncertainty in the market we think for 12 or 18 months while the ns6 stuff gets enforced over time so that i think that s driving most of the uncertainty as opposed to the mix mark smith vice president of financial operations and freight s pretty flat tom linebarger chairman and chief executive officer yeah freight s flat that s good mark was just adding that freight is flat so again we re not calling for a disaster we think things are gonna continue along fine but mix is slightly favorable maybe is what we hope again we didn t call it that well last year but we think it s favorable this year and we think that this ns6 thing is really what we re having to manage david raso evercore isi analyst and i ll pass on the baton here but just so we re level set here on if there is downside risk to the volume due to ns6 how much is the offset of your content tom linebarger chairman and chief executive officer yeah that just depends on how it goes but i guess our feeling is that to the extent we re exposed at all on revenue related to the market that ll be to our benefit in the long run we think we gain share in ns6 we think we gain content and margin in ns6 so it s we think it s a win for cummins the faster it moves that said to project does it mean we d be down x points it s really hard to say given the ways it could go but let s just say that we re ready for it to be enforced as fast as it can go that would be the best thing for us financially patrick ward chief financial officer the content would be consolidated 100 tom linebarger chairman and chief executive officer whereas the engine sales at jv versus the components 100 david raso evercore isi analyst terrific thank you rich freeland president and chief operating officer yeah thanks a lot david operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of jamie cook with credit suisse your line is open jamie cook credit suisse analyst hi good morning first question just on the guide i know you ve talked bigger picture headwinds tailwinds in terms of price cost tariff warranty incentive comp is there any way you can quantify on a basis point level just so we can understand what your assumptions are there i think your top line assumptions are reasonable i just want to know what the other puts and takes are and then my second question tom or maybe to the whole team as we think about previous downturns i think cummins has always done a very good job supporting higher trough earnings through a number of different diversification initiatives or share repo whatever as we think about 2020 and if the downturn does come what are the puts and takes we should be thinking about because as i think about this next downturn i m more concerned investment costs are going to be higher and your only lever to help support eps would be repurchase and by the way congrats pat and mark sorry tom linebarger chairman and chief executive officer great great questions jamie thank you and as you said we are having a pretty forward stance on cash flow and repurchases as we ve had in previous times like this where we think if we start to see a financial downturn ahead we will be aggressive on making sure we support our stock and we re in a good position to do that and our cash flow will be strong i think just let me break the two questions up i ll have mark go through the detail that you asked about i think he can do a good job of explaining that and then maybe i ll have rich talk a little bit about how we re posturing the company to approach a time when business is strong but maybe over the horizon looks like a downturn so mark we ll start with you jamie cook credit suisse analyst great thank you mark smith vice president of financial operations okay so pricing s gonna be about 80 basis points plus and variable compensation 40 warranty 140 then we get to the less exciting part with all those tariffs takes about 50 basis points level markets 40 which if you combine the pricing level markets and tariff gm that leaves you about neutral on all of those and then slight tick up in research and a slight tick down in jv earnings as the balance is china markets we model currently we ll be a little bit low and those are the moving parts rich freeland president and chief operating officer okay and just a little comment on how we think about the cycles jamie internally we talk about the mantra is you embrace the cycles ok you win the upturn you win the downturn which means that you have improved earnings at the trough and you have improved earnings at the peak and so we re committed to that you can imagine we ve had a good run in a lot of our markets many of them are above replacement cycle we have plans ready for a downturn so we ll do what we always do which we ll flex down quickly when we see that s coming we already have plans in place to do that we ll also look to structurally change the company through the downturn some things you can t do when things are going fast on how we just change the way we structurally do business so we have those things that we re thinking about and then we ll continue to invest in growth areas through the downturn when others don t so we get a strong balance sheet so we try to do these three combinations and when we come out of this thing we come out stronger each time so we re committed to continually improving we commit to 25 decremental margins through the downturn and we ll do that again and then maybe i ll turn to tom just a little bit for a balance sheet and share repurchase how we think about that tom linebarger chairman and chief executive officer yeah and again we will continue to generate strong cash flow throughout the period and so that will manage that through of course making sure that we don t spend more capital than we need to and you saw we re watching that now as we see things level out and maybe heading down and we ll continue to step up share purchases where we think we don t need as much cash flow to invest so those things are the things you ve heard from us before and i think what we re trying to do is make sure each time we approach this we capture the things that worked well in the previous downturn improve the things that didn t work as well as we liked and the leadership team is already having significant discussions about that as we enter 2019 so our plan this year has steps is already taking steps and anticipating this thing turning back down at some point again we don t know when as my conversation with david outlined but we know it s coming jamie cook credit suisse analyst okay congrats again pat and mark pat i m sure you ll miss these earnings calls thanks patrick ward chief financial officer thanks jamie operator thank you our next question comes from the line of andy casey with wells fargo securities your line is open andrew casey wells fargo securities analyst thanks congrats pat and mark tough act to follow there after jamie s comment first a clarification on the segment reporting basis were the 58 million marked down in mark to market recorded in eliminations patrick ward chief financial officer 24 million in eliminations andy 16 million in the engine business and then the balance evenly distributed across distribution power systems and components andrew casey wells fargo securities analyst okay tom linebarger chairman and chief executive officer and the reason that some get distributed is we took the electronic logging device right off as a corporate cost and then we allocate across the businesses right that s why it ends up that way spread across it wasn t that those businesses had anything to do with it it just got allocated as part of corporate expense andrew casey wells fargo securities analyst okay that s helpful thank you and then just a on china truck you answered a lot of it with respect to david s question but are you looking for the full year drop to be driven mostly by the first half with flattish performance in the second half mark smith vice president of financial operations say that again tom linebarger chairman and chief executive officer on china truck do we have a view about this quarter to quarter seasonality view mark smith vice president of financial operations yep still the same seasonality with the second half tom linebarger chairman and chief executive officer yeah the second half weakness really is driven by this ns6 anticipation andy that s the part where frankly our visibility isn t so great i mean as i tried to highlight there we have a view and it s as reasoned a view as you can get but it s just gonna come down to are people s adoption rates gonna be faster or slower and i think what we re saying now is we re saying that we think they re gonna hit the tier one for these which will mean that there will be very little volume effect that s just not that many trucks purchased for that it s mostly buses and things maybe refuse vehicles so most of the trucks will remain to the old standard which means it ll kind of truck along at steady freight rates with a small decrease where we d see a significant move potentially downward is if people thought hey the ns6 standard comes in and the price goes up a fair bit and i think i ll just wait now and of course if people thought that that s gonna happen one month from now they might buy more coming up front so these are the things that are acting against each other plus a relatively weak economy all those coming together are just making it difficult to predict but right now what we ve got is a steady first half drop a little second half and that s about as best we could do sitting where we sit now andrew casey wells fargo securities analyst okay thanks tom and then one last one electrified power the expected losses in 2019 are stepping up a little bit i just wanna make sure are we still looking for that same 500 million investment that you outlined in the 17 investor day tom linebarger chairman and chief executive officer yeah no change in the overall investment plan the expense run rate you re seeing is we have a fourth quarter run rate that we re kinda running across the year so we have our team staffed up now for those milestones i talked about they are staffed they are working toward deliver we re not changing very much we re just kinda sticking to it as i mentioned these milestones are big deals we want to get those right we re not trying to get distracted by a lot of other things and so we still see that 500 million number to be ok i mean you can t predict it perfectly but it feels like the right place for us still and not too much change in what we re focused on what we re doing a lot of people are working hard though i m giving it a pretty steady picture but there s a lot of work going on to make sure that we get that batter pack where we want it and the overall electric vehicle system where we want it and so those people would be sad if i said it was all smooth they re working hard but again i think from an investment point of view you should think on the same plan on the same run rate no change andrew casey wells fargo securities analyst great and good luck again pat patrick ward chief financial officer thank you james hopkins executive director of investor relations thanks andy all right thank you everybody i appreciate your interest in

imagine going to the store and finding that nothing has a price tag on it instead you take it to the cashier and they calculate the price what you pay could be twice as much or more than an hour earlier that s if there is even anything left in stock this is the economic reality that underpins venezuela s current political crisis though in truth that crisis has been going on for years the government headed by nicolÃ¡s maduro who has presided over venezuela since 2013 declared a state of emergency in 2016 that year the inflation rate hit 800 things have since gone from bad to worse by 2018 inflation was an estimated 80 000 it s difficult to say what the rate is now but bloomberg s venezuelan cafe con leche index based on the price of a cup of coffee suggests it is now about 380 000 about 3 million venezuelans a tenth of the population have fled the country this is the largest human displacement in latin american history driven by shortages of everything including food as well as the maduro regime s oppressive treatment of dissent read more venezuela is fast becoming a mafia state here s what you need to know no wonder then that maduro who has just begun his second term as president is now under considerable domestic and international pressure to call new elections so how did things get so bad how did inflation become hyperinflation in venezuela and how do venezuelans deal with it alberto valdes epa the cost of goods and the value of currency what we pay for goods and services reflects not only their cost of production but also of the value of the currency we buy them in if that currency loses value against the currency the goods are sold in the price of those goods goes up by 2014 the value of venezuela s currency the bolÃ­var and the prosperity of the venezuelan economy was highly dependent on oil exports more than 90 of the country s export earnings came from oil these export earnings had enabled the government headed by hugo chavez from 1999 to 2013 to pay for social programs intended to combat poverty and inequality from subsidies for those on low incomes to health services the government s spending obligations were high then the global price of oil dropped foreign demand for the bolÃ­var to buy venezuelan oil crashed as the currency s value fell the cost of imported goods rose the venezuelan economy went into crisis the solution of venezuela s new president nicolas maduro who succeeded chavez in march 2013 was to print more money schenyder mendoza epa that might seem silly but it can keep the economy moving while it gets over a hump caused by a short term price shock the venezuelan crisis however just got worse as the oil price continued to fall compounded by other factors that reduced venezuelan oil output international investors began looking elsewhere driving the value of the bolÃ­var even lower read more curious kids why don t poorer countries just print more money in these conditions printing more money simply made the problem worse it added to the supply of currency pushing the value down even further as prices rose the government printed more money to pay its bills this cycle is what causes hyperinflation playing the currency market circumstances like these quickly make saving money in the local currency nonsensical to protect themselves venezuelans started to convert their savings into a more stable currency like the us dollar this lowered the value of the bolÃ­var even further the government responded by issuing currency controls it set a fixed exchange rate to stop the official value of the bolÃ­var dropping against the us dollar and made it difficult to actually get permission to exchange bolÃ­vares into us dollars the idea was to stabilise the currency by effectively shutting down all currency transactions us dollars were still available on the black market however this meant going to any number of operators on the streets of downtown caracas or asking a friend to hook you up as the crisis deepened more and more venezuelans looked to switch their bolÃ­vares into us dollars shutterstock this increasing demand meant the black market price for greenbacks rose creating a difference between the official exchange rate set by the government and the unofficial going rate with this came new opportunities in 2014 reports emerged that groups of middle aged women were crossing the border to use atms in colombia they could withdraw funds from their venezuelan accounts as us dollars at the official rate they could then cross back into venezuela and exchange the dollars for bolÃ­vares at the unofficial rate making a tidy profit government officials able to exchange bolÃ­vares for us dollars within venezuela had their own version of this practice this pushed the price of us dollars up and that of bolÃ­vars down even more as the crisis deepened increasing numbers of ordinary venezuelans began to engage in the unofficial currency market sometimes this took the form of taking subsidised venezuelan goods like food across the border to sell this earned the sellers foreign currency but it also exacerbated shortages of goods within the country driving prices up even further this does not mean venezuela s currency crisis is the fault of ordinary venezuelans illegal economic activity is largely a coping mechanism a bellwether of the actual economy s ability to provide for people when a government fails its responsibilities it should be no surprise that people protect themselves through unofficial currency trading this is exactly what big international investors do all the time albeit through more official channels miguel gutierrez epa cannot be trusted by august 2018 the venezuelan currency was worth so little that it was more prudent to use cash for toilet paper rather than buy toilet paper the government tried to get on top of this situation by issuing a currency devaluation maduro devalued the bolÃ­var by 95 the largest currency devaluation in contemporary world history he also tied the new currency to the price of oil an economic experiment designed to show the venezuelan economy had solid foundations by bringing the bolÃ­var s value into line with the reality of what people actually thought it was worth and showing it was backed by something valuable oil maduro s government hoped venezuelans would believe in their own currency and not exchange it for dollars this would help stabilise the economy overall but within weeks of the devaluation it was clear ordinary venezuelans had not been convinced they had no reason to be given the government was not addressing other issues such as policies contributing to low productivity across the economy the government s increasing authoritarianism including interfering with the constitution and elections also signalled it was not to be trusted read more is authoritarianism bad for the economy ask venezuela or hungary or turkey hyperinflation is a very difficult hole out of which to climb very few economies ever experience it and it s hard to stop it without massively cutting government spending it is easy then to see why millions of venezuelans responded by dealing in the black market or taking their savings and themselves out the country altogether as the political crisis in the country deepens venezuelans will have to continue to seek ways to allow them to survive the storm any way they can

by gregory shupak the us media chorus supporting a us overthrow of the venezuelan government has for years pointed to the country s economic crisis as a justification for regime change while whitewashing the ways in which the us has strangled the venezuelan economy fair org 3 22 18 sister eugenia russian president of fundalatin a venezuelan human rights ngo that was established in 1978 and has special consultative status at the un told the independent 1 26 19 in contact with the popular communities we consider that one of the fundamental causes of the economic crisis in the country is the effect the unilateral coercive sanctions that are applied in the economy especially by the government of the united states while internal errors also contributed to the nation s problems russian said it s likely that few countries in the world have ever suffered an economic siege like the one venezuelans are living under while the new york times and the washington post have lately professed profound and definitely 100 percent sincere concern for the welfare of venezuelans neither publication has ever referred to fundalatin alfred de zayas the first un special rapporteur to visit venezuela in 21 years told the independent 1 26 19 that us canadian and european union economic warfare has killed venezuelans noting that the sanctions fall most heavily on the poorest people and demonstrably cause death through food and medicine shortages lead to violations of human rights and are aimed at coercing economic change in a sister democracy de zayas un report noted that sanctions hind the imports necessary to produce generic medicines and seeds to increase agricultural production de zayas also cited venezuelan economist pasqualina curcio who reports that the most effective strategy to disrupt the venezuelan economy has been the manipulation of the exchange rate the rapporteur went on to suggest that the international criminal court investigate economic sanctions against venezuela as possible crimes against humanity given that de zayas is the first un special rapporteur to report on venezuela in more than two decades one might expect the media to regard his findings as an important part of the venezuela narrative but his name does not appear in a single article ever published in the post the times has mentioned him once but not in relation to venezuela the economist francisco rodrÃ­guez points out that the sanctions the trump administration issued in august 2017 prohibited us banks from providing new financing to the venezuelan government a key part of the toxification of financial dealings with venezuela rodrÃ­guez notes that in august 2017 the us financial crimes enforcement network warned financial institutions that all venezuelan government agencies and bodies appear vulnerable to public corruption and money laundering and recommended that some transactions originating from venezuela be flagged as potentially criminal many financial institutions then closed venezuelan accounts concerned about the risk of being accused of participating in money laundering rodrÃ­guez says that this handcuffed venezuela s oil industry the sector most crucial to its economy with lost access to credit preventing the country from obtaining financial resources that could have been devoted to investment or maintenance and whereas previously the venezuelan government would raise production by signing joint venture agreements with foreign partners who would finance investment trump s sanctions effectively put an end to these loans mark weisbrot the nation 9 7 17 also an economist raised a related issue if we step back and look at venezuela from a bird s eye view how does a country with 500 billion barrels of oil and hundreds of billions of dollars worth of minerals in the ground go broke the only way that can happen is if the country is cut off from the international financial system otherwise venezuela could sell or even collateralize some of its resources in order to get the necessary dollars the 7 7 billion in gold held in central bank reserves could be quickly collateralized for a loan in past years the us treasury department used its clout to make sure that banks who wanted to finance a swap such as jpmorgan chase and bank of america did not do so sanctions have kept the venezuelan government from accessing financing and dealing with its debt while hamstringing its most important industry given that us media are writing for a principally us audience the damage done by washington and its partners sanctions should be front and center in their coverage exactly the opposite is the case virginia lopez glass of the new york times 1 25 19 uses 920 words to describe the challenges facing venezuelans but sanctions isn t one of them even as she writes about matters to which as i ve shown above sanctions are directly relevant food and medicine shortages are widespread hundreds have died from malnutrition and illnesses that are easily curable with the appropriate treatment weaponizing hunger in venezuela in this manner is dishonest and misleading christina m schiavoni a doctoral researcher at the international institute of social studies in the hague and ana felicien and liccia romero both of whom are venezuelan scholars wrote in monthly review 6 1 18 on overt us aggression toward venezuela in the form of the intensifying economic sanctions imposed by the obama and trump administrations as well as an all out economic blockade that has made it extremely difficult for the government to make payments on food imports and manage its debt bret stephens column in the times 1 28 19 only mentions the word sanctions to complain that the media supposedly isn t blaming socialism for the crisis in venezuela alleging that what you re likelier to read is that the crisis is the product of corruption cronyism populism authoritarianism resource dependency us sanctions and trickery even the residues of capitalism itself after dismissing the idea that the sanctions are a key part of the problems in venezuela stephens went on to advocate using them to bring about regime change in the country writing that the trump administration should enhance s political standing by providing access to funds that can help him establish an alternative government and entice wavering figures in the maduro camp to switch sides it can put venezuela on the list of state sponsors of terrorism these funds presumably refer the money that the us has seized from venezuela and adding the country to list of state sponsors of terrorism automatically entails hitting it with further sanctions the editorial board of the washington post 1 24 19 alleged that venezuela s government has subject the country s 32 million people to a humanitarian catastrophe without referring to what scholars whose research and writing focuses on latin america such as laura carlsen sujatha fernandes greg grandin francisco dominguez noam chomsky aviva chomsky gabriel hetland and venezuelan born historian miguel tinker salas describe common dreams 1 24 19 as sanctions cut off the means by which the venezuelan government could escape from its economic recession while causing a dramatic falloff in oil production and worsening the economic crisis and causing many people to die because they can t get access to life saving medicines later the editorial said that a us boycott of venezuelan oil could endanger ordinary venezuelans already coping with critical shortages of food power and medicine an absurd remark given that the sanctions they are occluding have had precisely these effects henry olsen in the post 1 24 19 wrote as if sanctions are a benign tool that can be used to usher in a brighter future for venezuelans rather than a key reason that so many of them find themselves in such a grim condition trump has many levers to pull short of military intervention to topple maduro he could use us pressure on the global financial system to cut off regime access to international banks freezing access to any secret accounts that the regime and probably its highest ranking leaders established offshore he can as sen marco rubio r fla has suggested work with american oil companies that purchase venezuelan oil to provide the profits from those purchases to accounts controlled by guaidÃ³ s national assembly he can also pressure china which has a far more valuable relationship with the united states than it does with venezuela to withdraw its support any or all of these measures would ratchet up pressure directly on the regime decreasing its ability to finance itself and buy support from security and military figures odds are that increasing financial pressure on the regime will finally bring about its collapse even if one momentarily sets aside that the sanctions are illegal under international law and violate the charter of the organization of american states and that the us has no right whatsoever to decide who governs venezuela these measures don t just ratchet up pressure on the regime they also kill and immiserate ordinary venezuelans a the post s charles lane 1 28 19 wrote apologists for the regime blame us sanctions and destabilization for venezuela s problems the truth is that with the exception of the george w bush administration s brief halfhearted support for a coup attempt in 2002 washington learning the lessons of ill fated cold war interventions has shown restraint in dealing with the caracas regime he went on to write that until the trump administration announced limitations on imports of venezuelan oil that day the united states had traded with venezuela and focused economic pressure on regime leaders and key institutions which suggests that the sanctions exclusively harm the regime again even if that were true it would still be illegal and amounts to a lie given the evidence that the sanctions are crushing the venezuelan masses unlike lane and the rest of the media s regime change choir the us government has acknowledged what it s doing to venezuela schiavoni felicien and romero point to a telling remark that a senior state department official made last year the financial sanctions we have placed on the venezuelan government has forced it to begin becoming in default both on sovereign and pdvsa its oil company s debt and what we are seeing because of the bad choices of the maduro regime is a total economic collapse in venezuela so our policy is working our strategy is working and we re going to keep it on the venezuelans thus the us government acknowledges that it is knowingly consciously driving the venezuelan economy into the ground but us media make no such acknowledgment which sends the message that the problems in venezuela are entirely the fault of the government and that the us is a neutral arbiter that wants to help venezuelans call this elision what it is war propaganda this piece was

china made it clear this week that it was not taking sides in venezuela and would cooperate with whoever was in charge this comes less than two weeks after venezuelan opposition politician the elected head of the national assembly in what was considered a fair vote juan guaido claimed he was the legal venezuelan leader because recently reelected president maduro had won in what was widely considered by locals and foreign observers a rigged and illegal election most western hemisphere nations and many european ones backed guaido as did most venezuelans the united states and eu nations are assisting guaido in taking control of billions of dollars in cash and other assets belonging to venezuela that are located in the u s and europe on the basis of all this guaido made it clear that he will respect current economic deals and is willing to work with russia and china currently venezuela s largest creditors maduro has the active support of cuba north korea iran and perhaps russia corruption update despite all the talk and action china seems to be losing ground when it comes to reducing corruption this is widely considered the most dangerous problem of all the 2018 international corruption ratings show the world that china is not making much progress dealing with corruption currently china ranks 87th out of 180 nations compared with 77 in 2017 and 79 out of 176 nations in 2016 corruption in the transparency international corruption perception index is measured on a 1 most corrupt to 100 not corrupt scale the most corrupt nations usually north korea 14 yemen 14 syria 13 south sudan 13 and somalia 10 have a rating of under 15 while of the least corrupt new zealand and denmark are over 85 the current chinese score is 39 versus 41 in 2017 compared to 63 61 for taiwan 40 40 for india 29 29 for russia 57 54 for south korea 14 17 for north korea 33 35 for vietnam 85 84 for singapore 72 73 for japan 38 37 for indonesia 38 38 for sri lanka 31 33 for the maldives 36 34 for the philippines 33 32 for pakistan 26 28 for bangladesh 28 30 for iran 16 15 for afghanistan 29 30 for burma 70 71 for the uae united arab emirates 62 64 for israel 72 75 for the united states 27 27 for nigeria 43 43 for south africa 18 18 for iraq 41 40 for turkey 49 49 for saudi arabia and 28 28 for lebanon a lower corruption score is common with nations in economic trouble and problems dealing with islamic terrorism and crime in general china s corruption score has not changed much since 2012 when it was 39 this indicates that despite all the breathless media hype about increased efforts to reduce corruption there is not much real progress president for life xi is accused of directing many corruption investigations at officials deemed a threat to his power christians korea and the denuclearization myth china continues to have a complicated relationship with north korea for example there is a lot of tolerated north korean government activity in northeast china north korea earns the ability to carry on like this by sharing intel gathered with china this includes info from north korea on what is going on in north korea and adjacent areas for example the north korean need for more cash now involves christian churches in northeast china and south korea many north korean defectors join these churches and north korea secret police have often done so as part of their job to collect information on subversives in the last year those orders have changed and the agents who are still active in these churches in northeast china have been ordered to change their focus to seeking business opportunities that will raise cash for the north korean government the agents have been told to seek out church members with business connections in south korea and develop those connections these can be legal or illegal as long as they are profitable collecting information on enemies of the state is now secondary to raising cash the shortage of which has become the greatest enemy north korean rulers currently face what these north korean still do is reported on and what new information they receive is shared with china north korean and local ethnic korean chinese in northeast china have long been vulnerable to north korean interference if the north korean agents can secretly get the chinese police to back off persecuting their church or individual believers the agent gains increased influence in the church this was long suspected but some of the recent senior defectors have apparently confirmed this for chinese and north korean christians this is just another aspect of persecution they have been increasingly subject to over the last decade china has become increasingly hostile to local christians and religions in general in early 2017 china expelled 32 south korean christian missionaries who were working along the north korean border the missionaries have long worked among the many ethnic koreans living in the area most of these ethnic koreans are chinese citizens but a growing number are illegal migrants from north korea china also prosecuted two south korean clergymen for assisting north koreans to escape from north korea and into china south korean christian missionaries who were working along the north korean border the missionaries have long worked among the many ethnic koreans living near the north korean border most of these ethnic koreans are chinese citizens but a growing number are illegal migrants from north korea since 2014 china has also applied more pressure to christian charities and foreign christians in general who are operating in china near the north korean border many of these christians especially ethnic koreans from the west are known or suspected of helping north koreans escape north korea and get to south korea the fact that this chinese north korean intel sharing and cooperation continues indicates that china is not willing to put extreme pressure on north korea to abandon its nukes that is a major reason why north korea can say to the americans and south koreans that denuclearization is possible while continuing to tell north koreans that the nukes will never be abandoned china really would prefer that north korea did not have nukes but is apparently willing to tolerate that if north korea becomes more responsive to chinese advance and needs to help that process along china is trying the carrot with north korea although the stick messing with the north korean economy by halting trade and chinese investment has been used more and more china is willing to unofficially reduce sanctions as long as north korea follows chinese advice about reforming their economy and adopting more of the techniques that have enabled china to remain a communist police state while also benefitting from a free market economy kim jong un is apparently succeeding in convincing china that north korea will accelerate its adoption of chinese economic practices that includes being more open to economic cooperation with south korea since the 1990s south korea and china have become major trading partners south koreans are becoming more willing to help north korea economically even though that will mean less incentive for north korea to denuclearize at the moment it is clear that north korea is not planning to denuclearize internal propaganda repeats that and much critical work on perfecting a nuke that could be used against japan continues china continues to tolerate a certain amount of north korean smuggling and financial misbehavior but north korea must be discreet because china is officially backing if not actually enforcing most of the economic sanctions on north korea since a crackdown on chinese banks a few years ago north korea has moved most of its illegal finance operations out of china north korea has established a network of companies and banks that will act for a fee as middlemen in turning north korean profits from foreign operations into products that can be shipped to north korea without any real proof north korea paid for it of course it is obvious that these imports are not free foreign aid but the source of payment is difficult to trace often more trouble than it is worth but when the effort is made a new north korea financial network is detected china is also helping north korea control its side of the border by making it easier to purchase the latest chinese surveillance camera equipment china is a leader in this market and the chinese government is a huge customer the north koreans are particularly interested in surveillance cameras that are easy to conceal the better to catch defectors or smugglers who believe they will not be detected same applies for border control guards who take bribes north korea does not want to stop smuggling but it does want most of it to be government controlled this is vital to bring in the luxury goods now banned by un sanctions via china these luxury and consumer items are needed for gifts to reward successful officials and also to stock the hard currency shops that carry foreign goods that can be purchased using dollars euros or yuan with more donju entrepreneurs and government officials getting bribe income these shops are busier and in need of more frequent resupply the burma blues in northern burma the chinese ambassador visited kachin state at the end of 2018 and bluntly told local officials that if china were not allowed to resume work on the 3 6 billion myitsone dam project there would be serious consequences for kachin state and burma in general after the visit china reported that the ambassador found most people in northern burma did not oppose the chinese projects the reaction in northern burma was to accuse the ambassador of ignoring reality the dam project was the result of studies done in the late 1990s to develop the border areas and control flooding originally scheduled to be operational by 2017 the myitsone project has been shut down since 2011 because of corruption charges largely true and armed resistance from local tribal rebels china was always willing to make concessions to save the dam project but has been unable to agree with burma on terms meanwhile conditions in china have changed originally china needed the 6 000 mw of electrical power generated by myitsone and 90 percent of it was going to china but in the last few years chinese economic growth has slowed and with that the need for additional electric power actually there are now electricity surpluses in parts of china bordering burma and the chinese have been offering to export some of that electric power to northern burma which still has an electricity shortage because of this many similar chinese development projects in northern burma other dams new mines and lots of road and bridge building to support it all are no longer as important to china burma is willing to let chinese development projects to go forward in the north as long as there is minimal corruption and misbehavior that means compensating the local landowners mainly tribes that have been in the area for centuries fairly china however wanted more than just the electrical power and profits from these investments china also wants some diplomatic assistance apparently regarding north korea south china sea and other sensitive matters china has been willing to negotiate with burma and compromise on its unpopular economic activities mainly in the north china is also offering good deals low prices on modern military equipment and that has the burmese military leadership interested meanwhile the border tribes have to go along with any chinese settlement and the tribes don t want the burmese troops to have more effective weapons the kachin tribes don t trust the chinese or their own government another chinese complaint has more widespread support shan state in northern burma remains the largest source of illegal drugs in the region china wants something done about all the drugs coming out of northern burma specifically opium heroin and methamphetamine the burmese methamphetamine production about 250 tons a year is a major regional problem that is worth 40 billion a year and that is a tremendous incentive for tribal drug gangs and corrupt government officials to help keep it going the meth usually in pill form is called yaba locally and is the most popular drug in southeast asia and southern china most nearly half of yaba goes to china followed by thailand the burmese meth has become hugely popular in china which is pressuring the burmese government to do more about the problem and that has resulted in more police activity up there but not enough to put a dent in the drug business the neighbors are aware that the burmese drug gangs have local security forces on the payroll which is why these clashes with burmese drug smugglers only seem to happen in thailand china plays down the fact that the smugglers don t have much trouble on the chinese side of the border because of the corruption moreover the drug trade in this area goes back a long time the area was a known source of opium for many centuries first as a valuable and expensive medicine pain killer and eventually for wealthy chinese a recreational drug in the 1700s the chinese tried with some success to ban opium exports to china the northern tribes of burma have maintained their armies of well armed well trained and very motivated soldiers for generations because of the drug income soldiers going after the drug armies are offered a choice bribes or bullets the bribes are the more popular choice january 30 2019 a un north korea sanctions monitoring group accuses china of violating the sanctions by tolerating chinese fishermen to buy fishing licenses to operate in lucrative north korea waters the chinese paid about 7 000 a month per boat south korea was also criticized for illegally bringing in several hundred tons of petroleum to operate a new liaison office at kaesong north korea is limited to 520 000 tons of imported petroleum products a year and all of that has been coming from china which normally shipped four times as much a year china is believed to be exceeding the quota by 20 percent or more via its oil pipeline to north korea illegal imports can be estimated by monitoring retail fuel prices in north korea january 29 2019 china has established a maritime rescue center on one of the artificial islands fiery cross reef in the spratly islands current facilities on fiery cross will be expanded to include more rescue capabilities nearby nations who have lost control of territory to the chinses south china sea claims see this rescue center as another chinese effort to legitimize its illegal efforts to take control of the south china sea by controlling the south china sea china controls the shortest sea route from west asia to the middle east africa and europe january 28 2019 the united states imposed oil sanctions on the venezuelan state oil company which is the only means china has to gets over 30 billion in venezuelan loans paid back this move encourages china to back juan guaido as the legitimate acting president of venezuela while guaido has made it clear he is willing to work with china it is only implied that the americans will go along with this january 26 2019 in malaysia the government announced it was canceling a 20 billion railroad project sponsored by the chinese the malaysians determined that the project was too costly and the government could not afford it the previous government that approved the deal was generally believed to be corrupt and willing to take bribes from the chinese to approve such a deal january 20 2019 china officially admitted that recent personnel changes in the military had fundamentally changed the chinese armed forces for the first time in history the chinese army comprises less than half the personnel in the armed forces the majority belong to the navy air force strategic missile forces space force and cyber war forces chinese have long called their armed forces the pla people s liberation army but in the last decade it has more common even for the media to refer to the chinese army navy air force and so on this process has been going on since the 1990s and the major shift took place in the last five years in 2013 there were 2 3 million personnel and about two thirds of that was the army in the last five years there were major cuts in army strength something that has been going on since the 1990s and rapid growth in the navy mainly as well as the other services military strength is now less than two million this has not gone unnoticed in russia although there the state controlled mass media maintains a strict silence about how the chinese military is not only twice the size of russian forces but has far more modern equipment both in terms of quality and quantity china also had a defense budget that is more double what russia can afford this also means that the in the russian chinese relationship china is now the senior partner in both economic and military terms january 18 2019 many nations are reporting major reductions in trade with china this is having a major impact on key world markets the most obvious one is petroleum where the price remains low despite the opec cartel cutting production several times the fracking boom in north america is the major reason for this and that explains why china is rapidly adopting the american fracking techniques to increase oil and natural gas production from the huge shale deposits that china has and which may exceed those in the united states january 14 2019 russia is joining china in undertaking high risk natural resource operations in africa for example russia recently agreed to back financially and otherwise a russian mining firm alrosa that negotiated a deal with the african nation zimbabwe to do a better and more profitable job of extracting diamonds from the large deposits zimbabwe has but has been unable to exploit effectively because the state run mining company was corrupt and inefficient alrosa will have more freedom to operate russia is also a major producer of diamonds and is willing to invest in zimbabwe despite the corrupt and erratic government there alrosa is protected because russia and china continue to protect their business interests in africa for example earlier in 2018 both countries vetoed a un resolution to impose sanctions on zimbabwe where the government has trashed the economy and chased a third of the population away russia and china also blocked un attempts to halt the sudan governments mass murder and depopulation of rebellious people in darfur russia and china both do a lot of business with zimbabwe and sudan but the opposition to un sanctions is more personal russia and china both have long histories of mass atrocities against their own populations and do not want to support any precedent for foreign intervention to halt this sort of thing zimbabwe would also like russian help in modernizing its armed forces but hasn t got any money to pay for it russia is willing to work out a deal that involves providing more security for russian commercial operations in zimbabwe january 12 2019 in uganda the finance minister announced that in his opinion uganda s growing debt is sustainable another government official had warned that major loans by some foreign lenders could lead to the lenders acquiring sovereign ugandan assets that warning spoke to a fear shared by many in uganda that major lender china has forced the ugandan government to use oil reserves as collateral for its large loans there are also worries that if default occurred beijing could gain control of power generation facilities and dams built with chinese money january 11 2019 japan is ordering another 99 f 35 fighters this will cost about 15 billion most of these will be the f 35a model but as many as 40 will be f 35bs the vertical takeoff version that can operate from carriers japan already has 42 f 35as on order to replace 73 elderly f 4e interceptors the new f 35as on order are to replace a hundred older f 15j fighter bombers another hundred more recently built f 15js have been upgraded with digital communications and fire control gear that can cooperate with f 35s japan may order more f 35s as part of its military buildup there may be more japanese f 35 orders because its locally designed f 2 maritime attack aircraft has been canceled because of high cost and uncertain performance japan also sought to design and build a stealthy replacement for the 1990s era f 2s but concluded it would be too expensive for just a hundred aircraft and such an x 2 aircraft could not compete against the american f 35 in export markets assuming japan changed its constitution to allow weapons exports so now japan is planning to eventually replace the f 2 with f 35s japan imports a lot of foreign warplanes but usually assembles them locally under license which it will do with the f 35s ordering some f 35bs makes it clear that japan is going to experiment with some of these aircraft aboard the existing japanese helicopter carriers since 2017 japan has had operational two 27 000 ton destroyers ddh type ships that look exactly like an aircraft carrier these izumo class ships can carry up to 28 helicopters or up to ten vertical takeoff aircraft the carriers are armed only with two 20mm phalanx anti missile cannon and launcher with sixteen essm missiles for anti missile defense the ddh have powerful engines capable of destroyer like speeds of over fifty four kilometers an hour there are also more medical facilities than one would expect for a ship of this size izumo does have considerable cargo capacity which is intended for moving disaster relief supplies quickly to where they are needed apparently some of these cargo spaces can be converted to berthing spaces for troops disaster relief personnel or people rescued from disasters as well as additional weapons and equipment needed to support f 35b fighter bombers izumo could carry and operate at least ten of the vertical take off f 35b stealth fighters once modifications were made to the flight deck handle the extremely high temperatures the f 35b generates when taking off or landing vertically like a helicopter meanwhile china admits that its aircraft carrier force will be confined to the west pacific for a decade or more as china learns how to use a carrier task force most effectively january 9 2019 in algerian the army also showed off six of its new chinese sm4 self propelled 120mm mortars algeria has long been a major customer for russian weapons and the algerian navy recently put two new russian kilo class submarines into service these had been ordered in 2014 when algeria began a major effort to upgrade its armed forces equipment while algeria has had some problems with the new russian weapons the chinese stuff has performed much better and the chinese tech and logistics support are superior as well algeria has the highest defense spending in africa about 10 billion a year which is a bit more than twice what second place sudan spends algeria accounts for about half the foreign weapons purchases throughout africa and gets most of its new gear from russia algeria keeps the russians honest and attentive by also purchasing more weapons from china which has a reputation for building russian weapons better than the russians a 2007 plan to spend 7 5 billion program to upgrade a lot of cold war era weapons and equipment included getting 300 new russian t 90 tanks and 1 200 german wheeled armored personnel carriers russia and germany are also providing new warships for the navy and dozens of russian su 30 warplanes russia offers low prices and a tolerant attitude towards corruption and bribes plus the russian stuff looks impressive and is not likely to be used in any serious fighting because algeria is surrounded by nations that have been generally non threatening for a long time the government has been quietly canceling or delaying military procurement deals because of the sustained low oil prices this includes nearly a billion dollars worth of russian arms and a 1 1 billion deal with an american firm to provide three gulfstream business jets equipped to perform radar optical and electronic surveillance this militarized gulfstream purchase was made in 2015 just as the low oil prices became a long term not a short term problem january 7 2019 north korean leader kim jong un arrived in china aboard his private train for a fourth visit this one lasted four days and apparently consisted of chinese officials reminding kim of how important it is for the kim dynasties survival that kim jong un pays attention to chinese economic advice kim was taken to several chinese workplaces to see the chinese economy in action and have it explained to him how it would work in north korea kim has been more cooperative with china than with south korea or the united states and for good reason china is the only reliable and effective ally north korea has in the past north korea has ignored and embarrassed china but no more north korea has been at odds with china ever since kim jong un took power in 2012 in 2014 kim was told that china would not come to the aid of the current north korean government if the government collapses or starts a war since 2014 china has been cracking down on north korean use of china for illegal imports and exports nothing seemed to work for china when it came to north korea or south korea for that matter this was humiliating for the chinese leaders and while the chinese government does not discuss this many chinese do talk about this disrespect and the chinese leaders pay attention to that but what could china do about an increasingly troublesome and disrespectful north korean leadership north korea s traditional allies china and russia have found that unlike before 2012 they now had little sway over the north korean government the russians could ignore all this but china could not to make matters worse china found itself being publicly insulted by north korea something that was unknown before kim jong un came to power in response china began publicly criticizing things that were wrong in north korea mismanagement nuclear weapons criminality in general china sent senior officials to north korea in late 2015 to spell out in some detail the consequences of continued bad behavior that did not fix the problem as usual when it comes to north korea the situation was expected to get very interesting especially since china offered a carrot as well as a stick following the 2015 warning chinese censors were ordered to suppress popular criticism of north korea and to have state controlled media say nice things about kim jong un for a while thus china offers north korea a choice cooperate and be rewarded or keep disrespecting their elder brother and suffer the consequences until 2018 north korea had not cooperated but china was patient and eventually reality caught up with the troublesome and now in big trouble kim jong un the elder brother is being listened to respected and obeyed

further simplified the business and acquired 5 companies and for the year we returned 1 6 billion to shareholders to our capital return program let s turn to guidance for the full year we expect revenue growth to be within a range of 7 to 9 in constant currency which falls within the medium term target we defined at investor day and for the first quarter of 2019 we expect revenue growth to be within a 7 5 to 8 5 range in constant currency turning to margins as you ll recall from investor day from here forward we will include stock based compensation expense in acquisition related charges in our non gaap measures of operating margin for 2019 our adjusted operating margin target will be approximately 19 i d like to offer a few thoughts now on the demand environment as we ve referenced on prior calls we are moving quickly to an era in which technology s role has shifted from supporting the business to actually being the business clients are clearheaded about this dynamic and continue to see the business case for digital transformation as absolutely compelling even against the backdrop of some global economic volatility our strategy for continuing to deliver disciplined and profitable growth as outlined at the november investor day responds directly to our clients mandate for transformation to help clients speed their journey to digital at scale we re investing to build distinctive leadership in the six advanced capabilities interactive artificial intelligence and analytics intelligent process automation platform solutions core modernization and digital engineering these six capabilities are aligned to our three practice areas and play to our expertise and strong market positions and all six areas offer ample headroom for growth and when we combine our focused investments in these capabilities with targeted acquisitions as well as continued geographic expansion in industry diversification we have our engine for delivering continued growth the board and i kept this strategy front of mind during the ceo selection process we undertook so we expect the strategy presented at investor day to continue to direct cognizant s approach to the market opportunity shaped of course by brian s perspective as he transitions into the ceo role i want to close by saying how fortunate i am to lead a company of cognizant s scale and stature and how proud i am of the work our associates do every day across the globe i look forward to continuing on the board and to ensuring a smooth transition and i m confident that cognizant s best days are ahead with that i ll turn the call over to karen who will give you an update on both our operational and financial performance karen karen mcloughlin chief financial officer thank you frank and good morning everyone q4 performance was solid rounding out full year results which were within our expectations and reflect continued execution of our strategy to derive sustainable revenue and earnings growth fourth quarter revenue of 4 13 billion was at the high end of our guided range an increase 7 9 year over year or 8 8 in constant currency the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard had an 11 million positive impact to revenue in the quarter banking and financial services continued to see slower growth at 2 8 year over year in constant currency driven by softness at a few of our largest banking clients as we discussed back at our investor day in november the pressure in our banking business has primarily been driven by some of our largest banking clients two of our top 5 clients continue to show good growth going into 2019 while spend at the other three clients remains under pressure despite the continued pressure in these three accounts the rest of our banking portfolio continues to grow nicely and based on deals that we ve already closed and our late stage pipeline of deals we do expect recovery in banking over the course of 2019 as i will discuss in a few moments we have made significant progress in developing platforms and solutions for the european banking markets and expect to see accelerated growth in those markets in 2019 moving on to healthcare which grew 7 year over year in constant currency growth with our healthcare payer and provider clients excluding the contribution from bolder healthcare was impacted by the continued ramp down of an account in which we were a subcontractor to a third party and a temporary slow down with several large clients involved in mergers where the potential spending associated with integration work is not yet under way we expect this to continue into q1 as healthcare delivery is shifting from a sea for service to a value based care model we are seeing increased collaboration and partnerships across payers and providers that s focused on effective consumer engagement with data driven insights while we have seen periods of slower growth in healthcare we believe that our investments in the industry have positioned us well to take advantage of this shift over the long term products and resources had another strong quarter showing 15 4 growth year over year in constant currency we were pleased with the good growth in both retail and manufacturing and logistics in q4 in what is typically a seasonally weak quarter for those industries let me give you an example of work we are doing to help clients along their transformation journey in this segment a leading u s fast food chain that pioneered the concept of the classic 1940s drive thru with the on the go convenience was facing the challenge of digital technologies redefining the very concept of convenience they needed to elevate the guest experience and increase operational efficiencies in order to stay competitive cognizant helped to develop an overall digital strategy and the restaurant changed first mobile app including location finding menu viewing ordering and online payment combined with kitchen customer service and supply chain management tools when the app was initially launched purchasers saw an average of 12 increase in order value it has now been deployed across all 2 000 plus franchise locations our communications media and technology segment had another strong quarter with year over year growth of 20 1 in constant currency driven by our technology clients a recent client engagement in our communications media and technology segment held our ai and analytics story a major software company needed to achieve a higher percentage of subscription renewals for its software and services reduced costly customer churn and drive additional sales the client however lacked essential repository of information about past customer transactions key decision makers on accounts or product related issues in other words the very details needed to expand sales and close more deals our team partnered with a client applying big data and machine learning to develop an automated cloud based central data repository and predictive analytics that enabled the client to connect the dots of customer behavior across its entire product portfolio using machine learning and predictive analytics the client is now able to predict customer churn with 80 accuracy take proactive steps to retain high risk high value customers and spot patterns to identify customers most receptive to cross sell and up sell many of you may know that cognizant was born in the data and analytics space and we ve been consolidating our position here over the last 25 years so we ve been at this for some time and today we are a top 3 leader in this market this is just one example of our analytics and ai practice at work now moving on to geos the rest of the world grew 4 7 year over year in constant currency results in asia pacific continue to be negatively impacted by the weakness in some of our larger banking clients europe grew 20 3 year over year in constant currency our investments both organic and inorganic have given us a solid footprint in continental europe from which we expect continued strong growth we ve grown our geographic footprint organically by expanding our client roster adding new delivery and operational centers and developing local talent in the markets we serve our organic growth has been accelerated with the ramp up of a number of strategic client engagements in benelux in banking and manufacturing nordics in energy and banking france in banking and life sciences switzerland in life sciences and germany with life sciences and communication media and technology acquisitions such as netcentric hedera zone and mirabeau have enhanced our digital leadership in the region and complemented our ability to service our clients across the entire range of the digital transformation as i mentioned earlier we have made significant progress developing platforms and solutions specifically for banking clients in europe these include solutions for core banking credit operations cloud transformation and digital transformation these solutions which require deep industry expertise and local presence are expected to bring sizable revenue opportunities in the coming years as an example of core banking transformation we ve recently announced partnership with three finnish financial institutions savings bank group oma savings bank plc and pop bank group to transform and operate a shared core banking platform based on temenos t24 and temenos payment hub that will enable their digital transformation plans more than 10 of finnish banking deposits and loans will be managed by the new platform this partnership will not only help support our acceleration of revenue growth beginning in the second quarter but over the longer term will provide expanded opportunities in other markets across europe an example of could transformation is our partnership with abn amro clearing to cloud enable its global it infrastructure and lay the foundation for digital transformation further we have a good pipeline of similar opportunities as we enter 2019 shifting now to margins non gaap operating margin which excludes stock based compensation expense acquisition related expenses and realignment charges was 19 5 non gaap eps was 1 13 exceeding our guidance primarily due to a lower non gaap tax rate the q4 gaap tax rate of 20 6 was lower than our previous guidance of 31 primarily due to net non operating foreign exchange gains driven by the appreciate of the indian rupee and guidance regarding the gilti provision of the tax reform act issued in the fourth quarter of 2018 this tax guidance led to a reversal of the incremental income tax expense accrued for this provision earlier in the year for the full year 2018 revenue of 16 13 billion represented growth of 8 9 or 8 5 in constant currency non gaap operating margin was 20 7 in line with our guidance of approximately 21 and non gaap eps was 4 57 as we presented at our investor day in november starting in 2019 we are revising our non gaap operating margin and eps definitions going forward our adjusted operating margin and eps will no longer exclude stock based compensation expense and acquisition related expenses when calculated under the new methodology the full year of 2019 adjusted operating margin was 18 1 and adjusted eps was 4 02 now turning to our other metrics consulting and technology services represented 58 2 of revenue and outsourcing services 41 8 of revenue for the quarter consulting and technology services grew 9 5 year over year and outsourcing services revenue grew 5 6 from q4 a year ago consulting growth benefited from the inclusion of several of our recent acquisitions such as softvision and atg and continued strong demands for digital solutions within outsourcing we saw continued strength in digital operations partially offset by the ramp down of the healthcare customer previously mentioned where we were serving as a subcontractor to a third party during the fourth quarter 37 of our revenue came from fixed price contracts and transaction based contracts were approximately 11 of total revenue in the quarter we added seven strategic customers in the quarter defined as those with the potential to generate at least 5 million to 15 million or more in annual revenue this brings our total number of strategic clients to 385 now moving to an update on operations in the fourth quarter we continued to build on the operational improvements we ve made in our business over the last two years such as higher levels of utilization improved pyramid structure simplification of our business unit overhead structure and a more effective leverage of our corporate function spend net of hedges our q4 margins also benefited from the depreciation of the indian rupee versus a year ago by 120 basis points which allowed us to continue investing for growth the solid margin performance also allowed us to absorb the remaining wage increases and promotions in the quarter while achieving our full year non gaap operating margin target in 2019 we expect continued margin improvement to be underpinned by ongoing improvement in operational efficiency and discipline a continued shift within our business to focus on higher value services improving profitability of our portfolio of large structured contracts and ongoing reassessment of less profitable opportunities that do not further our long term strategic position from a people and talent perspective our annualized attrition rate at 19 declined over 300 basis points from q3 but remains elevated while we are pleased with the decline in the attrition rate we continue to focus on our workforce strategy and overall management turning to our balance sheet which remains very healthy we finished the year with 4 5 billion of cash and short term investments down 545 million from december 31st 2017 net of debt this balance was down by 417 million from december 31st 2017 as a reminder our cash balance includes restricted short term investments of 423 million these restricted amounts are related to the ongoing dispute with the india income tax department we had strong cash generation in the quarter with free cash flow of 606 million on a full year basis free cash flow of 2 2 billion as the ratio to net income was just over 1 time our outstanding debt balance was 745 million at the end of the quarter and there was no outstanding balance on the revolver during the fourth quarter we repurchased approximately 3 6 million shares and our diluted share count decreased to 579 million shares for the quarter i would now like to comment on our outlook for q1 and the full year 2019 for the full year 2019 we expect revenue to grow 7 to 9 in constant currency based on current exchange rates this translates to growth of 6 3 to 8 3 reflecting our assumption of a negative 70 basis points for foreign exchange for the first quarter of 2019 we expect to deliver revenue growth of 7 5 to 8 5 in constant currency based on current exchange rates this translates to growth of 5 8 to 6 8 reflecting our assumption of a negative 170 basis points for foreign exchange for the full year of 2019 we expect adjusted operating margins under our revised definition to be approximately 19 and to deliver adjusted eps of at least 4 40 a 10 increase versus 2018 on a like for like basis this guidance anticipates a full year share count of approximately 578 million shares and a tax rate in the range of 24 to 26 this tax rate range is consistent with our midterm expectations guidance provided for our revised non gaap measures adjusted eps excludes realignment charges and other unusual items if any net non operating foreign currency exchange gains and losses and the tax effects of the above adjustments our guidance also does not account for the impact from shifts in the regulatory environment including areas such as immigration and tax we are committee to the more balanced approach to capital allocation that we outlined at our investor day last november beginning in 2019 we intend to utilize approximately 50 of global free cash flow annually for dividends and share repurchases this should allow us to maintain a dividend payout ratio of about 20 and reduce our outstanding share count by approximately 1 annually the board has declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0 20 per share for shareholders of record at the close of business on february 21st additionally 25 of our annual global free cash flow is intended to be used for acquisitions that enhance our longer term strategy of enriching our digital capabilities expanding our geographic footprint and enhancing vertical expertise in summary our solid execution in 2018 along with continued investment in the business has positioned us well to deliver another solid year of revenue and earnings growth in 2019 operator we can open the call for questions questions and answers operator thank you at this time we ll be conducting a question and answer session if you d like to ask a question please press 1 on your telephone keypad a confirmation tone will indicate your line is in question queue you may press 2 if you d like to remove your question from the queue for participants using speaker equipment it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the keys our first question comes from the line of tien tsin huang with jpmorgan please proceed with your question tien tsin huang j p morgan analyst hi thanks so much i just want to say frank congrats on an amazing run as ceo i enjoyed working with you and interacting with you so best wishes to you and raj as well let s start with that i guess on the ceo succession so brian humphries you gave a lot of good detail there what stood out for him to be chosen as ceo as an outsider can we infer that his international experience maybe signals a greater global focus for cognizant on top of carrying forward the plan you set up 3 months ago francisco d souza chief executive officer tien tsin thanks a lot for the kind words look i think that i ll say a couple of things when we set out to think about my successor the board conducted a thorough process what we were really focused on tien tsin was sort of the strategy that we laid out for all of you at investor day as sort of the core of what s going to take the company forward and as we assessed our choices brian is just a solid choice he is well regarded a highly regarded technology executive he s got a great track record of success across multiple companies industries technologies geographies roles and organizational cultures i think with his global perspective but also client focused experience with transformational technologies he is the right executive to execute on our strategy as digital continues to permeate and power every industry tien tsin huang j p morgan analyst got it got it so maybe if i can just add a quick outlook question just thinking about fiscal 19 the big differences here and how you might see growth shape up versus 2018 it looks like you re guiding the top end of the outlook to be pretty consistent with what you achieved in 18 karen mcloughlin chief financial officer i think that s fair tien tsin if you remember back at investor day right we talked about that we thought near to midterm growth would be in the 6 to 9 on an organic constant currency perspective and that in the near term we d be at the lower end of that range and then as we continued to grow and add on more acquisitions we would move up the range so as we re seeing this year we think it plays out very consistently with what we outlined at investor day q1 is a little bit slower than the full year but as we talked about in my comments we are starting to see some nice recovery with some of the new partnerships in financial services particularly in the european markets and so we re very confident that as we get into the second quarter that we ll start to accelerate growth in banking which then obviously support the overall growth rates for the year but i think in terms of general trends obviously shift to digital continues and really no significant changes from where we saw the recent quarters tien tsin huang j p morgan analyst all right appreciate it thanks operator thank you our next question comes from the line of lisa ellis with moffettnathanson please proceed with your question lisa ellis moffettnathanson analyst hi good morning i ll echo tien tsin s comments frank congratulations on a phenomenal run i think we re all curious to see what you re off to next i will actually start then taking this opportunity to ask you one more long term industry vision question as you are moving out of your ceo role at cognizant when you look out over the next 5 to 10 years in what ways in your mind will the it services industry be meaningfully different and comment on cognizant s distinctive positioning relative to those changes things that perhaps we don t have from our seats the opportunity to see in the way that you do francisco d souza chief executive officer thanks a lot lisa i appreciate again the kind words it s been quite a run just as an anecdote i was thinking about it the other day this is my 48th quarter that i will be reporting as the ceo of this place anyway i guess as a ceo you measure by public company quarters i think lisa here s what i would say to your question i think that as i look forward the difference that we re going to see over the next 5 10 years is and we ve been saying this and it may even sound somewhat clichÃ© at the moment technology is really going from a decade ago when it was supporting the back offices of business to really being the very essence of businesses today i say often that every enterprise is now a technology enterprise every business leader is really a technology leader every budget can be considered a technology budget inside of our clients i mean there s really this pervasiveness of technology where we re already starting to see and therefore which i think we re going to continue to see as technology becomes just more and more integral to not just businesses but governments and societies and so on and so forth against that context i think that firms like ours need to really have a set of capabilities that line up directly with that role that technology will play going forward that s why i think that the six capabilities that we outlined for you at investor day are so important if you look at them as capabilities they individually represent big market opportunities but if you look at them as a set as a group they really represent what i believe are the core capabilities that every enterprise is going to need to embed deeply into their operations into their p l into their business so that they can fully take advantage of digital at scale and so i think that this notion of how you organize yourself as a services business and how you respond to this idea of digital at scale the pervasiveness of technology across the enterprise is really going to be the core trend that services businesses will have to respond to over the coming decade lisa ellis moffettnathanson analyst great thank you and then maybe as my follow up i ll ask the inevitable every two year s question i suppose with new congress in session inevitably over the next couple of months i imagine we ll hear some noise surrounding h1b visa reform so just perhaps to get ahead of that can you proactively highlight what progress cognizant has made over the last couple of years reducing your dependence on h1b visas i recall i believe at investor day you gave some statistics about the percentage of your u s workers that are now permanent residents or citizens etc can you just maybe put those top of mind before we see any of that noise coming out over the next couple of months thanks francisco d souza chief executive officer thanks lisa look i always start the immigration questions with the big picture answer which is that the reality is that in many parts of the world certainly in the united states many parts of western europe there really is a significant shortage of technology talent which needs to be addressed for these economies to remain competitive if you go back to the first part or your first question as the world becomes more technology intensive these economies really need skilled technologists to maintain the competitive edge we continue to make progress at investor day we shared with you that at the moment in north america over 40 of our north american workforce or let s say our u s workforce is citizens or permanent residents we continue to make significant progress and i expect that in the medium term we ll be well over 50 karen mcloughlin chief financial officer and i think lisa this is karen if i could just add to that i mean as i think you know if you will recall last year we setup our u s foundation which we funded with 100 million initially to continue to launch more training programs in the u s as frank said obviously the biggest challenge is shortage of talent not just here but in other parts of the world as well so we are certainly focused on helping to change that trajectory in the coming years lisa ellis moffettnathanson analyst terrific thank you both and congrats again frank francisco d souza chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of edward caso with wells fargo securities please proceed with your question edward s caso wells fargo securities analyst hi good morning i was curious if you could give more color to your strategic accounts 385 of them sort of how many at this point are above the desired 5 million and maybe like some of your peers could you array them as to over 100 million over 50 million just give us a little bit more color other than it goes up 7 every quarter thank you karen mcloughlin chief financial officer so ed this is karen all of those accounts are actually over 5 million and most of them are considerably above 5 million on an annual run rate we have not broken out how many accounts we have over 100 million but it is in the range of doing this off the top of my head about 30 over 30 accounts at this point so there s a fairly large number of significant clients that have emerged over the years edward s caso wells fargo securities analyst right my other question is on the healthcare how sensitive are you to winning sort of these large transformational deals to sort of get the healthcare group back on track thanks and congrats to frank francisco d souza chief executive officer thanks ed look i don t think we are dependent on winning large transformational deals the business is built on this and the vast majority whether it s in healthcare or in any of the other verticals it s built on this idea of continuing to grow with our clients in a methodical way that usually involves many many small and medium sized projects with each client to continue to grow we ll continue to do large transformational deals we announced the deal that karen spoke about this quarter with the three finnish banks that s a great example of a transformational deal that plays into our strategy platforms and so on and so forth so i certainly will not rule out doing those deals going forward but i don t think the engine or the cognizant business is built on an assumption that we re going to do those deals to continue to grow karen mcloughlin chief financial officer and i think ed if could just also add to what frank said i think we talked about this last quarter a little bit right particularly with the platform deals the tmg deal and the emblemhealth deal you want certainly that large feed client to launch the platform and be able to build out the capability and so forth but after that it actually enables you to add a lot of smaller engagements and smaller clients that historically we may not have been able to really support in a meaningful way and we re certainly starting to see that traction now particularly with the tmg relationship and being able to onboard now smaller opportunities which obviously you can move a lot faster and they become accretive quite quickly so that s certainly happening in that side of the business and then overall in healthcare as we had talked about there s been obviously a number of mergers that are under way in healthcare while we certainly expect to get our fair share of the integration work once that commences we certainly have seen a little bit of pullback recently as those clients are planning for integration that s typical we said that at some point we thought that would happen and we ve seen that a little bit over the last few weeks at some point they will move into execution of the integration operator thank you our next question comes from the line of brian essex with morgan stanley please proceed with your question brian essex morgan stanley analyst good morning and thank you for taking the question karen i was wondering if you could touch on inorganic contribution in the quarter you guys had a pretty active fourth quarter with deals and it sounds like you continued that activity into this year just wondering what the contribution is and how we might anticipate contributions through the remainder of the year and i have a quick follow up karen mcloughlin chief financial officer sure so m a contribution in q4 was about 250 basis points on a year over year perspective that is also true in q1 so you will see that again in q1 for full year 18 it was about 150 basis points on a year over year basis versus 17 and in our 2019 guidance that includes the deals that we have already completed which is also about 150 basis points of revenue new deals as we talked about at investor day we would expect to add about 150 to 200 basis points a year of new deals so we ve obviously done that for 18 we ve done it again included in our 19 guidance and then new deals in 19 would be beyond that brian essex morgan stanley analyst got it that s super helpful and then you know maybe if we could touch on you mentioned in your prepared remarks that the impact of the rupee appreciation gave you a little bit of flexibility to invest for growth i think some are anticipating a little bit of maybe that s flipping to a headwind this year and if that s the case what measures might you have to continue to or i guess to manage that and continue to invest for growth throughout fiscal 19 karen mcloughlin chief financial officer sure so i mean we certainly ramped up hiring in the fourth quarter to support growth as we go in to 19 and we ll put those folks to good use i think as we look at 2019 utilization stayed fairly consistent last year with 17 we know we ve got a little bit of room to continue to push that if need be certainly we continue to focus on our pyramid as we move into 2019 and then really scaling some of the larger more structured deals or platform opportunities as we had said really two years ago when we started outlining this new framework that initially those deals do tend to be margin dilutive and as you get into the outer years such as where we re starting to get now with some of the original ones you start to see that margin accretion kick in which then allows us to continue to fund more investments so those would be some of the major things that we re looking at this year as well as continuing to leverage sg a but really our focus right now is driving for growth and making sure that we re investing in the talent and rescaling and so forth to do that brian essex morgan stanley analyst great very helpful thank you very much operator thank you our next question comes from the line of jim schneider with goldman sachs please proceed with your question jim schneider goldman sachs analyst good morning thanks for taking my question good luck to you frank in your next phase of your career maybe just to start off on the overall it spending environment from your customers right now clearly they re spending more on digital and less on maintenance can you maybe talk about their overall posture as they go into 2019 any signs of worries around an economic slowdown or a pullback in it spending or are things pretty much running the same course as they have been francisco d souza chief executive officer jim it s frank look i think as i said in my prepared comments what i see is an environment as you said in traditional in what you would think of as traditional it clearly a pressure on running the business maintenance types of activities in order to free up the dollars to invest in growth that trend has been going on for a while equally importantly as i said as technology permeates organizations i think we are able to tap into new budgets as i said almost every budget is now somewhat a technology budget whether it s the r d budget whether it s the marketing budget all of these become new sources of opportunity for us overall i think our market opportunities has never been larger it continues to expand given technology permeating all aspects of organizations i think as it relates to the macro environment clearly there are concerns out there about various issues in europe relations with china and so on and so forth i haven t seen it yet translate into a meaningful impact on demand for us so at this point when i think about 2019 i see a solid demand environment jim schneider goldman sachs analyst thanks and maybe as a follow up regarding the outlook in financial services in particular i think karen referenced a couple of specific deal wins that would improve that trajectory in q2 i guess what s your level of confidence in that improvement in financial sustain itself can you maybe just kind of address what you re seeing in your u s banking client base as well karen mcloughlin chief financial officer sure so in terms of the confidence jim as we talked about the finnish deal for example as a signed deal so we re just waiting for final clearance and closing of that we have other deals similarly in the pipeline that we re very close to finalizing here so we have a high degree of confidence particularly in the european markets in terms of what we re seeing and then as it relates to i m actually going to talk about north america as well as the top 5 so if you recall at investor day right we talked about the top 5 and that two of them had returned to very nice growth that continued in q4 and continues into q1 where we re talking about in some cases double digit year over year growth and those are obviously very large relationships so it s a very nice turnaround there the other three accounts continue to be under some pressure and at this point we re certainly not assuming a big turnaround for our guidance for those accounts but then if we look at the rest of the north america banking business it has and continues to grow quite nicely it just gets under pressure when you have some of these larger relationships pulling down the overall growth rate of the business jim schneider goldman sachs analyst thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of bryan keane with deutsche bank please proceed with your question bryan keane deutsche bank securities analyst congrats frank i did want to ask about the ceo change a little bit surprised it didn t you know the background of brian isn t somebody with a little bit more it services background or an executive from one of your peers or competitors can you just talk about why somebody outside the industry necessarily was the right hire for cognizant francisco d souza chief executive officer thanks bryan as i said before the board conducted a very methodical search for my successor we kept in mind very carefully the strategy that we outlined for you during our investor day a few months ago as we went through that process we just determined that brian is the right executive we think that he s got a terrific track record of success across companies in the technology space multiple industries obviously technologies themselves geographies roles in organizational cultures and when we put all of that together we just think that brian is the right executive to execute on the strategy that we outlined for you at investor day as digital continues to permeate and power as i said before every industry bryan keane deutsche bank securities analyst okay that s helpful and then karen just thinking about the guidance i know the fourth quarter came in about 8 8 in constant currency guidance is calling for 7 and 9 so i guess you re already running at the high end of the revenue guide and with financial services improving in 2019 just thinking about what pulls down maybe the range toward 7 and 9 and not a touch higher since you guys have a little bit of momentum heading into 2019 karen mcloughlin chief financial officer i think bryan i mean certainly the guidance is consistent with what we outlined at investor day q1 is a little soft which obviously puts a little bit of pressure on the full year although we re very comfortable with the ramp for the back half of the year i think obviously we like to be prudent particularly earlier in the year as we see things start to evolve we will certainly take that into consideration but i think right now we re very comfortable this is consistent with what we said back in november and we ve made the investments to support this growth range for this year bryan keane deutsche bank securities analyst all right thanks guys operator thank you our next question comes from the line of bryan bergin from cowen company please proceed with your question bryan bergin cowen company analyst hi good morning thank you regarding your onshore hiring efforts can you comment on the inflation levels in this tight labor environment particularly around digital capabilities and then how are clients responding on pricing and your ability to pass those costs through francisco d souza chief executive officer i would say a couple of things which we ve said in the past on a like for like basis once you look at all in costs our talent base in the u s whether that talent base is if you will hired locally or folks that are here on some sort of a visa there isn t a meaningful cost difference between those two talent pools so we are from a cost standpoint indifferent of course as i said earlier we are in a tight in a constrained market as you pointed out so given the demand for our services we re always struggling to find the talent that we need to fulfill our growth ambitions but like for like you know all in the costs are about the same karen mcloughlin chief financial officer yes and i think just to add to that too talking a little bit about pricing i think as frank said like for like you re not actually seeing a big change and certainly i don t think wage inflation given the skills we re hiring we ve seen that in a significant way what you do see obviously is and this is always true skills that are in hot demand come with a high price that s no different now versus the last 10 or 20 years but the flipside is that in this environment clients need that talent as much as we do and you ll get the pricing to accommodate that i think as we talked about last year pricing has remained quite consistent and in fact last year was the first year in quite a while that you actually had some pricing strength in the market because of the shortage of talent that trend has continued francisco d souza chief executive officer you know the last thing maybe i ll add sorry to jump back in remember when we look at our portfolio of digital our revenue from digital that is running it has and continues to run at above company average margins which i think speaks to our ability there to drive pricing despite the fact that in general the talent pool as karen pointed out in the digital part of the business is a higher cost talent pool operator thank you our next question comes from the line of keith bachman with bmo capital markets please proceed with your question keith frances bachman bmo capital markets analyst hi thank you very much first frank congratulations on brian i know him from his hp days i think he s a terrific choice as a matter of fact i think getting somebody from outside of industry could certainly help cognizant quite a bit so congratulations on that my question was a little bit different in that if i read the press release correctly you re the founder of the company as you said have tremendous success over a number of years you re going to move to the board seat i think after a transition period frequently particularly with founders there are situations in which when new leadership comes on board they eventually get off to allow the new leadership to have unbridled capabilities to direct the strategy but it doesn t sound like you plan on doing that am i correct in reading that francisco d souza chief executive officer you know keith my primary and really only goal here is to ensure that we do whatever is necessary to make sure that brian is incredibly successful as we go through the transition and beyond that and my commitment to my fellow board members and to the company is that i will play whatever role is necessary to make sure that that happens and not a bit more than that and so we will play that as things come but at the moment my commitment is to all of you to our shareholders to my 282 000 fellow associates around the world and to my fellow board members that my commitment is to make sure that i do whatever is in my power to ensure we have an absolutely smooth transition keith frances bachman bmo capital markets analyst fair enough fair enough just one for you karen i just want to understand 606 in 2019 606 was a help both the top line and the margins in 2018 my assumption is it s neutral in 2019 i know it s hard to predict because it depends on the nature of the contracts but is that the right assumption that 606 is neutral to both the top line and to the margins in 2019 karen mcloughlin chief financial officer yes that is a fair response from keith and we will no longer in 2019 we will not be breaking it out that was a one year requirement to make that disclosure but from a modeling perspective just assume it s neutral karen mcloughlin chief financial officer many thanks cheers operator thank you ladies and gentlemen our last question this morning will come from the line of rod bourgeois with deepdive equity research please proceed with your question rod bourgeois deepdive equity research analyst hey there and i d echo the last comment i think brian is a great hire and it s nice to see the new thinking about being more global and so on i wanted to ask in that context a couple of things do you expect as the ceo change occurs that anything related to guidance or financial targets might be reconsidered and also do you expect any management departures related to the ceo change besides the one that s already been announced francisco d souza chief executive officer rod it s frank multiple parts to your question there let me just first of all just say that as we think about raj i want to just say that it s worth really spending a minute to thank raj for his countless contributions to the growth and success of cognizant when raj joined the company i think we were 20 million in revenue and from that to over 16 billion last year raj has provided leadership operational skills passion for clients for over 2 decades in a variety of operating roles he s as you know served as our president for the past 2 and a half years so i just want to thank raj acknowledge his many many many contributions to the company on this call i wish him well in his future endeavors i think as we ve outlined for you today our targets and our guidance for 2019 are based on our best view of the business at this point for the year we re providing those to you as we always do having considered all of the factors that could positively or negatively influence our performance and this is our best view and that continues to be the case with the 2019 guidance i m sure that as brian comes in he ll bring his perspectives to the role and when we have updates we ll provide those to you or brian will going forward i don t think we have anything else to add to that so i guess thanks very much everybody thanks again for joining the call i want you all to know that i ve truly enjoyed the many many interactions with all of you over the 48 quarters that i ve done this i look forward to introducing brian to you in the days ahead and during the transition process once he s on board so thank you very much operator thank you this concludes today s teleconference you may disconnect your liens at this time thank you for

do not correspond to revenues under gaap but are used as relevant measures of business activity the following additional information is relevant to an understanding of metlife s performance results all comparisons on a constant currency basis reflect the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and are calculated using the average foreign currency exchange rates for the current period and are applied to each of the comparable periods as a result amounts will be updated each period to reflect the average foreign currency exchange rates volume growth as discussed in the context of business growth is the period over period percentage change in adjusted earnings available to common shareholders attributable to adjusted premiums fees and other revenues and assets under management levels applying a model in which certain margins and factors are held constant the most significant of such items are underwriting margins investment margins changes in equity market performance expense margins and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates asymmetrical and non economic accounting refers to i the portion of net derivative gains losses on embedded derivatives attributable to the inclusion of metlife s credit spreads in the liability valuations ii hedging activity that generates net derivative gains losses and creates fluctuations in net income because hedge accounting cannot be achieved and the item being hedged does not a have an offsetting gain or loss recognized in earnings iii inflation indexed benefit adjustments associated with contracts backed by inflation indexed investments and amounts associated with periodic crediting rate adjustments based on the total return of a contractually referenced pool of assets and other pass through adjustments and iv impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the re measurement of foreign denominated unhedged funding agreements and financing transactions to the u s dollar and the re measurement of certain liabilities from non functional currencies to functional currencies metlife believes that excluding the impact of asymmetrical and non economic accounting from total gaap results enhances investor understanding of metlife s performance by disclosing how these accounting practices affect reported gaap results metlife uses a measure of free cash flow to facilitate an understanding of its ability to generate cash for reinvestment into its businesses or use in non mandatory capital actions metlife defines free cash flow as the sum of cash available at metlife s holding companies from dividends from operating subsidiaries expenses and other net flows of the holding companies including capital contributions to subsidiaries and net contributions from debt to be at or below target leverage ratios this measure of free cash flow is prior to capital actions such as common stock dividends and repurchases debt reduction and mergers and acquisitions free cash flow should not be viewed as a substitute for net cash provided by used in operating activities calculated in accordance with gaap the free cash flow ratio is typically expressed as a percentage of annual adjusted earnings available to common shareholders notable items represent a positive negative impact to adjusted earnings available to common shareholders notable items reflect the unexpected impact

investor owned utilities have lobbied against rooftop solar projects and dug in their heels on transitioning to renewables a green new deal should empower communities to kick them out jeff gritchen digital first media orange county register via getty images highland park mich is a small majority black community of three square miles nestled in the center of detroit with some of the highest poverty and unemployment rates in the country it s suffered a series of indignities and setbacks over the years a state emergency management takeover of the city and surrounding areas a state takeover of the public water infrastructure public school closures and a collapse of tax revenue fueled by white flight fossil fuel driven suburban development and the rapid decline of the housing market and auto industries residents were hit again when in 2011 an armada of flatbed trucks with workers bearing dte energy logos moved through the city and started pulling streetlight poles out of the ground residents watched from their porches as their infrastructure was taken away in real time dte energy the area s investor owned monopoly energy utility repossessed over 1 000 streetlights from highland park because of 4 million in unpaid electric bills accumulated over many years to put that in context the city s debt to the utility was still significantly less than what dte s ceo gerard anderson took home in compensation that year 5 4 million the repossession prompted highland park residents to organize and put up their own solar street lights but it also forced the community to reckon with deeper questions of how dte treated residents a 2017 survey of 70 highland park households conducted by soulardarity a nonprofit and community organizing group found that close to half of those polled had trouble paying their electrical bills a quarter had experienced gas or electricity shutoffs the majority of which were during michigan s cold winter months nonetheless dte has proposed additional extensive rate hikes raising money that goes in large part to maintain their current coal plants build new fossil fuel plants and pay their ceos millions while dte s actions are shameful they aren t too different from the behaviors of many investor owned utilities in the united states the green new deal advocated by members of congress and presidential hopefuls including detroit s own freshman rep rashida tlaib promises rapid action on climate change while the green new deal should encompass a massive range of initiatives a cornerstone must be a program to free communities from the unjust power of investor owned utilities not only for de carbonization but in order to transform our economy so it serves everyone modeled after the original new deal s rural electrification administration such a program could give communities the much needed finance and capacity to kick out their investor owned utilities in favor of community run renewable powered utilities the problem with investor owned utilities dte and its fellow investor owned utilities have a long history prioritizing money making over the needs of communities or the environment as companies that are largely traded on the stock market their primary driver is shareholder gain and growth they dump pollution on poor people and people of color situating their noxious fossil fuel plants landfills incinerators or refineries in black and brown neighborhoods where the residents have less capital be it time money or political influence to object households in low income neighborhoods and communities of color across u s cities experience a higher than average energy burden a higher ratio of energy costs to earned income in part because they often live in older energy inefficient buildings the investor owned utilities also use regressive pricing mechanisms that squeeze the poor to the benefit of their shareholders and higher use ratepayers high energy commercial users get lower rates while ordinary consumers who seek to save money through conserving energy or installing solar systems find themselves being hit with higher fixed rates from utilities just to get access throughout wayne county which includes highland park and detroit households at 50 percent or less of the poverty level are spending a stunning 30 percent of their income on energy three times the threshold that qualifies as living in energy poverty and across the country much as in highland park shutoffs are an all too regular occurrence putting residents at risk of being without air conditioning in extreme heat home heating in extreme cold or even the ability to operate life supporting medical equipment these big companies consolidate political power through campaign contributions lobbying and tactical philanthropy they have built up serious political and economic machines where they operate often so much so that the regulators bend to their will quashing community needs for example dominion energy of virginia is the largest corporate contributor to electoral campaigns in the state no single company even comes close to dominion in terms of its wide ranging influence and impact on virginia politics and government says larry sabato a university of virginia professor the private utility industry shows no meaningful sign of being willing or even able to adapt to the urgent need for a shift to renewable energy in large part this is because their business model revolves around a centralized distribution system and a deeply vested interest in fossil fuel infrastructure from pipelines to power plants these companies have used their economic and political machines to dig in their heels in on the energy transition from fighting rooftop solar tooth and nail to changing rate structures in ways that make renewable energy financially infeasible while some investor owned utilities are starting to shift to renewable energy their compulsion to recoup their sunk costs and obligation to generate shareholder profits continually impede progress if not for pressure from municipalization campaigns in boulder colo and minneapolis minn the much lauded electric utility xcel may not have made commitments to increase its use of renewable energy so quickly where they ve given in to renewables investor owned utilities actively campaign against any projects that would fall outside of their ownership for example dte has been pushing a proposal that would change how net metering works a move that could seriously hurt rooftop solar because those who have it would benefit less from the energy they contribute to the grid in response to dte s proposal becky stanfield senior regional director of vote solar says it is very clear that dte is trying to put a dagger in the heart of rooftop solar in michigan this is especially problematic because we only have 12 years to implement a 45 percent reduction in our collective greenhouse gas emissions to avoid the worst consequences of climate change according to the latest report of the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change the united states is already feeling the effects of climate change with the costs disproportionately falling on low income communities and people of color the investor owned utilities persistence in a climate change fueling business model is a threat to us all time to take the power this failure begs the question is it time to liberate ourselves from for profit utilities in favor of community control by cutting ties with investor owned utilities to build new publicly owned and operated energy utilities communities could put themselves back in charge of decision making seek to lower their energy burden transition more rapidly to renewable energy and place equity at the center of energy policy now elected officials like tlaib and rep alexandria ocasio cortez d n y have teamed up with climate activists to demand adoption of a green new deal ocasio cortez s proposal mandates the rapid elimination of fossil fuel use and calls for a renewable resilient energy future with social economic racial regional and gender based justice and equality at the core community control of utilities is a key way to deliver on a just green new deal one way to bring this about is to have the federal government fund this ownership shift through patient low to no interest loans as well as grants and other incentives to support the creation of community owned nonprofit utilities allowing communities to ditch their current for profit utility contracts and take over their local wires the parallel electrifying rural america this is not unprecedented the u s government took very similar steps in the 1930s when congress passed the rural electrification act as part of the new deal to supply power to areas that for profit companies had written off as unprofitable when that act was signed into law by president franklin d roosevelt investor owned utilities had left nine out of 10 rural homes without access to electricity writes author john l neufeld in his book selling power economics policy and electric utilities before 1940 stories abounded of farmers coming individually and in groups to utility executives begging for service only to be flatly rejected even when their need came from illness in the family and even when they were close to an existing power line this created deep divides between america s cities and country leaving rural areas behind beyond lies darkness wrote one advocate for rural electrification rural residents were subject to grueling labor each day with women bearing a disproportionate burden of the back breaking work without running water gas or electricity processes like laundry and cooking took much longer detracting from women s ability to make life richer and fuller recounts william leuchtenburg in franklin d roosevelt and the new deal through the rural electrification act of 1936 roosevelt launched the rural electrification administration rea as a way to jumpstart rural electrification by providing long term patient capital in the form of low to no interest loans originally they were offered to for profit utilities but the utilities rejected the loans continuing to deem rea projects unprofitable but farmers and rural communities applied in huge numbers to start electric cooperatives public power districts and municipal utilities in order to bring electricity to their areas in 1935 congress appropriated 410 million in loans over the first 10 years of the program more than 7 5 billion in 2019 dollars and within a decade of opening up the program rural areas went from having little to no electricity to more than 90 percent electrification spurring faster growth of rural economies nearly all of the loans were fully repaid and the ultimate cost to the taxpayer was low rea is now considered one of the most successful of the new deal agencies while rea controlled the flow of federal funds to the region and supervised their use communities were given a substantial amount of autonomy to build out electrification in their areas and were largely owned and operated by customer owners as brian cannon describes in his analysis of rural electric co ops in the west power relations western rural electric cooperatives and the new deal although rea programs were planned and administered in washington d c western residents rather than new deal administrators initiated most of the region s rural electrification efforts rea provided important technical and legal capacity to support the localities helping the newly formed cooperatives and publicly owned utilities with contract negotiation management techniques auditing construction of their systems and even with shaping new norms around how to integrate electrification into rural lifestyles today there are more than 900 rural electric cooperatives that started through the program the administration is now housed under the u s department of agriculture and continues to provide loans to rural areas for new investments in their grids the proposal community ownership power administration current investor owned utilities think of shifting to renewable energy in much the same way as the utilities of the 1930s thought of rural electrification as a non economic social good and have actively opposed being mandated to act this clear market failure along with investor owned utilities immense political power has stymied action on many community solar energy efficiency and non exploitative rate projects across the country a green new deal should emancipate communities from these investor owned utilities fixing the market failure by deploying the much needed finance and capacity to kick out their incumbent utilities for publicly run renewable powered ones the reality is that the new renewable grid we are trying to build will be based on more decentralized assets amenable to the scale of local power not the old top down model of investor owned utilities to do so we advocate implementing what we call the community ownership power administration copa a financing and technical capacity program similar to the rea of the first new deal copa would provide a catalytic tool for a new energy system based on local community benefit municipalities counties states and sovereign tribal nations could gain the necessary legal authority along with access to a suite of patient financing and funding mechanisms including low to no interest loans grants and other incentives needed to terminate their contracts with investor owned utilities buy back the energy grid to form a public or cooperative utility and invest in a resilient renewable system the funds could be used by the community utilities to invest in a vibrant local economy working with community members the utilities could build or spur projects in energy efficiency grid resiliency shared solar and electrification and provide affordable energy rates good jobs and access to community based enterprise along the way this approach could increase buy in from organized labor as well unions have historically pushed back on renewable energy developments since utility and fossil fuel companies have typically had union representation while renewable energy companies to date have largely not been unionized the public sector s higher rate of unionization about five times higher than private sector workers could increase unions trust that a publicly owned utility would secure labor agreements with fair wages and good working conditions throughout their operations and contracted work these community based utilities could even take over other public goods such as broadband internet and water to ensure that these necessities are owned and operated by the communities that use them already more than 800 communities in the united states have invested in public or cooperative broadband networks to provide affordable locally controlled access to telecommunications much like the rea copa would also provide technical assistance that helps communities navigate legal and technological challenges throughout the takeover and startup process the program could even help to provide ideas and guidelines for setting up institutions that allow for participatory democracy distributed ownership and delivering on a vibrant economy while still leaving room for local design these utilities could implement multi stakeholder boards where workers community members and elected officials make decisions together they could also include consistent neighborhood meetings on topics ranging from workforce needs to how rates are affecting residents to new renewable energy projects in order to decentralize participation and draw upon local knowledge be it technical expertise or pure lived experience across their service area these meetings would provide avenues for petitioning and enable better mechanisms for transparent accessible information while rea mobilized electrification and broadened community asset ownership many of the rural electric cooperatives of today operate as old boys clubs without clear avenues for community members to engage or even know they have an ownership stake by taking clear steps to democratize community utilities copa iterates upon and builds better institutions that will specifically ensure that low income residents and communities of color have access and agency in this process to date communities that have municipalized utilitites have financed the takeover of investor owned utilities largely through municipal revenue bonds they are generally a major way for states and localities to pay for large expensive capital projects but they are also a major constraint on what cities can do municipal bonds which are traded on the financial market require payback with interest with rates higher for poorer cities as a result of low credit ratings from private rating firms the copa program would help by providing multiple low cost financing pathways to make the transition more affordable and accessible for communities across the united states beyond financing newly formed community utilities copa could also provide financing or funding to already existing publicly or cooperatively owned utilities transitioning to more renewable projects the policies and subsidies that the united states has provided up to now for the energy transition and infrastructure writ large have been too focused on for profit companies instead of communities or local governments essentially giving away public funds to profit the 1 as ocasio cortez p uts it for far too long we gave money to tesla and we got no return on the investment that the public made in new technologies it s the public that financed innovative new technologies a related problem since publicly owned utilities or nonprofits don t pay taxes they currently cannot take advantage of federal investment or production tax credits to finance a renewable energy project as a consequence they end up contracting with a for profit corporation that constructs and owns the renewable energy assets and claims the tax credit this has led to privatization of our renewable energy assets instead of direct investment and ownership by communities and local governments copa would avoid this instead of continuing to consolidate wealth among high paid ceos and shareholders community utilities could reinvest wealth back into the grid and the larger community copa would help by redirecting public investments to public institutions focusing on creating value for communities through a renewable energy future in designing the green new deal we must call for change that not only helps us meet our climate goals but shifts the very structure of the institutions that created the problem to begin with it means putting public goods under public control providing clear pathways for communities like highland park to take energy into their own hands and build utilities that are for and by the people highland parkers have organized to install solar street lights weatherize homes and bulk purchase solar they ve also created a proposal for citywide solar lighting and the blueprint for energy democracy a community wide plan to achieve sustainability with support through the green new deal and copa highland park can build on this

brookfield news feb 06 2019 globe newswire brookfield infrastructure nyse bip tsx bip un today announced its results for the year ended december 31 2018 for the three months ended dec 31 for the year ended dec 31 us millions except per unit amounts unaudited 2018 2017 2018 2017 net income1 71 71 410 125 per unit2 3 0 06 0 09 0 59 0 04 ffo4 326 313 1 231 1 170 per unit5 0 82 0 80 3 11 3 11 brookfield infrastructure reported net income for the year of 410 million 0 59 per unit compared to 125 million a loss of 0 04 per unit in the prior year net income for the year reflects better operating performance across the majority of our operations contributions from recent acquisitions and a gain of 209 million net of tax realized on the sale of our investment in an electricity transmission business these positive impacts were partially offset by higher depreciation a one time charge in our transport segment and the impact of foreign exchange which lowered u s dollar earnings in the current period our business generated ffo of 1 23 billion during 2018 or 3 11 per unit which represents a 5 increase over the prior year while ffo benefited from solid organic growth of 8 compared to 2017 results were impacted by the loss of income associated with asset sales and the time required to redeploy the proceeds in addition a stronger u s dollar reduced results by approximately 100 million compared to the prior year 2018 was an extremely active and successful year we executed on our asset rotation strategy an integral component of our full cycle investment plan and as a result are able to fund our secured transactions without need for equity issuance the business also generated solid results and we deployed over 2 5 billion into organic growth projects and new investments said sam pollock chief executive officer of brookfield infrastructure heading into 2019 the outlook for our business continues to be positive and we should experience meaningful growth in our results as we close three already committed transactions and realize on organic growth in our existing businesses segment performance the utilities segment contributed ffo of 576 million compared to 610 million for the prior year which included approximately 60 million of additional income from the transmission business we sold in 2018 underlying performance remains strong reflecting the benefits of capital commissioned into our rate base and inflation indexation which increased ffo by 5 these benefits were partially offset by the loss of income associated with the sale of our transmission operations in chile and higher borrowing costs relating to a debt financing at our brazilian regulated gas transmission business both of which were completed in the first half of the year results for our utilities segment were also impacted by foreign exchange which reduced earnings for the year by over 60 million our transport segment generated ffo of 518 million for the year which was modestly lower than the prior year results on a constant currency basis actually increased by 5 as our operating groups benefited from inflationary tariff increases and gdp linked volume growth arising from solid economic fundamentals in the majority of the regions in which we operate in particular results reflect strong agricultural volumes at our rail operations and higher levels of moves at our port assets these positive effects were partially offset by lower mineral volumes at our australian rail operations the impact from the handback of one of our state concessions in our brazilian toll road business and the impact of foreign exchange which reduced our results in u s dollar terms by approximately 40 million our energy segment generated ffo of 269 million in 2018 29 ahead of the prior year results in this segment benefited from the initial contribution of two sizable investments made in a canadian midstream business and a leading north american residential energy infrastructure company we also benefited from a 16 increase in gas transport volumes at our u s gas transmission operations due to production growth and contributions from the first phase of its gulf coast expansion project commissioned in the fourth quarter our data infrastructure segment contributed ffo of 77 million for the year which was slightly ahead of the prior year results for the year were 5 higher in local currency due to the benefits of inflation indexation and contribution from capital investments made in prior periods the strong underlying performance was partially offset by the impact of lower average hedge rates compared to prior year the following table presents ffo by segment for the three months ended dec 31 for the year ended dec 31 us millions unaudited 2018 2017

china made it clear this week that it was not taking sides in venezuela and would cooperate with whoever was in charge this comes less than two weeks after venezuelan opposition politician the elected head of the national assembly in what was considered a fair vote juan guaido claimed he was the legal venezuelan leader because recently reelected president maduro had won in what was widely considered by locals and foreign observers a rigged and illegal election most western hemisphere nations and many european ones backed guaido as did most venezuelans the united states and eu nations are assisting guaido in taking control of billions of dollars in cash and other assets belonging to venezuela that are located in the u s and europe on the basis of all this guaido made it clear that he will respect current economic deals and is willing to work with russia and china currently venezuela s largest creditors maduro has the active support of cuba north korea iran and perhaps russia corruption update despite all the talk and action china seems to be losing ground when it comes to reducing corruption this is widely considered the most dangerous problem of all the 2018 international corruption ratings show the world that china is not making much progress dealing with corruption currently china ranks 87th out of 180 nations compared with 77 in 2017 and 79 out of 176 nations in 2016 corruption in the transparency international corruption perception index is measured on a 1 most corrupt to 100 not corrupt scale the most corrupt nations usually north korea 14 yemen 14 syria 13 south sudan 13 and somalia 10 have a rating of under 15 while of the least corrupt new zealand and denmark are over 85 the current chinese score is 39 versus 41 in 2017 compared to 63 61 for taiwan 40 40 for india 29 29 for russia 57 54 for south korea 14 17 for north korea 33 35 for vietnam 85 84 for singapore 72 73 for japan 38 37 for indonesia 38 38 for sri lanka 31 33 for the maldives 36 34 for the philippines 33 32 for pakistan 26 28 for bangladesh 28 30 for iran 16 15 for afghanistan 29 30 for burma 70 71 for the uae united arab emirates 62 64 for israel 72 75 for the united states 27 27 for nigeria 43 43 for south africa 18 18 for iraq 41 40 for turkey 49 49 for saudi arabia and 28 28 for lebanon a lower corruption score is common with nations in economic trouble and problems dealing with islamic terrorism and crime in general china s corruption score has not changed much since 2012 when it was 39 this indicates that despite all the breathless media hype about increased efforts to reduce corruption there is not much real progress president for life xi is accused of directing many corruption investigations at officials deemed a threat to his power christians korea and the denuclearization myth china continues to have a complicated relationship with north korea for example there is a lot of tolerated north korean government activity in northeast china north korea earns the ability to carry on like this by sharing intel gathered with china this includes info from north korea on what is going on in north korea and adjacent areas for example the north korean need for more cash now involves christian churches in northeast china and south korea many north korean defectors join these churches and north korea secret police have often done so as part of their job to collect information on subversives in the last year those orders have changed and the agents who are still active in these churches in northeast china have been ordered to change their focus to seeking business opportunities that will raise cash for the north korean government the agents have been told to seek out church members with business connections in south korea and develop those connections these can be legal or illegal as long as they are profitable collecting information on enemies of the state is now secondary to raising cash the shortage of which has become the greatest enemy north korean rulers currently face what these north korean still do is reported on and what new information they receive is shared with china north korean and local ethnic korean chinese in northeast china have long been vulnerable to north korean interference if the north korean agents can secretly get the chinese police to back off persecuting their church or individual believers the agent gains increased influence in the church this was long suspected but some of the recent senior defectors have apparently confirmed this for chinese and north korean christians this is just another aspect of persecution they have been increasingly subject to over the last decade china has become increasingly hostile to local christians and religions in general in early 2017 china expelled 32 south korean christian missionaries who were working along the north korean border the missionaries have long worked among the many ethnic koreans living in the area most of these ethnic koreans are chinese citizens but a growing number are illegal migrants from north korea china also prosecuted two south korean clergymen for assisting north koreans to escape from north korea and into china south korean christian missionaries who were working along the north korean border the missionaries have long worked among the many ethnic koreans living near the north korean border most of these ethnic koreans are chinese citizens but a growing number are illegal migrants from north korea since 2014 china has also applied more pressure to christian charities and foreign christians in general who are operating in china near the north korean border many of these christians especially ethnic koreans from the west are known or suspected of helping north koreans escape north korea and get to south korea the fact that this chinese north korean intel sharing and cooperation continues indicates that china is not willing to put extreme pressure on north korea to abandon its nukes that is a major reason why north korea can say to the americans and south koreans that denuclearization is possible while continuing to tell north koreans that the nukes will never be abandoned china really would prefer that north korea did not have nukes but is apparently willing to tolerate that if north korea becomes more responsive to chinese advance and needs to help that process along china is trying the carrot with north korea although the stick messing with the north korean economy by halting trade and chinese investment has been used more and more china is willing to unofficially reduce sanctions as long as north korea follows chinese advice about reforming their economy and adopting more of the techniques that have enabled china to remain a communist police state while also benefitting from a free market economy kim jong un is apparently succeeding in convincing china that north korea will accelerate its adoption of chinese economic practices that includes being more open to economic cooperation with south korea since the 1990s south korea and china have become major trading partners south koreans are becoming more willing to help north korea economically even though that will mean less incentive for north korea to denuclearize at the moment it is clear that north korea is not planning to denuclearize internal propaganda repeats that and much critical work on perfecting a nuke that could be used against japan continues china continues to tolerate a certain amount of north korean smuggling and financial misbehavior but north korea must be discreet because china is officially backing if not actually enforcing most of the economic sanctions on north korea since a crackdown on chinese banks a few years ago north korea has moved most of its illegal finance operations out of china north korea has established a network of companies and banks that will act for a fee as middlemen in turning north korean profits from foreign operations into products that can be shipped to north korea without any real proof north korea paid for it of course it is obvious that these imports are not free foreign aid but the source of payment is difficult to trace often more trouble than it is worth but when the effort is made a new north korea financial network is detected china is also helping north korea control its side of the border by making it easier to purchase the latest chinese surveillance camera equipment china is a leader in this market and the chinese government is a huge customer the north koreans are particularly interested in surveillance cameras that are easy to conceal the better to catch defectors or smugglers who believe they will not be detected same applies for border control guards who take bribes north korea does not want to stop smuggling but it does want most of it to be government controlled this is vital to bring in the luxury goods now banned by un sanctions via china these luxury and consumer items are needed for gifts to reward successful officials and also to stock the hard currency shops that carry foreign goods that can be purchased using dollars euros or yuan with more donju entrepreneurs and government officials getting bribe income these shops are busier and in need of more frequent resupply the burma blues in northern burma the chinese ambassador visited kachin state at the end of 2018 and bluntly told local officials that if china were not allowed to resume work on the 3 6 billion myitsone dam project there would be serious consequences for kachin state and burma in general after the visit china reported that the ambassador found most people in northern burma did not oppose the chinese projects the reaction in northern burma was to accuse the ambassador of ignoring reality the dam project was the result of studies done in the late 1990s to develop the border areas and control flooding originally scheduled to be operational by 2017 the myitsone project has been shut down since 2011 because of corruption charges largely true and armed resistance from local tribal rebels china was always willing to make concessions to save the dam project but has been unable to agree with burma on terms meanwhile conditions in china have changed originally china needed the 6 000 mw of electrical power generated by myitsone and 90 percent of it was going to china but in the last few years chinese economic growth has slowed and with that the need for additional electric power actually there are now electricity surpluses in parts of china bordering burma and the chinese have been offering to export some of that electric power to northern burma which still has an electricity shortage because of this many similar chinese development projects in northern burma other dams new mines and lots of road and bridge building to support it all are no longer as important to china burma is willing to let chinese development projects to go forward in the north as long as there is minimal corruption and misbehavior that means compensating the local landowners mainly tribes that have been in the area for centuries fairly china however wanted more than just the electrical power and profits from these investments china also wants some diplomatic assistance apparently regarding north korea south china sea and other sensitive matters china has been willing to negotiate with burma and compromise on its unpopular economic activities mainly in the north china is also offering good deals low prices on modern military equipment and that has the burmese military leadership interested meanwhile the border tribes have to go along with any chinese settlement and the tribes don t want the burmese troops to have more effective weapons the kachin tribes don t trust the chinese or their own government another chinese complaint has more widespread support shan state in northern burma remains the largest source of illegal drugs in the region china wants something done about all the drugs coming out of northern burma specifically opium heroin and methamphetamine the burmese methamphetamine production about 250 tons a year is a major regional problem that is worth 40 billion a year and that is a tremendous incentive for tribal drug gangs and corrupt government officials to help keep it going the meth usually in pill form is called yaba locally and is the most popular drug in southeast asia and southern china most nearly half of yaba goes to china followed by thailand the burmese meth has become hugely popular in china which is pressuring the burmese government to do more about the problem and that has resulted in more police activity up there but not enough to put a dent in the drug business the neighbors are aware that the burmese drug gangs have local security forces on the payroll which is why these clashes with burmese drug smugglers only seem to happen in thailand china plays down the fact that the smugglers don t have much trouble on the chinese side of the border because of the corruption moreover the drug trade in this area goes back a long time the area was a known source of opium for many centuries first as a valuable and expensive medicine pain killer and eventually for wealthy chinese a recreational drug in the 1700s the chinese tried with some success to ban opium exports to china the northern tribes of burma have maintained their armies of well armed well trained and very motivated soldiers for generations because of the drug income soldiers going after the drug armies are offered a choice bribes or bullets the bribes are the more popular choice january 30 2019 a un north korea sanctions monitoring group accuses china of violating the sanctions by tolerating chinese fishermen to buy fishing licenses to operate in lucrative north korea waters the chinese paid about 7 000 a month per boat south korea was also criticized for illegally bringing in several hundred tons of petroleum to operate a new liaison office at kaesong north korea is limited to 520 000 tons of imported petroleum products a year and all of that has been coming from china which normally shipped four times as much a year china is believed to be exceeding the quota by 20 percent or more via its oil pipeline to north korea illegal imports can be estimated by monitoring retail fuel prices in north korea january 29 2019 china has established a maritime rescue center on one of the artificial islands fiery cross reef in the spratly islands current facilities on fiery cross will be expanded to include more rescue capabilities nearby nations who have lost control of territory to the chinses south china sea claims see this rescue center as another chinese effort to legitimize its illegal efforts to take control of the south china sea by controlling the south china sea china controls the shortest sea route from west asia to the middle east africa and europe january 28 2019 the united states imposed oil sanctions on the venezuelan state oil company which is the only means china has to gets over 30 billion in venezuelan loans paid back this move encourages china to back juan guaido as the legitimate acting president of venezuela while guaido has made it clear he is willing to work with china it is only implied that the americans will go along with this january 26 2019 in malaysia the government announced it was canceling a 20 billion railroad project sponsored by the chinese the malaysians determined that the project was too costly and the government could not afford it the previous government that approved the deal was generally believed to be corrupt and willing to take bribes from the chinese to approve such a deal january 20 2019 china officially admitted that recent personnel changes in the military had fundamentally changed the chinese armed forces for the first time in history the chinese army comprises less than half the personnel in the armed forces the majority belong to the navy air force strategic missile forces space force and cyber war forces chinese have long called their armed forces the pla people s liberation army but in the last decade it has more common even for the media to refer to the chinese army navy air force and so on this process has been going on since the 1990s and the major shift took place in the last five years in 2013 there were 2 3 million personnel and about two thirds of that was the army in the last five years there were major cuts in army strength something that has been going on since the 1990s and rapid growth in the navy mainly as well as the other services military strength is now less than two million this has not gone unnoticed in russia although there the state controlled mass media maintains a strict silence about how the chinese military is not only twice the size of russian forces but has far more modern equipment both in terms of quality and quantity china also had a defense budget that is more double what russia can afford this also means that the in the russian chinese relationship china is now the senior partner in both economic and military terms january 18 2019 many nations are reporting major reductions in trade with china this is having a major impact on key world markets the most obvious one is petroleum where the price remains low despite the opec cartel cutting production several times the fracking boom in north america is the major reason for this and that explains why china is rapidly adopting the american fracking techniques to increase oil and natural gas production from the huge shale deposits that china has and which may exceed those in the united states january 14 2019 russia is joining china in undertaking high risk natural resource operations in africa for example russia recently agreed to back financially and otherwise a russian mining firm alrosa that negotiated a deal with the african nation zimbabwe to do a better and more profitable job of extracting diamonds from the large deposits zimbabwe has but has been unable to exploit effectively because the state run mining company was corrupt and inefficient alrosa will have more freedom to operate russia is also a major producer of diamonds and is willing to invest in zimbabwe despite the corrupt and erratic government there alrosa is protected because russia and china continue to protect their business interests in africa for example earlier in 2018 both countries vetoed a un resolution to impose sanctions on zimbabwe where the government has trashed the economy and chased a third of the population away russia and china also blocked un attempts to halt the sudan governments mass murder and depopulation of rebellious people in darfur russia and china both do a lot of business with zimbabwe and sudan but the opposition to un sanctions is more personal russia and china both have long histories of mass atrocities against their own populations and do not want to support any precedent for foreign intervention to halt this sort of thing zimbabwe would also like russian help in modernizing its armed forces but hasn t got any money to pay for it russia is willing to work out a deal that involves providing more security for russian commercial operations in zimbabwe january 12 2019 in uganda the finance minister announced that in his opinion uganda s growing debt is sustainable another government official had warned that major loans by some foreign lenders could lead to the lenders acquiring sovereign ugandan assets that warning spoke to a fear shared by many in uganda that major lender china has forced the ugandan government to use oil reserves as collateral for its large loans there are also worries that if default occurred beijing could gain control of power generation facilities and dams built with chinese money january 11 2019 japan is ordering another 99 f 35 fighters this will cost about 15 billion most of these will be the f 35a model but as many as 40 will be f 35bs the vertical takeoff version that can operate from carriers japan already has 42 f 35as on order to replace 73 elderly f 4e interceptors the new f 35as on order are to replace a hundred older f 15j fighter bombers another hundred more recently built f 15js have been upgraded with digital communications and fire control gear that can cooperate with f 35s japan may order more f 35s as part of its military buildup there may be more japanese f 35 orders because its locally designed f 2 maritime attack aircraft has been canceled because of high cost and uncertain performance japan also sought to design and build a stealthy replacement for the 1990s era f 2s but concluded it would be too expensive for just a hundred aircraft and such an x 2 aircraft could not compete against the american f 35 in export markets assuming japan changed its constitution to allow weapons exports so now japan is planning to eventually replace the f 2 with f 35s japan imports a lot of foreign warplanes but usually assembles them locally under license which it will do with the f 35s ordering some f 35bs makes it clear that japan is going to experiment with some of these aircraft aboard the existing japanese helicopter carriers since 2017 japan has had operational two 27 000 ton destroyers ddh type ships that look exactly like an aircraft carrier these izumo class ships can carry up to 28 helicopters or up to ten vertical takeoff aircraft the carriers are armed only with two 20mm phalanx anti missile cannon and launcher with sixteen essm missiles for anti missile defense the ddh have powerful engines capable of destroyer like speeds of over fifty four kilometers an hour there are also more medical facilities than one would expect for a ship of this size izumo does have considerable cargo capacity which is intended for moving disaster relief supplies quickly to where they are needed apparently some of these cargo spaces can be converted to berthing spaces for troops disaster relief personnel or people rescued from disasters as well as additional weapons and equipment needed to support f 35b fighter bombers izumo could carry and operate at least ten of the vertical take off f 35b stealth fighters once modifications were made to the flight deck handle the extremely high temperatures the f 35b generates when taking off or landing vertically like a helicopter meanwhile china admits that its aircraft carrier force will be confined to the west pacific for a decade or more as china learns how to use a carrier task force most effectively january 9 2019 in algerian the army also showed off six of its new chinese sm4 self propelled 120mm mortars algeria has long been a major customer for russian weapons and the algerian navy recently put two new russian kilo class submarines into service these had been ordered in 2014 when algeria began a major effort to upgrade its armed forces equipment while algeria has had some problems with the new russian weapons the chinese stuff has performed much better and the chinese tech and logistics support are superior as well algeria has the highest defense spending in africa about 10 billion a year which is a bit more than twice what second place sudan spends algeria accounts for about half the foreign weapons purchases throughout africa and gets most of its new gear from russia algeria keeps the russians honest and attentive by also purchasing more weapons from china which has a reputation for building russian weapons better than the russians a 2007 plan to spend 7 5 billion program to upgrade a lot of cold war era weapons and equipment included getting 300 new russian t 90 tanks and 1 200 german wheeled armored personnel carriers russia and germany are also providing new warships for the navy and dozens of russian su 30 warplanes russia offers low prices and a tolerant attitude towards corruption and bribes plus the russian stuff looks impressive and is not likely to be used in any serious fighting because algeria is surrounded by nations that have been generally non threatening for a long time the government has been quietly canceling or delaying military procurement deals because of the sustained low oil prices this includes nearly a billion dollars worth of russian arms and a 1 1 billion deal with an american firm to provide three gulfstream business jets equipped to perform radar optical and electronic surveillance this militarized gulfstream purchase was made in 2015 just as the low oil prices became a long term not a short term problem january 7 2019 north korean leader kim jong un arrived in china aboard his private train for a fourth visit this one lasted four days and apparently consisted of chinese officials reminding kim of how important it is for the kim dynasties survival that kim jong un pays attention to chinese economic advice kim was taken to several chinese workplaces to see the chinese economy in action and have it explained to him how it would work in north korea kim has been more cooperative with china than with south korea or the united states and for good reason china is the only reliable and effective ally north korea has in the past north korea has ignored and embarrassed china but no more north korea has been at odds with china ever since kim jong un took power in 2012 in 2014 kim was told that china would not come to the aid of the current north korean government if the government collapses or starts a war since 2014 china has been cracking down on north korean use of china for illegal imports and exports nothing seemed to work for china when it came to north korea or south korea for that matter this was humiliating for the chinese leaders and while the chinese government does not discuss this many chinese do talk about this disrespect and the chinese leaders pay attention to that but what could china do about an increasingly troublesome and disrespectful north korean leadership north korea s traditional allies china and russia have found that unlike before 2012 they now had little sway over the north korean government the russians could ignore all this but china could not to make matters worse china found itself being publicly insulted by north korea something that was unknown before kim jong un came to power in response china began publicly criticizing things that were wrong in north korea mismanagement nuclear weapons criminality in general china sent senior officials to north korea in late 2015 to spell out in some detail the consequences of continued bad behavior that did not fix the problem as usual when it comes to north korea the situation was expected to get very interesting especially since china offered a carrot as well as a stick following the 2015 warning chinese censors were ordered to suppress popular criticism of north korea and to have state controlled media say nice things about kim jong un for a while thus china offers north korea a choice cooperate and be rewarded or keep disrespecting their elder brother and suffer the consequences until 2018 north korea had not cooperated but china was patient and eventually reality caught up with the troublesome and now in big trouble kim jong un the elder brother is being listened to respected and obeyed

safely through the last week s bitter cold as the polar vortex descended upon the midwest across spire s footprint our gas control experts and field employees were working around the clock to make sure everyone we serve have the energy needed to stay safe and warm we delivered thanks to the people who manage our system and our ability to operate in the most severe weather conditions service delivery is directly correlated with the significant investments we ve made in the last five years to modernize infrastructure and technology if time like this when we are keenly aware of our vital role in taking care of our communities to all our spire employees i d like to say thank you for answering the challenge on our year end earnings call in november i took some time to outline spire s journey of transformation and how that set us up for another successful year in fiscal 2018 this transformation also positions us for further success in 2019 and beyond today i m happy to report that we re off to a strong starting in this year as we continue to put our energy in motion guided by our mission and our consistent set of strategic priorities for delivering long term growth we remain laser focused on organic growth for our gas utilities and our gas related businesses by our marketing spire stl pipeline and spire storage and we continue to make significant investments in organic growth infrastructure modernization and innovation and technology all of which combine to drive our overall performance coming off a strong year and fiscal 2018 when we wrap that regulatory resets in every area we serve we continued the momentum and delivered improved financial and operating performance in first quarter 2019 i m pleased to tell you that we posted first quarter net economic earnings of 1 30 per share up 9 from a year ago reflecting growth at our gas utilities and continued solid performance by spire marketing in fact our gas utilities posted a 7 increase in earnings per share in the first quarter thanks to regulatory outcomes and growth in our core business which i ll describe in a moment we remain focused on raising the bar on the operations side too and i m proud of how our dedicated employees are continuing to deliver improved performance across our five gas utilities at the same time we are progressing with the development of our gas related businesses construction is under way on our spire stl pipeline and at spire storage indeed we recently received approval from the ferc to consolidate the operating certificate for our storage facility more on this in a moment we also continue to successfully implement technology solutions and innovation to achieve the targeted growth of our gas utility it starts with organic growth initiatives to increase customers and margin and lower operating costs these initiatives include enhancements to our new business processes and the technologies we use to track and successfully pursue opportunities we re also seeing further success for our increased focus on economic development in fact we are extensively engaged and reimagining the economic development landscape in missouri while we ve always had an active voice in early conversations on projects for the past year we ve been working with top business and government leaders to restructure and coordinate economic development efforts across the st louis region in fact last week the leading business organizations publicly announced the st louis regional economic development alliance the alliance creates a world class private sector initiative to attract and retain businesses jobs and top talents for the st louis region i have personally been involved in this effort for quite some time and i have the honor of serving as the first board chair for the alliance i m proud to say that with this new coordinated approach to economic development we now have an incredible opportunity to retain expand and attract large regional projects to the region now turning to the current business development our investment in new business continues to ramp up this quarter we invested 27 million up 19 over last year s record pace we achieved growth of 9 in new meters again an increase on top of last year s record level which also was supported by an increase of conversion activity in addition we are increasing our overall utility investment focused on infrastructure modernization in the first quarter utility capex was up 40 primarily driven by infrastructure upgrades and increased new business capital this was accomplished in spite of the challenging construction conditions this winter the regulatory mechanisms we have which included incentives to accelerate pipeline upgrades in both missouri and alabama and the real time rate making in alabama our key to timely recovery that helps drive our ability to holistically modernize our infrastructure system and return earnings to our shareholders in missouri we just filed for an additional 19 million in annual revenues under the infrastructure system replacement surcharge or isrs we expect new rates to go into effect in may in alabama you may recall that the commission established a rider to incent the accelerated replacement of remaining cast iron and bare steel distribution line the accelerated infrastructure modernization rider our aim provides an opportunity to earn an additional 10 basis points of equity return if target levels of replacement are met i m pleased to share that our infrastructure upgrade spend is on track for us to earn the increased roe next year and finally we support growth through the day and day out rigor of managing our costs to efficiently deliver safe and reliable natural gas while delivering exceptional service for our 1 7 million homes and businesses on the operations side of gas or gas utilities we continue to see improving performance driven by the investments we ve made in infrastructure technology and our people at spire everything begins with safety and we re seeing lower employee injury rate and better safety overall continuing the momentum from last year our strategic priority and invest in modernizing our pipeline system is leading to enhance system integrity with overall reductions in leaks and better leak response times this investment is driving lower maintenance cost across our system and finally our service levels and performance in the field continue to build on last year s success our customer satisfaction scores for our field technicians are higher and appointment attainment rates continue to go up building on the record levels we achieved last year in addition to the important work we do in the field to operate a safe and reliable system we re also investing in technology to help us better connect and serve our customers about 15 months ago we launched a technology enabled platform called my account that provides customers with more options for easily connecting and contacting us and manage their account on the go i m pleased to report that more than 680 000 spire homes and businesses have signed up for my account and as a result we re seeing increasing enrollment and programs such as paperless billing budget billing and auto pay plus our new automated start service and transfer service options are quickly becoming favorites among our customers by offering people more options and greater convenience we are seeing higher satisfaction overall let me now turn to spire stl pipeline following receipt of approval from ferc to proceed with our project we have secured land rights and have begun construction on the 65 mile route our contractor michels is highly regarded in terms of the quality and safety and based on our current construction schedule we expect the pipeline to be in service by september 30 our estimated total spend on the project remains 210 million to 225 million we have also been working to further advance spire marketing and spire storage at spire marketing we have devoted significant effort over the last year to build an even stronger team positioning us for long term growth and success the team has expanded its long standing business model of managing the complicated logistics and moving gas for customers including utilities power generators and producers by creating a larger geographic footprint growing its customer base and increasing its volumes as a reminder our marketing growth strategy is focused on contracting directly with producers and end users we re doing this while serving our growing customer base and leveraging our expertise to optimize our portfolio of supply transportation and storage assets based on market conditions including weather regional basis and price volatility spire marketing continues to be a valuable resource in our portfolio of business and once again posted strong performance reflecting its expansion and continuing favorable market conditions first quarter net economic earnings doubled over the last year to 0 16 per share turning to spire storage the ferc approved our application to strategically combine the operation of our two gas storage facilities into one certificate this positions us to offer new valuable services and enhance reliability to a broader and more diverse mix of customers from utilities and power generators to producers as we continue to integrate these facilities we re now finalizing our development plan to reflect the combined operations and take advantage of the expanded market opportunities we re focused on unlocking long term value by investing in infrastructure and resources thereby increasing injection and withdrawal capabilities expanding working gas capacity and building on our service offerings as a result we expect spire storage to contribute to earnings in fiscal 2020 rest assured that we ve assembled a very talented team to support this strategy an important part of how we deliver to value to our investors is there are dividend very proud of our track record 74 years of uninterrupted dividend payments including increases for 16 years in a row this includes a 5 3 increase effective in january of this year to an annualized rate of 2 37 per share i m pleased to report that our board has declared a quarterly dividend of 0 5925 per share payable april 2nd with that let me turn the call over to steve rasche to cover the financial performance and outlook steve steven p rasche executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks suzanne and good morning everyone let s review our results starting here on slide 12 we delivered strong growth this quarter with consolidated net economic earnings of nearly 66 million up 14 from last year with growth in both our businesses gas utility posted earnings of 66 4 million up 6 9 million or nearly 12 from last year gas marketing earnings of 8 3 million were 4 7 million higher or over double last year s results these were offset in part by 3 6 million and higher corporate expenses and spire storage losses included in net economic earnings for the first time this year net economic earnings were 1 30 per fully diluted share or over 9 higher than last year reflecting the higher share count from our equity offering last spring now i normally don t comment on gaap earnings but we ve included here in this slide since our comparables like those of many other companies are impacted by tax reform adjustments last year for us a non cash benefit of nearly 60 million or 1 24 per share which frankly makes the gaap earnings comparison and the significant drop in headline earnings misleading at best as a reminder we excluded these non cash benefits from our net economic earnings last year and we believe that the comparison of nee and the resulting year over year growth to be a fair review into our performance with that let s take a look at the key drivers starting on the next slide total operating revenues of 602 million or 7 higher than last year on the combination of higher weather related demand and higher commodity cost contribution margin was up as well consistent with colder weather this quarter our gas utility margins grew 2 million but that measure includes a 14 million customer rate reduction related to tax reform that is offset by lower income tax expense further down the income statement excluding that rate reduction margins were up 16 million or over 6 driven by first colder weather temperatures in our service territory were about 20 colder than last year and roughly 10 colder than normal this colder weather helped us to grow our off system sales and capacity release in missouri which benefits both our customers and utility secondly rate design changes in missouri including weather normalization which on balance push more of our margin into this quarter compared to a year ago and finally continued modest customer growth turning to gas marketing margins increased by 8 7 million as our geographic expansion and continued favorable market conditions allowed us to create value by optimizing our supply transportation and storage portfolio looking at operating expenses utility fuel cost and volume based taxes were higher as we would expect from higher revenues and commodity cost operation and maintenance expenses were up by 3 5 million but that increase was driven by higher benefit and energy efficiency cost that were defined by our missouri rate cases last year outside of those increases our run rate or controllable expenses were actually lower than last year not surprisingly depreciation and amortization was higher consistent with our higher capital investments gas marketing and other has two moving parts gas marketing and storage first gas marketing expenses increased due to higher commodity costs and volumes offset in part by a higher mix of trading business remember the transactions are recorded net as trading margins if we don t physically procure and deliver the same molecules which is not uncommon if we can trade at origin or destination to lower our delivered gas costs while meeting our customers needs secondly this expense line also includes spire storage expenses totaling 4 million this quarter and finishing up the slide interest expense was higher by 1 5 million largely due to higher short term interest rates and debt levels turning to slide 15 capital spend for the first quarter was 207 million reflecting our continued focus on infrastructure upgrades and new business investment in our utilities as well as higher spend in our other gas related businesses we are tracking against our 2019 full year capex target of 650 million with a note that we anticipate updating this target once we finalize our spire storage development plan as suzanne mentioned a few minutes ago our five year capital spending plan through 2022 remains 2 6 billion focused on utility infrastructure investments that are well diversified across our footprint and supported by long term upgrade programs of up to 20 years more importantly 85 of that spend is recovered with minimal regulatory lag or driving higher margins we also continue to grow our cash flow and maintain a strong financial position first quarter ebitda was up 3 from last year to 152 million short term liquidity was also very solid as we at the peak of our seasonal working capital needs our long term equity capitalization also strengthen year over year and we now stand at just above 51 equity capitalization up nearly 190 basis points from last year and we continue to execute on planned financings at spire missouri we funded 100 million term loan in december and at spire alabama we completed a 90 million private placement of senior notes in january on the equity side of our capital structure today we announced the establishment of 150 million at the market or atm program that will help us meet our incremental equity needs over the next couple of years and atm is a great tool and fits our situation well the need for an incremental equity capital over time to ensure that we maintain a balanced capital structure and strong credit metrics as we continue to grow and invest i should note here that we do not expect to activate the atm program this quarter and we ll update you as our plans change our sales agents on the program will be rbc and bank of america merrill lynch turning to our earnings outlook we reaffirm our long term net economic earnings per share growth target range of 4 to 7 as well as our 2019 guidance range of 3 70 to 3 80 per share earnings growth is supported by greater regulatory certainty and our strong rate base growth and our organic growth across our utilities it also reflects the updates that we ve shared today strong first quarter performance in our gas utility and marketing businesses the progress we ve made with spire stl pipeline and our targeted in service date as well as the continued investment in our storage business so in summary we re off to a great start and we continue to invest for long term success across our businesses with that let me turn it back over to you to suzanne for some closing comments suzanne sitherwood president and chief executive officer thank you steve in closing i d like to thank all of our spire employees for their hard work and personal commitment to serving our customers and community especially during the winter heating season when our customer count on us to safely and reliably keep their homes and businesses warm we re off to a fine start this fiscal year

the progress and achievements as we continue to move forward in that spirit i hope you re able to join us for spire s first ever investor day on april 4 in new york that s where we will have the chance to meet with you face to face and engage in a deeper conversation conversations around organic growth infrastructure modernization spire s marketing business model and growth plans the progress on constructing spire stl pipeline and how we re developing an integrated platform for spire storage now we are ready to take your questions questions and answers operator we will now begin the question and answer session operator instructions and our first question comes from michael weinstein with credit suisse please go ahead michael weinstein credit suisse analyst hi guys suzanne sitherwood president and chief executive officer hey good morning michael michael weinstein credit suisse analyst good morning could you talk a little bit about the atm and i guess more about the reasons why it was filed and what you re seeing over the next couple of years in terms of higher capex spend that might justify or it might require it and i guess mainly what i m asking for is a kind of a preview of what you might be talking about in april for and how you re going to change the plan steven p rasche executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah a good question michael i think we ve been talking for a while that atm programs are great tools to have in your tool box in fact i know i ve spoken in the past about the fact that i ve had these in prior lives in other companies and it s a great way to keep fine tune the capital structure and make sure that we support our strong credit metrics and i don t think it should be a surprise to anybody on the call that we want to make sure to be prepared as we continue invest somewhere in the next two years 1 1 million to 1 2 million in investments in our businesses that we can t reasonably finance only through debt capital and cash flow so from that standpoint i view an atm as a tool that makes sense for us it s a three year program 150 million fairly low in terms of size compared to our capitalization i think it s a reasonable program for us to put in place we as when we did our equity offering and may of last year we did that in anticipation of the spire stl pipeline and clearly met our equity needs for the next year that s what we ve talked about it on the call which is why we are not activating the program right now but i think you can expect as we get later on into the year end and into fiscal 20 that we ll activate the program at the right time and do it at a measured way so that we maintain those strong credit metrics over time because our expectation is we re going to continue would invest in our business and we have to keep an eye on the capital structure while we re keeping an eye on that accelerator to continue to grow michael weinstein credit suisse analyst got it and on the storage business i think you said that you expected a contribution from that next year and i think on the last call we talked about a small contribution in 2018 with kind of serve as the indication that maybe it would be earning money in 2019 so maybe you could just talk more about the timing of how that investments coming along suzanne sitherwood president and chief executive officer yeah michael so you are right that is how we spoke about it we at that time we had not secured the second facility and so now we are in the process of refining those development plans to integrate the two facilities and we ve gotten approval from the ferc as i mentioned to do just that which helps us in terms of our service offerings and the types of services they can offer us on a long term basis the combination of integrating these two facilities there obviously in the same territory geographically and provides us much more flexibility and again the ability to enhance our service offerings so it s a little bit i go slow now to go fast because we re in a much better position with that storage facility spire storage combined and we ll see in greater details to at the analyst day so hopefully you can join us to run working on those plans and we ll spend some time running through what exactly that looks like for you michael weinstein credit suisse analyst okay thank you thanks a lot and now i ll give it up to other people at this point suzanne sitherwood president and chief executive officer yeah thanks michael operator and our next question comes from shar pourreza with guggenheim partners please go ahead with your question shar pourreza guggenheim securities analyst hey good morning guys suzanne sitherwood president and chief executive officer hey shar steven p rasche executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning shar pourreza guggenheim securities analyst just two quick ones for you so on first on the stl approvals so given the fact that it s kind of behind us and construction is already commenced is there any sort of demand there to modestly upsize the pipe through other laterals of compression and the way we re thinking about it is there any incremental growth opportunities that you can get from this project suzanne sitherwood president and chief executive officer i ll give you a high flyby and mike here so he may want to expand on a little bit more of that as you said the pipeline itself is under construction and the anchor customer obviously is our spire east utility and which we ve talked a lot about what flexibility that brings us in the region and it is the shipper on that pipeline but that being said there is some small amount of capacity remaining and we can add compression to it over time and we ve talked about that but as i mentioned earlier we are laser focused right now in getting that pipeline up and operating and we re very satisfied with where we are in terms of scheduling cost and mike you may want to add a little more color and that s another item we ll give you greater details on an analyst day michael c geiselhart senior vice president strategic planning and corporate development yeah i mean we ll continue to focus on longer term opportunities to add that shippers to that system part of it really depends on interconnected pipelines and where we end up with our chain of rocks interconnect with mrt for example as to whether that our pipeline could potentially be part of a longer path that other shippers might buy so we ll continue to work on that very much in the long term as of right now we expect to go in service with really just the one contract with the affiliate shar pourreza guggenheim securities analyst and then that s helpful and then if you take the upsizing the route the filing process i would have to assume is going to be much more rapid than what we ve seen in the past with the current pipe michael c geiselhart senior vice president strategic planning and corporate development yeah we certainly have the ability to add compression to the project there is no compression on it in its current form and that would require another filing to add compression in the future but we have a fairly long lead time in terms of what customers would be driving that expansion so we wouldn t anticipate any delay between getting that approval versus when the revenue would start to flow from any additional customers and larger capacity shar pourreza guggenheim securities analyst excellent and then just lastly it s good to see that there s obviously some pretty good growth in the marketing business is there sort of a mix you re targeting as you think about the consolidated business mix like the marketing business is becoming more and more material i guess in the end how large do you want the segment to be is there sort of a target that you re aiming for suzanne sitherwood president and chief executive officer i wouldn t say per se that we have a target but we also what we re mostly focused on is geography and the quality of our customer like i mentioned earlier with utilities which obviously we have five utility companies power generation and producers which is much like our utility operations we serve the same type of customer mix so from a earnings mix we obviously will only grow that so much based on those geography and the type of customers that we re serving and we re predominantly utility today over 90 of our earnings is utility today so we re very comfortable with where we are and we are very comfortable with the quality of team that we ve placed in our houston office and the technology and so forth that we have to support that business steven p rasche executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah and remember also shar that we ll when the pipeline comes online that adds to our regulated side of our mix and we continue to expect every business to grow and the utility continues to show strong growth so our goal is to grow every part of the pie but we are always cognizant of how the pieces play out shar pourreza guggenheim securities analyst that s perfect suzanne sitherwood president and chief executive officer and yeah i was just going to add and mike will give more color on this at the analyst day it is the logistics business and it s logistics for to serve those customers which again is what we do everyday in the utility business shar pourreza guggenheim securities analyst got it got it so just to summarize the growth in the marketing business would commensurate with the regulated growth that you re seeing suzanne sitherwood president and chief executive officer that s right shar pourreza guggenheim securities analyst excellent thanks guys suzanne sitherwood president and chief executive officer thank you i appreciate it steven p rasche executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks operator and our next question comes from dennis coleman with bank of america merrill lynch please go ahead with your question jason ph analyst hi it s jason standing in for dennis good morning suzanne sitherwood president and chief executive officer hey jason steven p rasche executive vice president and chief financial officer how are you doing jason jason ph analyst doing well thanks regarding the gas marketing again i guess when you look at it from the other view earnings are roughly ph up could you give maybe a little bit more granularity about what drove it you indicated geographic coverage and favorable market conditions can you maybe talk about how each contributed suzanne sitherwood president and chief executive officer yeah i think maybe what might be helpful mike could you mike provide a little color more color there michael c geiselhart senior vice president strategic planning and corporate development yeah over the last couple of years we ve been pretty methodical about putting in place a plan to kind of expand the current business model if you will into a broader geography and so a part of part of that vision and moving the business to houston was to add folks to the team that could bring existing relationships with high quality customers that would essentially fit into our existing business model and so really the way i would describe the growth it s been pretty gradual and and pretty steady and incremental and it s essentially adding new customers and new regions particularly in the gulf coast and the southeast that kind of have expanded our geographic footprint so we re just doing more of the same kind of business with the same kinds of customers and volumes are up in a lot of cases across the board as well with existing customers and so you combine that with a relatively supportive market conditions in location basis and that sort of explains the large part of the growth today jason ph analyst okay thanks for speaking to that a little bit my next question is sort of around stl and and flows coming off of rex you mentioned that stl is going to receive gas most likely from marcellus and utica we ve heard from some industry guys that and gals that they ve indicated there might be cheaper gas out of the west is there any discussion around east first versus west first michael c geiselhart senior vice president strategic planning and corporate development yeah that s an interesting point and it certainly has evolved somewhat over time i think when we originally created the project there was a clear expectation that we would use primarily rex zone 3 gas which is marcellus utica gas for the most part you know that we still believe that gas will be extremely cheap long term but you know part of the reason we really liked the project is upon completion our interconnect point which will be a new interconnect point on rex will be essentially the no point in terms of physical flows between west between westbound gas and eastbound gas and so we expect to have in the neighborhood of 4 bcf of total physical flows kind of meeting on the pipeline in that area and so at least for the foreseeable future we expect that to remain the no point on rex and so we would have optionality conceptually any way we d we would have optionality between both eastbound flows and westbound flows which is a pretty interesting place to be jason ph analyst definitely all right thanks for the thanks for those insights i ll i ll jump off suzanne sitherwood president and chief executive officer yeah thanks operator operator instructions and our next question comes from selman akyol with stifel please go ahead with your question selman akyol stifel nicolaus company analyst thank you good morning suzanne sitherwood president and chief executive officer hi good morning selman akyol stifel nicolaus company analyst can you talk a little bit about your 9 meter growth and i think i thought i heard you say that was supported by conversion activity as well so could you talk about that steve lindsey executive vice president chief operating officer of distribution operations sure good morning this is steve lindsey i ll speak a little bit on behalf of utilities and so the 9 is a year over year comparison for first quarter and if you think back last year when we referenced a record year for us we had over 11 000 new meters across all of our jurisdictions and that was primarily in the residential and commercial markets as you can imagine we have had some increased activity on conversions when we say conversions those could be propane customers on our existing system and in some areas in the in the south southwestern part of missouri we re actually looking to expand into some poultry applications where our infrastructure just isn t there now and so those would be poultry and chicken houses and those type applications that will be converting from propane to natural gas i think it s really to build up of what we ve been putting in place over the last three years we ve become very focused we ve been really focusing our relationships with builders and developers and being there when they re making decisions as well as architects and engineers so i don t think it s any one big thing i think it s a lot of pieces that are starting to come together and as we also mentioned on our new business capital which is infrastructure that we re putting for really you know meters that are to come over the next three years we re up significantly over last year which was a big year for us as well so our focus on organic growth i think is really starting to pay off in the utilities as we continue to grow our base business selman akyol stifel nicolaus company analyst okay if i can just ask a little or dig a little deeper on that so if i asked you i guess i don t know five seven years ago about organic growth i think you probably would have said maybe 1 maybe 1 5 2 so do you think that organic growth number would be higher now i mean if we move to a plateau or higher level say 3 what do you think about it suzanne sitherwood president and chief executive officer yeah so let me start and then pass it to steve i want i m harkening back i m thinking back reflecting back based on your question five to six years ago we started talking about organic growth on these calls and our investment in people and technology like salesforce com like the way we serve our customers like the way that we think about conversions and started implementing programs that we re seeing the fruits of that work today and we so we took the long view again on organic growth and the types of customers coupled with economic development which i talked about earlier and we re continuing to invest in organic growth for for our future and think about it and it s a whole lot more of commercial acumen and again that started five years ago we brought in an executive and outside the industry to run that area for us and he reports to steve and steve you may want to add a little bit more color than that steve lindsey executive vice president chief operating officer of distribution operations yeah i think when you re talking about overall net growth and so what we were referencing earlier on new meters and new business capital is on the new side obviously you ve got to keep all the customers that you have so from a retention standpoint that s an issue that you know really as recently as as two or three years ago in some of our jurisdictions we were seeing negative overall growth if you think about it on on an annual basis and so the fact that we re positive in all of our jurisdictions and continue to trend up i think is is a result of a lot of things some of the data and analytics that we re putting together we now know on a daily basis by zip code our customer either increases or decreases so that we can put together very focused programs to address that whether it s around rebates energy efficiency programs and so again i think we ve been building for the last three years a lot of data a lot of tools and now we re really starting to use those tools and data to make decisions and effectuate outcomes steven p rasche executive vice president and chief financial officer and selman i would add that we view organic growth including the commercial and industrial sector which especially when you get down to the southern parts of our service territory is a much bigger part of the overall pie so it s hard to look at net customer or residence or business growth and really equate that to an impact in our earnings because one business can be thousands of residential customers now i d also add then we think about organic growth we think about it holistically and it is about managing cost and making sure that we re managing to get to the right margin and dropping the right earnings through the through the cost line and i think we ve shown that we consistently have been able to keep our cost in line and you saw that again this quarter and it s all part of that puzzle to make sure that we re doing the right thing growing but also doing the right thing for our customer and they re they re seeing the benefits in their bill in term of growth steve lindsey executive vice president chief operating officer of distribution operations yeah and and i think the last piece that suzanne mentioned in her remarks is we really have put a strong emphasis on economic development and this is in all of our jurisdictions and we we ve been seeing some strong things go on in the state of missouri as we focus on economic development across the state so i think more more good is to come on that as well selman akyol stifel nicolaus company analyst very good thanks i appreciate all that if you know just going over to storage you referenced sort of 39 bcf now and you re looking to expand can you say what size you re looking to take storage to michael c geiselhart senior vice president strategic planning and corporate development yeah this is mike you know we haven t what i can tell you is that you know that numbers comprised the two pieces right the 35 is the certificated capacity at ryckman and the 4 is the second facility at clear creek right now we re we re involved in very extensive kind of reservoir engineering work and geology work to really understand the potential size of the storage facility at clear creek we have only owned it since may and and i ve really kind of dug in to try and understand it it s part of the same formation as the ryckman facility so we think it has comparable size but until we finished that analysis we re really not in a position to say how much larger that clear creek facility can can be made beyond its current 4 bcf certificated capacity now when we look over on the ryckman side at this point we don t anticipate a large change in that capacity sitting here today but again that s still subject to the same kind of ongoing analysis so part of the development plan will be to refine that number and to come up with a number that is in fact going to be the certificated capacity of the two facilities on a combined basis and that will be filed with ferc at the appropriate point of time selman akyol stifel nicolaus company analyst okay and then you guys commented that storage ran loss at this quarter do you anticipate storage run losses every quarter this year or do you expect that to moderate as we approach 2020 steven p rasche executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah it s fair question selman we expect as we start ramping up the development plan that we should start moving closer and closer to earnings contribution we ll get into more detail we still have to finish the development plan and i think the important point to take away is we re looking we always try to make the right decision for the medium and long term and we see a great opportunity for even more value in the medium and long term and we think it s the right thing to do to make sure we re driving for the sort of right balance of investment and return which is why to the question earlier we re willing to accept no earnings contribution and some subsidy this year because we think in the medium to long term that s the best place to be for our customers and also for our investors selman akyol stifel nicolaus company analyst all right thank you very much suzanne sitherwood president and chief executive officer thank you operator operator instructions and our next question comes from richard sunderland with jpmorgan please go ahead with your question richard sunderland jp morgan analyst hi good morning just wanted to follow up on some of the marketing commentary earlier it seems like the performance and the strength year over year might be putting you a little bit ahead of plan could you frame sort of the performance in q1 and maybe even revisit the expectations from last year the 0 17 non recurring outperformance there steven p rasche executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah rich this is steve clearly there are two components if you think about the marketing business at the 5 000 foot level there are two components to think about one is the building the base business additional relationships additional contracts more storage transport that we can optimize that s the fundamental way in which we grow the business over the long term and mike geiselhart spoke to that in a few minutes ago the second part is the icing on the cake and what s going on with the market and are the market opportunity is creating unusual or opportunities that marketing businesses deal with everyday to optimize those investments is specifically in the assets and clearly through the first three months this year we ve seen some strong market conditions let s face it price volatility we saw in the early part of our year right as we were getting into the fall in the early winter with a four handle plus on gas and volatility and the early cold didn t give us some opportunities in the marketing business and that s what marketing businesses do they take advantage of opportunities that may be enter a day much less over a longer period of time but as we know markets change relatively quickly henry hub traded at 2 54 ph last night so the price volatility that we saw early in the season now that we re through the polar vortex and we really didn t see price spikes except for a single day we have to look at this business over the long term and i m we re not willing at this point to speak to what it looks like for the full year because as we look at the rest of the year especially going into the last part of the winter and into spring the market fundamentals are easing off a little bit for all the reasons that we talked about and it really starts with weather what we will do and we do this every year is we ll take a look at our performance after we get through the winter heating season and then make an assessment on how do we think about that in totality and how do we think about that going forward so that you all can understand the baseline for the business but i think mike s comments earlier stand we expect every business to grow and we re investing in a great team and relationships and everything else associated with that to grow that business in the right way doing what we do now which is physically procure and deliver gas and over time we expect that business to grow that s the fundamental part that you all should come to expect every year richard sunderland jp morgan analyst great thanks steve and just a few mechanical ones here the storage investment balance as of the quarter i m curious as to where that stands and then also if there are agency thresholds that you guys monitor for sort of the non regulated business versus total business mix steven p rasche executive vice president and chief financial officer the second the second piece gets back to the question that was asked earlier about mix of business and we obviously take a look at all of our businesses we expect them to grow it d be financed in a conservative fashion and ultimately we will and continue to be a largely regulated business but you have to look underneath the businesses because that s a surfacing comment right now as we stand today roughly 40 of the customers that we serve in marketing are utilities and power generation so under deals that can extend over a period of time which is a clearly different customer base than what you see with a pure marketer who might be selling into other places or to other marketers and the same as we develop the storage business our goal is to make that facility attractive to utilities power generators lng providers the kind of folks who need long term reliable storage services and in that vein the complexion of that business and how we think about that business changes so that s how we think about the mix of business we re clearly aware of where the guidelines are we know our peers really well and we understand how to think about that and actively exercise that internally to make sure that we are comfortable with where we are where we are driving but again we expect every one of our businesses to grow that s one of the tenants of our underlying business in terms of overall investment we re not quite at the 100 million mark this quarter if you look at the capital spend that we had this year or this quarter of 207 million about two thirds of that investment was in the utility and the other third was between the pipeline and the storage business and i think it was probably nearly 40 million in the storage business maybe it s 45 million in fact it is 45 million and the rest was in the pipeline as we now we ll see that ramp up fairly significantly going through the rest of the year so that s kind of where we stand right now and as suzanne mentioned on the in the prepared remarks we ll we ll update that not only the development plan for storage but how that impacts our go forward view on investment and capital and base gas and other things you need in order to adequately operate the storage facility once we have finalized that plan richard sunderland jp morgan analyst great thank you for the update operator and our next question comes from andrew levi with exoduspoint please go ahead with your question andrew levi exoduspoint analyst hi good morning guys suzanne sitherwood president and chief executive officer hi andy good morning steven p rasche executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning andy andrew levi exoduspoint analyst great pictures in the hand out of you two suzanne sitherwood president and chief executive officer thanks we ll get perfect communication and a little credit on that one steven p rasche executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah there s not scott okay but you both have multiple speakers andrew levi exoduspoint analyst just two very simple questions just on the atm just for modeling purposes how much should we kind of put into our earnings model a year like should it be 50 million 75 million any type of guidance you can give us on that steven p rasche executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah andy i can t give you any more guidance at this point it s a three year program i did mention that we expected to meet our needs for the next couple of years and we clearly have an activated the program at this point and we ll update you all in the next call where where we stand on that i think you ll have to figure out a reasonable way to a trip that over time as you because i know you will you will put yourself in our shoes and look at our capital structure and our credit metrics to make sure that we keep everything in balance andrew levi exoduspoint analyst and should we be more focused on the ffo to debt or your equity ratio steven p rasche executive vice president and chief financial officer actually we look at all of those and a few others our ffo to debt we re in the swim lane that would support our current credit ratings but it s something over time that we have a commitment to continue to improve andrew levi exoduspoint analyst and then the equity ratio at 51 at the end of the quarter is that kind of where you want to be as well steven p rasche executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah we ve worked really hard to get to about more equity than leverage on our long term capital structure we would like to keep that powder dry because we think that s the right place to be for us and that our investors actually appreciate that what you will see and continue to see andy is a continuing shift of the leverage and where it sets we continue to draw down the leverage at the holding company which is shareholder debt as we continue to borrow at the right times and we talked about a couple of those in the prepared remarks at the operating company the utilities where we get regulatory recovery i think you ll continue to see that and that s another component of that of the overall mix and that s at holdco data s a percentage in total debt we ve been very successful and continue to driving that down and it s one of our commitments to ourselves to our board and to our investors andrew levi exoduspoint analyst got it and then just separately just on the weather just in missouri and alabama kind of interested as kind of overall growth ph companies within your area how could you can you categorize the weather in the fourth quarter than maybe what i mean not the fourth quarter your first quarter and then kind of what you re seeing in the second quarter to just kind of hot cold hot cold so kind of where we stand weather wise whether it s in your southern service territory or your american service territory and then i have one more follow up to that steve lindsey executive vice president chief operating officer of distribution operations i ll take a shot this is steve i m not a weather expert but relative to just norms worried about this steve i think you mentioned this about 12 colder on average for the quarter than last year and about 10 from normal but as we all know there s variability so you might have as you described some very very cold periods followed by some warm so you have some cyclical periods and the one thing i will say too is as we talked about our capital we were able to have an essence of 40 increase in the utility capital spend first quarter year over year and that was in spite of some of the more challenging weather conditions so i think it clearly helps from a margin perspective as you ve seen and we went through those examples as well as we ve been able to manage it from a construction perspective in the south i think it s been again it s been up and down quite a bit we ve had some very warm periods followed by some very cold so i think when you get into averaging it might be pretty close to average there but we ve had some rain some snow and then some warm period so it was a little bit of a mix and for the quarter that we re in right now obviously this week we saw extreme conditions and the one thing i will say is that our systems across the board held up very well and i think a lot of that goes to a lot of the reinforcement and infrastructure upgrades that we put in place over the last five years so i think if you put all these things together we ve operated very well we continue to grow our system and from a margin perspective i think we re doing about as well as we could expect at this point in the year suzanne sitherwood president and chief executive officer and the flow through of that here as you think about it the way that we read meters and the way we cycle those meters through the month and then the way that data cycles through the rate design in those areas is how it flows to the bottom line it all arrives eventually but the timing from a quarter by quarter perspective is driven obviously by the way those meters some are read at first of the month on cycles some at the middle some at the end everyday we re reading meters and then that s where technology on a longer term basis and again we ll speak more about that at the analyst day our deploying meter reading technology and how we think about designing those rates even in these last rate resets that was very much topical so again it s the math shows up the calendarization of the meter reads and also there s rate design have impact but again over time it all flows to the bottom line it s more of a timing perspective and i think you have one more question i didn t want to cut you off andrew levi exoduspoint analyst yeah that s fine and then just guidance wise just to understand kind of where you started kind of where you are today and just focusing on the gas storage and on the marketing so are you kind of where you expect it to be when you gave guidance in both of those areas or a little better or little worse maybe you can tell us on that suzanne sitherwood president and chief executive officer yeah so i look at it this way so our gas companies we have five gas companies and how they collectively come in and then our gas related businesses marketing storage and pipeline and from a gas related businesses perspective we re actually where we expect it to come in in fact feeling a little better same thing with the gas company the utilities there s five of them and they re doing well on all performance metrics and i know we ve had a lot of conversations so far about gas related businesses as well as the utilities and when i think of them collectively and when we think of them collectively we are physically moving gas for customer be it residential customers or in a utility or small businesses large industrial or power generators and our gas related businesses as well as our utilities are every day physically moving gas for those customers the difference obviously with the utility side regulated by the state other regulation ferc or other criteria for gas related businesses that fundamentally which is what i ve been doing for 38 years we re physically moving gas for these customers to use it to keep their homes warm heat hot water improve their business processes or generate power and so we pull those together and we manage it collectively andrew levi exoduspoint analyst okay thank you steven p rasche executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks andy steve lindsey executive vice president chief operating officer of distribution operations thanks andy operator and this concludes our question and

with joanie greve with joanie greve the big idea during his state of the union on jan 30 1974 seven months before he resigned richard nixon appealed to congress to stop probing him and his reelection campaign i believe the time has come to bring that investigation and the other investigations of this matter to an end he said one year of watergate is enough forty five years later speaking on tuesday night from the same spot president trump warned house democrats in ominous terms against using their new subpoena power to investigate him an economic miracle is taking place in the united states and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars politics or ridiculous partisan investigations trump said with speaker nancy pelosi over his left shoulder if there is going to be peace and legislation there cannot be war and investigation we must choose between greatness or gridlock results or resistance vision or vengeance incredible progress or pointless destruction advertisement what the president presented of course is a false choice the economy boomed in the late 1990s during a period of peace and prosperity as house republicans investigated and impeached bill clinton trump didn t seem too worried about the impact of his birther crusade on the nation s health when barack obama was president when they had gavels during the obama years house republicans believed they had a constitutional imperative to conduct vigorous oversight of the executive branch many headlines this morning just as in the previous two years emphasize trump s plea for both parties to come together but the president s call for an end to the political stalemate last night sounded hollow to democrats just eight weeks after he declared that he would be proud to shut down the government to get a border wall this brinkmanship led to the longest partial government shutdown in american history and continues to create uncertainty as a new funding deadline looms on feb 15 president richard nixon

new material because the fans always want to hear the classics he opened with paeans to unity and harked back to inspiring examples of american greatness but he got elected promising disruption the meat of the speech was devoted to the issues that animated his upset victory in the gop primaries and then over hillary clinton and he kept going back to the set that worked protectionism nativism and isolationism his calls for rebuilding infrastructure and lowering prescription drug prices were also staples of his stump speech as a candidate trump is ever mindful of delivering for his base he mentioned early on that he s delivered for the blue collar workers who supported him referring to nafta as a catastrophe he name checked the 2020 battlegrounds of michigan ohio and pennsylvania that

border peaked most recently at 1 6 million in 2000 and have been in decline since falling to just under 400 000 in fiscal 2018 the decline is partly because of technology upgrades tougher penalties in the wake of the 9 11 terrorist attacks a decline in migration rates from mexico and a sharp increase in the number of border patrol officers trump exaggerates the link between immigration and crime almost all research shows legal and illegal immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than the native born population the consensus among economic research studies is that the impact of immigration

from afghanistan imagine how apoplectic certain conservatives would have been if obama had spoken to congress about opening a dialogue with the taliban he also announced that he will have a second summit with north korean leader kim jong un in vietnam on feb 27 and 28 if i had not been elected president of the united states we would right now in my opinion be in a major war with north korea trump said dubiously much work remains to be done but my relationship with kim jong un is a good one trump also sought to juice his standing with social conservatives by talking in stark terms about abortion he no longer has a looming supreme court vacancy to keep evangelicals in line instead he called for new national restrictions on women s reproductive rights during the third trimester members

speech for a group of supporters on monday night one of his allies asked whether he would discuss the deficit acting white house chief of staff mick mulvaney interjected nobody cares mulvaney said per abc news instead trump called for major new spending to eradicate hiv and develop new cancer treatments for children those are laudable goals for sure but he never talked about how he s going to pay for them instead he boasted about cutting taxes which has reduced revenue and forced the treasury to essentially borrow more money from places like china all of it will need to be paid back with

perhaps we can negotiate a different agreement adding china and others or perhaps we can t in which case we will outspend and out innovate all others by far trump said not giving a price tag unlike

sunday virginia gov ralph northam d addressed the controversy surrounding a photo that appears on his page in his 1984 medical school yearbook video reuters the latest from richmond virginia gov ralph northam who built his political career on his honesty and authenticity was shocked by the immediate calls from democratic allies for his resignation after a racist photo was discovered on his medical school yearbook page gregory s schneider and laura vozzella have a behind the scenes look at the chaos engulfing richmond most of his staff was gone for the night as and his wife pam worked the phones in the executive mansion they called friends back in norfolk old classmates from his medical school looking for answers about the racist photo that had emerged from his 1984 yearbook when advisers showed up the next morning to what they thought would be the task of helping northam resign the near sleepless governor had a surprise this isn t me he told them saturday according to one adviser that set what was already a crisis into uncharted waters as northam staged a national news conference and defied calls to step down from virtually the entire political establishment but his assumption that allies would give him the benefit of the doubt contributed to northam s poor handling of the crisis over the photo according to people close to the governor and his shock at being so quickly discarded by the party has made it harder for northam to accept the calls to resign the people said over the past several days he has even toyed with the idea of leaving the democratic party and governing as an independent a sign of the degree that he is isolated from every political ally from his state party and from the national party northam has started signaling to his few remaining allies that he thinks he can remain in office according to the new york times s alan blinder jonathan martin and trip gabriel the governor whose power has been on the verge of collapse since the photograph surfaced on friday intends to hire a private investigator to examine the circumstances of the picture according to a democrat familiar with his plans and mr northam s supporters have begun to express increased confidence that he will hold on to his job despite a national onslaught of condemnation in part because the republicans who control the general assembly have demonstrated little urgency toward seeking his ouster democratic leaders are struggling with how to respond to a sexual assault allegation against lt gov justin fairfax who would become governor if northam resigns from jenna portnoy laura vozzella and antonio olivo although democrats at the state and national level have been quick to say women should be believed and that all allegations should be investigated they say they are resisting a rush to judgment unlike claims of assault against supreme court justice brett m kavanaugh former senator al franken d minn former congressman john conyers jr d mich and others virginia democrats privately note the accuser in the fairfax case has not yet offered evidence she says corroborates her claim the dilemma shows the trouble they have enforcing a policy of zero tolerance if both northam and fairfax resign attorney general mark herring d would become governor larry j sabato and kyle kondik of u va s center for politics note in the immediate aftermath of the northam bombshell and fairfax s seemingly likely ascension to the governorship we thought back to herring s decision to defer to northam in advance of the 2017 election with fairfax potentially becoming governor herring who previously announced his intention to seek the governorship in 2021 could have been effectively blocked yet as of now herring is only one of the three elected democratic statewide officeholders without a cloud over his head sabato and kondik add that northam s continued presence in the governor s mansion could have a detrimental effect on democrats efforts to retake control of virginia s house of delegates or senate next year republicans are hanging on to very slim majorities in the state house of delegates 51 49 and state senate 21 19 democrats seemed like favorites to win both chambers particularly because a new state house of delegates map imposed by judicial order will improve democratic odds in that chamber but one could imagine the opposite happening particularly if northam hangs around and depresses democrats or the fairfax allegations continue to churn the new world order the senate passed its middle east policy bill that includes a rebuke of trump s plans

more than 64 million from philip bump on tuesday released a report looking only at trump s first four trips to mar a lago as president on feb 3 6 feb 10 12 feb 17 20 and march 3 5 2017 the total just under 14 million for an average cost of 3 4 million per trip that includes about 8 5 million spent by the defense department and 5 million by the department of homeland security it also includes about 60 000 paid directly to mar a lago itself 24 000 of which was for lodging for defense department personnel and 36 000 for operational space used by dhs if we therefore assume a blanket average of 3 4

mike gleason it is my privilege now to welcome axel merk president and chief investment officer of merk investment and author of the book sustainable wealth axel is a well known market commentator and money manager and is a highly sought after guest at financial conferences and on news outlets throughout the world and it s always great to have him back on with us axel it s always a pleasure and thanks for joining us again axel merk my pleasure mike gleason well axel we want to get your thoughts here as the market seemed to be in a bit of flux a few months ago pretty much everyone was looking at three or four rate hikes and for quantitative tightening the reduction of the central banks bond holdings to continue but then the higher rates and prospects of further tightening finally caught up to the equity markets we had three months of sustained selling in stocks late last year and suddenly fed officials are singing a very different tune today they are signaling a much more dovish policy however we ve seen a big rally in stocks it isn t clear what to expect since the equity market seems to be a major factor when it comes to fomc policy tell us what you re expecting here and before we get too much into fed policy moving forward which i ll ask you about in a moment tell us is the selling we saw in the fourth quarter all behind us or is this a bit of a sucker s rally in stocks axel merk sure well i think you re timing is right talking about the expectations we had the end of the third quarter last year about a lot of tightening and to talk market terms there were very substantial positions on short treasuries short bonds betting on higher rates and as investors then looked out towards this year 2019 they repositioned or you can say there was a short squeeze and you had a significant rally in treasuries suddenly this took on a life of its own and the media is never afraid of putting a story into market a move and say oh my god the world is falling apart and sure enough the scare made it all the way to the fed and our mr powell who was walking in his dark room and said alright alright the market once had it a certain way and now it doesn t and then the moment that switched the market then started on rallying a few things here the u s consumer is doing just fine maybe they re going to fall off a cliff we don t see that yet inflation impressions are increasing no matter what everybody is telling you wages are going up not just for the c o level but all the way down the corporate ladder yes there are issues in the rest of the world and yes we are late in the economic cycle and so what all of that means is that higher rates to me automatically translates to more volatility so the high volatility is just natural obviously it may have been exasperated you can blame the algos whatever you want but yes higher volatility is with us historically we don t have a bear market most of the time anyway unless there is a recession and i just said i don t think the recession is imminent now that doesn t mean there isn t a risk of one that doesn t mean volatility isn t high it doesn t mean investments aren t going to diversify but certainly long in the tooth on this expansion and so everybody may well be prudent to kind of trim things back on their risk exposure and that s exactly what s been happening but for the time being i do think this economic cycle is not over yet we are late in it i also happen to think i mentioned inflationary prices the fed is not done tightening we ve gone overboard on that and i think we will likely see two more rate hikes later this year so this back and forth is likely going to continue and it s going to be a bit of a rollercoaster because also i mentioned higher wages that obviously hits corporate earnings corporate america is exposed internationally so yes they ll have some headwinds but in the meantime the consumer seems to be spending happily maybe not on housing but on many other things mike gleason as we re talking here on wednesday afternoon fed chair powell just came out with his statement tell us what you took from that sounds like you re still expecting that we are going to see a couple more rate hikes this year talk about fed policy a bit more axel merk well yeah that was my view and of course my view doesn t matter it matters what mr powell thinks because he is the one who calls the shots right it s not me i just have my thoughts here obviously powell has backpedaled quite substantially and they re two things there is the rate path and then there s this wonderful thing called quantitative tightening you refer to and maybe let s talk about that first remember when yellen talked about paint drying on a wall when they started on this journey basically they decided the fed balance sheet is too large they want to get down but that s about all they decided they didn t make up their mind of where that journey is going to take them in my view they thought that they had until the end of this year or so before they can actually decide how low they want to take the balance sheet so sure enough the market threw a tantrum and powell said okay i get it we got to do something and at the fomc meeting he kind of said we still don t have a clue he didn t use those words but yeah we might consider doing something and that really shows that the fed doesn t have a plan with quantitative tightening they re in so called uncharted territory and there s no academic framework no past of framework other than listening to the markets and that s really dangerous because it s the fed that s supposed to set what the risk free asset is the regulatory risk free asset treasuries and so when the fed just says hey let the market dictate that it creates an interesting unstable back and forth i m not suggesting that wouldn t be better if he market did everything but with the fed in there with a bazooka that kind of creates odd dynamics on the other side of it with regard to raise remember we are still only just about maybe in neutral yet unemployment has been going down and wage prices have been going up at some point that s not going to work anymore and i think that ll have to take the foot further off the accelerator i happen to think that s still on there even though we ve had hiccups in the emerging markets where it matters accessibility to loans financial conditions are just fine in the u s and the whole point of hiking is to tighten financial conditions that hasn t happened unless you re in emerging markets unless you re in some bad areas or from a junk area a little bit but for mainstream america financial conditions have not tightened and that s why i think they will change their view later this year possibly as early as this summer and if you just take what the fed said that s part of what markets rallied that s why metals rallied is because rate hikes are off the table for now and god speed for you people are thinking maybe the economy is going to ease up some point mike gleason yeah happy days are here again i guess at least in the short term one of the reasons it s great to have you on is that we know you re always keeping a close eye on international markets as well there s a lot going on in both europe and china the chinese economy appears to be slowing and any serious recession there will have big impacts for all of us and the political turmoil in europe may also drive markets what do you see as the biggest developing story internationally that will impact investors her in the u s axel axel merk the biggest story may not always be what the biggest impact is you rightfully mentioned china first china is just so much bigger so what happens in china matters china clearly has had a slowdown they have all kinds of incentives along the way to try to boost that they re trying not to actually lower rates so they re actually lowering most of the reserve requirements and have tax cuts they don t like to lower rates because they don t like to mess with the exchange rates too much they like to keep that reasonably stable whatever that means these days with the yuan and so there is some slowing down if they quote unquote panic it means they ll open the floodgates of stimulus but for the time being they re reasonably confident that the stimulus will work its way through the quote unquote bigger story may well be brexit even powell referred to it keep in mind the good old great empire is about less than 3 of world gdp these days so yes brexit matters but it doesn t matter as much as some other things out there similarly italy that was the sideshow mostly a show and sure there are going to be elections in the european union and sure the populists are going to get more votes but none of that really changes the global dynamics obviously what does happen on global scale are the trade discussions the general perception is there are solutions they re not going to happen there tomorrow and if you listen to draghi the head of the european central bank he says oh we downgraded our outlook but it s not that we think that we going to be negative outcomes to these many risk scenarios that s what draghi said he actually thinks there s going to be positive outcomes to most of them but because of the uncertainty the sentiment has been impacted so that s dragging on things and obviously the sentiment is impacted and that s the same danger with the u s consumer of course is that that might actually then induce slower growth all these risks that are out there they re solvable brexit most people believe we re not going to haunt brexit to kick the can down the road heard that term before that s what strong leaders are best at it seems the world will be around tomorrow in the meantime american consumers are happily spending mike gleason let s get your thoughts on what all of this might mean for precious metals can you give us a quick summary of what you re expecting in the metals market as we move through the year axel merk yes sure on gold which is kind of the easiest because of the least industrial influence that s difficult enough to prognosticate about you ve got these two forces on the one end i see rising inflationary pressures that s a positive i see at some point rates are going to go down as a discounting mechanism the market seems to be giving a boost here to precious metals now with that said i do think rates will move higher later this year the main buyer in gold that i see these days is one that buys for diversification when you have higher volatility cash flow gets discounted more that means the risk assets stock market in particular is under pressure potentially but gold historically does well when the stock market doesn t do well there are exceptions like the early 80 s bear market and that s when real interest rates went up to through the roof but it is for diversification because gold is really one of the easiest diversifiers i say easier rather than best necessarily because it has the zero correlation to stocks and it s far easier to do than some long short strategy that gives you an uncorrelated return otherwise if you go to other metals and other commodities of course the dynamics are far more complex that s why i really try to stick to gold especially on a brief analysis mike gleason my guest last week talked about how gold is hitting all time highs in many different currencies talk about the currency side of things the dollar what you re expecting there because obviously gold is trading in reverse correlation to the dollar in many situations not always but in many situations give us your thoughts there axel merk well on the day we re talking the dollar index is plunging other currencies are rising versus the dollar because of this very dovish commentary and statement by the fed and the question really is and the world was divided on that and that s great because we make the market where s it going to be heading from here we ve had years of dollar going up the u s was the cleanest of the dirty shirts and what not and it increasingly appears that the market is looking forward to the next easing cycle whereas the other parts of the world and i include the eurozone here they re still thinking we re on the hiking cycle we have sweden who also negative rates for example other than the eurozone they hiked rates draghi is retiring at the end of this year out of the ecb i happen to think that as both yellen and bernanke were more hawkish towards the end of their terms so will draghi be and draghi is actually quite positive in a medium term the successor to draghi cannot be as dovish in my view as draghi is and then i happen to think the glass is half full on some of these inflation metrics on that note by the way we have low oil prices at the end of last year if oil prices are not depressed any of this year the year over year effects will show quite significant headline inflation in the eurozone by the way headline inflation is the mandate in the u s it s core inflation but if you look at longer term inflation expectations they happen to be very correlated to the price of oil it may not make much sense because obviously in the long run the price of oil of today doesn t really matter but as those changes are filtering through i think inflation expectations will rise wage prices will lead to higher wages inflation expectations so all of that will get other leaders around also to be a tad more hawkish and it appears to be that is in favor of world currencies versus the dollar that just had such a great ride for several years and so it appears to me that this long bull run in the dollar might be over mike gleason well as we begin to wrap up her axel give us any final thoughts that you may have for us today or maybe touch on anything else that you may be focusing on that perhaps we didn t get to already and then ultimately what kind of year do you envision 2019 is going to be for investors expand on any or all of that as we begin to close please axel merk well the short of it is higher volatility higher rates warrant higher volatility and at the risk if using a technical term that means higher dispersion of risk let me expand on that just briefly when you have quantitative easing the perceived risk was taken out of the market so you invested in junk barns and it was quote unquote not risky because the fed took care of it now fear is back and the good news of that is that it matters where you put your money that means active management will come back that means the making a choice is actually going to prove you re right or wrong whereas before you just bought the index and everything was great that doesn t mean that suddenly all the money will go back to active managers i think that s going to be a long process but i would not be surprised of this year active managers are going to significantly outperform the industry simply because of greater opportunities there with the greater volatility reference the sharks but i just look at interest rates because when interest rates are higher there will be more opportunities i think for the active manager mike gleason well we ll leave it there thanks as always axel we certainly appreciate your getting your very studied insights and greatly appreciate your time coming on with us once again now before we let you go like we always do please tell folks a little bit more about you and your firm and then also how they can follow you more closely axel merk sure come to merkinvestments com we

up to date commentaries feel free to follow me on twitter or linkedin or whatever your favorite social media site is we re there to help and we can even devise some specialized strategies to take a

shareholder approval but if and when so we ll be talking a lot more about the specific mining companies down the road as well mike gleason yeah i think many folks here would be interested in that well excellent axel thanks so much for your time we look forward to checking back with you before we re long and dissecting the state of the markets again with you soon until then take care and enjoy your

china made it clear this week that it was not taking sides in venezuela and would cooperate with whoever was in charge this comes less than two weeks after venezuelan opposition politician the elected head of the national assembly in what was considered a fair vote juan guaido claimed he was the legal venezuelan leader because recently reelected president maduro had won in what was widely considered by locals and foreign observers a rigged and illegal election most western hemisphere nations and many european ones backed guaido as did most venezuelans the united states and eu nations are assisting guaido in taking control of billions of dollars in cash and other assets belonging to venezuela that are located in the u s and europe on the basis of all this guaido made it clear that he will respect current economic deals and is willing to work with russia and china currently venezuela s largest creditors maduro has the active support of cuba north korea iran and perhaps russia corruption update despite all the talk and action china seems to be losing ground when it comes to reducing corruption this is widely considered the most dangerous problem of all the 2018 international corruption ratings show the world that china is not making much progress dealing with corruption currently china ranks 87th out of 180 nations compared with 77 in 2017 and 79 out of 176 nations in 2016 corruption in the transparency international corruption perception index is measured on a 1 most corrupt to 100 not corrupt scale the most corrupt nations usually north korea 14 yemen 14 syria 13 south sudan 13 and somalia 10 have a rating of under 15 while of the least corrupt new zealand and denmark are over 85 the current chinese score is 39 versus 41 in 2017 compared to 63 61 for taiwan 40 40 for india 29 29 for russia 57 54 for south korea 14 17 for north korea 33 35 for vietnam 85 84 for singapore 72 73 for japan 38 37 for indonesia 38 38 for sri lanka 31 33 for the maldives 36 34 for the philippines 33 32 for pakistan 26 28 for bangladesh 28 30 for iran 16 15 for afghanistan 29 30 for burma 70 71 for the uae united arab emirates 62 64 for israel 72 75 for the united states 27 27 for nigeria 43 43 for south africa 18 18 for iraq 41 40 for turkey 49 49 for saudi arabia and 28 28 for lebanon a lower corruption score is common with nations in economic trouble and problems dealing with islamic terrorism and crime in general china s corruption score has not changed much since 2012 when it was 39 this indicates that despite all the breathless media hype about increased efforts to reduce corruption there is not much real progress president for life xi is accused of directing many corruption investigations at officials deemed a threat to his power christians korea and the denuclearization myth china continues to have a complicated relationship with north korea for example there is a lot of tolerated north korean government activity in northeast china north korea earns the ability to carry on like this by sharing intel gathered with china this includes info from north korea on what is going on in north korea and adjacent areas for example the north korean need for more cash now involves christian churches in northeast china and south korea many north korean defectors join these churches and north korea secret police have often done so as part of their job to collect information on subversives in the last year those orders have changed and the agents who are still active in these churches in northeast china have been ordered to change their focus to seeking business opportunities that will raise cash for the north korean government the agents have been told to seek out church members with business connections in south korea and develop those connections these can be legal or illegal as long as they are profitable collecting information on enemies of the state is now secondary to raising cash the shortage of which has become the greatest enemy north korean rulers currently face what these north korean still do is reported on and what new information they receive is shared with china north korean and local ethnic korean chinese in northeast china have long been vulnerable to north korean interference if the north korean agents can secretly get the chinese police to back off persecuting their church or individual believers the agent gains increased influence in the church this was long suspected but some of the recent senior defectors have apparently confirmed this for chinese and north korean christians this is just another aspect of persecution they have been increasingly subject to over the last decade china has become increasingly hostile to local christians and religions in general in early 2017 china expelled 32 south korean christian missionaries who were working along the north korean border the missionaries have long worked among the many ethnic koreans living in the area most of these ethnic koreans are chinese citizens but a growing number are illegal migrants from north korea china also prosecuted two south korean clergymen for assisting north koreans to escape from north korea and into china south korean christian missionaries who were working along the north korean border the missionaries have long worked among the many ethnic koreans living near the north korean border most of these ethnic koreans are chinese citizens but a growing number are illegal migrants from north korea since 2014 china has also applied more pressure to christian charities and foreign christians in general who are operating in china near the north korean border many of these christians especially ethnic koreans from the west are known or suspected of helping north koreans escape north korea and get to south korea the fact that this chinese north korean intel sharing and cooperation continues indicates that china is not willing to put extreme pressure on north korea to abandon its nukes that is a major reason why north korea can say to the americans and south koreans that denuclearization is possible while continuing to tell north koreans that the nukes will never be abandoned china really would prefer that north korea did not have nukes but is apparently willing to tolerate that if north korea becomes more responsive to chinese advance and needs to help that process along china is trying the carrot with north korea although the stick messing with the north korean economy by halting trade and chinese investment has been used more and more china is willing to unofficially reduce sanctions as long as north korea follows chinese advice about reforming their economy and adopting more of the techniques that have enabled china to remain a communist police state while also benefitting from a free market economy kim jong un is apparently succeeding in convincing china that north korea will accelerate its adoption of chinese economic practices that includes being more open to economic cooperation with south korea since the 1990s south korea and china have become major trading partners south koreans are becoming more willing to help north korea economically even though that will mean less incentive for north korea to denuclearize at the moment it is clear that north korea is not planning to denuclearize internal propaganda repeats that and much critical work on perfecting a nuke that could be used against japan continues china continues to tolerate a certain amount of north korean smuggling and financial misbehavior but north korea must be discreet because china is officially backing if not actually enforcing most of the economic sanctions on north korea since a crackdown on chinese banks a few years ago north korea has moved most of its illegal finance operations out of china north korea has established a network of companies and banks that will act for a fee as middlemen in turning north korean profits from foreign operations into products that can be shipped to north korea without any real proof north korea paid for it of course it is obvious that these imports are not free foreign aid but the source of payment is difficult to trace often more trouble than it is worth but when the effort is made a new north korea financial network is detected china is also helping north korea control its side of the border by making it easier to purchase the latest chinese surveillance camera equipment china is a leader in this market and the chinese government is a huge customer the north koreans are particularly interested in surveillance cameras that are easy to conceal the better to catch defectors or smugglers who believe they will not be detected same applies for border control guards who take bribes north korea does not want to stop smuggling but it does want most of it to be government controlled this is vital to bring in the luxury goods now banned by un sanctions via china these luxury and consumer items are needed for gifts to reward successful officials and also to stock the hard currency shops that carry foreign goods that can be purchased using dollars euros or yuan with more donju entrepreneurs and government officials getting bribe income these shops are busier and in need of more frequent resupply the burma blues in northern burma the chinese ambassador visited kachin state at the end of 2018 and bluntly told local officials that if china were not allowed to resume work on the 3 6 billion myitsone dam project there would be serious consequences for kachin state and burma in general after the visit china reported that the ambassador found most people in northern burma did not oppose the chinese projects the reaction in northern burma was to accuse the ambassador of ignoring reality the dam project was the result of studies done in the late 1990s to develop the border areas and control flooding originally scheduled to be operational by 2017 the myitsone project has been shut down since 2011 because of corruption charges largely true and armed resistance from local tribal rebels china was always willing to make concessions to save the dam project but has been unable to agree with burma on terms meanwhile conditions in china have changed originally china needed the 6 000 mw of electrical power generated by myitsone and 90 percent of it was going to china but in the last few years chinese economic growth has slowed and with that the need for additional electric power actually there are now electricity surpluses in parts of china bordering burma and the chinese have been offering to export some of that electric power to northern burma which still has an electricity shortage because of this many similar chinese development projects in northern burma other dams new mines and lots of road and bridge building to support it all are no longer as important to china burma is willing to let chinese development projects to go forward in the north as long as there is minimal corruption and misbehavior that means compensating the local landowners mainly tribes that have been in the area for centuries fairly china however wanted more than just the electrical power and profits from these investments china also wants some diplomatic assistance apparently regarding north korea south china sea and other sensitive matters china has been willing to negotiate with burma and compromise on its unpopular economic activities mainly in the north china is also offering good deals low prices on modern military equipment and that has the burmese military leadership interested meanwhile the border tribes have to go along with any chinese settlement and the tribes don t want the burmese troops to have more effective weapons the kachin tribes don t trust the chinese or their own government another chinese complaint has more widespread support shan state in northern burma remains the largest source of illegal drugs in the region china wants something done about all the drugs coming out of northern burma specifically opium heroin and methamphetamine the burmese methamphetamine production about 250 tons a year is a major regional problem that is worth 40 billion a year and that is a tremendous incentive for tribal drug gangs and corrupt government officials to help keep it going the meth usually in pill form is called yaba locally and is the most popular drug in southeast asia and southern china most nearly half of yaba goes to china followed by thailand the burmese meth has become hugely popular in china which is pressuring the burmese government to do more about the problem and that has resulted in more police activity up there but not enough to put a dent in the drug business the neighbors are aware that the burmese drug gangs have local security forces on the payroll which is why these clashes with burmese drug smugglers only seem to happen in thailand china plays down the fact that the smugglers don t have much trouble on the chinese side of the border because of the corruption moreover the drug trade in this area goes back a long time the area was a known source of opium for many centuries first as a valuable and expensive medicine pain killer and eventually for wealthy chinese a recreational drug in the 1700s the chinese tried with some success to ban opium exports to china the northern tribes of burma have maintained their armies of well armed well trained and very motivated soldiers for generations because of the drug income soldiers going after the drug armies are offered a choice bribes or bullets the bribes are the more popular choice january 30 2019 a un north korea sanctions monitoring group accuses china of violating the sanctions by tolerating chinese fishermen to buy fishing licenses to operate in lucrative north korea waters the chinese paid about 7 000 a month per boat south korea was also criticized for illegally bringing in several hundred tons of petroleum to operate a new liaison office at kaesong north korea is limited to 520 000 tons of imported petroleum products a year and all of that has been coming from china which normally shipped four times as much a year china is believed to be exceeding the quota by 20 percent or more via its oil pipeline to north korea illegal imports can be estimated by monitoring retail fuel prices in north korea january 29 2019 china has established a maritime rescue center on one of the artificial islands fiery cross reef in the spratly islands current facilities on fiery cross will be expanded to include more rescue capabilities nearby nations who have lost control of territory to the chinses south china sea claims see this rescue center as another chinese effort to legitimize its illegal efforts to take control of the south china sea by controlling the south china sea china controls the shortest sea route from west asia to the middle east africa and europe january 28 2019 the united states imposed oil sanctions on the venezuelan state oil company which is the only means china has to gets over 30 billion in venezuelan loans paid back this move encourages china to back juan guaido as the legitimate acting president of venezuela while guaido has made it clear he is willing to work with china it is only implied that the americans will go along with this january 26 2019 in malaysia the government announced it was canceling a 20 billion railroad project sponsored by the chinese the malaysians determined that the project was too costly and the government could not afford it the previous government that approved the deal was generally believed to be corrupt and willing to take bribes from the chinese to approve such a deal january 20 2019 china officially admitted that recent personnel changes in the military had fundamentally changed the chinese armed forces for the first time in history the chinese army comprises less than half the personnel in the armed forces the majority belong to the navy air force strategic missile forces space force and cyber war forces chinese have long called their armed forces the pla people s liberation army but in the last decade it has more common even for the media to refer to the chinese army navy air force and so on this process has been going on since the 1990s and the major shift took place in the last five years in 2013 there were 2 3 million personnel and about two thirds of that was the army in the last five years there were major cuts in army strength something that has been going on since the 1990s and rapid growth in the navy mainly as well as the other services military strength is now less than two million this has not gone unnoticed in russia although there the state controlled mass media maintains a strict silence about how the chinese military is not only twice the size of russian forces but has far more modern equipment both in terms of quality and quantity china also had a defense budget that is more double what russia can afford this also means that the in the russian chinese relationship china is now the senior partner in both economic and military terms january 18 2019 many nations are reporting major reductions in trade with china this is having a major impact on key world markets the most obvious one is petroleum where the price remains low despite the opec cartel cutting production several times the fracking boom in north america is the major reason for this and that explains why china is rapidly adopting the american fracking techniques to increase oil and natural gas production from the huge shale deposits that china has and which may exceed those in the united states january 14 2019 russia is joining china in undertaking high risk natural resource operations in africa for example russia recently agreed to back financially and otherwise a russian mining firm alrosa that negotiated a deal with the african nation zimbabwe to do a better and more profitable job of extracting diamonds from the large deposits zimbabwe has but has been unable to exploit effectively because the state run mining company was corrupt and inefficient alrosa will have more freedom to operate russia is also a major producer of diamonds and is willing to invest in zimbabwe despite the corrupt and erratic government there alrosa is protected because russia and china continue to protect their business interests in africa for example earlier in 2018 both countries vetoed a un resolution to impose sanctions on zimbabwe where the government has trashed the economy and chased a third of the population away russia and china also blocked un attempts to halt the sudan governments mass murder and depopulation of rebellious people in darfur russia and china both do a lot of business with zimbabwe and sudan but the opposition to un sanctions is more personal russia and china both have long histories of mass atrocities against their own populations and do not want to support any precedent for foreign intervention to halt this sort of thing zimbabwe would also like russian help in modernizing its armed forces but hasn t got any money to pay for it russia is willing to work out a deal that involves providing more security for russian commercial operations in zimbabwe january 12 2019 in uganda the finance minister announced that in his opinion uganda s growing debt is sustainable another government official had warned that major loans by some foreign lenders could lead to the lenders acquiring sovereign ugandan assets that warning spoke to a fear shared by many in uganda that major lender china has forced the ugandan government to use oil reserves as collateral for its large loans there are also worries that if default occurred beijing could gain control of power generation facilities and dams built with chinese money january 11 2019 japan is ordering another 99 f 35 fighters this will cost about 15 billion most of these will be the f 35a model but as many as 40 will be f 35bs the vertical takeoff version that can operate from carriers japan already has 42 f 35as on order to replace 73 elderly f 4e interceptors the new f 35as on order are to replace a hundred older f 15j fighter bombers another hundred more recently built f 15js have been upgraded with digital communications and fire control gear that can cooperate with f 35s japan may order more f 35s as part of its military buildup there may be more japanese f 35 orders because its locally designed f 2 maritime attack aircraft has been canceled because of high cost and uncertain performance japan also sought to design and build a stealthy replacement for the 1990s era f 2s but concluded it would be too expensive for just a hundred aircraft and such an x 2 aircraft could not compete against the american f 35 in export markets assuming japan changed its constitution to allow weapons exports so now japan is planning to eventually replace the f 2 with f 35s japan imports a lot of foreign warplanes but usually assembles them locally under license which it will do with the f 35s ordering some f 35bs makes it clear that japan is going to experiment with some of these aircraft aboard the existing japanese helicopter carriers since 2017 japan has had operational two 27 000 ton destroyers ddh type ships that look exactly like an aircraft carrier these izumo class ships can carry up to 28 helicopters or up to ten vertical takeoff aircraft the carriers are armed only with two 20mm phalanx anti missile cannon and launcher with sixteen essm missiles for anti missile defense the ddh have powerful engines capable of destroyer like speeds of over fifty four kilometers an hour there are also more medical facilities than one would expect for a ship of this size izumo does have considerable cargo capacity which is intended for moving disaster relief supplies quickly to where they are needed apparently some of these cargo spaces can be converted to berthing spaces for troops disaster relief personnel or people rescued from disasters as well as additional weapons and equipment needed to support f 35b fighter bombers izumo could carry and operate at least ten of the vertical take off f 35b stealth fighters once modifications were made to the flight deck handle the extremely high temperatures the f 35b generates when taking off or landing vertically like a helicopter meanwhile china admits that its aircraft carrier force will be confined to the west pacific for a decade or more as china learns how to use a carrier task force most effectively january 9 2019 in algerian the army also showed off six of its new chinese sm4 self propelled 120mm mortars algeria has long been a major customer for russian weapons and the algerian navy recently put two new russian kilo class submarines into service these had been ordered in 2014 when algeria began a major effort to upgrade its armed forces equipment while algeria has had some problems with the new russian weapons the chinese stuff has performed much better and the chinese tech and logistics support are superior as well algeria has the highest defense spending in africa about 10 billion a year which is a bit more than twice what second place sudan spends algeria accounts for about half the foreign weapons purchases throughout africa and gets most of its new gear from russia algeria keeps the russians honest and attentive by also purchasing more weapons from china which has a reputation for building russian weapons better than the russians a 2007 plan to spend 7 5 billion program to upgrade a lot of cold war era weapons and equipment included getting 300 new russian t 90 tanks and 1 200 german wheeled armored personnel carriers russia and germany are also providing new warships for the navy and dozens of russian su 30 warplanes russia offers low prices and a tolerant attitude towards corruption and bribes plus the russian stuff looks impressive and is not likely to be used in any serious fighting because algeria is surrounded by nations that have been generally non threatening for a long time the government has been quietly canceling or delaying military procurement deals because of the sustained low oil prices this includes nearly a billion dollars worth of russian arms and a 1 1 billion deal with an american firm to provide three gulfstream business jets equipped to perform radar optical and electronic surveillance this militarized gulfstream purchase was made in 2015 just as the low oil prices became a long term not a short term problem january 7 2019 north korean leader kim jong un arrived in china aboard his private train for a fourth visit this one lasted four days and apparently consisted of chinese officials reminding kim of how important it is for the kim dynasties survival that kim jong un pays attention to chinese economic advice kim was taken to several chinese workplaces to see the chinese economy in action and have it explained to him how it would work in north korea kim has been more cooperative with china than with south korea or the united states and for good reason china is the only reliable and effective ally north korea has in the past north korea has ignored and embarrassed china but no more north korea has been at odds with china ever since kim jong un took power in 2012 in 2014 kim was told that china would not come to the aid of the current north korean government if the government collapses or starts a war since 2014 china has been cracking down on north korean use of china for illegal imports and exports nothing seemed to work for china when it came to north korea or south korea for that matter this was humiliating for the chinese leaders and while the chinese government does not discuss this many chinese do talk about this disrespect and the chinese leaders pay attention to that but what could china do about an increasingly troublesome and disrespectful north korean leadership north korea s traditional allies china and russia have found that unlike before 2012 they now had little sway over the north korean government the russians could ignore all this but china could not to make matters worse china found itself being publicly insulted by north korea something that was unknown before kim jong un came to power in response china began publicly criticizing things that were wrong in north korea mismanagement nuclear weapons criminality in general china sent senior officials to north korea in late 2015 to spell out in some detail the consequences of continued bad behavior that did not fix the problem as usual when it comes to north korea the situation was expected to get very interesting especially since china offered a carrot as well as a stick following the 2015 warning chinese censors were ordered to suppress popular criticism of north korea and to have state controlled media say nice things about kim jong un for a while thus china offers north korea a choice cooperate and be rewarded or keep disrespecting their elder brother and suffer the consequences until 2018 north korea had not cooperated but china was patient and eventually reality caught up with the troublesome and now in big trouble kim jong un the elder brother is being listened to respected and obeyed
president donald trump delivered his state of the union address tuesday night and heritage foundation experts weighed in with analysis of the president s policy proposals commentary editor of the daily signal daniel davis collected their responses for each issue here is what they had to say a call for robust border security president donald trump s remarks on immigration tonight reflected a commonsense principled approach to the immigration problem that his opponents refuse to acknowledge in their obsession with opposing anything he does trump also made a fundamental point that his opponents refuse to recognize when he said we have a moral duty to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens he pointed out the sharp divide that exists between the public and the washington establishment when he said no issue better illustrates the divide between america s working class and america s political class than illegal immigration wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards referring to the impasse between the president and congress over border security trump was right when he said this was a moral issue and that the lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety security and financial well being of all americans he said it was time for congress to show that america is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes cartels drug dealers and human traffickers out of business trump said he had ordered another 3 750 troops to the border to prepare for even more caravans that are not only headed to the border but are being helped by the mexican government to bring them up to our country in areas where there is little border protection he expressed what the majority of americans believe that we should support legal immigrants who enrich our nation and strengthen our society in countless ways but that tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate it is cruel it leaves working class americans to pay the price for mass illegal immigration reduced jobs lower wages overburdened schools and hospitals increased crime and a depleted social safety net trump pointed out the danger of uncontrolled illegal immigration by listing the grim statistics on crimes committed by illegal aliens in the last two years alone immigration and customs enforcement officers made 266 000 arrests of criminal aliens including those charged or convicted of nearly 100 000 assaults 30 000 sex crimes and 4 000 killings he emphasized the victimization of americans by these criminal illegal aliens by introducing a woman whose parents in nevada were recently murdered by an illegal alien and he pointed out the big drop in illegal crossings in cities like san diego and el paso that put in a strong security wall that has made el paso one of the safest cities in the country trump said he would send a commonsense proposal to end the crisis on the southern border that includes not only humanitarian assistance but more law enforcement drug detection at our ports closing loopholes that enable child smuggling and plans for a new physical barrier or wall to secure the vast areas between our ports of entry these are exactly the kinds of actions that need to be taken to remedy our border problem hans von spakovsky manager election law reform initiative and senior legal fellow institute for constitutional government the president was right to call for serious reforms to the u s immigration system and recognized that legal immigration respects our laws and enriches our society any legal immigration system however must be enforced with appropriate border security interior enforcement and adjudication by immigration courts unfortunately too many on the left do not believe that laws should be enforced or illegal immigration stopped while we can and should expect a vibrant debate over how to best combat illegal immigration too many progressives in the chamber appear to prefer far left positions like abolishing ice defending immigration loopholes and resisting nearly all efforts to stop illegal immigration and caravans coming to our border congress can and should take real steps to combat illegal immigration while rejecting unfair amnesty deals that encourage more illegal immigration david inserra policy analyst homeland security and cybersecurity davis institute for national security and foreign policy economy tax cuts continue to boost jobs and wages thanks to the 2017 tax cuts and other pro growth economic reforms like deregulation the u s economy has continuously outstripped expectations the president touted that companies are coming back to our country in large numbers he is right and the proof is in the numbers the most recent example is january s blockbuster jobs report which showed businesses added over 300 000 new jobs and followed on the heels of workers receiving the largest wage gains in over 10 years what s most impressive is that the lowest income workers in the u s have benefited the most from the strong labor market wage growth for rank and file nonsupervisory workers has outpaced both inflation and wage growth in the rest of the economy black latino young and low skilled workers have also seen some of the largest drops in unemployment in recent years our strong economy is truly benefiting all americans this isn t happenstance the 2017 tax cuts made american workers globally competitive again by lowering punitive business taxes to levels similar to most european countries coupled with sweeping reforms to outdated and unnecessary regulations tax cuts have made the u s an easier place to do business and a more attractive destination for new investments new business investments are what create new and better paying jobs massive tax cuts for working families the president is right to champion the 2017 tax cuts for families which put more money in the pockets of american taxpayers is supporting a healthy economy and lifting the wages of working americans the vast majority of households in every congressional district got a tax cut last year through lower employer tax withholdings average americans got a 1 400 tax cut and families of four saved 2 900 many americans are benefiting twice from the tax cuts first by paying less in taxes and a second time from higher wages generated by a faster growing economy at the end of 2018 workers received some of the largest wage gains in over 10 years and unemployment rates are historically low over the next 10 years because of a larger economy the typical american will benefit from over 26 000 more in take home pay or 44 697 for a family of four adam michel policy analyst thomas a roe institute for economic policy studies individuals with disabilities are benefiting from the strong economy the president highlighted how the strong economy is benefiting the most vulnerable in society including americans with disabilities for whom unemployment has also reached an all time low this is great news now is the time to enact lasting reforms to help ensure that the social security disability insurance program is prepared for those times when the economy is weak by modernizing outdated benefits improving the accuracy of the determination process and putting in place policies to help individuals with disabilities access accommodations before they lose their jobs and to set expectations and processes in place to help them return to work if they can romina boccia director grover m hermann center for the federal budget institute for economic freedom mixed accuracy on us china trade as expected president donald trump reiterated the complaints his administration has regarding china s unfair trade and investment practices however it s misleading to suggest china has stolen american jobs it s often suggested that the trade deficit the u s has with china somehow leads to u s job loss but there is no correlation between a growing trade deficit and u s job loss over the last several months the trade deficit with china has increased while u s employment has increased also as expected we received no new information on the details of a u s china trade deal we likely won t know any of the details until a final deal is made between trump and chinese president xi jinping it s been suggested the two could meet following the next summit between trump and north korean dictator kim jong un on feb 27 and 28 the u s and china have to make a deal before march 2 at which point the tariffs on 200 billion worth of goods that americans buy from china will increase from 10 to 25 percent riley walters policy analyst asia economy and technology davis institute for national security and foreign policy cuts to regulation are bringing back jobs compared to previous speeches president donald trump did not outline new regulatory reform goals however he did briefly note that the administration has cut more regulations in a short time than any other administration during its entire tenure as a result he added companies are coming back to our country in large numbers the administration has indeed taken important steps to rein in agencies rulemaking it issued 65 percent fewer economically significant rules those with costs to the private sector that exceed 100 million a year than the obama administration and 51 percent fewer than the bush administration after 22 months in office the white house is also pursuing rollbacks of the obama administration s costliest and unwarranted rules but regulatory repeal is a laborious process that may take years especially given the never ending legal challenges pursued by regulatory proponents the no 1 thing the administration must do is stop internet regulation further innovation is key to economic growth and national security and both will be stymied if the statists get a regulatory foothold if trump pursues no other regulatory reform preventing internet regulations would be enough the second priority would be to demand that any new regulatory statute has a hard expiration deadline that s needed to halt the cumulative regulatory burden and force agencies and congress to review the necessity for regulations the white house cannot accomplish all the necessary reforms unilaterally congress must do much more to eliminate unnecessary regulation and curtail agency overreach congress could do a great deal more to advance reform by exercising a bit of political will including eliminating funding for regulatory programs that lack actual statutory authority or those that have failed to achieve the intended results lawmakers must also institute expiration dates for funding of regulatory initiatives to reduce the cumulative burden of regulation the 50 member staff of the office of information and regulatory affairs who review agency rulemaking is badly outnumbered by the hundreds of thousands of regulators who labor daily crafting rules congress should expand the resources of the office to improve regulatory oversight as well as assert more of its own authority over runaway regulation diane katz senior research fellow in regulatory policy institute for economic freedom deregulation helping the economy as a candidate donald trump made a commitment to reform the regulatory state as president he has taken steps to do just that the trump administration has taken historic steps to fight overregulation the president has been committed to preventing needless regulations from strangling the economy early in his presidency trump issued a series of executive orders designed to improve the regulatory process he required two old regulations to be removed for every new one he slowed the issuance of new rules so that the office of management and budget along with the office of information and regulatory affairs could ensure that new rules would not disrupt economic growth overall there has been at least a 27 percent decrease in the issuance of new regulations overall 67 significant rules rules with an effect of 100 million or more have been eliminated but only three new ones issued atop that the administration worked with congress to use the congressional review act to repeal rules proposed during the obama administration the trump administration s deregulatory efforts have contributed to historic economic growth consider energy america has taken fracking and made it into an engine of energy primacy america is now a net exporter of energy and is the world s largest oil and gas producer proof of the wisdom of the administration s deregulatory efforts can be seen in the fact that we have seen the reversal of the diaspora of american businesses that we saw in prior administrations as the president said companies are coming back to our country in large numbers thanks to our historic reductions in taxes and regulations deregulation not only helps the small businesses that we see throughout our neighborhoods it also serves to encourage large businesses to move facilities back into the united states as well as to entice foreign businesses to locate within our country when that happens more and more americans get jobs that help each of them take a step toward their dreams paul larkin senior legal research fellow meese center for legal and judicial studies institute for constitutional government trump right to rebuke socialism president donald trump s criticism of socialism is entirely valid there is no more sure means to impoverish a country than to adopt socialist policies economic freedom is the key to prosperity free markets offer the most ethical and humane means of organizing economic life in 2018 and 2019 the heritage foundation hosted a speaker series free markets the ethical economic choice which critiques the liberal progressive and socialist egalitarian vision that seeks to use government to enforce a predetermined distribution of economic goods in the name of equality fairness or social justice david burton senior fellow in economic policy roe institute for economic policy studies institute for economic freedom and opportunity killing the death tax the death tax also known as the estate tax is a 40 percent tax on assets left behind after death for years this tax has been a costly financial burden on family owned businesses and has been known to stifle economic growth the tax cuts and jobs act has begun to alleviate the burden by raising the threshold to assets exceeding 11 2 million lawmakers should seek to fully repeal the tax as doing so will continue to boost american economic growth for years to come kevin dayaratna ph d senior statistician and research programmer institute for economic freedom failure to mention america s growing debt problem one issue that the president failed to address tuesday night is the nation s ballooning debt last week the congressional budget office released its latest budget and economic projections the budget office estimates that the national debt will increase by a staggering 13 trillion over the next decade driven by entitlement spending and growing interest payments on the national debt and these projections are likely optimistic assuming that the budget control act spending caps remain unaltered through 2021 and that no major disaster and emergency spending is approved by congress the good news is these are just projections there is still time to change course and avert the looming budget crisis but doing so will take strong leadership from the president and congress the president s first two budgets pledged to cut spending and fundamentally reform the role of the federal government now more than ever the president and congress should recommit to fiscal restraint and work together to find solutions that will stabilize the debt and put the country back on a sustainable budget path justin bogie senior policy analyst in fiscal affairs roe institute for economic policy studies institute for economic freedom and opportunity a misguided approach to paid family leave president donald trump mentioned that he is the first president to include a plan for nationwide paid family leave in his budget americans want paid family leave but not if they have to pay for it a federal paid family leave program would cost taxpayers hundreds if not thousands of dollars more in taxes each year and most importantly it could not meet workers needs as well as more flexible employer based policies the federal disability insurance program is an example of the dysfunction that could come from a federal paid family leave program paid leave is on the rise in the u s without federal involvement over the past three years more than 100 large name brand companies announced new or expanded paid family leave programs and the largest 20 employers in the u s all provide paid family leave now is not the time to stifle this growth or to crowd out existing policies with a federal paid leave program instead of a new national entitlement that would crowd out existing private and state based programs and shift their costs onto federal taxpayers lawmakers should pursue policies such as the working families flexibility act universal savings accounts and lower taxes and fewer regulations that would free up resources for businesses to provide paid family leave rachel greszler research fellow in economics budget and entitlements institute for economic freedom and opportunity celebrating women s success president donald trump celebrated the fact that the 116th congress has more women than any other congress in history the fact that the number of women in congress has increased three and a half fold since 1992 without any legislation addressing the gap shows that women are fully capable when they choose to of shattering so called glass ceilings on their own yet democrats in congress are already advocating so called fair pay laws that would result in rigid pay scales and one size fits all jobs that could hurt more women than they help and that could cause employers to discriminate against women in the hiring process through the threat of punitive lawsuits instead of focusing only on pay and ignoring women s choices let s hope that the 116th congress instead seeks ways to create equal opportunities for all women and men alike without limiting access to jobs that meet women s and men s individual needs and desires rachel greszler research fellow in economics budget and entitlements institute for economic freedom and opportunity law judicial nominations president donald trump noted that hundreds of highly qualified nominees have stalled in the senate and that includes a number of judicial nominees since the very beginning of his administration trump has placed an emphasis on nominating individuals to the federal bench who will interpret and apply the constitution and laws as written this is perhaps the most successful area of his administration so far to date he has appointed two supreme court justices 30 u s court of appeals judges more than any other new president at this point and 53 u s district court judges but the judiciary is still 16 percent vacant and we are in the longest period of triple digit judicial vacancies in 25 years trump has re nominated 48 highly qualified men and women whose nominations expired with the 115th congress the senate has work to do thomas jipping deputy director and senior legal fellow and elizabeth slattery legal fellow meese center for legal and judicial studies institute for constitutional government honoring a heroic police officer it might have seemed like a small part of the president s speech but the significance of the event that he mentioned goes far beyond the few words he used months ago jewish americans were viciously murdered in an attack on the tree of life synagogue in pittsburgh as the president noted pittsburgh swat officer timothy matson raced into the gunfire to stop the murderous assault matson was successful but he was shot seven times in the process think about that he ran toward the gunfire not away from it as most people would but that is what america s police do every day to help their fellow citizens and save lives america s police are the foot soldiers of an ordered society we owe them much but most of all we owe them our respect and thanks people like timothy matson never become rich they never play in super bowls they never receive academy awards but they should they stand watch and put themselves between those who would do us harm and the people who cannot protect themselves matson and the rest of the officers like him deserve more credit more kudos and more plaudits than they ever will receive but we can at least be thankful that the president is aware of their heroism paul larkin senior legal research fellow meese center for legal and judicial studies institute for constitutional government celebrating landmark criminal justice reform president donald trump repeatedly called for america to unite as one people to put aside partisan politics and choose greatness for the country in support of his call for unity trump cited the first step act as an instance when lawmakers in washington have overcome political differences to do great things for america the first step act a landmark piece of bipartisan legislation was signed into law by trump on dec 21 2018 and has brought as heritage scholars have observed modest yet much needed prison and sentencing reform to the federal criminal justice system the first step act among other things eliminated a disparity in federal sentencing laws for federal prisoners convicted of possessing or selling crack cocaine prior to the enactment of the fair sentencing act as the president stated the disparity in the sentencing laws has wrongly and disproportionately harmed the african american community attending the state of the union on tuesday by personal invitation from trump and the first lady were two individuals who received disproportionate sentences for their crimes the first guest was alice marie johnson who was sentenced to life in prison as a first time nonviolent drug offender in june trump commuted johnson s sentence after learning of her extraordinary rehabilitation while in prison trump then introduced matthew charles who was the first beneficiary of the first step act s sentencing reforms charles would have been sitting in federal prison for the state of the union had the first step act not become law and had he not turned around his life while serving a 35 year sentence in federal prison for selling crack cocaine charles found god and dedicated himself to conducting bible studies working as a law clerk teaching ged courses and mentoring fellow inmates on jan 3 charles was the first federal inmate to be released from prison after receiving a reduced sentence under the first step act his story and the first step act were major focal points in the speech but there is more work to be done my former heritage colleague john michael seibler perhaps stated it best after trump s first state of the union when he wrote that the need for criminal justice reform goes beyond prison walls and into the criminal code with the 116th congress now in session federal lawmakers need to consider additional proposals that would restore the integrity of the federal criminal justice system now retired sen orrin hatch r utah fought tirelessly while in the senate for sensible mens rea latin for guilty mind reform and introduced the mens rea reform act of 2018 in the 115th congress which would have required all federal crimes to have a mens rea requirement unless congress specifically stated otherwise sen chuck grassley r iowa also introduced in the 115th congress a proposal that would have ordered the attorney general to take an inventory of all federal criminal offenses currently on the books this was part of the sentencing reform and corrections act of 2017 the time is ripe to take the next step forward to reform the federal criminal justice system and the president confirmed tuesday evening that he is ready to build new coalitions forge new solutions and unlock the extraordinary promise of america s future jonathan zalewski visiting legal fellow and koch associate justice ginsburg s absence there s been a flurry of speculation from fan and foe alike about justice ruth bader ginsburg s health in recent months at the end of last year she was treated for broken ribs after falling in her office and she had cancerous nodules removed from her left lung the latter led to her missing two weeks of oral argument in january while she recuperated from surgery we shouldn t read too much into her absence from president donald trump s address tonight because she has never appeared at a republican president s state of the union address supreme court justices are not required to attend the state of the union indeed five justices missed the address last year and justices antonin scalia clarence thomas samuel alito and sonia sotomayor all missed at least one state of the union address during president barack obama s administration in 2010 chief justice john roberts pointed out to the extent the state of the union has degenerated into a political pep rally i m not sure why we re there elizabeth slattery legal fellow meese center for legal and judicial studies institute for constitutional government defense foreign policy a strengthened military and nato when president donald trump says that in the last two years great progress has been made in rebuilding the u s military he s right increased defense budgets of 700 billion in 2018 and 716 billion in 2019 are already making a difference reflected in increased readiness and modest growth army brigade combat team readiness as an example went from 33 to 50 percent ready in the space of one year now as congress begins to contemplate the 2020 defense budget it is critically important that both congress and the administration continue their support for rebuilding the military and as heritage foundation research recommends authorize and appropriate at least 742 billion for defense in 2020 similarly the president is right when he describes how nato allies are spending more on defense they have indeed begun to increase their defenses pledging to increase their spending on defense by more than 100 billion the trump administration deserves credit for calling out the allies who have not been spending enough on their defenses previous u s efforts to call attention to this issue have been half hearted and garnered little attention this is an area where trump s straight talk has paid off although credit is due more effort is needed only 5 of 29 nato allies now meet the target of spending 2 percent of their gross domestic product on their militaries as an example of some countries not investing enough germany was unable to deploy any of its submarines last year and only half of its fighter aircraft were ready for use heritage research recommends continued pressure on nato allies until all meet the established goals thomas spoehr director center for national defense standing with the venezuelan people from early in his presidency president donald trump has focused on addressing the crisis in venezuela trump s policy recognizes the reality that nicolas maduro must step down the corrupt socialist regime has bankrupted venezuela causing latin america s worst economic and refugee crisis maduro s thugs are directly involved in drug trafficking support for terrorists and human rights violations venezuela now has more political prisoners than even cuba trump has responded by sanctioning nearly 100 corrupt venezuelan officials and cut off their access to illicitly obtained wealth america is not going at this alone either dozens of countries have united alongside trump s efforts to restore freedom in venezuela ana quintana senior policy analyst latin america and western hemisphere davis institute for national security and foreign policy eliminating isis president donald trump briefly discussed middle east policy in his speech focusing primarily on the war against terrorists in syria and iraq when i took office the president said isis controlled more than 20 000 square miles in iraq and syria today we have liberated virtually all of that territory from the grip of these bloodthirsty killers now as we work with our allies to destroy the remnants of isis it is time to give our brave warriors in syria a warm welcome home bringing the troops home and fulfilling campaign promises are laudable goals but the trump administration must be careful not to do this at the expense of long term u s security interests in syria and the middle east the u s inevitably will have to withdraw at some point but it must first ensure that arrangements have been made to protect u s national interests including permanently defeating isis which the administration correctly has made its top priority just hours before the speech gen joseph votel the top u s military commander in the middle east testified before the senate armed services committee and warned that isis could regroup and resurge unless the u s and its allies maintain relentless pressure on it trump must keep this in mind and make sure that as he withdraws u s troops from inside syria the anti isis coalition continues to nail isis coffin shut supported by u s air power jim phillips senior research fellow middle eastern affairs confronting the growing threat of anti semitism president donald trump warned we must never ignore the vile poison of anti semitism or those who spread its venomous creed with one voice we must confront this hatred anywhere and everywhere it occurs more than 70 years after the rebirth of the jewish nation enemies of her very existence are using boycott divestment and sanctions bds to economically harm and morally malign one of our closest allies indeed the bds movement exemplifies contemporary anti semitism these peddlers of hate hurl false allegations against israel in an attempt to generate public support for their movement unfortunately several newly elected members of congress are vocal advocates of bds particularly reps rashida tlaib d mich and ilhan omar d minn following her election victory tlaib said in reference to israel i will not support racist countries that pick and choose who gets access to justice she further claimed that israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu is pursuing apartheid policies during israel s 2012 war against hamas an entity designated a foreign terrorist organization omar claimed israel has hypnotized the world may allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of israel she has also claimed that israel is an apartheid regime these allegations defy reality the israeli government does not impose ethnic segregation on communities arab and jewish israelis are free to buy and sell homes and land within areas that fall under israeli administration on the other hand jews are precluded from living in zones controlled by the palestinian authority which manages palestinian civil affairs in fact a fatwa forbids arabs from selling real estate to jews in those areas under penalty of death a top judge of the palestinian authority warned that acting contrary to this order qualifies as high treason israel is the middle east s only true democracy one in which minority rights are protected the right to vote access to public health care public education freedom of speech and protection of legal rights are enjoyed by all citizens regardless of race and irrespective of religion the israeli government also protects the right of muslims christians and jews and others to practice their respective faiths mosques churches and synagogues operate within yards of each other political leaders in both u s political parties must recognize and speak out against those who normalize this venomous creed joel griffith research fellow financial regulations thomas a roe institute for economic policy studies president donald trump made three references to anti semitism in his address to iran s genocidal threats against the jewish people to the tree of life synagogue attack and to the nazi concentration camps which judah samet and joshua kaufman two of the president s guests survived at home the fbi reports that jews were the most frequent targets of violent crimes based on religion in 2017 as anti semitism grows both in the united states and around the world the trump administration is ensuring that these attacks will be condemned and punished the department of justice under the trump administration has aggressively prosecuted these crimes and created a website to provide a centralized portal on these types of crimes for law enforcement media researchers victims and advocacy groups emilie kao director richard and helen devos center for religion civil society life a bold stand for life and human dignity tonight president donald trump called on the country to work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life and asked congress to pass the pain capable unborn child protection act which would protect women and unborn children from gruesome late term abortions performed after 20 weeks the nonpartisan congressional budget office estimates that passing this bill could potentially save 10 000 lives each year a number widely considered to be on the conservative side the u s is one of only seven countries in the world that allows elective abortion past 20 weeks five months at which point scientific evidence suggests that the baby is capable of feeling excruciating pain during an abortion procedure at the state level over a dozen states across the country have enacted 20 week bills americans support significant abortion restrictions by a large margin regardless of party affiliation in fact 75 percent of americans support limiting abortion to at most the first trimester congress should ensure that public policy respects the rights of the most vulnerable and innocent among us passing legislation to protect unborn children who are capable of feeling pain would be a meaningful step toward that goal melanie israel research associate richard and helen devos center for religion civil society energy infrastructure the triumph of american energy president donald trump mentioned that the united states has become the world s largest oil and gas producer with an abundance of resources under u s soil the energy revolution is here to stay the institute for energy research has demonstrated that there is over 1 4 trillion barrels of oil and over 2 4 quadrillion barrels of cubic feet of natural gas here in the united states heritage foundation research has found that taking advantage of this vast supply would create millions of jobs and grow the economy for years to come we are now beginning to see these massive benefits pursuing unnecessary and burdensome regulations or enacting plans like the green new deal and making conventional fuels prohibitively expensive would undo these great gains kevin dayaratna ph d senior statistician and research programmer institute for economic freedom for cutting edge infrastructure unleash the private sector president donald trump called the need for infrastructure legislation a necessity not an option again trump wrongly characterized america s infrastructure as crumbling when the facts say otherwise nevertheless trump said he was eager to work with congress on legislation to deliver new and important infrastructure investment including investments in the cutting edge industries of the future if the goal is to unleash new cutting edge infrastructure congress cannot go down the same top down tax and spend road massive new government spending on infrastructure will be inefficient politically driven and result in poor infrastructure outcomes that are not aligned with real needs see the heritage foundation s new report regulatory reform is the key to unlocking infrastructure investment any infrastructure proposal must focus on the role of the federal government a fiscally responsible bill should have offsets to pay for new spending and narrow the federal role by eliminating funding for local and often wasteful projects such as bike paths and mass transit furthermore substantial regulatory improvements will unleash private sector investment reforming environmental and labor regulations with a focus on transitioning authority to the states creating market incentives and removing costly ineffective regulations will stimulate investment in new infrastructure around the country nicolas loris research manager energy and environment and the herbert and joyce morgan research fellow institute for economic freedom health care lowering drug prices the president is focused on the right problem overly high prices for prescription drugs he rightly recognizes that government policy plays a role in driving up these prices and fixing it requires addressing a lot of flawed government policies his administration has done much to start to address this problem for example the fda approved a record number of generic drugs in 2017 and 2018 according to the council of economic advisers generic approvals under president donald trump have saved consumers 26 billion congress should take up the president s call to go further one piece congress can help with is the government payment system for drugs which is fundamentally broken and drives up costs one way government does this is through an overly complicated payment system for seniors drugs in medicare instead congress should help more seniors access medicare advantage a system of premium support for medicare beneficiaries that lets them choose the plan that covers all their needs including drugs today one third of seniors have already chosen medicare advantage and the trump administration has done much to improve it so it is a good place to start this change would help ensure that seniors no longer have to face high out of pocket costs for prescription drugs this approach is a proven way to empower seniors to afford the drugs they need while creating pressure on drug companies to offer drugs at a price that people value marie fishpaw director domestic policy studies education striking the right balance on school choice president donald trump tonight said that to help support working class parents the time has come to pass school choice for america s children the administration s support of school choice is praiseworthy although the federal government does not have the constitutional authority to create a nationwide school choice program the president is right to use his bully pulpit to make the case for empowering families with school choice congress should now heed the president s call and work to create education choice in those areas in which it has a constitutional warrant to do so for children from military families native american students on tribal lands and for students living in washington d c such a federal focus would pay dividends for the school choice movement by leaving education choice programs to the states which have been the catalyst for the impressive growth in school choice over the past two decades for their part states across the country should also heed that call and work to advance education savings accounts vouchers and tax credit scholarships so that every child in america has access to a learning environment that is the right fit for them lindsey m burke director center for education policy institute for family community and opportunity
yves here since the economists mentioned below got in quite a fistfight i ll only add one observation the notion that higher taxes mean entrepreneurs would leave is nonsense starting a new business requires above all customers a foreign transplant won t have them and will be disadvantaged in acquiring them and that s before these pundits having no clue as to how hard an international move is when you don t have an employer sponsoring it already rich people may give up their citizenship but that s a different category by enrico bergamini research assistant at bruegel and previously a data science consultant for the ngo action aid originally published at bruegel during a panel at davos dell founder michael dell was asked about his opinion on the proposal of a 70 top marginal tax rate he replied name a country where that has worked ever co panelist erik brynjolfsson mit names the united states in between the 1930s and the 1960s when the average top rate was higher than 70 with peaks of 91 on january 4th alexandria ocasio cortez newly elected congresswoman and rising star of the democratic party proposed in an interview with 60 minutes to raise the tax rate to 70 on incomes above 10 million the tax she explained is meant to finance her plan for a green new deal an ambitious programme of investments in carbon free infrastructures and jobs across various sectors in order to decarbonise the economy by 2030 ocasio cortez argued that if taken in a historical perspective this is far from a radical idea under dwight eisenhower s presidency in the 1950s top marginal tax rates were as high as 91 coming from the 73 of 1920 and still as high as 70 in 1980 this proposal kick started a heated debate not only about the technical calculations of top marginal tax rates but also on the progressivity of tax systems and the role of different economic policy instruments in fighting inequality for the washington post jeff stein with the help of tax experts such as mark mazur tax policy center joel slemrod university of michigan and ernie tedeschi treasury department of obama s white house tries to assess the implications of this tax policy mazur calculates that it could raise 720 billion over the next decade affecting 0 05 of the us population around 16 000 households although the estimate is likely to be much smaller because of the changing behaviour of the millionaires paul krugman steps into the debate in a new york times op ed reframing ocasio cortez s proposal not as a radical socialist idea but as an economically sound proposal even moderate if viewed from a historical perspective krugman quotes the diamond saez 2011 calculation of the 73 optimal top marginal tax rate as well as the ideal rate found by romer romer 2011 which was higher than 80 he challenges the republican trickle down arguments for tax cuts as based on research by well nobody showing a non negative correlation between economic growth and top marginal tax rates but what would be the economic justification for high top marginal income rates krugman builds the argument on diminishing marginal utilities and competitive markets the former imply that an extra dollar of income is more useful to low income families than to richer ones if each agent is paid her marginal utility marginal top tax rates could even theoretically be up to 100 the obvious tradeoff is that this would totally eliminate any incentive to work more and hurt economic growth and innovation however in case of non perfectly competitive markets where market failures such as monopolies and rents are present the optimal marginal tax rate that maximises social benefits and aggregate welfare can be quite high john cochrane replies to krugman s arguments by pointing out that the 70 calculations are based on arbitrary assumptions and that mirrlees 1971 calculates an optimal rate of 0 starting from different assumptions cochrane writes that saez diamond calculations do not include federal and local state taxes and that the disincentive argument does not account for human capital decisions that individuals might take and like the decision to relocate it depends on the total tax bite not just the marginal tax bite how much will i earn after all taxes what lifestyle will i lead if i go to med school or just stay where i am clive crook on bloomberg highlights the technical difficulties of calculating optimal tax rates drawing attention to the fact that saez zucman 2011 estimate a range between 48 76 where the optimal tax rate might lie also crook argues that economically it is a very questionable proposal the risk is that the most successful entrepreneurs would emigrate which would have costs higher than a loss of tax revenue but what crook finds as the main problem with social welfare maximising policies is that by grounding arguments in diminishing marginal utilities they ignore questions of justice and liberty whether some of the rich might deserve to be rich because of the work they ve done the risks they ve taken or the ideas they ve come up with is irrelevant garrett watson at the tax foundation underlines the risk that innovation processes will be hampered by higher marginal tax rates quoting empirical evidence from a 2018 working paper by charles jones by contrast pasi kuoppamÃ¤ki chief economist of danske bank a s s finland branch writes on the hill that nordic countries although each helped by having a smaller population have been able to make high taxation work well without harming innovation or incentives to work while providing comprehensive welfare policies on bloomberg noah smith also endorses the proposal as far from radical and economically well grounded and further the key issue in his view is to go beyond this plan and reform the corporate and capital gains tax systems enlarging the base of high earners and probably using wealth taxes tyler cowen michael strain and karl smith join in a debate with noah smith on the economics of ocasio cortez s plan for a top marginal tax rate they express several concerns about the effectiveness of such a plan in fighting inequality a plan that would foster tax avoidance schemes and hamper innovation processes karl smith points out what makes these systems redistributive is not punitive tax rates on the rich but broad based taxes that are used to fund a universal basic income for everyone on avoidance aparna mathur american enterprise institute explained that elasticities of high income individuals that have a much higher capacity to avoid taxes would result in a government revenue 27 8 lower than the calculations made in a static scenario she proposes alternative solutions such as an x tax as suggested by carroll and viard 2012 that would distort incentives less or a carbon tax that also would also entail redistributive mechanisms a point elaborated upon in a recent bruegel blueprint written by grÃ©gory claeys gustav fredriksson and georg zachmann the bloomberg editorial board argued that ocasio cortez s idea is unwise but worth discussing since the revenue needs of the government will rise in the future both for social security spending and for tackling climate change they suggest to focus on closing loopholes and broadening the tax base before raising the rates emmanuel saez and gabriel zucman of the university of california and berkeley address these concerns in an op ed for the new york times they reply to the objections showing that high top marginal tax rates are not correlated with slower economic growth not only in the united states but also in japan between 1950 and 1982 their main point though is of a political nature while in the us incomes in the lower half of the distribution have stagnated for 30 years the top 0 1 saw an increase of 300 and the 0 001 of 600 in their view proposals like ocasio cortez s have more to do with preserving a japan style liberal democracy rather than paving the way for authoritarian reactions that result from years of negative income growth rates for a large part of the population if the concentration of incomes at the top coincides with concentration of power higher tax rates are meant to shelter society from the dangers of plutocracy more than to finance investment plans or the welfare state this op ed raised many reactions both from the left and from the right greg mankiw criticised the political argument by commenting that most of the people that are earning high incomes earned their wealth honestly and have less political influence than commonly thought chris dillow from a marxist perspective argues that the excessive political influence of the rich cannot be solved by a socialist democrat state intervention which would be insufficient to mitigate the failures of capitalism the debate was pushed two days later by the proposal of a tax reform by the democratic presidential candidate elizabeth warren this plan would introduce a wealth tax on the ultra rich a novel element in the history of us tax system the proposal is based on an analysis by saez and zucman a 2 tax on the wealth that exceeds 50 millions and an additional surplus tax of 1 on households with a net worth of more than 1 billion these taxes would raise according to their calculations 2 75 trillion for a 10 year timespan 1 0 of gdp per year affecting 75 000 households a group smaller than the 0 1 according to saez and zucman the ultra rich tax would be able to raise 212 billion for 2019 they present an estimate by piketty saez and zucman 2018 that the tax burden on the wealth of the richest 0 1 households including local state and federal taxes would be 3 2 for 2019 lower than the burden on the 99 estimated at 7 2 they claim that the ultra rich tax would raise the burden on the 0 1 to 4 3 the revenue generated senator warren explains in an interview could be funneled into childcare and healthcare proposals and to reduce student debt yet the main objective in the senator s words is to help to level the power dynamics in washington reducing the amount of political influence that the economic elite can achieve it s about making democracy work better and it s about making the economy work better when you ask me about the centerpiece it actually starts with an anti corruption bill that tries to reduce the influence of money in washington warren s proposal was defended by noted tax experts and by paul krugman in the new york times arguing that although radical it would raise the average tax rates on the richest 0 1 to 48 up from 36 he added that it would be feasible looking at denmark and sweden where higher taxes did not lead to higher fiscal evasion if adequately enforced on bloomberg while noah smith favoured a wealth tax meant to reduce income inequality as a better plan than many of the alternatives harvard s law professor noah feldman expressed concerns as to the constitutionality of such a tax shared by another candidate for the 2020 elections michael bloomberg as in the case of the ocasio cortez proposal many commentators put forward the argument that these type of taxes would hamper innovation and entrepreneurship european trends this chart from piketty s capital in the 21st century depicts a decreasing trend in top marginal tax rates from a historical perspective in a comparison between france germany the uk and the us the share of national income for the top 1 has been on the rise in many european countries the late anthony atkinson proposed a 65 top tax rate for the uk in inequality what can be done 2015 and also piketty called for a rethinking of top marginal income rates in europe of course as mentioned by grace blakeley the situation on the european side is much more complex and would require capital controls to be effective however if europe is to accept the preoccupations for democracy expressed by saez and zucman it should have a debate on high income taxation
following in the wake of gold silver sees stronger growth precious metal range gold 1 225 oz to 1 450 oz silver 14 50 oz to 20 00 oz platinum 700 oz to 950 oz palladium 1 130 oz to 1 650 oz rhodium 2 000 oz to 3 250 oz ruthenium 200 oz to 350 oz iridium 1 150 oz to 1 750 oz platinum surplus remains strikes could temporarily prop up the price palladium remains in short supply price expected to rise with high volatility medium and long term trends in the precious metals industry investments in recycling and hydrogen technology there are several indications that the price of gold could rise in 2019 in light of unrest in the capital markets investors are increasingly turning to less volatile alternatives the central banks in developed markets have pursued an unconventional monetary policy for years the us federal reserve appeared to have first retreated from the zero interest rate policy to a normal interest rate environment and now seems to act with more caution again a temporarily weaker us dollar could support gold this overall situation holds the potential for unexpected tensions gold can be used as a tool to hedge against currency fluctuations furthermore economic and political uncertainties are globally on the rise the brexit the unsolved trade conflict between china and the united states the government shutdown in the united states or the recession in italy these and other factors are causing the global economy to experience lower growth central banks are increasingly becoming gold buyers again thus supporting demand for 2019 the price per fine ounce of gold is expected to range between usd 1 225 and usd 1 450 in uncertain times the price of silver is influenced by the same factors as the price of gold furthermore there are other signs that the price of silver will experience a steeper rise than gold in 2019 the underlying demand from the industry is growing this precious metal is indispensable for photovoltaics and despite more efficient products with lower silver content a higher number of new installations in many regions will lead to higher demand for silver furthermore silver is necessary in the growing areas of electronics for vehicles smartphones tablets and so forth on the investor side silver supplies declined last year and for etfs they have fallen by 280 tons the current gold silver ratio of 83 is also indicative for this silver is consequently undervalued compared to gold historically ratios above 80 have never lasted long because the market environment now favors the demand for silver the price per fine ounce of silver is expected to range between usd 14 50 and usd 20 00 the lower demand for diesel engines continues to lead to an excess of platinum the automotive industry is the largest consumer of platinum with a 42 percent market share platinum is used in diesel catalytic converters the platinum demand from the jewelry industry at a share of 25 percent remains with the risk of declining a slight uptick in demand for platinum is due to its applications in oil refineries especially in china and in the usa and a higher demand for platinum as a catalyst material for chemical processes the offer of platinum from mines primarily in south africa is supposed to grow by one percent potential strikes over wage negotiations in the mining industry could temporarily prop up the price the offer from recycling is seeing moderate growth this year all in all a production surplus of 21 tons of platinum is expected for 2019 with overall production amounting to 207 tons in 2018 the close correlation with gold could temporarily support the price of platinum the price per fine ounce of platinum is expected to range between usd 700 and usd 950 the shortage of palladium will continue in 2019 as visible etf stocks have shrunk from 39 4 tons to around 20 tons the automotive industry is the heaviest consumer of palladium at 81 percent palladium is used in catalytic converters in gasoline engines a slight growth in the automobile market and stricter emission regulations in china are further increasing the demand for palladium although the production of palladium from mines and from recycling slightly exceeds demand there is still a market deficit of 17 tons strikes by south african mine workers could exacerbate this deficit the situation might ease if economic growth slows in china and the usa the automotive heavyweights based on the continuing palladium shortage the price per fine ounce of palladium is expected to range between usd 1 130 and usd 1 650 for the medium to long term the heraeus precious metals sees two major trends that will affect the precious metals industry 1 the primary production of platinum and palladium from mines will decline during the next ten years the recycling of platinum group metals pgms will acquire an increased importance not sufficiently high prices and high and further growing cost of mining have led to a consolidation in industry within the last years especially in the field of pgms 2 alterations in mobile powertrain technologies lead to a lower request for platinum the request for platinum will return to significant growth by the development of the fuel cell technology due to the diesel scandal and an absence of a connection technology that relies on platinum there will be a surplus of platinum in the next decade however hydrogen technology using predominantly platinum in catalytic converters as a drive for vehicles and stationary motors and for energy storage will boost demand for platinum but this might have increasingly noticeable effects on both the supply of platinum and its market price around the year 2030 in contrast the growth in automobile sales worldwide will increase the demand for palladium in the next decade despite an increase in electric vehicles the growing number of gasoline and hybrid vehicles will more than compensate for the drop in palladium use due to entirely electric vehicles to serve these two trends heraeus precious metals is investing in expanding its recycling capacities in germany the usa india and china in china the company opened the world s largest and most modern factory for precious metals recycling short time ago we are already recycling more than 100tons of platinum and palladium per year compared to primary extraction this accounts for significant savings in co2 emissions and energy consumption precious metals recycling is increasingly important for closing the gap between the shrinking output by mines and the demand explains andrÃ© christl president of heraeus precious metals for the germany based heraeus technology group the company is also investing in the development of new technologies including hydrogen technology
in his second state of the union address president donald trump sought to strike a bipartisan tone of unity and progress just weeks after the longest shutdown in us history and with less than two weeks to go before the next funding lapse trump asking americans to choose greatness focused on some of his top priorities immigration the economy infrastructure drug prices and national security cnn vetted the president s claims immigration claim 1 in 3 women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north indeed the trek to the us mexico border has been reported to be violent according to data from doctors without borders 68 3 of migrants and refugees entering mexico reported being victims of violence during their transit toward the united states and nearly one third of women said they d been sexually abused but this needs some perspective this very violence is why women choose to travel in caravans to achieve safety in numbers trump has offered no specifics about how his policies would address the scourge of sexual violence faced by migrants the administration has argued in the past that by building the wall migrants will be deterred from making the journey priscilla alvarez claim year after year countless americans are murdered by criminal illegal aliens trump has repeatedly cited crimes committed by undocumented immigrants both during his presidential campaign and during his tenure in office this is the second time he s invited family members of victims to the state of the union the bureau of justice does not include citizenship in its breakdown of national arrest statistics so there is not reliable federal data to quantify the number of crimes committed by undocumented immigrants here s what the statistics do show on immigration and crime a 2018 study by the libertarian cato institute which reviewed criminal conviction data from the texas department of public safety found that immigrants legal or illegally are less likely than native born americans to be convicted of a crime throughout the country there is also generally a decrease in the number of violent crimes according to the fbi other studies have found that murder rape robbery and aggravated assault have not increased alongside an uptick in undocumented immigration since 1990 that undocumented immigrants do not contribute to an increase in drug overdoses and dui deaths and that young undocumented immigrants engage in less crime than their american or legal immigrant peers priscilla alvarez claim the border city of el paso texas used to have extremely high rates of violent crime one of the highest in the country and considered one of our nation s most dangerous cities now with a powerful barrier in place el paso is one of our safest cities the president s statement which has been repeated by public officials and the white house over the course of the last year makes an inaccurate connection according to an analysis of fbi crimes data and city law enforcement data analyzed by the el paso times violent crime in el paso peaked in 1993 border fence construction didn t begin until 2008 and was completed in 2009 but violent crime fell long before the wall was built in el paso with violent crime falling 34 between 1993 and 2006 in the city and according to the el paso times from 2006 to 2011 violent crime in el paso actually increased by 17 percent maegan vazquez claim the lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety security and financial well being of all americans trump said the southern border is lawless while making the case for sending an additional 3 750 troops to the border here s what we know about the nature of crime around the border region as well as the presence of law enforcement and military there there were 19 555 border patrol agents assigned to patrol the nation s borders in fiscal year 2018 it was the first year that had a net staffing gain in five years the majority of border patrol agents are assigned to the southern border those border patrol agents apprehended 396 579 immigrants crossing the border illegally in 2018 which was down from a peak in of 1 643 679 arrests in nineteen years ago meanwhile border patrol agents seized tens of thousands of pounds of illegal drugs at the border in the past years studies and officials have also found that the us side of the border is relatively safe compared to other us cities violent crime rates have remained the same or dropped in many border cities in the last five years prior to 2016 for which data is available found an analysis by the texas tribune for example border communities like laredo el paso edinburg and brownsville all saw fewer than 400 crimes for every 100 000 residents according to the 2016 report you ve got to understand we re a border city so we have a lot of local law enforcement said webb county jail commander ponce treviÃ±o told the tribune former customs and border patrol commissioner david aguilar said in 2015 that border communities are safer than the interior locations of each of the border states violent crime is lesser along the border than it is in the interior reported the huffington post geneva sands claim i want people to come into our country in the largest numbers ever but they have to come in legally this is at odds with what s been the administration s stance on legal immigration trump has both sought to cut legal immigration and has made it more difficult for asylum seekers administration officials have signaled a desire to curtail a number of aspects of the legal immigration system from family based immigration to the diversity visa lottery while major overhauls of legal immigration policies would require congress to pass legislation immigrant rights advocates say there are signs the trump administration is already reshaping the system in more subtle ways making it more difficult to obtain certain visas the trump administration has also slashed the number of refugees the us has taken in last week the administration also began implementing the so called migrant protection protocols which allows for the administration to return some migrants seeking asylum in the united states to mexico to await their immigration court hearing as of last week more than a dozen migrants had been returned to mexico under the trump administration s new asylum policy since execution of the program began according to senior dhs officials priscilla alvarez and catherine shoichet economy claim in just over two years since the election we have launched an unprecedented economic boom a boom that has rarely been seen before trump can claim some credit for the acceleration of the economy on his watch but not most of it he inherited a labor market in the later stages of a long recovery from the great recession with fairly consistent job creation growth in monthly payrolls reported by the bureau of labor statistics averaged 217 000 jobs under president barack obama s second term and under trump it has averaged 203 000 pushing the overall unemployment rate to the lowest level since 1969 and unprecedented levels for people of color the economy has added 4 87 million jobs since trump took office not 5 3 million the number he cited wage growth has picked up since late 2017 especially for rank and file workers but not to the above 3 5 rates seen in the late 1990s and mid 2000s some of the pace of the increase had to do with states and cities raising their minimum wages which the president had no hand in indeed the economy grew at a rate of 4 2 in the second quarter of 2018 fueled in part by the surge in government defense spending as well as a large corporate tax cut that temporarily goosed business investment by the third quarter of 2018 growth slowed to a rate of 3 4 economists forecast a further deceleration through 2019 as the effects of the fiscal stimulus wear off and as businesses and consumers confront higher interest rates lydia depillis claim we have unleashed a revolution in american energy the united states is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world this is true but needs context the us became the world s largest crude oil producer in august 2018 when it surpassed russia for the first time since 1999 in terms of total daily crude production according to the us energy information administration earlier in the year the us surpassed saudi arabia s crude oil production for the first time since 1973 it has been the largest producer of natural gas since 2011 the rise in us oil and gas production is due in large part to advances in fracking technology that allowed drillers to access reserves socked away in shale formations buried deep underground production dipped in 2015 and 2016 as a result of overproduction and a collapse in oil prices but recovered quickly once supply stabilized and prices increased just as trump was coming into office the trump administration often touts its moves to relax obama era rules on oil and gas production such as one restricting the flaring of methane from fracking sites trump has also opened public lands to more drilling it s unclear though given the decade of increased energy production in the us how much of an impact any of those moves have had lydia depillis claim we have added 600 000 new manufacturing jobs something which almost everyone said was impossible to do but the fact is we are just getting started trump is overstating the number of manufacturing jobs created during his presidency about 454 000 were added since the beginning of 2017 according to the bureau of labor statistics but it s true that growth in manufacturing jobs has sped up during the past two years the reason for uptick is likely due to a number of factors including falling oil prices strong job numbers nationwide and deregulation katie lobosco claim no one has benefited more from our thriving economy than women who have filled 58 of the newly created jobs last year all americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before trump is spinning the data here by the numbers there are more women working in the united states than ever before but when measuring the labor force participation rate of women america has fallen behind other advanced economies today according to the bureau of labor statistics roughly 57 of all women in the us are working or looking for work but that s down from a high of 60 3 in april 2000 more than three decades ago the us was among the leading nations in terms of the share of prime age women in the workforce but american women s aggregate workforce participation has since edged down while other advanced economies have caught up and surged ahead since 1985 according to an april 2018 report by the international monetary fund there are a number of reasons behind the trend including structural issues and an aging population the us is the only advanced economy without a government mandated paid maternity leave and lacks affordable child and elder care options making it more difficult for women to work trump announced in his speech plans to include in this year s fiscal budget a nationwide paid family leave donna borak claim more people are working now than at any time in our history 157 million people at work that s true but it could do with some context according to data from the bureau of labor statistics released this month employment numbers on household data sits at 156 694 000 as a percentage of the population however we are still below our pre recession levels of employment holmes lybrand infrastructure claim i know that congress is eager to pass an infrastructure bill trump said and i am eager to work with you on legislation to deliver new and important infrastructure investment including investments in the cutting edge industries of the future while there s lot of talk about infrastructure there s been little tangible action to back up trump s picture of a government eager to act here s what has happened to date last february trump proposed a 1 5 trillion infrastructure plan though only 200 billion would come from the federal government the plan leaned on state and local governments to match federal funding by at least a four to one ratio as cnn noted at the time the plan also focused on making it easier to get federal permits and would allow the federal government to sell assets that would be better managed by state local or private entities according to the proposal house speaker nancy pelosi and senate minority leader chuck schumer have both said there s room to make a deal on infrastructure but neither are hopeful holmes lybrand drug prices claim it is unacceptable that americans pay vastly more than people in other countries for the exact same drugs often made in the exact same place this is wrong this is unfair and together we will stop it it s true that americans shell out more for medications than their peers in canada europe and many other places trump has often pointed this out as yet another example of how the world takes advantage of the us his administration put out areport in october that said pharmaceutical manufacturers charge 1 8 times more in the us for drugs that fall under medicare part b which are administered in doctor s offices and hospitals to treat cancers multiple sclerosis and other illnesses to counter this the administration is exploring setting the reimbursement level for these drugs based on their cost in other countries the so called target price of these medications would be 126 of the average of other nations this international pricing index model was quickly panned by the pharmaceutical industry as well as many conservatives who call it price fixing it runs counter to republicans allegiance to the free market system the proposal would stifle innovation and limit access to new medicines americans for tax reform and 56 other conservative groups wrote in a letter to the department of health human services in november tami luhby claim as a result of my administration s efforts in 2018 drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years this is true but misleading the president is citing the 12 month change in the consumer price index for prescription drugs it dropped 0 6 in december the largest decrease since april 1973 however the cpi varies widely month to month it rose 3 2 in the 12 months ending in june and some experts are concerned that the index isn t as adequate a measure as it was because of changes in the prescription drug market drug companies are still raising drug prices regardless of trump s tweets calling them out for doing so the prices of more than 2 300 drugs have gone up so far this year taking into account different dosages of the same drug according to rx savings solutions however the increases so far this year are more muted than in 2018 the average rise has been 6 8 so far this year as opposed to 10 4 the same period a year ago according to rx savings solutions tami luhby national security claim we have spent more than 7 trillion dollars in the middle east trump said of the conflicts in afghanistan and iraq this is false never mind that afghanistan isn t in the middle east and it s not the first time trump has floated this claim about spending on wars in iraq and afghanistan the non partisan congressional research service said that between 2001 and 2014 the operational costs for the wars in iraq and afghanistan were 1 6 trillion a cnn analysis found that in order to get to 7 trillion you have to add future spending most of which is for veterans over the next 35 years nicole gaouette claim when i took office isis controlled more than 20 000 square miles in iraq and syria just two years ago today we have liberated virtually all of the territory from the grip of these bloodthirsty monsters trump is right about the amount of territory re captured from isis during his time office at the end of 2016 isis controlled territory in syria and iraq was about 23 320 square miles according to defense publication ihs jane s on tuesday the commander of us central command gen joseph votel said the group is down to about 20 square miles that they still control tonight trump pointedly chose not to repeat his false statement that isis has been defeated a claim his own generals have contradicted on tuesday votel said the fight against the terror group is not over kylie atwood claim if i had not been elected president of the united states we would right now in my opinion be in a major war with north korea this is questionable the diplomatic thaw did not begin with trump it began in early 2018 when south korean president moon jae in welcomed north korean athletes to the winter olympics in pyeongchang in february in april moon and kim jong un held the first inter korean summit in more than a decade at the korean demilitarized zone before that trump s rhetoric had arguably raised tensions his august 2017 threat to meet north korea with fire fury and frankly power the likes of which the world has never seen before prompted pyongyang the next day to threaten to strike the us territory of guam with an enveloping fire trump did break precedent by hastily agreeing to an historic summit in singapore with kim the june 2018 talks led to a vaguely worded commitment to complete denuclearization talks between the us and north korea have faltered due to both sides drastically different definitions of denuclearization but trump announced during the speech that he would meet for a second summit with kim on february 27 28 in vietnam will ripley claim we are also getting other nations to pay their fair share finally for years the united states was being treated very unfairly by friends of ours members of nato but now we have secured over the last couple of years more than 100 billion of increase in defense spending from our nato allies they said it couldn t be done trump is right that nato allies stepped up their defense spending under his watch nato chief jens stoltenberg said so in a fox news interview last month by the end of next year nato allies will add 100 billion extra us dollars toward defense so we see some real money and some real results and we see that the clear message from president donald trump is having an impact that being said the us push for nato countries to spend more on national security began under presidents george w bush and barack obama spending has risen in recent years but many countries in the decades old alliance are still well below the requirement that they spend at least 2 of their gdp on defense making sure that other countries pay their fair share is a pet issue for trump he regularly railed against nato countries during the 2016 campaign and rattled his counterparts during nato summits these past two years trump regularly spreads falsehoods about the transatlantic alliance and questions its usefulness but none of that heated rhetoric made its way into his state of the union tonight marshall cohen and nicole gaouette claim trump declared that the us is withdrawing from the 1987 intermediate range nuclear forces treaty adding that while we followed the agreement to the letter russia repeatedly violated its terms this is true the us says that russia has not adhered to the inf treaty since 2014 though moscow consistently denies it is violating the pact and says us claims are driven by washington s desire to develop currently banned weapons systems and during a january 29 hearing on worldwide threats director of national intelligence dan coats said we know russia has violated the terms of of that treaty nicole gaouette governance claim this new era of cooperation can start with finally confirming the more than 300 highly qualified nominees who are still stuck in the senate in some cases years and years waiting not right the senate has failed to act on these nominations which is unfair to the nominees and very unfair to our country now is the time for bipartisan action this is misleading while it is true that confirmations for trump nominees lag behind the rate of confirmation for other american presidents it is inaccurate to suggest that it is entirely the fault of the senate which is controlled by republicans of the 705 key executive branch positions tracked by the washington post and the nonpartisan partnership for public service 274 have not been confirmed while trump and senate republicans sharply criticize democrats for slowing down the confirmation process more than half of those 144 to be exact are open because the trump administration has not yet nominated a candidate the jobs range from ambassadorships to important undersecretary roles to governorships at the federal reserve board overall the partnership analysis shows that only 54 of trump civilian executive branch nominations have been confirmed much lower than the 77 of obama nominees confirmed at the same point in his presidency alex rogers this is a breaking story and will be updated

generated by the business to pay certain guarantee fees that were previously paid in kind these cash payments are all reflected in free cash flow accordingly we believe unlevered free cash flow

advertisement fact check of the 2019 state of the union address and democratic response share copy link copy president donald trump delivered his second state of the union address tuesday he called for unity among americans and is expected to lay out an agenda of the american people our fact check team examined the president s prepared remarks released by the white house here is a look at what we ve found claim we passed a massive tax cut for working families and doubled the child tax credit findings the tax cuts and job act of 2017 did include tax cuts for americans however the word massive is subjective and vague with the passage of the tax cuts and job act several changes were made to the individual income tax according to the tax foundation an independent tax policy nonprofit the changes include a nearly doubled standard deduction limits on itemized deductions and reduced income tax rates also the tax cuts and job act expanded the child tax credit the credit went from a maximum of 1 000 per child in 2017 to a maximum of 2 000 in 2018 according to the balance a personal finance website staffed by financial experts rating unclear americans will file their first tax returns under the new policies in coming weeks time will tell whether working americans got a massive break ___claim african american hispanic american and asian american unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded findings what he s not saying is that the unemployment rates for all three groups have gone up since reaching record low levels black unemployment reached a record low 5 9 percent in may but rose to 6 8 percent in january latino unemployment fell to 4 4 percent its lowest ever last october and asian unemployment fell to a record low of 2 2 percent in may but latino and asian unemployment also have increased in part because of the government shutdown which elevated unemployment last month the african american rate is still nearly double the jobless rate for whites at 3 5 percent the most dramatic drop in black unemployment came under president barack obama when it fell from a recession high of 16 8 percent in march 2010 to 7 8 percent in january 2017 rating misleadingthe associated press provided this fact check ___claim therefore we recently imposed tariffs on 250 billion of chinese goods and now our treasury is receiving billions of dollars a month from a country that never gave us a dime findings trump made a similar claim on nov 29 2018 in a tweet after first announcing the 250 billion tariff on chinese imports when tariffs are put on products coming from outside of the u s in this case from china the money usually comes from u s consumers not chinese companies according to a november 2018 article from vox while the u s generates some revenue from the tariff it is not equal to billions of dollars vox reports in a new york times article also published in november 2018 writer jim tankersley explained china will never directly pay the tariff companies are more likely to pass off the cost of importing products to consumers a way china could lose tankersley said would be if american companies move their operations to another country and thus china would see less economic growth rating misleading___claim when i took office isis controlled more than 20 000 square miles in iraq and syria today we have liberated virtually all of that territory findings since its inception in 2014 us led forces with operation inherent resolve have terminated 60 000 to 70 000 isis militants including 120 of its leaders since august of that year the united states has conducted more than 27 000 airstrikes on isis targets in iraq and syria in 2017 more than 23 000 square miles of territory across iraq and syria were liberated from isis control according to army lt gen paul e funk ii that number means more than 98 percent of the land once claimed by the terrorist group has been returned to the people more than 4 5 million people were freed from isis oppression in 2017 since operation inherent resolve began in 2014 7 7 million people have been liberated from isis since the liberation of isis former headquarters in raqqa syria in october 2017 isis has lost substantial ground at its peak nearly 10 million were living under territory controlled by the terror group president trump is calling for a troop withdrawal from syria as well as afghanistan reportedly against advice from senior intelligence officials the senate voted monday to oppose the withdrawal of u s troops from those two countries senators voted 70 26 for the amendment sponsored by senate majority leader mitch mcconnell the measure says the islamic state group and al qaida militants still pose a serious threat to the united states and it warns that a precipitous withdrawal of u s forces from those countries could allow terrorists to regroup destabilize critical regions and create vacuums that could be filled by iran or russia rating true but time will tell what happens after the u s pulls troops from areas previously held by isis ___claim where walls go up illegal crossings go way down san diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in the country this powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings findings the evidence is inconclusive as to whether walls actually work in deterring illegal crossings when barriers were built in san diego in the 1990s and early 2000s arrests fell 80 percent over seven years from 524 231 in 1995 to 100 681 in 2002 when barriers were built in the border patrol s yuma arizona sector in the mid 2000s arrests for illegal crossings plummeted 94 percent in three years to 8 363 from 138 438 but both areas also saw sharp increases in border patrol staffing during that time making it difficult to pinpoint why illegal crossings fell so dramatically few people dispute that fences contributed to a sharp drop in crossings in cities such as san diego but barriers also pushed people into more remote and less patrolled areas like in arizona where thousands of migrants have perished in extreme heat congress main watchdog reported in 2017 that the government does not have a way to measure how well barriers work to deter immigrants crossing illegally from mexico rating inconclusive___claim lawmakers in new york cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother s womb moments before birth and then we had the case of the governor of virginia where he basically stated he would execute a baby after birth findings new york recently passed a law that would allow for abortions after 24 weeks if the fetus is not viable or when the mother s life is in danger nbc news reported abortions are not legal after 24 weeks if a pregnancy is healthy and viable previously abortions after 24 weeks were only allowed if the mother s life was in jeopardy only 1 3 percent of abortions occur in the u s after the 21st week according to centers for disease control statistics nbc news reported virginia gov ralph northam recently defended a bill that would loosen restrictions on late term abortions allowing a procedure to occur with one doctor s approval rather than three doctors which is currently required in virginia cnbc reported northam s controversial comment was that the infant would be delivered the infant would be kept comfortable the infant would be resuscitated if that s what the mother and the family desired and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother according to cnbc his spokesperson later clarified that the births he was referring to would either be nonviable or have significant fetal abnormalities rating untrueclaim year after year countless americans are murdered by criminal illegal aliens findings his assertion is at odds with several studies that found immigration does not lead to increased crime multiple studies from social scientists and the libertarian think tank cato institute have found that people in the u s illegally are less likely to commit crime than are american citizens and legal immigrants are even less likely to do so some of those findings include the following ruben rumbaut a university of california irvine sociology professor co authored a recent study that noted crime rates fell sharply from 1990 to 2015 at a time when illegal immigration spiked a march study by the journal criminology found undocumented immigration does not increase violence and academic research suggests immigrants are no more likely to commit crimes than native born americans politifact reported rating exaggerated countless means too many to be counted and most stats show that undocumented immigration does not increase violence ___ claim human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the united states and to sell them into prostitution and modern day slavery findings his administration has not supplied evidence that women and girls are smuggled by the thousands across remote areas of the border for these purposes what has been established is nearly 80 percent of international trafficking victims cross through legal ports of entry a flow that would not be stopped by a border wall trump distorts how often trafficking victims come from the southern border according the counter trafficking data collaborative a global hub for trafficking statistics with data contributed by organizations from around the world the national human trafficking hotline a venture supported by federal money and operated by the anti trafficking group polaris began tracking individual victim records in 2015 from january through june 31 2018 it tracked 35 000 potential victims of those there was a near equal distribution between foreigners on one hand and u s citizens and legal permanent residents on the other most of the labor trafficking victims were foreign and most of the sex trafficking victims were u s citizens of foreign nationals mexico had the most frequently trafficked rating mostly untruethe associated press provided this fact check ___ claim u s created 5 3 million new jobs and importantly added 600 000 new manufacturing jobs findings president trump has tracked jobs created from the day he was elected not the day he was inaugurated the washington post reported from the time trump took office approximately 4 9 million american jobs were created according to the u s bureau of labor statistics the post reported and about 436 000 of those jobs have been in the manufacturing industry trump also claimed that there are more working americans today than ever before there are more than 159 million americans working or are in search of work according to the u s bureau of labor statistics but the country s population has also grown significantly over the years vice president mike pence in 2017 made the claim that more americans are working than ever before employment numbers have nearly doubled since 1968 but population has grown proportionately over that period of time too according to the washington post citing bls statistics rating untrue there are more americans working than ever before but not due to trump s policies and trump s job tracking is misleading because he counts jobs created before he took office ___claim the u s can protect american workers by passing the u s mexico canada agreement to replace nafta findings with the new agreement u s dairy farmers will be able to send more products to canada american drug companies will be able to sell more pharmaceuticals to its northern neighbor and more auto parts will have to be made in these three countries vox also reports that the agreement does have protections for workers in all three countries but there s a level of uncertainty with the changes the trade pact could ultimately shift what vehicles are manufactured it also may help u s factory workers with competitive wages in several cases otherwise those automakers would face tariffs although not directly addressed there are still other factors at play regarding declines in dairy sales and potential effects on u s taxpayers and patients rating generally true ___claim we have unleashed a revolution in american energy the united states is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world findings the united states became the world s largest producer of crude oil the u s energy department announced in september 2018 the united states reclaimed the top spot for the first time since 1973 topping russia and saudi arabia the energy department estimates that the u s will remain no 1 through 2019 with regard to natural gas the united states has been the world s top producer since 2009 the energy department said in a may 2018 report the energy department said in may 2018 that the united states remained the world s top producer of petroleum and natural gas the latest data is for 2017 rating true___claim no issue better illustrates the divide between america s working class and america s political class than illegal immigration wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards findings one of the president s most popular assertions in his fight for a border wall is that democrats are a proponent of open borders to date there is zero evidence of democratic lawmakers ever saying they wanted illegal migrants to flow into the country freely in a june tweet senate minority leader chuck schumer of new york reiterated his attempt at a bill that included 40 billion for border security with the senator saying the funds would have been far more effective than the wall rating untrue___ claim the lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety security and financial well being of all americans findings lawless is overblown border patrol arrests a useful but imperfect gauge of illegal crossings are relatively low on the mexican border there was a 30 percent annual jump in the 2018 fiscal year to nearly 397 000 from around 304 000 but that was coming off a 46 year low last year s tally was down 76 percent from a peak of more than 1 6 million in 2000 instead of trying to elude capture many people turn themselves in to u s officials to seek asylum or other form of humanitarian protection u s border authorities fielded more credible fear claims the initial step toward asylum in the 2018 fiscal year compared to the previous time frame credible fear claims accounted for 18 percent of all people arrested or stopped at the mexican border in the latest period up from 13 percent a year earlier yes border crossings have risen sharply in the last months but that s driven by an increase in families about half of border patrol arrests are families a dramatic change from several years ago that to many suggests a humanitarian crisis but not a security crisis rating misleading___claim it is unacceptable that americans pay vastly more than people in other countries for the exact same drugs often made in the exact same place this is wrong unfair and together we can stop it findings the u s spends nearly 330 billion a year on prescription drugs according to the american medical association foundation a nonprofit that funds community health and medical education programs according to a scientific american article citing analysis done for reuters the u s pays on average three times more for the world s top 20 selling medicines compared to britain researchers also found that u s drug prices were consistently higher than in european markets six times higher compared to brazil and 16 times higher than average drug prices in india which usually has the lowest drug prices this is according to scientific american because the u s allows market competition to set prices other countries with lower prices let the government directly set the price for medication ama says that pharmaceutical companies pharmacy benefit managers and health insurance companies set the drug prices in the u s rating true___claim all americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before findings more than three fourths of american women ages 25 to 54 were working last year up from 73 3 percent of women in 2015 according to biz journals citing the wall street journal meanwhile unemployment rates for adult women went down to 3 3 percent the highest point for employment of women in the age range from 35 to 44 years was 77 7 percent in 1997 that has hovered around 74 percent since 2010 although women s workforce participation in the u s has increased dramatically over the second half of the 20th century this rate has stagnated since around 2000 women s participation rate was at 60 7 percent in 2000 based on those 16 years and older who are actively working or are in search of work the labor force participation rate was 56 8 percent in 2016 the latest year available from the u s department of labor they project participation to go down to 55 8 percent by 2024 this is also not the first time president trump has made this claim rating unclear the u s releases this data in percentages but does not show a clear picture of raw numbers ____________________________________fact checking stacey abrams responseclaim maternal mortality rates show that mothers especially black mothers risk death to give birth findings according to statistics from the centers for disease control and prevention black women do in fact face a significantly higher maternal mortality risk than other races figures from 2011 2014 show 40 deaths per 100 000 live births for black women white women experienced 12 4 deaths per 100 000 live births while women of other races comprised 17 8 deaths per 100 000 live births ratings trueclaim the republican tax bill rigged the system against working people rather than bringing back jobs plants are closing layoffs are looming and wages struggle to keep pace with the actual cost of living findings while manufacturing plants are closing in the united states the number of manufacturing jobs has grown since trump s tax bill went into effect the new york times reported wage growth has increased but not as much as it has in other periods with low unemployment rates in recent months wage growth has grown about a percentage point more than inflation rating misleading

from much higher levels trump stimulus dissipates us president trump and the previous gop controlled us congress claimed to be breathing new life into the us economy with generous tax cuts the us economy is now overheating with inflation rising above target causing the federal reserve to continue raising the federal funds rate to dampen demand as most families hardly gained from the tax changes us purchases of houses and consumer durables continued to decline through 2018 instead of investing in expanding productive capacity us companies spent much of their tax savings on a 1 1 trillion stock buy back spree in 2018 hence the positive impacts of tax cuts were not only modest but are also diminishing nearly half of 226 us chief financial officers recently surveyed believe that the us will go into recession by the end of 2019 with 82 percent believing that it will have begun by the end of 2020 wall street s biggest banks jp morgan and bank of america are also preparing for a slowdown in 2019 as if to confirm their concerns both the dow jones industrial average and the s p 500 had their worst ever december performance since 1931 when stocks were battered after the great

not preparing for the inevitable david lipton the first deputy managing director of the imf warned in early january 2019 the next recession is somewhere over the horizon and we are less prepared to deal with that than we should be less prepared than in the last although the imf had projected 3 7 percent global economic growth for 2019 in october 2018 lipton s statement suggests that the imf is likely to revise its 2019 growth forecast downward there have also been growing concerns over the continued efficacy of unconventional monetary policy since the 2008 2009 global financial crisis gfc undoubtedly countries now have less fiscal space than in 2009 and overall borrowing including public debt has risen since reaping what you sow the policy blunders since the gfc have only made things much worse the ideologically driven case for fiscal consolidation did not boost investor confidence for a robust recovery as promised despite acknowledging false claims cited to justify fiscal consolidation including the imf s admission that its early advice was based on faulty calculations there was no recommended change in policy course instead all responsibility for recovery was put on the monetary authorities who resorted to unconventional policies especially quantitative easing qe however the global economic recovery since then has remained tepid and easily reversible additional liquidity made available by qe has largely been used to buy financial assets and for speculation amplifying the financial vulnerability of emerging market economies which have experienced increased volatility governments also failed to take advantage of historically low even negative real interest rates to borrow and invest to boost productive capacity in the longer term by mainly benefiting financial asset holders qe has exacerbated wealth concentration meanwhile cuts in public services and social spending have worsened social polarization as tax cuts for the rich have failed to generate promised additional investments and jobs growth the failure to achieve a robust recovery has not only worsened the debt situation but also made lives harder for ordinary people growing polarization has also worsened resentments eroding trust undermining solidarity and progressive alternatives ethno populist jingoism undermines cooperation but lack of preparedness can hardly be due to ignorance as there have been many such predictions recently certainly more than in 2007 2008 before the gfc the cooperation that enabled co ordinated actions to prevent the great recession from becoming a depression has not only waned but major countries are now at loggerheads preventing collective action national political environments are also more hostile in europe the rise of ethno populist nationalism is making it harder to pursue eu level policies and to act together to prevent and mitigate the next financial crisis and downturn the new sovereigntists and false prophets of american exceptionalism are undermining multilateral cooperation when needed most thus a recession in 2019 may well elevate geo political tensions exacerbating the negative feedback loop for a perfect storm

measure how well barriers work to deter immigrants crossing illegally from mexico rating inconclusive___claim lawmakers in new york cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother s womb moments before birth and then we had the case of the governor of virginia where he basically stated he would execute a baby after birth findings new york recently passed a law that would allow for abortions after 24 weeks if the fetus is not viable or when the mother s life is in danger nbc news reported abortions are not legal after 24 weeks if a pregnancy is healthy and viable previously abortions after 24 weeks were only allowed if the mother s life was in jeopardy only 1 3 percent of abortions occur in the u s after the 21st week according to centers for disease control statistics nbc news reported virginia gov ralph northam recently defended a bill that would loosen restrictions on late term abortions allowing a procedure to occur with one doctor s approval rather than three doctors which is currently required in virginia cnbc reported northam s controversial comment was that the infant would be delivered the infant would be kept comfortable the infant would be resuscitated if that s what the mother and the family desired and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother according to cnbc his spokesperson later clarified that the births he was referring to would either be nonviable or have significant fetal abnormalities rating untrueclaim year after year countless americans are murdered by criminal illegal aliens findings his assertion is at odds with several studies that found immigration does not lead to increased crime multiple studies from social scientists and the libertarian think tank cato institute have found that people in the u s illegally are less likely to commit crime than are american citizens and legal immigrants are even less likely to do so some of those findings include the following ruben rumbaut a university of california irvine sociology professor co authored a recent study that noted crime rates fell sharply from 1990 to 2015 at a time when illegal immigration spiked a march study by the journal criminology found undocumented immigration does not increase violence and academic research suggests immigrants are no more likely to commit crimes than native born americans politifact reported rating exaggerated countless means too many to be counted and most stats show that undocumented immigration does not increase violence ___ claim human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the united states and to sell them into prostitution and modern day slavery findings his administration has not supplied evidence that women and girls are smuggled by the thousands across remote areas of the border for these purposes what has been established is nearly 80 percent of international trafficking victims cross through legal ports of entry a flow that would not be stopped by a border wall trump distorts how often trafficking victims come from the southern border according the counter trafficking data collaborative a global hub for trafficking statistics with data contributed by organizations from around the world the national human trafficking hotline a venture supported by federal money and operated by the anti trafficking group polaris began tracking individual victim records in 2015 from january through june 31 2018 it tracked 35 000 potential victims of those there was a near equal distribution between foreigners on one hand and u s citizens and legal permanent residents on the other most of the labor trafficking victims were foreign and most of the sex trafficking victims were u s citizens of foreign nationals mexico had the most frequently trafficked rating mostly untruethe associated press provided this fact check ___ claim u s created 5 3 million new jobs and importantly added 600 000 new manufacturing jobs findings president trump has tracked jobs created from the day he was elected not the day he was inaugurated the washington post reported from the time trump took office approximately 4 9 million american jobs were created according to the u s bureau of labor statistics the post reported and about 436 000 of those jobs have been in the manufacturing industry trump also claimed that there are more working americans today than ever before there are more than 159 million americans working or are in search of work according to the u s bureau of labor statistics but the country s population has also grown significantly over the years vice president mike pence in 2017 made the claim that more americans are working than ever before employment numbers have nearly doubled since 1968 but population has grown proportionately over that period of time too according to the washington post citing bls statistics rating untrue there are more americans working than ever before but not due to trump s policies and trump s job tracking is misleading because he counts jobs created before he took office ___claim the u s can protect american workers by passing the u s mexico canada agreement to replace nafta findings with the new agreement u s dairy farmers will be able to send more products to canada american drug companies will be able to sell more pharmaceuticals to its northern neighbor and more auto parts will have to be made in these three countries vox also reports that the agreement does have protections for workers in all three countries but there s a level of uncertainty with the changes the trade pact could ultimately shift what vehicles are manufactured it also may help u s factory workers with competitive wages in several cases otherwise those automakers would face tariffs although not directly addressed there are still other factors at play regarding declines in dairy sales and potential effects on u s taxpayers and patients rating generally true ___claim we have unleashed a revolution in american energy the united states is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world findings the united states became the world s largest producer of crude oil the u s energy department announced in september 2018 the united states reclaimed the top spot for the first time since 1973 topping russia and saudi arabia the energy department estimates that the u s will remain no 1 through 2019 with regard to natural gas the united states has been the world s top producer since 2009 the energy department said in a may 2018 report the energy department said in may 2018 that the united states remained the world s top producer of petroleum and natural gas the latest data is for 2017 rating true___claim no issue better illustrates the divide between america s working class and america s political class than illegal immigration wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards findings one of the president s most popular assertions in his fight for a border wall is that democrats are a proponent of open borders to date there is zero evidence of democratic lawmakers ever saying they wanted illegal migrants to flow into the country freely in a june tweet senate minority leader chuck schumer of new york reiterated his attempt at a bill that included 40 billion for border security with the senator saying the funds would have been far more effective than the wall rating untrue___ claim the lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety security and financial well being of all americans findings lawless is overblown border patrol arrests a useful but imperfect gauge of illegal crossings are relatively low on the mexican border there was a 30 percent annual jump in the 2018 fiscal year to nearly 397 000 from around 304 000 but that was coming off a 46 year low last year s tally was down 76 percent from a peak of more than 1 6 million in 2000 instead of trying to elude capture many people turn themselves in to u s officials to seek asylum or other form of humanitarian protection u s border authorities fielded more credible fear claims the initial step toward asylum in the 2018 fiscal year compared to the previous time frame credible fear claims accounted for 18 percent of all people arrested or stopped at the mexican border in the latest period up from 13 percent a year earlier yes border crossings have risen sharply in the last months but that s driven by an increase in families about half of border patrol arrests are families a dramatic change from several years ago that to many suggests a humanitarian crisis but not a security crisis rating misleading___claim it is unacceptable that americans pay vastly more than people in other countries for the exact same drugs often made in the exact same place this is wrong unfair and together we can stop it findings the u s spends nearly 330 billion a year on prescription drugs according to the american medical association foundation a nonprofit that funds community health and medical education programs according to a scientific american article citing analysis done for reuters the u s pays on average three times more for the world s top 20 selling medicines compared to britain researchers also found that u s drug prices were consistently higher than in european markets six times higher compared to brazil and 16 times higher than average drug prices in india which usually has the lowest drug prices this is according to scientific american because the u s allows market competition to set prices other countries with lower prices let the government directly set the price for medication ama says that pharmaceutical companies pharmacy benefit managers and health insurance companies set the drug prices in the u s rating true___claim all americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before findings more than three fourths of american women ages 25 to 54 were working last year up from 73 3 percent of women in 2015 according to biz journals citing the wall street journal meanwhile unemployment rates for adult women went down to 3 3 percent the highest point for employment of women in the age range from 35 to 44 years was 77 7 percent in 1997 that has hovered around 74 percent since 2010 although women s workforce participation in the u s has increased dramatically over the second half of the 20th century this rate has stagnated since around 2000 women s participation rate was at 60 7 percent in 2000 based on those 16 years and older who are actively working or are in search of work the labor force participation rate was 56 8 percent in 2016 the latest year available from the u s department of labor they project participation to go down to 55 8 percent by 2024 this is also not the first time president trump has made this claim rating unclear the u s releases this data in percentages but does not show a clear picture of raw numbers ____________________________________fact checking stacey abrams

items can be found in our earnings press release and in the appendix to this presentation advertisement advertisement now i d like to turn the call over to andres andres lopez chief executive officer thank you dave and good morning everyone let me begin with an overview on slide three the year 2018 offer plenty of challenges for o i yet it also offered the opportunity to display our improved leadership accountability new capabilities improved culture and ability to execute as a single integrated global enterprise altogether we are more resilient than ever before and this year is a clear demonstration of the ongoing success of our transformation are coming both external and internal challenges for instance coming to a year fx was projected to be a significant tailwind by mid year it had become a headwind for the full year we faced lower than expected issues as well a transportation strike in brazil a batch disruption in mexico very high trade in the u s and a soft wine season in europe further in 2018 we took a pause in effect to emphasize a large incremental asset maintenance program that retrofitted assets to new market needs and added incremental capacity to support growth in emerging markets as we said in prior earnings calls the region hit its 15 margin target exiting the year in all this focused effort has helped reset the region for a sustainable improvement trend going forward advertisement advertisement again o i is a resilient company it is a change company that can absorb this shocks meet financial commitments while investing to set up the drivers of future shareholder value creation and of course europe continued to grow year after year with three consecutive years of triple digit margin expansion europe is the region most advanced in our transformation they are showing us what is possible as we properly segment our markets clearly define where to play and how to win and execute effectively to achieve this high results we are applying integrated business planning with running to year time horizon focusing on product system costs and simplifying the organization to become faster and more effective in 2018 our total system cost efforts contributed over 30 million and we continued to optimize our footprint with a closure of the atlanta plant in the third quarter as jan will talk more about later we continue to make progress on managing our capital structure and especially capital allocation in fact we have initiated a quarterly dividend while continuing to buy back shares at our investor day we provided an overview of our strategy and key financial targets all of which remain on track over the next several years including our 2019 earnings and cash flow guidance before moving into a review of trends by region let me provide detailed insight into sales volume which might be of concern for investors as you can see on slide four one of our key takeaways today is that our sales volume growth profile is changing for the better in 2019 quite simply the year 2018 is distorted by multiples ins and outs that mask the solid foundation for our volume evolution over the next several years advertisement advertisement we have characterized the ins and outs as simple optics temporary one off items that will favorably impact 2019 and beyond and structural factors we have already addressed or we are close to concluding in early 2018 these factors taken together adversely impact 2018 sales volume by about 250 basis points first we have been shifting a large amount of volume from waco and monterrey to our jv with cbi this instantly reduces our top line while this generates an unfavorable year on year comparison effect that is lapping in the second quarter of 2019 it is the right thing to do for long term sustainable value creation which shows in a strong and ongoing equity earnings second our sales in 2018 were adversely impacted by 50 basis points from several discrete events that one repeat in 2019 examples include the great harvest in europe and brazil transportation strike and third we couldn t serve some incremental volume last year due to capacity constraints in europe and latin america we are addressing this latter point by adding incremental capacity we already installed lines in late 2018 in europe that are now fully operational and we are adding a few more lines this year also in the first half of 2019 we are reopening a plant in brazil and adding lines in columbia advertisement advertisement in mexico we are successfully increasing the productivity of existing assets and excellent and inexpensive way to effectively increase capacity serve incremental sales and reduce cost be mindful that our commercial organization has already tangible incremental volume commitments from customers i think it s also important to work through the cadence of volume gains over the course of the year in the bar chart on this slide let s focusing on the evolution of o i legacy volumes which will drive our reported revenue dynamics in the first quarter are clearly transitory this is the last quarter that transferred of o i volume into the jv impacts o i revenue from there you can really see the year on year increase taking all beginning in the second quarter again this is driven by the combination of various specific events unwinding the temporary factors from last year the additional capacity i mentioned and top line growth from customer contracts and favorable market trends in all despite a slight volume decline in the first quarter of 2019 we continue to see full year volume growth of 150 basis points a combination of core organic growth and new business from a strategic customers turning to slide five let s step back from just 2019 for the moment to recognize the strongest start we have made on our three year plan for volume growth the pie chart from investor day outlines the resources of our expected 10 increasing volume over the next three years the 150 basis points of growth in 2019 i spoke about on the prior slide is a combination of core organic growth and a strategic customer agreements again leading to a break from 2018 volume pattern we have also locked in most of the all elements that will increase our volumes over two years the capacity i mentioned that we are adding in europe and in colombia for instance is specifically to grow with a strategic customers together this will support an incremental 150 basis points of volume for o i as they ramp up over the next 6 to 12 months advertisement advertisement joint ventures will continue to be a key part of our volume story even if we only formally recognize equity earnings from them the jv with cbi is adding another furnace at the end of 2019 mainly fueled by higher sales volumes of the modelo brands and we also invested in nearly 50 interest in comegua in central america and the caribbean together incremental volumes are more than 350 basis points and i hope to share more news to you soon about a few other important opportunities that we are making a lot of progress on in all we are well on our way to lock in the 10 increasing volumes over the next several years now on slide five let s take in the full year 2019 in short we ambition higher adjusted earnings and adjusted free cash flow in the year fundamentally we are building upon investments we have made so far and still investing for future shareholder value these investments are in additional capacity cost reduction and more flexible and reliable assets in talent and capabilities like lower procurement and breakthrough innovation and technology on the capacity side we anticipate adding four new furnaces seven new machines and several line conversions in 2019 to support volume growth about half of the capacities has been added in the americas and the other half in europe and we ambition investing capital within our product system cost framework in order to continue to reduce our structural costs in warehousing and logistics energy and labor for instance remember as we mentioned at investor day the capital projects for both growth and cost reductions are expected to generate returns between 12 and 25 this volume growth plus continued benefits in our total system cost approach and a constructive price environment will push up our segment operating profit in absolute terms and boost our margins as well while jan will provide more financial details on how we see 2019 unfolding let me focus on the regional perspective advertisement advertisement let us start with europe on slide seven overall the gas container market in europe is healthy and continuing to grow at about 1 per year glass continues to be a very good fit with customer in this market that value premium products package in a sustainable substrate our customers local regional and global are very interested in our support for them to grow and the share of glass in their portfolio interest from customers and consumers is clearly on the rise and we have been adapting our operations and footprint to meet emerging trends especially to meet the higher value premium segment which is growing at mid single digits super premium grows even faster in fact for a few years now we have been building our capabilities both commercial and end to end supply chain to take advantage of these trends which manifest across all of our geographies let me pass on o i sales volumes for a moment underlying growth is good it is positive yet why europe shipments were essentially on par with prior year due to three specific issues that temporarily offset the positive translation of the growing segments in 2018 the full grade harvest in 2017 impacted 2018 glass container shipments which will rebound in 2019 due to a strong harvest confirmed in 2018 lower margin foods sales driven by mix management increases europe s margin that will lap in early 2019 and the lack of capacity to serve incremental sales in growing segments due to high capacity utilization supported by long term customer contracts we added several lines to existing furnaces in late 2018 that will supply incremental capacity across elected segments plus we are adding a few more lines this year separately we plan to build a brownfield furnace to meet increased demand for long term strategic customers growth this furnace intended to come in line in early 2020 is expected to generate a return on capital of more than 12 advertisement advertisement taking together we anticipate o i europe will generate above market growth in 2019 based on the confluence of key factors favorable market conditions incremental volume through growth of a strategic relationships and o i selectively adding capacity to meet customer demand in key segments as we mentioned at investor day these opportunities are expected to generate solid returns on invested capital at the same time we remain squarely focused on reducing the structural costs these our sustainable efforts with best in class processes practices and tools now deeply embedded in o i s dna in fact in the chart on the right you can see how europe is doing more with less net volumes having moved too much over the past few years and as we explained this is about to change so the profit expansion has really been driven by commercial efforts on price and mix management and continued benefits of total system costs as we look through year end and into 2019 and beyond we expect further gains in europe in volumes cost reduction and profitability supporting our objective of continuous margin improvement turning to americas on the slide eight fx continues to be a considerable headwind while overall market trends support low single digit volume growth over time that said 2018 was a challenging year for volume in the region most of which i have already touched on however let me walk through dynamics in the fourth quarter in particular which saw an abnormally high year on year decline in volume advertisement advertisement volumes in the fourth quarter in the u s were down around 10 5 percentage points is due to a shift in production to a jv with cbi which will begin to lap in the second quarter of 2019 5 percentage points is due to ongoing megabeer dynamics one customer to one customer harvest impacted by two hurricanes and one customer that temporarily stop purchases and is resuming normal purchases in 2019 for 2019 we anticipated return to year over year growth in the u s in the second quarter we have been focusing on our commercial and operational efforts on premium products across all categories and on securing customer growth as a result we expect broad based growth in non beer categories will overtake the current megabeer downdraft in brazil we continue to see very strong market dynamics across all categories especially in premium products in the first nine months of the year our shipments in brazil were up double digits by the third quarter though we were already straining our capacity we have been running very hard and then the brazil transportation strike preventing us from building up our inventories which only strained further as such we actually saw a year on year decline in shipments in the fourth quarter not because of the market is very healthy but because of supply chain constraints of course this is why we are presently restarted a plant in the country and leaning on our plants in the americas leveraging our integrated supply chain capabilities to meet ongoing growth in brazil even though we are still likely to be somewhat capacity constraint safe volume growth in brazil is expected to be up low single digit for the full year 2019 despite this transitory issues there were many bright spots the jv with cbi continues to perform exceptionally well the fourth furnace came in line in the first quarter of 2018 and help reach equity earnings from the jv higher year on year the fifth furnace is projected to be on line by the end of 2019 volumes in mexico were strong in the back half of 2018 driven by solid demand trends and supply through increased increasing productivity volumes grew modestly in the andean countries and the strength utilization rates this justifies the new lines we are adding there in early 2019 again volume dynamics price kept pace with cost inflation including higher freight charges and the fx impact on raw materials and energy supplies across the americas the commercial and end to end supply chain organizations are collaborating well to meet customer needs and reduced cost overall we expect the americas will generate higher sales profit and margin in 2019 and beyond let s finish the regional review with asia pacific on slide nine the region improved significantly over the course of 2018 and undertook incremental activity in the asset advancement program starting in the fourth quarter of 2017 similar to what we did in previous years in europe and the americas with very positive impact over time as expected the region exceeded 2018 with a 15 margin an improvement of over 800 basis points year on year 2019 will bring a year with much improved assets that are a better fit to market with increased productivity and increased capacity to support growth with a focus on reducing a structural costs and capitalizing on growth opportunities apac s financial profile will continue to improve we see it evolving similar to europe over time where their transformative actions have driven a steady profit increases and margin expansion for the last several years that said in the first quarter asia pacific has engineering activity consistent with the companywide rebuild program and during the first half of the year the region will be working up relatively high cost import in inventory driven by the prior year s asset activity for apac this translating to a full year 2019 with low double digit margins which we then expect to expand by 100 basis points per year for several years and now i d like to turn the call over to jan to discuss our financial review and outlook jan bertsch senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks andres turning to slide 10 i want to first remind you of our key metrics which we presented at investor day last november we ve updated the slides for 2018 actuals in short we achieved our previous commitments certainly not without some challenges and we re excited to move forward to the next phase we see 2019 as a pivotal year for the company s transformation we have momentum and are on track to achieving growth margin expansion cash generation and return cash to shareholders over this three year plan before jumping forward though let me review the eps bridges for 2018 on slide 11 beginning with the full year on the chart on the left entering the year we thought fx would be a tailwind of about 0 10 however as we look back on the full year the strengthening u s dollar led to a 0 02 headwind for earnings a 0 12 delta to expectation and that s just on translation it s even higher when considering the fx impact on cost inflation which would add another nickel or so so on a constant currency basis adjusted eps for full year 2018 was up 0 09 with half of this coming from the business and the other half from our investments and share buybacks as we look at the reconciliation for the fourth quarter on the right most of the full year commentary holds for the quarter currency was 0 01 headwind while segment operating profit was higher net interest flip to a headwind as a result of higher variable rates while the tax rate for the full year was essentially flat there was a benefit in the fourth quarter due to the favorable impact of closed audits and statute expiration moving on to cash flow on slide 12 we delivered adjusted free cash flow of 362 million right in the middle of our guidance range cash flow from operations was up 10 compared with prior year driven not only by higher segment operating profit i just mentioned but also by lower cash restructuring payments working capital in total contributed cash of 15 million in 2018 which reflects a lower impact from inventory due to softer sales at the end of the year as i anticipated on the last earnings call we gave back some of the increase in cash flow from operations through a higher level of capex activity in 2018 up about 25 million compared with prior year you may recall that we had a high level of outstanding capex payables at the end of 2017 due to activity late in the year we paid that down early in 2018 in turn the change in capex payables was larger in 2018 as reflected on the statement of cash flows still the average level of capex activity for the past two years has been about 500 million in line with our expectation that said please see the last page of the appendix for more details on that on slide 13 let me refresh the 2019 adjusted eps guidance i presented at investor day last november the temporary items didn t change which taken together with rebase adjusted earnings to just under 2 60 a share we spoke in great detail at investor day about our strategic initiatives and the benefits we expect in the coming years specifically in 2019 we expect a 150 basis points of volume growth both organic and from strategic customers andres mentioned the solid price cost dynamics structural costs will also benefit from our total systems cost initiatives and much improved asia pacific cost base regarding strategic initiatives we will see a small contribution from our nearly 50 interest in the central america jv already in the first quarter variable interest rates are high year on year and we expect a higher effective tax rate we therefore anticipate a headwind coming from non operational items in 2019 and lastly we have become more active in repurchasing shares which we expect will add 0 10 to 0 15 to eps in 2019 depending on the pace of the buyback in all we have a good line of sight to 3 per share in adjusted earnings for 2019 and while there are many moving pieces to achieve it we see about half coming from business performance and half from share buyback on the next slide let me pause on how we see eps unfolding this year because it s different than last year due to several specific reasons which i believe street estimates have not fully incorporated the chart on the left shows how three key factors are expected to flip from a headwind in the first quarter to the tailwinds in the second half of the year fx moved quite a bit in the second quarter of 2018 so it should not be a surprise that its adverse impact is mainly isolated in the first half of this year based on current fx rates of course andres already discussed volumes both production and sales which are linked he outlined our capacity ads and how we will resume year over year growth in the second quarter that s what s reflected here now let s move to the chart on the right to drill down on just the first quarter partially offsetting the downdraft from fx and volumes we see some benefit coming from ongoing total system cost savings and apac gains overall non operational items are likely to be about flat so while we see eps down a nickel or so in the first quarter on a year over year basis we have tangible reasons for our confidence of higher earnings through the rest of the year shifting back to cash generation on slide 15 we are affirming our investor day target for 2019 adjusted free cash flow at 400 million similar to our adjusted earnings we provided additional assumptions in 2019 in the appendix so i ll just touch on a few the expected increase in earnings should flow naturally into cash generation the growth opportunities will allow us to work off the excess inventories from 2018 this coupled with more focus on increasing inventory efficiency should allow inventory to become a source of cash in 2019 we are presently forecasting lower cash restructuring payments in 2019 although this is contingent upon footprint optimization and other opex reduction efforts regarding capex we expect it will again be around 500 million as discussed in detail during investor day maintenance capital will be a bit lower and strategic capital for growth and cost reduction will be a bit higher there is always some variability in cash generation fx rates have a big impact and will be assured properly pays our capex expenditure throughout the year turning to slide 16 we have borrowed another investor day slide to highlight how we are managing our debt portfolio we continue to proactively issue non u s dollar denominated debt to hedge against foreign currency fluctuations at the end of 2018 only half of our debt was denominated in u s dollars whereas it was three quarters just three years ago we are also very deliberate about the overall level of floating rate debt and again in which currencies we hold it at the end of 2018 more than half of our floating rate exposure was to euribor which has not been on the increase like libor rate regarding our overall leverage we plan to repay debt and reduce our leverage ratio in 2018 leverage was relatively flat due to investing in our shares and investments and joint ventures we are confidently working toward a level of three times leverage by year end 2021 even if our net leverage ratio may fluctuate slightly year over year on slide 17 you can see the progress we have made in reducing our pension benefit obligation on a year over year basis discount rates were up which lowered plan liabilities compared with prior year for plan asset however the relatively weak market performance in 2018 more than offset the positive effect of the discount rates resulting in an overall increase in unfunded pension liabilities that said the risk mitigation activities we ve engaged in over the past several years have cut in half the effect that we would have experienced otherwise the company has focused on annuitizations and taking the liabilities completely off our books in order to reduce our financial risk and we will continue to focus on doing more looking into 2019 based on the rate of return assumptions we expect pension expense as well as cash contributions to be relatively flat to 2018 let s review the chart on the right as i d like to highlight this occasionally to show that using eps is the gauge of our business performance does not fully reflect the underlying strength of our business fundamentals because eps is partially masked by non cash pension accounting guidelines this is the reason we continue to remind the investment community about the approximate 0 35 non cash charge in pension expense related to the amortization of actuarial loss that is weighing on our earnings throughout the year and beyond we will continue to work on reducing our pension liability so that is a smaller source of volatility on company earnings now let s turn to slide 18 and discuss another win which we ve been managing the company s risk profile over time the fundamental metrics that we monitor related to our legacy asbestos liability continues to progress in the right direction the key drivers of the company s 1958 exit from this business and the resulting declining demographic trends while o i has been actively defending these demographic trends this is not the only reason we ve seen this decline the company has long practiced risk management in this area still the environment is volatile with discrete pockets of litigation perhaps even in adjacent spaces potentially creating substantial risk as i mentioned at investor day we have been actively pursuing some of these proactive risk management strategies to protect the effect of the demographic trends we believe the combination of several developing factors including changes in the law and procedure renewed attention to dockets of older non mesothelioma cases and deteriorating litigation dynamics in specific jurisdiction have the potential to put upward pressure on claim values and volumes given the situation the company added 125 million to the accrual and implemented and accelerated disposition strategy to act as a hedge against these potential pressures for perspective the 2018 charge is within 15 of the original lifetime estimate we booked in 2015 the execution of this strategy will likely result in cash payments averaging approximately 150 million in each of the next two years they are expected to drop to the 60 million to 80 million range in 2021 and then declines consistent with historic demographically driven trend should continue based on our current assessment of the landscape we anticipate the accrual in 2021 will not be more than 250 million de risking asbestos protecting the effect of the demographic trends and managing risk in the litigation environment our areas of key focus and we will continue to take actions to protect the company from downside risk as we hope you can see from the previous few slides with a backdrop of declining legacy liabilities we view 2019 as a continuation of our practice of returning cash to shareholders and de risking the balance sheet generally speaking we anticipate that about half of our free cash flow and half of net divestiture proceeds over time will be returned to shareholders first we will be paying our dividend in fact next week the quarterly dividend is a clear sign of the board s confidence in our three year plan and as of december 31 2018 we had 550 million remaining in the share repurchase program approved by the board we expect about 200 million of that will be purchased during 2019 and the remaining through 2021 as for remaining funds we plan to allocate them among deleveraging funding strategic investments that have returns in excess of our weighted average cost of capital and repurchasing shares and now i d like to turn the call back over to andres andres lopez chief executive officer thanks jan i trust you can see that we will continue to build and what we have accomplished over the past few years not just stabilizing the business but elevated it and invest in capabilities to grow it further as i described in investor day in the next three year planning horizon there are several value platforms that will unlock shareholder value the first is grow and expand o i s readiness to leverage newly developed capabilities and translate several market trends into grounded ascribable top line growth opportunities will help us grow and expand with the strategic customers next is the structural cost improvement we believe product system cost is a best in class approach to a structural cost reduction and will contribute to our bottom line for years to come our third area of focus is sustainability even the very real global traction of sustainability o i will exert even more focus on this ph mentioned going forward we ve also made substantial progress on innovation and developing breakthrough technology the magma pilot is running well in our streator facility we are on a schedule successfully and timely clearing important milestones the progress is very encouraging exciting and has generated tangible interest by key stakeholders we will continue to provide updates in every earnings call even if we like this one and jan just mentioned capital allocation and how the risk in o i s balance sheet coupled with increasing the return of cash to shareholders will drive value to our owners for years to come now that we have completed our remarks we are happy to take your questions questions and answers operator operator instructions your first question comes from the line of mark wilde from bmo capital markets your line is now open mark wilde bmo capital markets analyst good morning andres good morning jan andres lopez chief executive officer good morning mark mark wilde bmo capital markets analyst i wondered if you could just give us a little more color on sort of the volume in particular regions around the americas in the fourth quarter and what you re expecting in 19 and then also given the declines you mentioned in the u s whether you have any plans for potential footprint moves over the next year or two andres lopez chief executive officer okay so the situation in the americas is as follows we see solid demand across the region with the exception of megabeer so we continue to see the same decline rate we talked about before we already factored the current decline rates now beyond that everything else we see it quite solid now if we talk about the u s and when we look at all product categories in the market all of them are offering opportunities for growth and as you know we have been focus on those categories for three years now and we ve been adapting the footprint in those three years too and now is the moment to start joining even more the benefits of that work that we did over the last three years when you look at particular areas that are growing quite fast for us products like comegua it is growing double digit and it s been sustained so it s quite solid we re seeing a double digit growth in carbonated rtd teas too and we re seeing situations like one very important food customer that moved their product some time ago to pet coming back to glass this year 2019 so that s quite a successful story there so bottom line u s megabeer declines run rates are already reflected in forecast as we noted today other categories growth and we ve been focus on this for three years and that s why we are confident we re going to see this performance in 2019 as we move forward when we look at brazil very strong demand across all categories premium beer demand is growing really fast it s 14 of the total business in brazil at this point customer s one glass to be par of that portfolio for premium beer so they re urging us to able to supply enough for them and as we reflected in the opening remarks we were able to grow really well from q1 through q3 in brazil at double digit rates now we reached a high utilization of capacity in brazil toward the end of the year inventories were very low so what happen is we ended up moving from growth of double digit growth in the first three quarters to decline in the fourth quarter and that s why you see these fourth quarters so low for the americas because a driver of growth which has very solid demand in the country couldn t grow in that particular quarter and then u s as i explained before i can t give more color on that now brazil is going to receiving capacity as we mentioned which is going to just make this country to rebound back to growth and that s all in the plant now you see and it s low q1 in particles of that because we are deploying capacity in brazil and in colombia and that obviously cost some money but also has some ramp up and that s impacting the quarter operation when we look at mexico a very solid demand too we re seeing growth opportunities in premium product specifically beer premium tequila and nabs and we re emphasizing productivity in that country we started last year we ve been successfully increasing output and we continue to do so so that s going to help us support incremental demand this year and we will also have the production that we lost last year from keratos ph issues in 2019 so that s going to support our growth in starting in the second quarter you re going to see that we re going to have positive rates in mexico now when we look at colombia is having a very strong demand in beer premium and we are adding lines in this country too and we expect that to be operational as we go into the second quarter and third quarters so that s why we re confident we re going to have this growth impacting the americas in 2019 altogether we see single digit growth for the americas in 2019 operator your next question comes from the line of george staphos from bank of america merrill lynch george staphos bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi everyone good morning thanks for all the details and congratulations on the progress andres i wanted to take jan a step back perhaps we appreciate all the color on volume and the outlook and your confidence there if you go back a few years ago one of the mantras with owens illinois was around stability and bringing stability back to your organization both from an operating standpoint and the volume standpoint one can you comment a little bit in terms of how you feel you progress there relatedly when we look at the americas there was about 48 million negative year on year variance in operations i m assuming a lot of that was the one off stuff that you talked about on a quarter call just now but how much of that was manufacturing maybe was under your control that you could have done a better job on and hopefully we will improve on the future and then around stability when we look at cash flows in asbestos jan can you give us a bit more color in terms of why it s prudent to proactively pull these claims forward as we think about the stability in cash flow thank you andres lopez chief executive officer okay so the george when we look back we said achieving the stability in operations and volume was very important for us and i think we made very good progress it s quite solid so we re counting on that stability to build our growth that we are seeing into a future i think the work that we ve done with customers where is creating a stability in the volume side i m going to talk about the americas in a minute for the fourth quarter and the operations are more and more stable over time and obviously that s a long term effort however our stability today is significantly higher than before now what that cost is we have another chance and we had that the chance over the last couple of years to focus on building this new demand and when we were in a day we propose that we will grow 10 in the following three years and that s because we have very single opportunities very specific opportunities in a specific segment already identified that we ve been working with our customers for quite a while that we are starting to close so when i look at the position we have when we where in i day based on that stability and the growth momentum at that point in time we were confident and we were optimistic and i would tell you today even more confident and more optimistic because we made substantial progress on the agreements we needed to put in place to be able to secure the demand for the following three years now when i look at the fourth quarter the demand in the fourth quarter wasn t good and it was a disappointing quarter but it has a quite a few things in there so it s driven by the americas within the americas half of it is with the united states half of that is the transfer of that volume to the jv which is going to lap now so we won t have that issue with that comparison anymore we already have megabeer which we already know it is already factoring our forecast at the run rate we know now the other portion is those specific issues with the customers that was exposed to hurricanes that lost their demand altogether and that other customers that is stop by but is resuming purchases so two very specific issues very unfortunate but they don t define the demand pattern for us going forward and the other situation is brazil we were going very strong for the year and it become a decrease year on year for the fourth quarter all the reason for that is capacity so we need to implement capacity in brazil we already have plans for that we re making very good progress we are about to start that plant that we mentioned before and we continue to evaluate alternatives to driving a capacity up in brazil jan bertsch senior vice president and chief financial officer and george let me clarify here i think if you re talking about the operating costs in the americas that you see on i think it was slide 27 of negative 48 million costs that is cost inflation but the trade cost is relatively flat so the driver of decline is volume which andres just mentioned let me go to the second part of your question when you were talking about asbestos but before i do that i just want to mention one other thing we talked andres talked about the stability we also tried to put a lot of emphasis over the last several years in the stability of our balance sheet and whether it was renegotiating our bank credit agreement or changing our debt profile to reduce the exposure the currencies spreading out the maturities or annuitizing more pensions that we have it was all with the goal of developing a stronger balance sheet and balancing our risk reducing our risks of the company another piece of that of course is asbestos and to get into the last part of your question it s probably best if i set some context for the broader topic of asbestos to really answer your question thoroughly all of the fundamental metrics that we monitor related to our legacy asbestos liability continued to progress in the right direction i mean the key drivers of the company s 1958 exit from this business and the resulting declining demographic trends and from 1948 through 1958 this company owned an installation business that produced and sold materials containing asbestos and then in 9th april of 58 the company sold the business unit and therefore the time frame appropriately reflects the mortality of current and expected claims but it s 30 years of asbestos liability on litigation rather it shown us its volatile in many external variables outside the company s or any other asbestos defendants controls can do and will affect the litigation environment this is why another key driver of o i s progress that its long standing strategy to proactively manage emerging risk so as to protect the favorable demographic trends and one example of such a strategy would be the use of administrative claims handling agreement at our investor day last november i mentioned that a couple of these risks that were materializing such as changes in the law increases in judicial resources unfavorable jurisdictional dynamics and even new bankruptcies as you know bankruptcies by other prominent asbestos payers create additional risk for companies like ours who remain in the litigation as we have for many years when we gain more information on these risks we believe it s prudent to implement strategies to mitigate them for some of these matters accelerating the disposition of some claims is a good way to hedge against the future risks and volatility like any other type of hedge the near term cost maybe a bit higher than average but operate to prevent inflationary factors in the future that s a situation with our strategy here we ll have some higher near term costs that need to adjust our accrual to account for them but to keep a proper perspective the accrual increase like i mentioned there s about a 15 adjustment to the estimated lifetime liability recorded back in 2015 so let s also keep proper perspective on the lifetime estimate even though we ve booked a projected lifetime asbestos accrual on our balance sheet for the past three years the litigation environment continues to be active and as we ve mentioned evolving factors could develop in a way that would cause us to adjust our asbestos reserve this is why we ve long disclosed that the point estimate of the lifetime accrual could be higher importantly we think that this charge and the resulting higher payments will make over the next last couple of years to dispose of these claims is appropriate to incur now to mitigate a greater risk that may develop in the future of course we ll continue to closely monitor changes in the asbestos environment and may implement additional de risking strategies in the future to mitigate new risk before they grow as i mentioned at investor day we still anticipate that our lifetime asbestos accrual will be less than 250 million at the end of the three year period ending in 2021 and our expected annual payments in 2021 will be in the 60 million to 80 million range we anticipate and then likely continue to decline thereafter consistent with the demographic effect so i hope that helps with your question operator your next question comes from the line of chip dillon from vertical research your line is now open chip dillon vertical research partners llc analyst yes good morning and thanks again for all the details just a quick question about the asbestos situation i do know that you had a slide from investor day that talked about the potential to do the de risking accelerated payments i don t recall though or maybe i just missed this that there would likely to be an increase to the cumulative reserve which was 125 million and so my question is was that increase something that you either missed and or you maybe we just didn t that you knew was going to happen or is it something that as a result of the recent developments since november and then as you go out how high is your confidence level that we won t have to see another increase in the reserve jan bertsch senior vice president and chief financial officer okay so chip at investor day we were in the midst of executing our strategy to mitigate future risk but we hadn t finished negotiation and with much of that behind us we have more clarity about the asbestos related payments over the next few years so that s why we think about 150 million on average for the next two years before falling back to a lower level of 60 million to 80 million for the last year of our three year range and then declining thereafter makes sense and it s consistent with the demographic trends as we see them today of course we ll continue to review our asbestos accrual and liabilities on an annual basis are more frequent if we need to just like we mentioned back in 2015 and have done ever since but i hope you see this as a more aggressive way to continue to tackle this very difficult situation and to help hedge against future increases and to be able to overall reduce the risk of this company which has been a strong focus especially in the last several years operator your next question comes from the line of debbie jones from deutsche bank your line is now open debbie jones deutsche bank securities inc analyst hi good morning andres lopez chief executive officer good morning debbie jones deutsche bank securities inc analyst i have a question on your guidance for europe you re referring to modest growth to europe in the region i was just wondering if you could talk about some of the buckets that i m sure you ve got fx as a negative and volume growth has been at the positive but how should we model in the cost side of things i mean those specifically in q1 can you elaborate on the comments that you made around some of the temporary items andres lopez chief executive officer so let me just make a comment on q1 and one of the major reasons why we re seeing a number that is below prior year and that is we are installing capacity and as you would expect that comes along with the spending and we got to hire people we got to train people we got to have expenses to put the capacity in place and then we got a ramp up so that s part of what we re seeing and based from an operational perspective impacting q1 which in fact is very positive as you look at the following quarters but we got to go through that quarter to be able to get to the higher performance quarters so from an operational perspective that s what s taking place jan bertsch senior vice president and chief financial officer yes and debbie maybe i can share a few numbers with you and when we look at europe for the first quarter we see a pretty balanced price cost spread maybe slightly positive we see from a volume standpoint things pretty on track versus prior year fx looks like it s in the first quarter going to be a headwind in europe i would say 5 million 6 million or so is what we re looking at based on the january 31st rates when we compare it to last year you know you see the big movement between the euro in that comparison area but that s where i see the biggest changes overall really a relatively flat for europe in the first quarter operator your next question comes from the line of gabe hajde from wells fargo your line is now open gabe hajde wells fargo securities llc analyst yeah good morning thanks for taking the question andres lopez chief executive officer good morning gabe hajde wells fargo securities llc analyst i was wondering if you could comment at all andres just i guess bigger picture on your expectation for volume given where we are sort of in the economics like war climate any slowdown potential from any consumers or travel related spend for some of the higher end i guess liquors and stuff like that you have a sense for maybe where customer inventories are and how that could impact sales if in fact something materializes on the slowdown side andres lopez chief executive officer well at this point in time what we re seeing is across the world when we look at our end users the only segment really that chose weakness and decline is megabeer in the united states which we have fully factor when we talk with customers they continue to see a good outlook for the businesses we haven t seen any change in that regards and we continually test that we see a premium product category to be the driver of our growth going forward this is a category of products that has proved to be quite resilient even when you have some downturns and we tested that in brazil we ve been able to grow in that premium beer over the last three years or four years even though the economy was in a very bad situation i highlighted the megabeer before it s important to have in mind that even though that subsegment declines it is only 5 of the total o i volume now at the same time premium beer grows very fast in the united states and we are very well positioned to serve that segment as you know because of the jv that we have in constellation brands so in all i think demand is quite healthy around the world we haven t seen any change on that the primary focus for us right now is to be able to finalize some of the initiatives and agreements that we ve got to have in place some of them are already finalized we continue to be focused on the orders and we are focused on the execution around installing capacity which we have started last year in europe with the addition of lines and we continue this year with addition of lines in brazil in europe with the addition of capacity in colombia with increasing productivity in mexico so that s where we ve got to go right now operator your next question comes from the line of tyler langton from jpmorgan your line is now open tyler langton jp morgan analyst hey good morning thank you jan i had a question on the divestiture i think you mentioned on investor day that you expected net proceeds i think 400 million to 500 million through 2021 so could you just talk about how that process is going and what you re seeing in general andres lopez chief executive officer yes so we continue with the same expectation we identify the potential businesses that we can deal with or part of businesses that we can deal with to do that and we are just moving forward with all the steps that you would expect we got to go through so we re actively executing on that jan bertsch senior vice president and chief financial officer yes so let me just add tyler since you asked about that i think that s an important part of the conversation related to the cash for the company because we anticipate based on where we are today and in our plan to reach adjusted free cash flow of 400 million for the company this year we ve talked about asbestos being 150 million 160 million payment this year so that reduces the free cash flow of about 240 million if we just add the cash component of these divestitures on just for sake of conversation we have about 440 million available to invest in the company deleverage or return value to our shareholders and based on our plan we would take about half of that over 200 million to return value to the shareholders through a combination of a dividend which will cost us about 30 million this year and then the couple of hundred million of share buybacks that we talked about so you can clearly see the merits of kind of tying our proceeds from the divestitures with our share buyback plan it s an important component of it and we re taking a very seriously and then on the other side we have another couple of hundred million plus to pay for minority dividends about 20 million for the year and then our investments in joint ventures is specifically like our joint venture with constellation brands as well as rmbc and then the remaining component of that 150 million 170 million we will primarily use for deleveraging or strategic capital for the company that yields very solid returns on capital so there is a balanced approach of investing in the business paying down debt reducing our leverage and returning value to the shareholders operator your next question comes from the line of edlain rodriguez from ubs your line is now open edlain rodriguez ubs equity research analyst thank you good morning guys andres lopez chief executive officer good morning edlain rodriguez ubs equity research analyst just one quick one on the eps guidance i mean should we make anything about the slight change in tone from 3 plus to approximately 3 that has anything changed at all since the investor day plus or minus jan bertsch senior vice president and chief financial officer i m glad you asked that question i thought it came up several times in the commentary last evening the answer is no please don t overanalyze that when i read it several times i was actually surprised our goal is to hit that 3 handle obviously we d like to be a bit higher than 3 we are working on everything we can to be that way but we re sticking right now with our 3 a share so please don t look any deeper into the minor wording change that was made between last november and last evening in the release operator your next question comes from the line of scott gaffner from barclays capital your line is now open scott gaffner barclays capital inc analyst thanks good morning andres lopez chief executive officer good morning scott scott gaffner barclays capital inc analyst andres jan just a quick question jan going back to the thoughts on share buyback a couple of things there can you talk about in the context of de risking the balance sheet as you mentioned right 240 million of free cash flow after you subtract out the pension sorry the asbestos payment so first would be should we think about the share buyback being more weighted toward the second half once you finally finished some of these divestitures the second part being should we think about in divestitures and share buybacks being more neutral to earnings on a go forward basis and then just lastly on the capital spend in europe you said 12 return on capital for brownfield are you getting later in the cycle and seeing lower return on capital from new investments on a go forward basis thanks jan bertsch senior vice president and chief financial officer let me first talk about the share buybacks i mean we already did in january about 40 million of share buyback so we ve started this year we also have about an equivalent amount last december so you think about it that way we probably have close to 160 million more to do the balance of this year we always said that we would time it and make sure that it made sense with other demands on cash in the company including capex and everything else in the proceeds of the from our divestiture so we will continue to try to match that up saying that andres mentioned that we are on target and very clearly looking at our open land that we have available for sales as well as some other divestitures that we re looking at and so i think we are on target this year to execute that entire 200 million and i think it s a little bit premature to give you by quarter how much that is but we ll share that as we go forward and you also asked about is that more neutral to earnings going forward and we do have a program as of the end of last year of 550 million on share repurchases so if we execute 200 million of those this year you can think that we ll have a remaining balance to do through the next couple of years of our plan as well i think we have good return in excess of 12 for our brownfield in europe and it clearly adds value over time we look at each one of these opportunities that we have standing on its own as well as in conjunction with what else we re doing in the region for the company and so will continue to be very prudent and very disciplined on making decisions that make sense for the company operator your next question comes from the line of ghansham panjabi from baird your line is now open ghansham panjabi robert w baird co analyst hi good morning andres and jan andres lopez chief executive officer good morning jan bertsch senior vice president and chief financial officer good morning ghansham panjabi robert w baird co analyst good morning i guess going back to europe 3q 2018 volumes were a bit sluggish i believe relative to your initial expectation i guess the 4q 18 sort of benefit from any sort of catch up i m just trying to understand the volume increase and then related to that just looking at europe on a full year basis volumes were basically flat how are we at this point where our capacity constraint in europe from your vantage point and then just separately jan comegua how is that going to be accounted for in the p l thanks so much jan bertsch senior vice president and chief financial officer okay andres lopez chief executive officer so we started some lines some additional lines in europe late last year so they help at the very end and they re helping across the full 2019 we got a little bit of improvement in wine demand at the very end when the 2018 harvest was confirmed to be very strong that you will expect that the dynamics in the market change from that point on so we saw some improvement due to that and we continue to focus on the premium segments they have opportunity for growth so as we make capacity available we are confident we re going to see improvement in demand in europe and that s why we put in place this or we re planning to put in place this brownfield that will start operation in q1 2020 jan bertsch senior vice president and chief financial officer okay and you also asked about comegua that s a non consolidated joint venture so we ll see the equity earnings of that will be reflected in the americas segment operating profit operator your last question comes from the line of arun viswanathan from rbc capital markets your line is now open arun viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst hey guys good morning thanks for taking the question andres lopez chief executive officer good morning arun viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst just wanted to go back to the americas obviously we ve been experiencing these declines on u s last year for a while just wondering i know i think you obviously reduce that exposure do you think you kind of found a steady state on other categories where last year ph continue to decline and if so what kind of percent of the portfolio would that become and what were the other categories become thanks andres lopez chief executive officer so the megabeer in our assumptions continues to decline and continues to decline at the current run rate we re not assuming that that s going to stop anytime soon it could but is difficult to predict so our assumption is it continues to go down and as you know we ve been working on the other categories of products for three years now both commercially and from a capacity standpoint so i think we re going to see more and more opportunities materializing as we go through 2019 now we got to take into consideration the volume that we are gaining through a jv because we are in fact with larger presence of o i containers in the u s market when you put together what we sell within the u s made with u s capacity plus the jv so we think the growth of the other categories and when you consider the joint venture too it s going to have the total u s market for us growing through 2019 david johnson treasurer and vice president investor relations thank you everyone that concludes our earnings conference call please note

washington ap president donald trump laced his state of the union speech with puffed up numbers and partial truths tuesday as he hailed an economic miracle warned of human traffickers flooding across the border and appeared to place afghanistan in the middle east instead of where it is asia trump used information selectively in claiming a drop in drug prices not seen in half a century and promised the nation it would see bountiful benefits from a trade deal that hasn t been approved might not be and in any event makes only modest changes from the status quo for her part democrat stacey abrams reflected a recent and misleading talking point by her party when she slammed the trump administration for choosing to cage children at the border ignoring a practice also employed by the obama administration to hold migrant children in facilities with chain link fencing here s a look at some of the statements from state of the union night
fact check trump s 2019 state of the union address all americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before all americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before all americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before all americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before washington the associated press and abc news are fact checking remarks from president donald trump s state of the union speech here s a look at some of the claims we ve examined middle east wars trump our brave troops have now been fighting in the middle east for almost 19 years the facts trump exaggerated the length of the wars in iraq and afghanistan the war in afghanistan began in october 2001 in the aftermath of the sept 11 attacks the invasion of iraq was in march 2003 the u s has been at war for a bit more than 17 years also he refers to fighting in the middle east iraq is in the middle east but afghanistan is in south and central asia food stamps trump describing progress over the last two years nearly 5 million americans have been lifted off food stamps the facts the number of people receiving food stamps actually hasn t declined that much government data show there were 44 2 million people participating in the supplemental nutrition and assistance program in 2016 before trump took office in 2018 there were 40 3 million people participating in snap that s a decline of 3 9 million not the 5 million that trump talked about the number of people participating in the snap program peaked in 2013 and has been going down since that time trump s last budget proposed cutting snap by 213 billion over 10 years the administration also has been pushing to give states more flexibility in implementing the program including tightening work requirements for recipients border wall trump these border agents will tell you where walls go up illegal crossings go way way down san diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in our country in response a strong security wall was put in place this powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings simply put walls work and walls save lives the facts it s a lot more complicated than that yes border patrol arrests in the san diego sector plummeted 96 percent from nearly 630 000 in 1986 to barely 26 000 in 2017 a period during which walls were built but the crackdown pushed illegal crossings to less patrolled and more remote arizona deserts where thousands died in the heat arrests in tucson in 2000 nearly matched san diego s peak critics say the water balloon effect build a wall in one spot and migrants will find an opening elsewhere undermines trump s argument though proponents say it only demonstrates that walls should be extended the government accountability office reported in 2017 that the u s has not developed metrics that demonstrate how barriers have contributed to border security tariffs trump we recently imposed tariffs on 250 billion of chinese goods and now our treasury is receiving billions of dollars the facts this is misleading yes money from tariffs is going into the federal treasury but it s largely coming from u s businesses and consumers it s not foreign countries that are paying these import taxes by cutting a check to the government his reference to money coming into the treasury now belies the fact that tariffs go back to the founding of the country this revenue did not start with his increased tariffs on some goods from china tariffs did produce 41 3 billion in tax revenues in the last budget year according to the treasury department but that is a small fraction of a federal budget that exceeds 4 1 trillion the tariffs paid by u s companies also tend to result in higher prices for consumers which is what happened for washing machines after the trump administration imposed import taxes trade nafta trump our new u s mexico canada agreement or usmca will replace nafta and deliver for american workers bringing back our manufacturing jobs expanding american agriculture protecting intellectual property and ensuring that more cars are proudly stamped with the four beautiful words made in the usa the facts it s unlikely to do all those things since the new agreement largely preserves the structure and substance of nafta in one new feature the deal requires that 40 percent of cars contents eventually be made in countries that pay autoworkers at least 16 an hour that is in the united states or canada but not in mexico it also requires mexico to pursue an overhaul of labor law to encourage independent unions that will bargain for higher wages and better working conditions for mexicans still just before the agreement was signed general motors announced that it would lay off 14 000 workers and close five plants in the united states and canada philip levy senior fellow at the chicago council on global affairs and a trade official in republican president george w bush s white house says president trump has seriously overhyped this agreement jobs and manufacturing trump we have created 5 3 million new jobs and importantly added 600 000 new manufacturing jobs the facts 5 3 million jobs have been added since president trump s election in november 2016 but he did not become president until january 20 2017 nearly 4 9 million jobs have been created since february 2017 including 454 000 manufacturing jobs the unemployment rate at 4 percent is at levels last seen in late 1999 and 2000 the uptick in the unemployment rate in the most recent jobs report was likely because of the government shutdown the unemployment rate in november 2018 was 3 7 percent which was a level last seen in 1969 according to the bureau of labor statistics african american unemployment is at historic lows at 6 8 percent but it has ticked up in recent months after hitting an all time low of 6 percent toward the end of last year similarly the hispanic unemployment rate at 4 9 percent has ticked up from recent lows of 4 4 percent toward the end of last year wages trump wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades and growing for blue collar workers who i promised to fight for they re growing faster than anyone else thought possible the facts this is an unsupported statement because the data on hourly wages for private workers only goes back to 2006 not decades but data on wages for production workers date back to 1939 and trump s claim appears to be unfounded average hourly earnings for production and non supervisory workers are up 3 4 percent over the past year according to the labor department those wage gains were higher as recently as early 2009 and they were averaging roughly 4 percent before the start of the great recession in late 2007 there are other ways to track wage gains and those don t work in trump s favor either adjusted for inflation median weekly wages rose just 0 6 percent in 2018 the gains in weekly wages were 2 1 percent in 2015 limiting legal immigration trump i want people to come into our country in the largest numbers ever but they have to come in legally the facts this is false trump has repeatedly sought to reduce the number of people legally allowed into the united states last fall president trump set the lowest cap in the history of the refugee admission program permitting only just 30 000 a year in president obama s last year he proposed a cap of 110 000 amid the height of the crisis in syria in fiscal year 2017 the trump administration allowed the second fewest refugees ever trump also won a battle in the supreme court to restrict all forms of travel and immigration from 7 countries five of which have muslim majority populations just last week the administration began selectively enforcing a new policy at the southern border that requires migrants seeking asylum to wait in mexico while their applications are processed he has also called for the elimination of the diversity visa program which typically awards up to 50 000 immigration visas each year minority unemployment trump african american hispanic american and asian american unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded the facts what he s not saying is that the unemployment rates for all three groups have gone up since reaching record low levels black unemployment reached a record low 5 9 percent in may but rose to 6 8 percent in january latino unemployment fell to 4 4 percent its lowest ever last october and asian unemployment fell to a record low of 2 2 percent in may but latino and asian unemployment also have increased in part because of the government shutdown which elevated unemployment last month the african american rate is still nearly double the jobless rate for whites at 3 5 percent the most dramatic drop in black unemployment came under president barack obama when it fell from a recession high of 16 8 percent in march 2010 to 7 8 percent in january 2017 drug price decline trump as a result of my administration s efforts in 2018 drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years the facts this is mostly spin while president trump is correct that drug prices dropped in the last year and that hasn t happened since 1972 the drop was less than1 percent drug prices and spending remain at historically high levels including for drugs like insulin which more than doubled in price since 2012 and many of trump s efforts to bring down those costs haven t been enacted yet according to the consumer price index that dip is 62 percent looking at data collected from december 2017 to data from december 2018 last fall an associated press analysis examined the list prices for some 26 000 brand name drugs and found 96 price hikes for every one price cut what trump can point to in favor of consumers is an aggressive push by the u s food and drug administration during his administration to approve generic drugs white house advisers in an october 2018 report estimated that the recent approval of generic drugs has resulted in 26 billion in savings for consumers that would have otherwise had to choose brand name drugs among those approved under trump was the first generic version of epipen the lifesaving auto injector used to treat emergency reactions epipen injectors went from costing 100 in 2009 to 600 in 2016 and while out of pocket spending for prescription drugs remained mostly flat in 2017 trump s first year in office out of pocket physician and hospital costs increased many of trump s ideas to drive down drug costs haven t taken effect yet and are still winding their way through the rulemaking process one proposal would upend the usual system of drug rebates when people buy prescription drugs through medicare or medicaid the plan would prohibit drug makers from offering discounts or rebates to pharmacy benefit managers that administer drug plans instead the manufacturers would be encouraged to provide rebates directly to consumers democrats pushed back insisting they think the plan will raise costs for consumers another proposal announced last fall is to limit what it pays for certain drugs for medicare recipients by tying the price for some drugs to prices paid overseas the measure which would be phased in over several years would only apply to certain types of drugs via medicare that are administered by a physician the drug industry fought back and said the administration was discouraging innovation human trafficking trump human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the united states and to sell them into prostitution and modern day slavery the facts his administration has not supplied evidence that women and girls are smuggled by the thousands across remote areas of the border for these purposes what has been established is nearly 80 percent of international trafficking victims cross through legal ports of entry a flow that would not be stopped by a border wall trump distorts how often trafficking victims come from the southern border according the counter trafficking data collaborative a global hub for trafficking statistics with data contributed by organizations from around the world the national human trafficking hotline a venture supported by federal money and operated by the anti trafficking group polaris began tracking individual victim records in 2015 from january through june 31 2018 it tracked 35 000 potential victims of those there was a near equal distribution between foreigners on one hand and u s citizens and legal permanent residents on the other most of the labor trafficking victims were foreign and most of the sex trafficking victims were u s citizens of foreign nationals mexico had the most frequently trafficked countless murders trump year after year countless americans are murdered by criminal illegal aliens the facts there is no national database that compares crimes committed by immigration status making it difficult to confirm or dispute the president s assertions what available studies do show is that overall crime rates are lower among immigrant groups than they are among native born americans according to ice data over the past two years there were nearly 4 000 arrests made for people both convicted of and simply charged with homicide among immigrants released into ice custody for deportation but the homicides could ve been committed over any number of years more generally the president s speech referenced 266 000 arrests of undocumented immigrants with criminal records over the past two years a number that mainly includes immigrants who were convicted of crimes in the past and perhaps served jail time before they were released into ice custody prescription drug prices trump americans pay vastly more than people in other countries for the exact same drugs often made in the exact same place the facts this is true a government study has found that medicare pays more for some drugs than other wealthy nations last fall the government released a study that found medicare the federally run health care program for seniors paid more than other industrialized countries for physician administered drugs while the precise amount varied by product the study found that prices charged by those manufacturers are 1 8 times higher in the u s than in other countries trump has proposed that medicare only agree to pay costs based on cheaper prices paid by other nations it s one of several proposals he s made in recent months in a bid to drive down costs although that proposal wouldn t take place for another year or so the drug industry had criticized the approach contending that the money paid goes toward ground breaking research that benefits americans first according to one industry group americans have access to cancer medicines on average two years earlier than in countries like the united kingdom germany and france industry executives also say it s not fair to compare what the u s pays for drugs compared to people in countries with socialized health care systems economy trump in just over two years since the election we have launched an unprecedented economic boom a boom that has rarely been seen before there s been nothing like it an economic miracle is taking place in the united states the facts the president is vastly exaggerating what has been a mild improvement in growth and hiring the economy is healthy but not nearly one of the best in u s history the economy expanded at an annual rate of 3 8 percent last spring and summer a solid pace but it was just the fastest in four years in the late 1990s growth topped 4 percent for four straight years a level it has not yet reached under trump and growth even reached 7 2 percent in 1984 almost all independent economists expect slower growth this year as the effects of the trump administration s tax cuts fade trade tensions and slower global growth hold back exports and higher interest rates make it more expensive to borrow to buy cars and homes tax cuts trump we passed a massive tax cut for working families and doubled the child tax credit the facts the president said that his tax plan provides tax cuts to working families and while that s true in the short term multiple analyses found wealthier americans and corporations will receive the largest benefit over the long term the gop tax plan reduces taxes on average for all income groups initially including middle class americans the average household will see a tax cut of 1 610 in 2019 according to the tax policy center a nonpartisan think tank overall most americans eight in 10 according to the center will pay lower taxes this year but multiple independent analyses concluded that wealthier americans and corporations will receive the largest benefit over the long term in general higher income households receive larger average tax cuts as a percentage of after tax income the center found on average in 2027 taxes would change little for lower and middle income groups and decrease for higher income groups most of the individual income tax provisions will expire after 2025 unless congress acts the corporate tax rate cuts are permanent women in workforce trump in prepared excerpts all americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before the facts of course there are more women working than ever before but that s due to population growth and not something that trump can credit to any of his policies the big question is whether a greater percentage of women are working or searching for a job than at any point in history and on this count women have enjoyed better times women s labor force participation rate right now is 57 5 percent according to the labor department the rate has ticked up recently but it was higher in 2012 and peaked in 2000 at roughly 60 percent energy trump in prepared excerpts we have unleashed a revolution in american energy the united states is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world the facts true if we means trump and his recent predecessors it s not all to trump s credit the government says the u s became the world s top natural gas producer in 2013 under barack obama s administration the u s now leads the world in oil production too under trump that s largely because of a boom in production from shale oil which also began under obama abc news contributed to this
