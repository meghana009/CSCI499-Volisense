mar 21 2019 alasdair macleod note this article is not and must not be construed as investment advice it is analysis based purely on economic theory and empirical evidence the global economic outlook is deteriorating government borrowing in the deficit countries will therefore escalate us treasury tic data confirms foreigners have already begun to liquidate dollar assets adding to the us government s future funding difficulties the next wave of monetary inflation required to fund budget deficits and keep banks solvent will not prevent financial assets suffering a severe bear market because the scale of monetary dilution will be so large that the purchasing power of the dollar and other currencies will be undermined failing fiat currencies suggest the dollar based financial order is coming to an end but with few exceptions investors own nothing but fiat currency dependent investments the only portfolio protection from these potential dangers is to embrace sound money gold the global economy is at a cross road with international trade stalling and undermining domestic economies some central banks notably the european central bank the bank of japan and the bank of england were still reflating their economies by supressing interest rates and the ecb had only stopped quantitative easing in december the fed and the peoples bank of china had been tightening in 2018 the pboc quickly went into stimulation mode in november and the fed has put monetary tightening and interest rates on hold pending further developments it is very likely this new downturn will be substantial the coincidence of the top of the credit cycle with trade protectionism last occurred in 1929 and the subsequent depression was devastating the reason we should be worried today is stalling trade disrupts the capital flows that fund budget deficits particularly in america where savers do not have the free capital to invest in government bonds worse still foreigners are now not only no longer investing in dollars and dollar denominated debt but they are suddenly withdrawing funds according to the most recent us treasury tic data in december and january these outflows totalled 257 2bn at this rate not only will the us treasury need to fund a deficit likely to exceed a trillion dollars in fiscal 2019 but the us markets will need to absorb substantial sales from foreigners as well in short america is going to face a funding crisis to have this funding problem coinciding with the ending of credit expansion at the top of the credit cycle is a lethal combination as yet unrecognised as the most important factor behind both american and global economic prospects the problem is bound to emerge in coming months while today s trade protectionism is less vicious than the smoot hawley tariff act america s drawn out trade threats today are similarly destabilising the top of the credit cycle in 1929 was orthodox its principal effect had been to fuel a speculative stock market frenzy in 1927 29 this time the credit bubble is proportionately far larger and its implosion threatens to be even more violent governments everywhere are up to their necks in debt as are consumers personal savings in america the uk and in some eu nations are practically non existent the potential for a credit economic and systemic crisis is therefore considerably greater today than it was ninety years ago bearing in mind the dow fell just under 90 from its 1929 peak the comparison with these empirical facts suggests we might experience no less than a virtual collapse in financial asset values however there is an important difference between then and now during the wall street crash the dollar was on a gold standard in other words the price effect of the depression was reflected in the rising purchasing power of gold this time no fiat currency is gold backed so a major credit economic and systemic crisis will be reflected in a falling purchasing power of fiat currencies the finances of any government whose unbacked currency is the national pricing medium are central to determining future general price levels just taking the us dollar for example the government s debt to gdp ratio is over 100 in 1929 it was less than 40 at the peak of the cycle the government should have a revenue surplus reflecting underlying full employment and the peak of tax revenues in 1929 the surplus was 0 7 of estimated gdp today it is a deficit of 5 5 of gdp in 1929 the government had minimal legislated welfare commitments the net present value of which was therefore trivial the deficits that arose in the 1930s were due to falling tax revenues and voluntary government schemes enacted by presidents hoover and roosevelt today the present value of future welfare commitments is staggering and estimates for the us alone range up to 220 trillion before adjusting for future currency debasement other countries are in a potentially worse position particularly in europe a global economic slump on any scale let alone that approaching the 1930s depression will have a drastic impact on all national finances tax revenues will collapse while welfare obligations escalate some governments are more exposed than others but the us uk japan and eu governments will see their finances spin out of control furthermore their ability to cut spending is limited to that not mandated by law even assuming responsible stewardship by politicians the expansion of budget deficits can only be financed through monetary inflation that is the debt trap and it has already sprung shut on minimal interest rates for a temporary solution governments can only turn to central banks to fund runaway government deficits by inflationary means the inflation of money and credit is the central banker s cure all for everything inflation is not only used to finance governments but to provide the commercial banks with the wherewithal to stimulate an economy an acceleration of monetary inflation is therefore guaranteed by a global economic slowdown so the purchasing power of fiat currencies will take another lurch downwards as the dilution is absorbed that is the message we must take on board when debating physical gold which is the only form of money free of all liabilities gold can only give an approximation of the loss of purchasing power in a fiat currency during a slump because gold s own purchasing power will be rising at the same time between 1930 and 1933 the wholesale price index in america fell 31 6 and consumer prices by 17 8 these price changes reflected the increasing purchasing power of gold because of its fixed convertibility with the dollar at that time therefore the change in purchasing power of a fiat currency is only part of the story however the comparison between purchasing powers for gold and fiat currency is the most practical expression of the change in purchasing power of a fiat currency because the choice for economic actors for whom gold has a monetary role is to prefer one over the other it is an ongoing process about to accelerate chart 1 shows how four major currencies have declined measured in gold over the last fifty years the yen has lost 92 4 the dollar 97 42 sterling 98 5 and the euro 98 2 prior to 2001 the euro price is calculated on the basis of its constituents technical and market analysis of gold s position the ultimate bankruptcy of currency issuing governments likely to be exposed by the forthcoming slump will be reflected in another lurch downwards in currency purchasing powers it should become apparent as time progresses that the price of gold in fiat currencies will continue to rise the reasons are not yet clear to the consensus of portfolio investors and speculators but it is likely that the more prescient among them will begin to realise that in the event of a significant recession slump or depression the dollar price of gold will rise substantially for the moment they are likely to concentrate on timing using technical analysis rather than thinking through economic concepts chart 2 illustrates the current technical position the current rally commenced from a record oversold condition on comex the selloff was consistent with extreme selling exhaustion indicating a major turning point the net managed money position on comex indicates the gold contract is still moderately oversold however the april contract is running off the board which means that some 200 000 expiring contracts are still to be sold stand for delivery or rolled forward by the end of this month march this suggests a little more consolidation may be needed before gold advances to attempt a challenge on the 1350 level the 55 day and 200 day moving averages recently completed a bullish golden cross with the price above both signalling a bullish trend a retest of the 55 day ma occurred at the beginning of this month and is normal if as the chart suggests a triangle pattern is emerging it is an ascending triangle which is bullish an ascending triangle has a flat top and a rising base admittedly the top line declines slightly but not enough to put it in the class of symmetrical triangles where the eventual break out direction is less certain it is possible for the gold price to trade another down leg within the confines of the triangle before making its final breakout to the upside in which case the gold price might decline towards the low 1200s before making its upwards break defining the gold market and vanishing liquidity following its peak in september 2011 gold found a bottom at 1047 in december 2015 that was followed by a 31 rally to 1375 in july 2016 since when gold has established a triangular consolidation pattern last august the price sold off to 1160 becoming oversold to record levels that established the second point of a rising trend marked by the lower solid line in february the gold price mounted a challenge to the upper parameter of the consolidation range before retreating to test established support at 1280 1305 shown by the pecked lines there is a good chance that another attempt to break through the 1350 level will take place soon and that it will succeed the following bullet points sum up this positive case the possibility that the ascending triangle might need longer to play out leads to the common technical recommendation to wait until gold breaks through the 1350 1365 level before buying for the next leg of the bull market chart 3 gives a longer term perspective of gold s valuation it is of the gold price adjusted by mine supply and for changes in the fiat money quantity simply put fmq is the sum of cash bank deposits and savings accounts and also bank reserves held at the fed it is the total amount of fiat money both in circulation and available for circulation in 1934 dollars deflated by the increase in the fiat money quantity gold has returned to the extreme lows seen on only two previous occasions the first was when the london gold pool failed in the 1960s followed by the collapse of the bretton woods agreement in 1971 at that time the decline in the fmq adjusted price of gold since 1934 was fuelled by monetary expansion until a point was reached which could go no further this led to an explosive recovery taking the price of gold in adjusted terms back to 1934 levels the realisation that the dollar faced the prospect of uncontrolled price inflation forced the fed to raise interest rates so that the banks prime rate exceeded 21 in december 1980 this was sufficient to prevent the gold price from further rises and physical gold then became the collateral of choice for a developing carry trade central bank sales were designed to signal the demonetisation of gold and deter buyers they leased significant quantities of bullion for the carry trade which increased supply synthetically and drove the gold price back to the same extreme valuation lows seen in the 1960s this was 2000 2002 after rallying from these extreme lows to a nominal high in september 2011 an increase in derivative supply coupled with the banking and investment establishment retaining an increasingly rosy view of fiat currencies have been instrumental in returning gold to the valuation lows of the 1960s and 2000 2002 it is in this context that the outcome predicted in chart 2 should be considered if as argued earlier in this article america and the rest of the world faces a global slump a premium for physical gold is likely to arise relative to the systemic risks of holding gold substitutes such as derivatives and even physically backed etfs in that event a return to the 1934 price level for gold in fmq adjusted terms before any further monetary dilution implies a nominal gold price of about 24 000 this conclusion does no more than indicate an upper target for the price of gold adjusted for historic monetary inflation if as seems likely a developing credit crisis occurs as a consequence of today s events the quantity of fiat money in issue will rise significantly from current levels as government debt is monetised therefore given the extreme undervaluation of gold suggested by chart 3 it is hard to see how the price of gold measured in dollars can go much lower the gold market has three basic elements to it there is an underlying stock of approximately 170 000 tonnes increasing at about 3 000 tonnes a year it is impossible to define how much of the total above ground stock is monetary gold not least because jewellery in asia is bought as a store of monetary wealth and is used as collateral against loans however if we are to classify asian jewellery as non monetary gold then monetary gold in the form of bars and coin is thought by many experts to represent between thirty and forty per cent of the total assuming a median estimate of 35 this is 60 000 tonnes of which 33 760 tonnes is stated to be in national reserves this leaves an estimated 26 240 tonnes of investment gold in public hands worth 1 1 trillion much of this can be regarded as being in long term storage for market purposes the physical market on its own is relatively illiquid secondly there are regulated futures and options markets the most important of which is america s comex currently there are about 520 000 comex contracts of 100 oz each outstanding which are worth a total of 68bn options on futures total a further 220 000 contracts which are impossible to notionally value being puts and calls at varying strike prices third there are unregulated otc derivatives mostly forward contracts in london the last bank of international settlements statistics estimated total gold forwards and swaps were valued at 419bn over six times the size of comex in addition there were 149bn of otc options the liquidity is broadly confined to comex london forwards and other otc media these are all derivatives with minimal physical settlement taking place consequently the price of physical gold is not determined by the marginal supply and demand for bullion but almost entirely reflects financial factors in the banking system if financial market conditions return to an approximation of the 1929 32 period for the reasons described earlier in this article there is likely to be a banking crisis or at the very least a serious dislocation of financial markets therefore it is possible that at the same time investment funds and private individuals seek to gain portfolio exposure to the gold price they will be doing so while the means of doing so are contracting or even disappearing altogether an outcome of this sort hinges on the depth and pace of economic deterioration time will tell as to whether the current rapid deterioration in the economic outlook goes on to replicate the 1929 32 precedent but it is getting increasingly difficult to argue against it happening in which case the gold price could rise rapidly due to its current undervaluation a shortage of monetary gold outside central bank reserves systemic disruption of paper markets and a renewed pace of monetary inflation before the fiat money investment community realises what is happening portfolio switching from fiat to gold if the combination of both a developing credit and trade crises leads to a modern version of the 1929 32 global economic slump financial asset values will fall heavily but this time there is the additional factor of a renewed acceleration of monetary inflation which at some point might offer some support to stock prices at least in nominal currency terms in every hyperinflation an index of stock prices can perform well on this basis but adjusted for the currency s loss of purchasing power stock prices actually suffer substantial losses that assumes of course the rest of the world s economy is broadly stable which is almost certainly not going to be the case in our scenario additionally the inflationary conditions of a fiat currency s twilight moments involve the market imposing increasing levels of time preference on everything including bond prices therefore the discount between market prices and final redemption values widens dramatically governments and other borrowers face a near impossible funding task unless they are prepared to pay increasingly higher interest coupons unlike the experience of the great depression when interest rates reflected those of gold this time bond yields paid in fiat currencies will rise and continue rising this leads towards a different progression of notable developments compared with 1929 32 an approximate sequence of how these might evolve is described as follows 1 evidence of a looming recession becomes increasingly apparent central banks respond in their time honoured way by easing monetary policy and replacing stalling credit creation with extra base money government bond prices rise as they are seen to be the least risky investment in an uncertain economic outlook and equities rally after an initial sell off at the same time lending bankers observe increasing risk in commercial lending and respond by quietly withdrawing loan facilities from all but the largest manufacturers of goods and producers of services this appears to approximate to the current situation 2 with unsold inventory increasing industrial production is reduced and rising numbers of workers are laid off analysts revise their forecasts for corporate profits downwards and the number of corporate failures increases bond dealers adjust their expectations of government borrowing and quantitative easing is reintroduced by central banks to ensure government bonds can be issued at suppressed interest rates at this stage investors face a worrying combination of falling equity prices reflecting a deteriorating economic outlook combined with unexpected monetary inflation in the form of qe 3 foreigners liquidate us investments in order to sell dollars the reserve currency this appears to have started early and repatriate funds to support their base operations bond dealers facing a glut of government bond issues expect bond yields to continue to rise stock markets slide and with it is a growing realisation that the recession is turning into a wealth destroying slump 4 as the markets demands for increased time preference undermine all debtors finances investors increasingly avoid bonds and equities abandoning hope of any recovery in financial asset prices hedging into gold mines and gold etfs gathers pace and the purchasing power of gold continues to rise measured against both fiat currencies and against the commodity and energy complex 5 having fallen behind the time preference demanded by markets central banks are reluctantly forced to raise overnight interest rates to protect the currency and bring price inflation under control they have no choice but this is seen as capitulation by investors residential mortgage costs increase sharply driving consumers into negative equity as property prices suffer from forced selling in countries where the home has become the middle class s principal asset the effect on consumer spending is devastating governments end up bailing out or bailing in lenders while trying to moderate mortgage interest costs 6 by now the gold price measured in unbacked currency is beginning to discount a continuing acceleration in monetary inflation the gold price will be at multiples of current levels in all currencies including the dollar 7 the sense of crisis escalates and mounting bad debts at the banks raise the prospect of a systemic banking crisis despite depositor protection schemes depositors begin to take steps to reduce their bank balances with the facility to encash bank deposits being strictly limited alternatives to deposits in insolvent banks will be in high demand these will be gold silver and other perceived stores of value cryptocurrencies could come into their own as an escape route from holding deposits in the banking system 8 those who attempt to escape systemic risk by exchanging bank balances for alternatives are simply passing bank deposits to the vendors this is fine so long as vendors are happy to accept the systemic risk if not then prices of alternative stores of value must rise to compensate a classic flight out of money into anything else develops and is made more urgent by the lack of a cash alternative 9 the currency rapidly loses purchasing power and it will be moving into its end of life government bonds will have lost nearly all their value measured in gold and governments will still be accelerating inflationary financing because bond financing without the central bank buying them will not be possible during this process with few exceptions financial assets will face annihilation a further problem is failing banks are the custodians of stock entitlements with few being directly registered in the beneficial owners names at best this leads to a temporary loss of ownership at worst it provides the means for confiscation an intense bear market destroys wealth at some stage investors will begin to realise their portfolios are almost totally exposed to fiat currency risk the belief that inflation hedges such as overweight equities and underweight bonds offer protection against extreme monetary inflation will be disproved investors will need a radical new approach using sound money as their performance criteria this is cannot be an inflation index which is likely to become increasingly manipulated by statistical method it has to be gold instead of rapidly depreciating fiat currency the problem investors will then face is mathematical there are probably less than 30 000 tonnes of monetary gold excluding asian jewellery in private hands today worth about 1 1 trillion according to the boston consulting group in 2015 there were 71 4 trillion of portfolio assets of which 36 1 trillion were in us dollars with the monetary gold held outside government reserves being about 1 5 of portfolio assets how do you replace non performing fiat currency dependent assets with a portfolio designed with sound money in mind this is why the return to sound money will destroy the west s financial system driving the purchasing power of gold higher measured against commodities goods and services while that of paper fiat moves towards worthlessness the destruction of financial wealth could easily compare with 1929 32 and if it wipes out fiat currencies will be even worse the removal of cash as an effective escape route for investors fleeing systemic risk turns systemic risk directly into a collapsing preference for money relative to goods gold cryptocurrencies and the rest one it starts it could happen quite quickly see

can putin fix russia s sputtering economy women wave russian flags to mark the fifth anniversary of russia s annexation of crimea in sevastopol on march 16 2019 getty blatant disrespect for russia s government can now land you in jail under a new law the country s legislature has passed worried that russians are increasingly inclined to criticize the state or protest against it the government is tightening the screws public support for the kremlin and for russian president vladimir putin has slumped in recent months the government s popularity had spiked after russia annexed the ukrainian territory of crimea in 2014 catapulting putin s approval rating to near 80 percent where it remained for nearly five years yet that political magic is wearing thin over the past six months putin s rating has crashed true the most recent poll by the levada center an independent russian polling organization suggests that 64 percent of russians continue to approve of putin s work as president yet that is the lowest number since 2013 when putin returned to the presidency amid anti regime protests russia s citizens are gloomy about politics because of the country s sputtering economy russia has had a miserable past five years in 2014 two external shocks buffeted the country first oil prices collapsed falling from above 100 per barrel in 2014 to barely 30 per barrel in early 2016 slashing russia s largest source of export revenue second the united states and europe imposed tough financial sanctions that forced russian firms to reduce investment and raised borrowing costs across the economy as the ruble tanked investment and consumption also declined at the time russia s leaders could with some justification blame outside forces for the economic downturn russia has no control over oil prices which are set in a global market and sanctions were the result of confrontation with the west if you approved of the annexation of crimea as most russians did then you could not blame putin for sanctions western financial restrictions were the cost of reasserting russia s stature on the world stage now five years have passed since the imposition of the first round of sanctions and the collapse of the price of oil and for most russians things have scarcely improved oil prices are roughly twice their 2015 lows the economy is growing again albeit slowly yet typical russians don t feel any better off in fact they feel worse off adjusting for inflation household disposable incomes have declined each of the past five years it s no wonder that russians are beginning to ask questions each year has been worse than the one before the government isn t helping last year it rammed through a controversial pension reform that will raise the retirement age from 55 to 60 for women and from 60 to 65 for men over the next several decades with society rapidly aging and its pension system underfunded the russian government wasn t wrong to think that something had to change yet most russians rely primarily on their government pensions for retirement income so this change will hit hard and unlike sanctions pension hikes cannot be blamed on nato russians across the country were unhappy with the announced increase in the retirement age some even took to the streets though the number of protesters wasn t especially large the kremlin followed the pension change with a hike in the value added tax from 18 percent to 20 percent the cost of which will be promptly passed on to consumers this too will hit household incomes making russians feel poorer still in his annual address to russia s federal assembly in late february putin assured russians that he would make things better he mentioned foreign policy but the bulk of the speech focused on domestic reforms more poor families will get aid to support children he promised families with disabled children will receive a few thousand extra rubles per month those with multiple children will be given housing subsidies and lower interest rates on mortgages and any family with three or more kids will get tax cuts on houses and landownership it was a speech intended for struggling families evidence that the kremlin s political advisers and spin doctors understand that they need to offer something more than geopolitical confrontation but if the message was on target the substance was not adding up the pledges in putin s speech finance minister anton siluanov predicted that the promises would cost 100 billion to 120 billion rubles or approximately 1 5 billion per year divide that by russia s population approximately 140 million and putin s new handouts amount to slightly more than 10 per person per year even in a country such as russia where salaries are far lower than in the united states this is small beans contrast the kremlin s promise of a 1 5 billion increase in social spending for example with the country s 390 billion in foreign exchange reserves or consider the state owned energy company gazprom which reported 15 billion in profits in the first nine months of 2018 or the 58 russians who according to forbes each have personal fortunes bigger than the spending boost that putin promised to really understand how underwhelming putin s spending promise is however compare it with the revenue this year s tax hike will raise around 8 9 billion according to the finance ministry in other words russia s government is decreasing household incomes via a substantial tax hike giving back a small portion of that revenue through new social spending and hoping that nobody notices the kremlin is pocketing the rest in any case whether the kremlin will follow through on its new spending promises is far from clear putin made a similar series of pledges in 2012 around the start of his previous presidential term when he promised that he would hike salaries but not increase the retirement age five years later many of these vows remained wholly unfulfilled this time fulfilling promises will be even harder russia s provincial governments which are often charged with implementing social programs are in many cases now heavily indebted after five years of economic stagnation the kremlin knows of course that its promises aren t that impressive but russia s elite believes it has little room for maneuver as the country s confrontation with the west intensifies most of russia s leaders believe that the united states plans to increase its financial pressure the u s senate is considering a bill that would sanction the issuance of new russian sovereign debt which in practice would limit russia s capacity to run a large budget deficit russia has long prepared for this type of foreign pressure with austere fiscal policies but without a growing economy the populace will find government austerity more painful than before the only other option for the kremlin is to improve the business climate in ways that attract more russian and foreign investors such moves however would also threaten the kremlin s ability to control russian domestic politics in many cases the russian government views foreign investors as a threat one major american investor in russia michael calvey was imprisoned in february on dubious charges and improving the environment for domestic investors means reducing the power of the monopolistic state owned firms firms through which the kremlin can exert power at home given these constraints russia s government believes its best option is to hunker down the kremlin knew that tax hikes and pension cuts would make people unhappy but amid a financial war with the west russian leaders ask what choice does their country have expect more promises from the state therefore but don t expect much to change the kremlin s style of rule at home and confrontation with the west abroad have boxed it in over the next five years russia s economy will barely grow the country s government forecasts predict given such dismal projections in the absence of a new foreign crisis to rally around russians will probably judge the kremlin s policies to be stale but stale can be stable even if putin s approval rating slips further new legislation tightening penalties for speech critical of the government is raising the cost of dissent the risk of fines or arrest will dissuade most people from protesting against the dismal economic outlook russians are sadly used to economic stagnation and ineffective government and they are unlikely to be offered an alternative anytime soon this article was originally published on

after the much more dovish than expected fed economic projections and shockingly poor eurozone manufacturing data it looks like major world economies are at the brink recessions german 10 year bund yield turned negative for the first time since 2016 and it was as high as 0 12 during the week us yield curve between 3 month and 10 year is now inverted with 10 year yield in free fall while the market reactions might be exaggerated sentiments are undoubtedly very fragile at the moment in the currency markets yen and swiss franc ended as the strongest ones of falling global yield and risk aversion that s not much a surprise on the other hand canadian dollar was the weakest ones partly because wti crude oil failed to sustain above 60 and retreated but more importantly it was argued that canadian economy is facing more intense than expected moderation in the economy if us would be in recession canada will only be worse sterling was the second weakest while euro was the third despite very dovish fed dollar ended the week mixed only let s have a recap some of the key events last week first fed took 2019 rate hike off table revised down growth and job outlook fed left federal funds rate unchanged at 2 25 2 50 as widely expected the statement offered no surprise at the committee will remain patient regarding future adjustments to interest rates fed also decided to terminate the balance sheet reduction plan in september this year the shocks came from the all round deeply dovish economic projections according to median projections there will be no more rate hike in this year indeed within the forecast horizon there is at most one hike to 2 6 by end of 2021 which would be lower than longer run rate at 2 8 gdp forecasts for 2019 and 2020 are revised down unemployment rate for 2019 2020 and 2021 are all revised up core pce inflation projections were left unchanged overall the projections suggested that fed is rather worried about growth outlook high level us china trade talks to resume but tariffs will likely stay long talking about growth outlook a key risk is prolonged trade tensions and tariffs us trade representative robert lighthizer and treasury secretary steven mnuchin will visit china on march 28 29 to resume high level trade talks chinese vice premier is expected to travel to washington in early april ahead of that there were reports that china is pushing back against us demands on intellectual property protection as well as other major issues while such reports were unconfirmed they re still consistent with the fact that there has been basically no leaked information on the core issues including ip theft forced technology transfer subsidies on state owned enterprises and enforcement of the agreement on the other hand trump openly said that he s considering to leave tariffs on chinese products there for a substantial period of time even if a deal is agreed trump got his point that china had a lot of problems living by certain deals also keeping the tariffs there could force china to deliver what were agreed however without us stopping the punitive tariffs china will certainly not agree to correcting its unfair trade practice while lifting its own retaliatory tariffs at the same time the us won t have it all that is even if there is an eventual agreement and china will speed up it s reforms tariffs from both sides will stay there for much longer and as we pointed out before tariffs are the cannons of trade war and they are bombing both economies everyday right now believe it or not other world economies including germany and japan who were on brink of recessions have been dragged down by slowdown in global trade growth us china tariffs on each other are hurting the world too and will continue to do so for a long period of time even if there is finally a deal as trump indicated recession risks in eurozone in particular germany intensified the impact of trade on eurozone manufacturing sector is rather evident eurozone pmi manufacturing dropped to 47 6 in march a 71 month low offset by resilience in services pmi composite just dropped 0 6 to 51 3 markit noted that the data pointed to just 0 2 growth in q1 more worryingly forward looking indicators suggested that growth could be even weaker in q2 a reversal in services could drag eurozone into contraction looking into the steam engines both manufacturing and services in france were already in contraction germany pmi manufacturing even dived to 44 7 a 79 month low services in germany was resilient but even so pmi composite dropped to 51 5 it should be noted that germany narrowly avoided recession with 0 growth in q4 but risks didn t dissipate since then the poor set of pmi data serve german 10 year bund yield negative for the first time since 2016 brexit cliff edged delayed for two weeks news on brexit were relatively positive at the european council meeting in brussels eu approved a short brexit extension if no brexit deal is approved by the house of commons in uk the extension will be until april 12 when uk has to indicate a way forward if a brexit deal is approved the extension will be until may 22 but the cliff edge was just delayed uk still still have to make a decision between a deal no deal a long extension or revoking article 50 the above discussed developments all played a hand in the financial markets last week the collective impacts have been rather negative most accurate us recession indicator triggered for the first time since 2007 one of the most important development was yield curve between 3 month and 10 year is now inverted after steep decline in long yields it happened for the first time since 2007 this part of the yield curve is seen as having strong predictive power of recessions indeed san francisco fed had published a economic letter information in the yield curve about future recessions detailing some research on the topic more importantly the technical development in 10 year yield suggests that the worst is yet to come tnx dropped sharply to close at 2 455 last week both long term channel support and 38 2 retracement of 1 336 to 3 248 were taken out decisively tnx was also rejected below 55 week ema before adding to its bearishness in the relative bullish case fall from 3 248 is merely correcting the up trend from 1 336 but even so the case is now open for deeper decline to 61 8 retracement at 2 066 which is close to 2 034 support and 2 0 psychological level futures pricing in more than 50 chance of fed cut in 2019 with dovish fed projections and rising risk of recession in the us traders raised their bet on a fed rate cut by the end of the year drastically fed fund futures now imply 57 9 chance of having one rate 25bps cut or more by december meeting to 2 00 2 25 it was just around 30 a week ago and 11 a month ago dollar index staying in consolidation medium term bullish dollar index s performance was not too back last week despite dipping to 95 74 it quickly recovered to close at 96 65 overall outlook is unchanged that consolidation pattern from 97 71 might extend in case of another fall we d expect strong support from 94 09 38 2 retracement of

yuho nishimura director of the international department at the genron npo and a ggf 2030 fellow discusses the upcoming g20 meeting in japan and tokyo s priorities during its g20 presidency in your opinion in which policy areas has the g20 achieved its best results in the last decade since its establishment in 2008 the g20 s most successful achievements have been the first g20 summit in washington d c and the second summit in london which aimed to address the 2008 financial crisis to restore global economic growth and to implement necessary reforms in the world s financial systems the london summit took place six months after the 2008 financial crisis and resulted in an agreement through which world leaders injected 1 1 trillion dollars into the world economy since then the g20 has played a crucial role in reshaping the governance of global finance by implementing financial regulations that aim to mitigate risks to the financial system as a whole developing strict rules for investment banks increasing the lending capacity of the international monetary fund imf and collecting information on the shadow banking system it was during this period that china rose to become a global economic superpower when the chinese government announced its own massive fiscal stimulus plan shortly after the g20 2008 summit most of the g20 countries had yet to recover from the economic fallout of the financial crisis this bold measure helped sustain the global economy and the stability of financial markets and it marked the fall of american unilateral dominance as china transformed into an economic powerhouse the success of the g20 summits has encouraged the acceptance of this diverse multilateral forum made up of both advanced and emerging markets that reflect our multipolar world and taught the west that both presence and commitment from emerging countries are necessary for global financial governance in the twenty first century how relevant is the g20 today many argue that the g20 s efficacy as an emergency response mechanism has declined in recent years as evidenced by the 2017 german summit and 2018 argentina summit when conflict between major powers exposed the increase in tensions over trade and climate change issues however as the g20 is attended by heads of state from twenty countries and by representatives of institutions that represent almost two thirds of the global population and 90 percent of the world s gdp it still has an invaluable role to play as a platform for candid discussions about global economic growth and transnational issues over the last decade the g20 has focused on market stability and restoring economic growth but it has also addressed and increased public awareness of transnational issues such as poverty reduction migration cryptocurrency regulation and employment in an encouraging statement made from the leader of one of the founding countries of the g20 canadian prime minister justin trudeau said what sets the g20 apart from other organizations its origins as a rapid response crisis management group and unique size and flexible structure makes it particularly well suited to take on big issues that we all face in our rapidly changing world what are japan s main priorities during its g20 presidency in 2019 japan will host the 2019 g20 osaka summit on june 28 29 and the japanese government has announced that it will prioritize trade imbalance infrastructure quality aging societies and digital taxation first i am following the discussion on digital taxation closely as it highlights the g20 s initiative to address non traditional issues there has been increased criticism of major digital multinational companies not paying their fair share of taxes these digital multinationals have taken advantage of rules governing taxation of foreign companies which in the current system depend on whether the firm has a permanent establishment pe in a country this system has paved the way for it giants to avoid taxes by not maintaining such pes in the countries they operate in according to the european commission digital firms have an effective tax rate of only 9 5 percent compared to 23 5 percent for traditional business enterprises with the rising global discontent towards this lawful tax evasion by multinationals and with globalization s waning reputation japan should provide a forum for international rule making that will serve as a bridge between europe which aims to tax digital multinationals and the reluctant united states and china second this g20 will emphasize the quality infrastructure investment qii partnership agenda and its aims of increasing economic productivity safety and resilience while transparently and sustainably contributing to local economies while china is incurring debt as it expands its infrastructure in line with its own rules the g20 needs to provide a forum for debate over appropriate global infrastructure standards and funding lastly and most importantly as the current holder of the g20 presidency japan is responsible for protecting the rules based free trade regime which currently faces an uncertain future due to the harsh tensions between the u s and china the japanese government has announced that regardless of the outcome of bilateral negotiations between the two countries it will initiate trilateral dialogue together with the u s and the e u with the aim of reforming outdated aspects of the wto what is japan s role in the g20 japan needs to display strong leadership and provide a decisive voice that aligns with the g20 s core mission to strengthen the economic foundations of the world and to enable sustainable and inclusive growth of the global economy although there has been wide spread debate over the u s china decoupling since the end of 2018 china has become an integral part of the bretton woods framework making separation impossible instead of maintaining the status quo the g20 must work together to update the global system by engaging china in the face of rising unilateralism the g20 must also deliver a strong and effective message to the world about respecting and protecting mutual values such as the rules based system multilateralism and international cooperation moreover japan should set a bold new agenda for a multilateral rule making that responds more effectively to rapid global and technological change an example of this is prime minister abe s announcement regarding the creation of a framework for cross border data sharing at the world economic forum in januar while it faces an uphill battle the leadership japan displayed last year during the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership tpp 11 and the japan eu economic partnership agreement shows that it is fully capable of fulfilling its role as g20 president yuho nishimura is director of the international department at the genron npo an independent think tank in japan she is a global

possible impacts of us sanctions on popular discontent and loyalty towards ortega are analyzed if there is no political agreement the risks of financial collapse are debated at the wilson center in washington by ivan olivares confidencial havana times the collapse of the nicaraguan economy has affected more families as a whole than the national banking system but no one has been left unscathed on the one hand there are some 415 000 people in unemployment or underemployment while many nicaraguans are at risk of returning to poverty on the other banking seems to be immersed in a downward economic spiral warns the essay nicaraguan tragedy from consensus to coercion presented on tuesday at the wilson center located in the us capital in the paper the authors professor and former official of the state department richard feinberg and researcher beatriz miranda carry out an intense look over the last three decades in the country to help understand how it was that the april rebellion was reached the article by feinberg and miranda was discussed at the wilson center in a panel with the participation of luis rivas ceo of promerica group and julie chung an official of the us state department official who accompanied ambassador mckinley in a meeting with president daniel ortega before the crisis the imf had judged that the nicaraguan banking system was sound and robust with levels of capitalization and liquidity well above international standards a precaution that provided some protection against the shocks of mid 2018 they recognize but the economic crisis that followed governmental repression against citizens led to an increase in non performing loans a plummeting of profits and suddenly placing at risk the capital that banks had accumulated for many years in their analysis feinberg and miranda warn that the continuous withdrawal of deposits could lead to a liquidity crisis so that banks could not fulfill their obligations and close their doors or seek new owners alternatively the loan losses and the declining profits could wipe out their capital creating a solvency crisis a total loss of confidence could cost a bank run so far deposit withdrawals have proceeded gradually but in light of the tense political stalemate an exponential explosive withdrawal of deposits rises as a credible threat they explained in fact the lack of sufficient liquidity to face a possible run of deposits has the banking system in suspense which for months has restricted credit for almost any type of activity a decision that now extends to agricultural and fishing production which threatens this activity on which thousands of jobs depend as well as local commerce exports agroindustry and food security in the country pros and cons of sanctions even though a financial collapse could be caused by the internal situation the authors weighed the effect that the us economic sanctions could have whose punitive measures point at the sandinista leadership but they can also harm the economy and society in general the sanctions against people seek to force these individuals and other senior officials to reevaluate their ties with the ortega murillo regime the decision to oppose the new loans threatens the economy as a whole to undermine ortega s political base but if they are sustained they will inevitably bring suffering to the average nicaraguan they warn feinberg and miranda point out that the effectiveness of the sanctions strategy assumes that ortega s apparently firm control over the sandinista leadership and over the security forces may be affected that ortega and his people will respond rationally to popular discontent and that the political opposition will be able to take advantage of any emerging division to increase its negotiating capacity these sanctions could affect the flows of merchandise and money between the united states and nicaragua which places 40 of its exports of products in that country as well as 70 of the production of the companies that work under free trade regime without ignoring that some 800 million dollars 55 of the total annual remittances comes from that country us sanctions against remittances and the export of merchandise especially in the clothing sector which is labor intensive would directly harm middle class and the poor households the scholars warn in this regard they note that the application of economic sanctions that affect the entire country can be counterproductive because those who have state jobs or any kind of governmental benefit will strengthen their loyalty to ortega increasing the cohesion of the regime the impact of a peaceful solution restoring real peace and putting the national productive apparatus to run with international financial support could triple gdp per capita from the 2 161 dollars in 2017 to some 6 700 by 2050 with a greater effort the next generation could enjoy a gdp per capita six times greater than the current one concludes the essay by feinberg and miranda their summary is simple yes economic growth is important the distribution of wealth also is but it is not enough institutions and institutionalism have weight they mean a lot and public private agreements are not enough to make everyone believe that everything is fine as a developing economy nicaragua faces many challenges but the economic model designed over the last 25 years has laid a solid foundation the keys to future success included sustained macroeconomic discipline export led growth an increasingly diversified export platform and an openness to foreign investment and multilateral funding the document summarizes the authors add that a reasonably equitable distribution of the fruits of growth could be achieved through the combination of a solid job creation progressive fiscal policies and specific and efficient governmental assistance programs in the private sector a more educated and trained workforce will justify a fairer distribution of productivity gains at the end of the day the reality was different from the sweetened scenario that the interested parties tried to orchestrate as was evident when the events revealed that there was a critical problem or a set of problems where there was no consensus the reforms of the institutions of the public sector taking advantage of a daddy state the old mentality that sought to manipulate public office to obtain private and partisan profits had not disappeared appropriate relations between the public and private sectors and between the state apparatus and the main political parties were under discussion it relates the independence of the judicial sector and the integrity of the electoral process were also in dispute hence the deep political crisis nicaragua is living proof that economic growth is not sustainable without a functional consensus on political institutions as many voices at different times in the last decade had warned repeating what was advise to the government of daniel ortega feinberg and miranda detail that nicaragua desperately needs a political solution credible enough to restore confidence in financial markets investors and consumers the most pressing political problems are the reform of the electoral system and the date of the elections as well as the return of civil liberties and the freedom of political prisoners so more comprehensive government reforms must be followed they state warning those who expect solutions in a very short term the authors emphasize at the beginning that economic recovery is likely to advance slowly as the nation recovers from the severe trauma of violent confrontation and economic actors wait to see if the new political agreements are sustainable during this transition the international financial institutions can set up a concerted and fast disbursing stabilization package which establishes the conditions for renewed growth they proposed they refer to entities such as the international monetary fund the world bank and the inter american development bank which they say have fallen short in three critical aspects how to face corruption trusting unreliable official statistics and not calculating properly the political risk
as eu imposed austerity crushed greece in 2010 a waiter in corfu told us we should cut the heads off the politicians before the week was out there were riots in athens buildings were set on fire and three bank employees burned to death thankfully we re nowhere near that stage but if you lift the lid off social media you ll see the pot is bubbling ferociously britain is split in two each half calling the other all sorts of names most of these ranters qualify for jury service and the franchise one trembles at the thought of direct democracy one in four of the population is said to suffer from a mental disorder and to judge by facebook it s plausible but in a way hardly surprising far from seeking to reunite the country professional politicians in the uk have been fomenting discontent among remainers and have even advised eu leaders on how to subvert the referendum result is it a coincidence that the daily mail has been given a new editor who has u turned the paper s line and now characterises brexiteers as saboteurs leading us to an abyss even the eurocrats are infected mr van rompuy who looks as if he couldn t decapitate a boiled egg fantasises about holding a knife to our throat mr tusk even less loved in his native poland than here smirks at a vision of those who promoted brexit in hell their intemperate language is a clue to the fact that not one but two crises are brewing the first is the european union s jean monnet s dream of a europe that could never make war with itself again has been caught in the trap of confusing aim with method full political unification has been pursued clandestinely and with an almost suicidal obsession like captain ahab after his white whale as a prelude the single currency was forced into being despite the unreadiness of participants such as greece and italy both of which fudged their economic data to qualify and have suffered for it since the eu s appetite for centralised control and aggrandisement remains unslaked would c p snow have dubbed them the labradors of power straight after the centenary of the armistice frau merkel returned to her theme of a european intervention force now she is after an aircraft carrier just when it is rumoured that china plans to sell off its own to pakistan how does one justify the expense of such capital ships with their increasing vulnerability the interference in the ukraine that has heightened tensions between the western alliance and russia see the military build up in the region on both sides here and here hasn t put the eu off its plan to foster supranational order elsewhere too africa is the future said mr juncker in his 2018 state of the union address urging more collective arrangements there of the kind that were the foundation stones of the eu in the midst of this brexit and the common man threaten to spoil the grand project of the philosopher kings again and again on shows such as question time ordinary people are bluntly challenging their elected representatives to do what was solemnly promised in 2016 this brings us to the second local crisis by affirming not only orally but in the official pamphlet the eu referendum is a once in a generation decision this is your decision the government will implement what you decide that the referendum would be held once only and that the result would be implemented whatever the outcome our leaders effectively turned it into a binding plebiscite now they wish to resile that has raised and dashed expectations in the most emphatic way and the implications are dangerous if this vote is delegitimised then so are all those passed in parliament many of them by a smaller margin than four per cent the callaghan government fell in 1979 when the motion of no confidence was carried by a single vote what would the consequences be former brexit secretary dominic raab said on last week s question time that there will be a day of reckoning if brexit is nullified and he may be thinking of deselections party membership cancellations and the shattering of the two party system itself but some think or worse wish that it could go further even dr richard north has said perhaps only half jokingly it is not only ideas that develop in the provinces so do revolutions fortunately revolutions and civil wars don t just happen and a good thing too as whatever the outcome the process is horrific and often long drawn out because unlike a war there s nobody to make peace on behalf of the whole country they need an evil constellation of factors but that discussion is for another occasion having said that one of the possible triggers is major financial dislocation not just the vindictive awkwardness in trading arrangements that the eu appears to be preparing for us cutting off its nose to spite its face but the kind of long cycle economic downturn about which irving fisher nicolai kondratiev and others have theorised the role of debt has been overlooked by many economists and professor steve keen has estimated that only some 20 out of 10 000 professionals foresaw the 2008 2009 global financial crisis for those who think the crisis is over because of quantitative easing and modern monetary theory it s worth noting that global debt is now bigger than ever some three times the size of the world s gdp despite high levels of money printing we are not yet seeing significant inflation but that is because economic demand is dropping and debt servicing is a growing challenge the turnover of cash is slowing and offsetting the effects of monetary inflation also the us dollar the world s reserve currency is being snapped up by foreign countries scared of local currency depreciation default so at present those dollars are not cascading back into the usa and boosting the price of everything says analyst martin armstrong harder times are coming goodbye cheap energy a booming consumer economy and abundant public services hello to raising the state pension age including for women who hadn t expected that trimming the social benefits of the gilets jaunes and so on ordinary wage earners now need additional financial support to make ends meet real hourly wages have pretty much stalled over the last 40 years since the multinationals saw massive opportunities for capital in global workforce arbitrage sir james goldsmith warned about the socio economic consequences at the time of gatt in 1994 and now it has all come to pass it will go on until it can t but who knows when or how that will happen when the times come that try men s souls the search is on for an ideological map to find our way out power relations come under scrutiny in the eighteenth century the american colonists adopted the enlightenment analysis that rooted power in the consent of the people so that when general gage defended his lumping american rebel officers with their men by saying that he recognised only ranks derived from the king george washington replied that for his part he could not conceive any rank more honorable that that which flows from the uncorrupted choice of a brave and free people the purest source and original fountain of all power five months later came the publication of tom paine s common sense arguing on the same lines and setting the movement alight ian geering qc s piece last week on the bruges group site 10 march follows this tradition it is a normative political philosophy this is how we feel things ought to be rather than how they have been for most of recorded history did the americans complain of taxation without parliamentary representation leeds birmingham and manchester shared their plight while old sarum had seven voters and two mps up to the twentieth century only a fraction of the adult british population could vote at all and had to resort to other means to register their dissatisfaction as tony benn observed at the time of the maastricht capitulation riot has historically played a much larger part in british politics than we are ever allowed to know unless we can offer people a peaceful route to the resolution of injustices through the ballot box they will not listen to a house that has blocked off that route and that is where we are watching a cloth eared parliament rejecting an open prison withdrawal agreement yet fighting against a clean break either way negating what the people decided upon yes the people are divided by their very nature votes are divisive the key to peace is to accept them as decisive but those with access to power and the media have worked hard to jemmy the cracks wider the process of re radicalisation has started and this time the state seems either unconscious of the peril or like george iii sure of its ability to patronise and repress britain nearly had a conflagration in 1789 the philosopher richard price a friend of paine gave a french revolution inspired speech a discourse on the love of our country looking at the fundamentals of politics and like paine rooting power in the people the reception was enthusiastic a term with distinct connotations of danger in those days the state was alive to the danger and acted certain gentlemen came to advise price on his future conduct burke began to compose a justification for the british constitution in rebuttal 1789 marked the last time a woman was burned at the stake in london for coining radical groups such as the london corresponding society were infiltrated by government agents and ultimately suppressed yet even with the brakes on the vehicle of power was pushed inch by inch over the next century towards electoral reform and democratisation answering the radicals who took revolutionary france as their model edmund burke articulated a pragmatic scheme for the parliamentary government we now have a balance between the royal executive and popular representation and between constituency representation and mere delegation this circumvented the bloody conflict of first principles that played itself out on the other side of the channel but burke was addressing the problem of how we govern ourselves not whether we should be able to govern ourselves at all even pragmatism has its limits and on this latter issue the people firmly assured by their representatives that this vote would be decisive made their determination the task of their representatives was then to carry it through while closing the divisions among the people as they went forward they have failed on both counts the issue has now turned from uk versus eu to people a confused disunited squabbling people versus parliament itself all our democratic progress is in danger of being thrown away for if the solution to the threat of revolution in britain as france burned was to fashion its own sustainable form of democracy then to discard democracy is to wind the clock back to pre revolutionary days and then the clock will start forward again towards fresh crisis and solutions that have already failed

so if jay powell and company wanted to reassure investors the doves are in control here it looks like they have done that the newly dovish fed will also stop shrinking its balance sheet by the end of september the fed s shift back into easy money mode reflects either a dramatic downgrade in the economic data or a craven capitulation to political pressure a case can be made that both the data and the politics helped push the fed to completely abandon its former plans to continue gradually hiking rates this year we can only speculate as to what words may have been exchanged between federal reserve chairman jerome powell and the donald trump administration s plunge protection team late last year when markets were on the verge of crashing but that period clearly served as an inflection point for monetary policy and the stock market since then stocks have surged higher they rallied again following the fed s dovish pronouncements this week in fact virtually all asset classes got a boost from the fed stocks bonds commodities and precious metals to some extent gold prices currently check in at 1 311 per ounce up 0 6 this week silver shows a weekly gain of 0 5 to bring spot prices to 15 43 platinum is up 1 9 since last friday s close to trade at 851 and finally palladium posted yet another record high this week the supply constrained metal has pulled back a bit here the last couple of days and currently trades at 1 573 per ounce after advancing 0 8 on the week as of this friday morning recording the move in gold and silver markets following the fed s announcement wasn t as dramatic as bulls had hoped for the money metals probably won t accelerate to the upside in a big way until something breaks the uptrend in the s p 500 and drives more safe haven demand in the near term momentum could take the major u s equity averages back up to test their old record highs around there the markets could see some major technical resistance investors will have to ask themselves whether they want to buy stocks trading near all time highs when the economy is headed for a slowdown by the fed s own admission and the earnings picture is deteriorating yes a dovish fed is supportive of higher equity prices all else being equal but that doesn t necessarily mean equities will be the best performing asset class going forward bonds caught a bid this week as interest rates fell and the yield curve flattened rates on treasuries going out 10 years are now all close to 2 5 there appears to be little room left for bonds to rally from here unless the fed starts cutting rates or investors are willing to accept lower yields on bonds than the short term rate set by the fed if the yield curve fully inverts and long term paper yields less than short term paper that would represent an ominous sign for the economy historically an inverted yield curve signals a coming recession on the other hand commodity markets are coming back to life crude oil has been on fire of late with west texas intermediate climbing above 60 per barrel this week as u s imports of venezuelan oil shrank to zero for the first time in decades the plunge in oil prices in the fourth quarter of 2018 had contributed to disinflationary pressures the fed in turn lowered its inflation outlook central bankers now expect the inflation rate to trend slightly below their arbitrary 2 target over the next year but if inflation pressures rise unexpectedly later this year the fed will be handcuffed by its own pronouncement to markets that it s done raising rates while some investors are concerned about the risks of a slowing economy virtually nobody on wall street is paying attention to the potential inflation threat as a consequence inflationary assets including energy stocks mining stocks and precious metals remain the most heavily discounted assets in an investment universe where good values or even decent values are hard to come by for the first time in years u s monetary policy is now conducive to higher precious metals prices the fed isn t the only factor that drives these markets of course but over time being on the right side of the fed usually leads to profitable outcomes well now without further delay let s get right to this week s exclusive interview mike gleason it is my privilege now to welcome back david smith senior analyst at the morgan report and regular contributor to moneymetals com david it s been too long how are you my friend david smith it s been a while and i m happy to be back mike mike gleason well david for metals investors who got started after the 2008 financial crisis it has not been an easy ride as we both know prices rose sharply between 2008 and 2011 driven by the crisis and the fed s response to it 0 interest rates and massive amounts of money creation then the metals markets began to flounder some of the safe haven demand for metals dried up as the equity markets recovered and fear dissipated price rigging and suppression in the futures markets has progressed from conspiracy theory to conspiracy fact metals prices are not being set in free or fair markets so it is not easy for some investors to hang in there but the reasons to own metal are still there bigger than ever so now might be a good time to review some of them you talk a lot about precious metals role as insurance would you mind going over how metals act as a form of insurance for our listeners david as we start out today david smith well there s several iterations of the insurance piece as david morgan of the morgan report always talks about you buy the physical first and you buy that for insurance first and profits second but if you look back and a lot of people would not even believe this until they saw the chart but gold held since 2000 has doubled the appreciation of the stock market the overall stock market so in spite of the big plans that we ve seen that we saw from 1 900 down to about 1 050 and then the move in 2016 we had which gave most of it back and gold ended up for the whole process from that point down about 45 silver down about 70 from 2011 in spite of that the metals are still using their role as insurance of helping you diversify of helping contradict other price changes in investments you may have and then providing liquidity for you so they historically have done that very well that role of insurance and they continue to do so mike gleason you talk about metals as a source of liquidity what do you mean by that david smith it means that if you need money if you have some kind of an expense you need to deal with right away you can sell the gold right now at any gold operation any salesmanship whether it s a jewelry store or an operation like money metals and you can get your money for that to pay that expense you can t do that with property you can t do it with real estate in general and collectibles and things like that so it gives you a real good opportunity i always like to tell people from time to time when you buy gold and silver you don t think of it as buying something like a car or a fishing rod or a camera or something like this you re exchanging one form of which i would argue is inferior money fiat money that s not backed by anything you re exchanging that for a form of historic sound honest money you re not making a purchase per se you re making an acquisition of a greater ability to have a financial element that can do really well for you and offer diversity mike gleason kind of leads me right into my next question you ve described why metals are a good alternative to saving dollars in a bank account elaborate on that if you would and why an investment in bullion can be considered a type of savings david smith well one of the advantages over having fiat money that amount of money in the savings account is that it s yours nobody else has a claim to it i think even today most people that have bank accounts in the united states which is most people i think they don t realize that when they put that money into their account the bank really owns that money granted you have the fdic insurance up to 100 000 per calendar this sort of thing but the reality is if they choose to use some of that money because they ve gotten in trouble investment wise or for some other reason they can take that and you can have a hard time getting it back so the money s in your name in a sense but it s really not yours where you can get ahold of it not to mention if you try to take out a significant amount you go and try to take out 1 000 they ask you what you want to do with it as though it s any of their business there shouldn t be an assumption that you re going to do drugs or do something illegal it s your money and if you want to take it out and give hundred dollar bills out in the street that should be your business mike gleason yeah not to mention if you want 5 000 or 8 000 in cash good luck call a day in advance make sure they ve got that money there when you come in because often banks don t even have that much of the paper money that they re dealing in it s kind of scary actually when you think about it in terms of what could happen if we do get some kind of a crisis and you have a run on the bank for instance david smith not only that mike but there s actually a reporting form that banks have to fill out if you try to get out 10 000 or more at one time or if you take out lesser amounts such as 2 or 3 000 and then maybe 4 000 it s called structuring and their assumption is you re guilty until proven innocent and that you must be wanting to do something nefarious for it this whole idea of standing on the head the idea that you re innocent until proven guilty is being turned around and i just don t like that attitude either mike gleason switching gears here a little bit one of the interesting things about silver as an investment that is very unique and different than other asset classes right now like stocks or real estate is that at present value silver would need to triple in price just to reach the nominal all time high of around 50 an ounce that we hit both back in 1980 and again in 2011 you would have to think that if it did get to 50 again and we could see it break through there that could be off to the races like palladium for instance that market keeps going higher and higher now that we re in this uncharted territory but silver still needs to triple just to get back to that all time nominal high comment on that if you would and touch on what a tremendous value proposition there is in silver right now as a result because you really can t say the same about other markets and other sectors or investment classes right now david smith well silver is one of the few metals that has not traded at all time nominal highs granted it hit almost 50 in 2011 but as you ve mentioned it s dropped since then and it hasn t gone to say 60 or 70 or 80 whereas gold which traded at 850 in 1980 hit 1 923 in 2011 so that s not an inflation adjusted high but it is a nominal high as you were mentioning and i really think what s going to happen it s hard to predict the future but i think there s a real good chance of this happening i think we re going to see silver over the next couple of years move up pretty sharply and at some point it s going to challenge 50 and when that happens it might have to bang his head against that resistance a few times but when it finally breaks through i think it will be a lot like palladium if you remember palladium when it was trying to go through 1 000 it played around and it did 1 050 and 950 and dropped down to 800 this type of a thing then it went up and it just tick tick tick tick against the top and all of a sudden it broke through and it wasn t a 100 move it was just 5 or 10 and then it just kept going and going and going in a very semi gradual it was not a vertical run at all it was just a solid movement that was always contained on the downside and moved on up if you think about it if you go back and you look at the move between 1 050 and where it is now over 1 500 it almost takes your breath away how far it s gone and how quietly it s done it and people have watched it all the way and who knows how much farther it ll go but the point is i think when silver gets above 50 and builds a bit of a base i think you ll see 75 or 80 silver very quickly and it s going to be three digits in my belief and i believed this since the beginning we ll see three digit silver at some point in the next few years and one of the things about waiting for prices to go where you thought they were is by the time you decide to do something about it it s already there and the risk is a lot greater or it may be inconvenient for you to do it and you don t do it at all and you get to watch the whole darn thing mike gleason getting back to palladium for second here david we ve talked with you a lot about that metal over the years several years ago you were on this very program and telling people that that was a great investment opportunity we were still in the triple digits well below 1 000 at the time and it s been a fantastic play for the people that followed your advice just comment about where we are right now i mean how high can it go i guess is the first question then also if you would comment about this potential breakdown in the futures market in palladium this physical shortage that we re seeing and how that potentially could be a precursor to what we might see one day in the gold and silver markets david smith the palladium breakdown they really do have very small supplies most palladium comes from russia or from south africa or from zimbabwe and the deficit has been building for several years it s really pretty interesting because an awful lot of what palladium is used for in catalytic converters which i believe tends to be a regular gasoline powered cars as opposed to diesel engines which platinum is more frequently used for they can be substituted but you can t just change it on a dime rick rule was talking about this not too long ago and he said it could take a couple of years to retool to get back over so that the palladium that is now being used could all can be utilized as platinum instead so in terms of where the price could go it could go up another 500 to 1 000 but the risk is absolutely enormous at this point to try to buy it now and personally i wouldn t recommend it i think platinum because it usually is 200 or 300 above gold and is now well below it it s about 850 versus gold at 1 300 and this has persisted for quite a long time at some point the bull market in palladium will be over and the platinum market will do catch up but i remember when the last time this happened which is i think about 10 or 12 years ago might ve been a little farther back but ford motor they panicked and they bought a lot of palladium and they ended up selling and a 1 5 billion loss a few months later so whether you re a manufacturer or an investor or whatever the market is pretty high here and it could go a lot higher but when it finally turns around it could be really interesting to watch on the downside mike gleason some of my recent podcast guests have been talking about that very dynamic i think it was craig hemke at tf metals that pointed out that back then in the early 2000s when palladium shot up like it did and ford motor company and the other automotive manufacturers started to hoard the metal boris yeltsin in russia of course russia controls a lot of that supply and is the main producer of it like you mentioned he bailed out the market and supplied a lot of physical palladium at the time it seems somewhat unlikely that we re going to get the same type of cooperation from mr putin so that ll be an interesting market to watch how about rhodium david we talk even less about that market but that s another one that has seen some pretty attractive gains it s not maybe as white hot as palladium but it s still performing quite well any quick comments about rhodium david smith well rhodium is a real esoteric market it s a very small market even compared to platinum and palladium especially palladium which are not big markets it s my understanding that most of the pricing takes place by appointment i do know that for example you can buy a 1 oz rhodium bullion bars i think there s about a three or 400 deficit when you sell so that s a pretty big spread in both directions but it s used for some of the same things platinum and palladium are to me it s fun to watch but in terms of getting deeply involved in it not so much i d rather do silver and gold by the way there s so many things that are pointing towards this buildup of a very very strong gold and silver market over the next several years one of the things i read just a couple of days ago is that silver purchases in india not gold but silver have reached a four year high that s been almost under the radar screen because people focus on how much gold india buys which is quite a lot but silver is absolutely maintaining a very very strong upward trend in purchases in india and last year 30 of the world s production of silver was purchased by the third quarter by india alone so we re going to wake up one of these days and we re going to find out that there s a whole lot more buying pressure across the board for both of these metals than we thought was the case mike gleason i wanted to ask you about your expectations about how well the metals will work as an investment or its ability to generate returns for investors over time the metals role as insurance and is a better form of money or perhaps more important reasons to own them we ve already discussed those but let s face it most people buying gold and silver are anxious to see profits on their investment that is what they have missed in recent years and it is frustrating but there s little reason to think that the next several years will be a repeat of the past you and i were speaking offline about the potential set up right now in the metals markets that we re looking at potentially some good gains over the next few years and maybe instead of maybe what was a little bit of a false breakout in 2016 when we had a nice rally it could be a little bit different this time around give us your thoughts there david smith i really believe so i m deeply involved in the mining stocks as an analyst for the morgan report with david morgan i do a lot of work on my own a lot of investment i buy a lot of stocks that i don t write about they re not on our formal allocation table something that i happened to get interested in i hold a couple of stocks for example now that they re mining in japan or exploring in japan and they ve done well lately but i think what we re facing here and i get it when people say it s been so depressing the last few years i bought the metals and they either stayed flat or they declined and i understand why people have given up some who ve been at it for 30 years but the thing is usually before the biggest opportunities is when the day appears to be darkest i can tell you honestly and i ve told this to several of my friends i ve been involved in the metal since the mid 70s in the 1970s i did mostly physical and futures in the metals the period between 1980 and about 2002 was 22 years of pretty much an unremitting bear market in gold and silver and especially silver it went from 50 to a little under 5 i can tell you honestly that the time between 2011 and say last fall was more difficult for me emotionally which is a period of about seven years or so seven a half years it was more difficult than the 22 years i spent waiting for another silver bull market so i understand that what s going on but i m telling you i look at these charts and nothing s ever a guarantee but i think the probabilities favor a market over the next three to five years maybe longer but certainly at least about three years that i think will absolutely shock people when we end up seeing where things are in just a few years there are so many things that indicate that the risk reward in addition to the probabilities of a very strong sustained secular move is right ahead of us mike gleason yeah we talked about it before about how this is not a time to lose your nerve the reason why you bought gold and silver in the first place that being just a ridiculous amount of debt and credit all over the economy those reasons are still very much there today if not even more out sized and more out of control golden and silver didn t just become a bad alternative to paper money over the last few months or few years and people need to keep that in mind you want to continue to hold it as a hedge against what may be coming and i think we both agree that it s not just a matter of if but when the wheels finally do come off well david thanks so much for your time today and for your enlightening comments as always we always enjoy catching up with you and hope we can do it before long i hope you enjoy your weekend and we ll talk soon thanks very much david smith very good

global financial conditions are easing as a result of the fed and other banks renewed dovishness new york the us federal reserve surprised markets recently with a large and unexpected policy change when the federal open market committee fomc met in december 2018 it hiked the fed s policy rate to 2 25 2 5 percent and signaled that it would raise the benchmark rate another three times to three to 3 25 percent before stopping it also signaled that it would continue to unwind its balance sheet of treasury bonds and mortgage backed securities indefinitely by up to 50 billion per month but just six weeks later at the fomc meeting in late january the fed indicated that it would pause its rate hikes for the foreseeable future and suspend its balance sheet unwinding sometime this year several factors drove the fed s volte face first and foremost policymakers were rattled by the sharp tightening in financial conditions after the fomc s december meeting which hastened a rout in global equity markets that had begun in october 2018 and these fears were exacerbated by an appreciating us dollar and the possibility of an effective shutdown of certain credit markets particularly those for high yield and leveraged loans second in the latter half of 2018 us core inflation unexpectedly stopped rising toward the fed s two percent target and even started falling toward 1 8 percent with inflation expectations weakening the fed was forced to reconsider its rate hike plan which was based on the belief that structurally low unemployment would drive inflation above two percent third us president donald trump s trade wars and slowing growth in europe china japan and emerging markets have raised concerns about the united states own growth prospects particularly after the protracted federal government shutdown with which the us met the new year fourth the fed has had to demonstrate its independence in the face of political pressures in december when it signaled further rate hikes trump had been calling for a pause but since then the fed has had to worry about being blamed in the event of an economic stall fifth richard clarida a well respected economist and market expert joined the fed board as vice chair in the fall of 2018 tipping the balance of the fomc in a more dovish direction before then fed chair jerome powell s own dovish tendencies had been kept in check by a slightly less dovish staff and the third member of the fed s leadership troika new york fed president john williams who expected inflation to rise gradually above target as the labor market tightened the addition of clarida amid stalling inflation and tightening financial conditions no doubt proved decisive in the fed s decision to hit the pause button but clarida also seems to have pushed the fed toward renewed dovishness in more subtle ways for starters his presence lends support to powell s view that the flattening of the phillips curve which asserts an inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment may be more structural than temporary some fed researchers disagree and have published a paper arguing that uncertainty with respect to the phillips curve should not stop the fed from normalizing us monetary policy but with clarida s input the fed will be more inclined to focus on actual inflation trends rather than on the official unemployment rate and its implications under traditional models moreover while fed staff members tend to believe that the us economy s rate of potential growth is very low around 1 75 2 percent clarida like powell seems open to the idea that trump s tax cuts and deregulatory policies combined with the next wave of technological innovation will allow for somewhat stronger non inflationary growth finally clarida is spearheading an internal strategy review to determine whether the fed should start making up for below target inflation during recessions and slow recoveries by allowing for above target inflation during expansionary periods and though the review is still in its early stages the fed already seems to have embraced the idea that inflation should be allowed to exceed two percent without immediately triggering a tightening taken together these factors suggest that the fed could remain in pause mode for the rest of 2019 after all even a recent modest acceleration of wage growth does not seem to have produced higher inflation implying that the phillips curve may stay flatter for longer and given the fed s new de facto policy of targeting average inflation over the course of the business cycle a modest temporary increase in core inflation above two percent would not necessarily be met with policy action but while the fed is most likely to remain in a holding pattern for the bulk of 2019 another rate hike toward the end of the year or in 2020 cannot be ruled out china s growth slowdown seems to be bottoming out and recovery there could start to strengthen in the coming months especially if the current sino american negotiations lead to a de escalation of trade tensions likewise a deal to avert an economically disastrous hard brexit could still be in the offing and it is possible that the eurozone s slowdown especially germany s will prove temporary moreover global financial conditions are easing as a result of the fed and other central banks renewed dovishness and this could translate into stronger us domestic growth much will depend on whether trump abstains from launching a separate trade war against the european auto industry which would rattle equity markets again yet barring more fights over the us federal budget and the debt ceiling not to mention possible impeachment proceedings against trump the us could be spared serious domestic political and policy shocks in the months ahead if us gdp growth does remain resilient this year some acceleration of wage growth and price inflation could follow and core inflation may even rise above target in the second half of the year or 2020 and while the fed seems willing to tolerate a period of temporary above target inflation it cannot allow that to become the new status quo should this scenario arise later in the year or next year the fed could hike its baseline rate by another 25 basis points before settling into a protracted pause either way the new normal will be a us policy rate close to or just below three percent

stephen moore president trump s pick to serve on the federal reserve s board of governors defended shifting his views on major economic issues since working with trump saying saturday that he favors stable prices and economic growth certainly i m in favor of most of the policies that this president has put forth moore said in a phone interview with the washington examiner during the obama administration moore a fellow at the conservative heritage foundation criticized the fed s post financial crisis policy of setting interest rates near zero to spur spending suggesting in 2015 for instance that easy money policy risked a repeat of the 2008 crisis but moore did an about face after trump s criticism of the central bank for raising rates calling on the fed to keep its target rate as low as possible moore went as far in december as to call on fed chairman jerome powell another trump nominee to resign for raising rates moore said saturday that he would not take political considerations into account if he were confirmed to the fed despite his proximity to trump i get that the fed has to be independent of what the president wants he said when questioned about the discrepancy between his views on interest rates before and after trump s presidency moore said that he favors changing fed policy to tie interest rates to the prices of oil and other major commodities he explained that he supported a rules based monetary policy that would have exceptions during a time of economic crisis keep those stable over time and you ll have a stable price system moore said according to data from the federal reserve the price of oil is about 40 percent lower than it was before the recession that began in late 2007 while the average price of gasoline per gallon is approximately 60 cents lower jim pethokoukis an economic policy analyst for the american enterprise institute who has known moore for years said that congress will look skeptically at moore s closeness to trump and his reversals on policy that s certainly an accusation that he s going to hear said pethokoukis a frequent guest on moore and larry kudlow s old radio show i think it s ok to change your mind on things but i think you have to provide a logical coherent path as to what caused that change he said before trump s election moore also positioned himself as a fiscal hawk in 2015 moore argued that the debt ceiling a legal borrowing limit for the federal government should not be raised without significant spending cuts the trump administration has asked congress to raise the debt ceiling without any spending cuts in return in comments since trump s election moore has downplayed the need to cut spending arguing that all that matters is economic growth i don t think by the way there is any particular relationship between the debt and interest rates or deficits and rates moore said in a 2018 interview with the christian broadcasting network but i want to reduce the debt burden on the economy so growth you have debt numerator gdp denominator get that gdp up deficits are rising significantly during trump s presidency accelerated by the tax cuts and spending increases he s presided over the congressional budget office projects that the federal deficit will approach 900 billion this year over 100 billion more than last year and will rise indefinitely in the years ahead on saturday moore pushed back on the notion that he doesn t care about the government spending more than it takes in deficits reduce growth they don t stimulate growth he said before adding that i m a big growth hawk whatever you can do to create economic growth we just need a fed policy that permits the economy to grow without inflation moore said in my mind the most important thing is growth there s no way you can possibly bring the deficit down without growth despite the discrepancies between his own views over the years and likely universal opposition from democrats moore has the advantage of a winning personality said pethokoukis he is a super friendly guy said pethokoukis of moore we got into it but it was always very congenial spirited economic experts on both the right and the left panned moore s nomination after trump announced his intent to pick the former club for growth president driven largely by moore s unorthodox background for the fed steve is a perfectly amiable guy but he simply does not have the intellectual gravitas for this important job wrote greg mankiw a harvard economist and a former chairman of the council of economic advisers during the george w bush administration it is time for senators to do their job mr moore should not be confirmed
by marshall auerback a market analyst and commentator produced by economy for all a project of the independent media institute airbus is considering whether or not to shift the assembly process of its latest generation of a330 planes to china as part of a bid to increase its market share in the world s fastest growing civil aviation market the european multinational is following a trend started by boeing which recently opened a new completion plant in china on the face of it the decision by the two companies which dominate the civilian aviation market makes sense build where your biggest customer lives especially as china does not yet have a fully homegrown civil aviation industry ready to compete globally the benefits are many including the goodwill and esteem of the country that would be buying these planes in the long term however that might prove to be a costly miscalculation based on its recent history hereand here it won t take long for china to catch up and largely displace both companies domestically in beijing s home aviation market as well as seizing a large chunk of the corporate duopoly s global market share airbus and boeing could therefore be making short term decisions with negative long term consequences for their future profitability given china s formidable economic advancement none of this should come as a surprise to either airbus or boeing nor should it shock western governments the problem is that everybody has historically been guided by the naïve assumption that simply admitting china to organizations such as the world trade organization wto would induce beijing to in the words of philip pan eventually bend to what were considered the established rules of modernization prosperity would fuel popular demands for political freedom and bring china into the fold of democratic nations or the chinese economy would falter under the weight of authoritarian rule and bureaucratic rot china has unquestionably modernized but its politically illiberal dirigistepolity has if anything massively moved in the opposite direction strengthened by that very modernization process that has done anything but falter furthermore the country has many aims and goals that are antithetical to the long term prosperity of western companies and economies as the european union is beginning to recognize boeing and airbus might simply become the latest western sacrificial lambs beijing has explicitly targeted wide bodied aircrafts as one of its 10 new priority sectors for import substitution in its made in china 2025 document so whatever short term gains airbus and boeing receive in terms of securing additional orders from china could well be undermined longer term the resultant technology transfers and lower labor costs will almost certainly give beijing a quantum leap toward competing directly and ultimately displacing both companies given the merger with mcdonnell douglas boeing will continue its march toward effectively becoming a branch of the u s department of defense as its civilian market share crashes but airbus doesn t really have the luxury of a military alternative given the relative paucity of european defense expenditures as if boeing needed any further problems the 737 fiasco represents the latest in a series of setbacks for the company boeing s 737 global recall coming on the heels of the initial launch problems of the 787 dreamliner some six years ago where the demoduralization of production meant that boeing could not fully account for stress transmission and loading at the system level as gary pisano and willy shih write together illustrate the dangers of spreading manufacturing too far across the globe engineers notes cuny fellow jon rynn need to kick the tires of the new production processes they design so while a market may be global production and the growth of production take place most efficiently in relatively close geographic quarters american companies such as boeing consistently underestimate the value of closely integrating r d and manufacturing while underplaying the risks of separating them as recent events have demonstrated again to the company s cost by deciding to expand its a330 production in china airbus looks poised to repeat boeing s error a potential miscalculation that most european union companies have hitherto largely avoided because the eu has prioritized domestic manufacturing discouraged offshoring more than its u s counterparts in regard to the loss of u s manufacturing jobs attributable to china the american economic review paper by justin r pierce and peter k schott specifically notes that there was no similar reaction in the european union where policy did not change beijing itself has historically balanced its purchases from both major civil aviation manufacturers to ensure that it does not rely too heavily on one aircraft supplier which means that airbus will likely benefit from the void created by the 737 recall all the more reason why the european conglomerate should be wary of following the pied piper like expansion into china the 737 recall also complicates resolution of the u s china trade conflict which had appeared closer to resolution in light of beijing s proposal to buy an additional 1 2tn in u s exports over six years boeing aircraft purchases featured heavily on beijing s shopping list but the longer term challenges relate to china s economic development path and its corresponding move up the high tech curve which have largely been characterized by mercantilist policies of protection and heavy government subsidy in this regard the chinese state has followed a national development strategy first outlined in the mid 19th century by the german economist friedrich list who argued that the national government should play a crucial role in promoting guiding and regulating the process of national economic advancement protectionism list argued should play a role here as well during the country s catch up phase of technological development list wrote the analysis against a historic backdrop where germany was beginning to challenge the dominant economic power of its time the united kingdom so the defenders of beijing might well point to his work to show that there is nothing new about using the state as a principal instrument to accelerate economic development and innovation however list was analyzing two capitalist economies operating within the context of a 19th century gold standard global financial system which invariably circumscribed the scope of state involvement the finite availability of gold reserves limiting fiscal policy options by contrast today the global economy operates under a fiat currency system and what therefore distinguishes china s economic domestic development from its 19th century predecessors is the sheer scale of fiscal resources it can deploy in the furtherance of its economic and military objectives some of these objectives might not be so benign to the west longer term which points to another consideration for the west for all of its supposed embrace of capitalism china is still primarily a state dominated economy which eschews the disciplines of a free market economy this means it has the capacity and ideological predisposition to use the national fiscal policy as a loss leader absorbing losses well beyond what would be tolerated in an economy dominated by private enterprise private companies of course can go bust beijing underwrites its designated national champions by relying on a combination of subsidies some disguised as they flow through state backed investment funds and the financial sectors and buy china preferences to develop chinese products even though these policies are contrary to the rules of wto membership which china eagerly joined in 2001 as the economist brad setser argues various parts of the chinese state compete absorb losses and then consolidat around the successful firms other countries worry about the losses notes setser but not the chinese government which simply socializes the losses at the national level and writes them off in this regard boeing and airbus would do well to consider china s experience in the solar industry designating this as another strategic sector for growth in the 1990s chinese solar companies with the explicit backstop of the state ultimately raised enough funding via debt to build sufficient solar capacity for the world three times over the overinvestment ultimately killed the cash flows of major western competitors and knocked them out of the business leaving the market free for china to dominate commenting on the trend scientific american highlighted that between 2008 and 2013 china s fledgling solar electric panel industry dropped world prices by 80 percent a stunning achievement in a fiercely competitive high tech market china had leapfrogged from nursing a tiny rural oriented solar program in the 1990s to become the globe s leader in what may soon be the world s largest renewable energy source here was a classic case of state guided supported commercial companies receiving benefits that went far beyond anything in say korea or taiwan or even japan in the earlier part of their development now this trend is manifesting itself across the entire spectrum of the chinese guided economy including agricultural equipment industrial machinery telecommunications ai computer chips and civil aviation in another disturbing parallel that boeing and airbus would do well to consider he timeline of china s rise began in the late 1990s when germany overwhelmed by the domestic response to a government incentive program to promote rooftop solar panels provided the capital technology and experts to lure china into making solar panels to meet the german demand according to scientific american much like the german solar companies which shipped valuable manufacturing and technological expertise to china to sustain demand boeing and airbus could well be signing their economic death warrants by agreeing to offshore increasing amounts of production in china to sustain their global market shares aided and abetted by their more market oriented governments which frown on the idea of national industrial policy the same thing is happening in wind power in china which is expected to see offshore wind capacity grow from 2 gigawatts last year to 31 gigawatts in the next decade china s expansion here has already forced siemens and gamesa to merge to cope with the rising competitive challenge as far as aviation itself goes setser makes the point that china may cut into the united states future exports by building its own competitor to the 737 and also cut into europe s future exports if airbus decides to build the a330 in china and china buys made in china rolls royce engines for the c929 and the a330 even if this allows the duopoly to maintain its dominance in global civil aviation it is hard to see how shifting manufacturing production of aircraft components to china to get orders constitutes a win for the u s or european workers who are already being displaced and boeing s weak kneed response to the 737 crisis will likely exacerbate the company s problems going forward the bottom line is that both western governments and western corporations have persistently underestimated the power of china s economic development model and the corresponding economic threat that it poses to the west s own affluence the usual criticism leveled against the chinese growth model is that a country that subsidizes its industries ends up with inefficient industries because heavily protected local firms are shielded from global competition ultimately leaving the country that resorts to protectionism with inferior products the idea of national champions built up via state dirigisme according to classic liberal economic doctrine ultimately ensures that economic efficiency and commercial considerations get squeezed out rent seeking and corruption become institutionalized goes the argument so these national champions ultimately will not be able to compete in the global marketplace that was certainly the assumption of milton friedman who called the chinese communist party s state driven strategy an open invitation to corruption and inefficiency by contrast according to defense and the national interest the governing assumptions of capitalist economies is that he discipline of the marketplace not the state is better suited to choose winners and knock out losers who cannot offer the prices or quality or features of their competitors china represents the ultimate repudiation of these seemingly ironclad economic laws the country s success has come across a slew of industries clean tech notably wind and solar power internet companies despite overwhelming censorship china has corporate behemoths such as alibaba or baidu which rival google in scale and scope and more recently in the telecommunications sector where huawei has clearly benefited from buy china preferences created by the state via its state owned telecommunications enterprises and now is considered to be the global leader in 5g telephony in practice therefore there is no reason why the same model cannot work with regard to civil aviation even as airbus and boeing eagerly provide the rope with which they may hang their respective companies in the future

president donald trump on friday tapped stephen moore a conservative economic commentator and fellow critic of federal reserve policy under chairman jerome powell to join the us central bank s board of governors a move that would put a trump loyalist inside the world s most important financial institution mr moore who last year suggested in a radio interview that mr trump had cause to fire mr powell for wrecking our economy would add a critical and unconventional voice to a collegial committee that unanimously backed mr powell in keeping rate hikes on hold this month the group often reach policy decisions by consensus after debating the issues i will be nominating mr moore to the fed mr trump told reporters as he arrived in florida for a weekend trip he ll be great on the fed interviewed on bloomberg television on friday after mr trump s announcement mr moore said he is an independent voice despite his close ties to and support of mr trump s policies and said he did not want to be a disruptor but instead aimed to work closely with mr powell to try to make sure that america grows as fast as it can he described remarks suggesting mr powell and other fed policymakers should be fired as probably written in a time of anger given a very substantial mistake the fed made in raising rates in december asked if the fed should be cutting interest rates instead he said was unsure one of the things that will be really interesting for me is to hear the case look at their data and then help make the decision about whether we re too tight or too loose mr moore said before joining the conservative heritage foundation think tank mr moore had worked as an editorial page writer at the wall street journal he also was an adviser to mr trump s presidential campaign and holds a master s degree in economics from george mason university i have known steve for a long time and have no doubt he will be an outstanding choice mr trump wrote on twitter on friday elsewhere on twitter some conservative economists and fellow fed critics were less effusive trust me steve knows absolutely nothing about the federal reserve or monetary policy bruce bartlett a supply side economist who served in the republican administrations of ronald reagan and george hw bush said on twitter stephen moore is unfit to serve on the fed board monetary economist george selgin director of the libertarian cato institute s center for monetary and financial alternatives said on twitter senators mum mr moore whose nomination would require senate approval helped write mr trump s signature tax plan the nomination could test just how successful mr powell has been in his aggressive courting of lawmakers in his first year as fed chair mr moore will likely face heavy criticism from senate democrats with whom he has clashed for years the biggest question will be whether the republicans who have regularly met with powell agree to advance someone who has publicly chastised the head of the fed and agreed that trump has the power to fire him a spokeswoman for republican senator crapo who leads the senate banking committee whose support is needed before a fed governor can be appointed declined to comment none of the other members of the committee commented when contacted by reuters about moore s nomination the position would give mr moore a vote at the policy setting table of an institution whose interest rate hikes last year were a frequent target of mr trump s ire the fed has since put its rate hikes on hold citing slowing global and us growth and low inflation in the bloomberg television interview mr moore said he was not sure about whether the fed should cut rates and also said he needed to reserve judgment about the size of the fed s bond holdings because i don t have the full knowledge that i need but he later added that over time obviously we want to reduce that balance sheet and not have these massive amounts of debt on the fed balance sheet the fed on wednesday said it would stop scaling back the vast portfolio of bonds they built up to spur an economic recovery from the 2007 2009 financial crisis and recession in current conditions the fed said it needs to have a balance sheet of roughly us 3 5 trillion more than four times pre crisis levels to manage interest rates a portfolio that would at some point need to begin slowly growing again over time shifting views mr trump had actually won broad support for his first fed picks including mr powell with economists on the left and right seeing them as mainstream choices who could maintain the fed s independence from political concerns and extend a consensus shaped under previous fed chair janet yellen along with mr powell mr trump appointed respected academic economist richard clarida as vice chair randal quarles as vice chair for regulation and kansas community banker michelle bowman the choice of mr moore drew broad criticism as economists across the spectrum noted that mr moore s writings and comments seemed to confuse basic concepts and had been wildly inconsistent over time mr trump picked mr moore after speaking with him to compliment him on an opinion article he co authored in the wall street journal that newspaper reported earlier citing a senior administration official in the article mr moore argued that the fed s rate hikes promoted deflation and described the central bank as the last major obstacle to the united states staying on a good path while mr moore has sided with mr trump in chastising the fed for raising rates he has in the past been just as vocal in critiquing the central bank for not raising them in october 2015 when the unemployment rate was 5 per cent versus 3 8 per cent today and the fed s preferred measure of inflation was just 1 2 per cent lower than today mr moore wrote in the washington times t he fed refused to raise interest rates off zero in september and hello that easy money policy is how we got into the mess in 2000 and then in 2008 wall street cheered janet yellen s decision to keep the cheap dollars flowing isn t this all starting to sound familiar in the same column he urged congressional republicans to put up a fight on the debt ceiling by requiring more budget discipline as a condition of higher debt levels on friday the treasury department reported a record monthly budget deficit of us 234 billion along with using technical terms to mean different things than most economists mr moore in a 2014 co authored paper argued the exact opposite of the views he embraces today urging the fed to pull liquidity from the economy by selling off its assets because of the risk of inflation the fed may still suffer some losses on these securities sales but the danger of future inflation and political pressure outweigh the consequences of these losses he wrote the us recovery then was still at a weak point and fed officials at the time felt rates needed to remain low to support employment and growth if confirmed by the senate mr moore would fill one two open positions on the fed s seven seat board presidents certainly use appointments to shape monetary policy if the senate is willing to go along that is said sarah binder an economics professor at george washington university reuters
it s a familiar story a deep pocketed country develops oil fields in a heavily indebted nation with lax environmental regulations the locals object claiming that oil and gas extraction degrades their land air water and quality of life protests mount and locals appeal to elected officials who appear powerless to intervene the foreign country tries to influence local elections complaints about spills and leaks pour in lawsuits fly there are rumblings that locals may resort to civil disobedience if the rich foreigners keep spoiling their resources this scenario has played out around the world in nigeria ecuador indonesia and elsewhere in what economists call the resource curse countries with minerals or oil are vulnerable to exploitation by foreign powers and end up with sullied land poisoned waters and dirty air but in a new twist to an old narrative the foreign interloper in this story is canada and the area being despoiled is the united states specifically boulder county colorado the deal in october 2015 the canada pension plan investment board cppib announced a 900 million deal to purchase all of the oil and gas assets in the denver julesburg d j basin owned by encana the u s subsidiary of a canadian energy company with the same name that at that point was one of the largest producers in colorado the investment board is a quasi governmental 368 billion behemoth that invests payroll withholding taxes from canada s workers on behalf of 20 million contributors and beneficiaries and pays benefits much like the u s social security system does its portfolio is vast and includes renewable energy projects real estate business ventures around the world as well as fossil fuel production and pipelines encana had holdings in rapidly growing areas along colorado s front range north of denver and astride interstate 25 corridor between colorado s capital and its fourth largest city fort collins the deal to sell to cppib stalled as financial and social pressures bore down on the oil and gas industry some encana holdings were in communities such as broomfield and boulder counties that had banned hydraulic fracturing or fracking in 2012 and 2013 the oil and gas industry challenged those bans and the legal fight reached the colorado supreme court as the encana deal was being negotiated in early 2016 while the fracking bans were still in place oil bottomed out at 34 a barrel and encana s stock had dropped to below 5 from its five year high of more than 24 in the summer of 2014 many companies in the oil and gas patch were stressed front range citizens groups were organizing ballot measures to force new oil and gas development farther from where people lived and suburban parents who had never done anything more political than attend pta meetings became fractivists and planned civil disobedience actions in local libraries then came the colorado supreme court s landmark may 2016 decision invalidating all local control bans in favor of longtime statewide authority to foster oil and gas development that authority entrusted to the colorado oil and gas conservation commission cogcc historically has meant that the state has approved every completed drilling permit application residents across the front range who had been working to win voter approval for local fracking bans were outraged by the ruling local activism continued with new proposed initiatives more neighborhood groups pressuring their local officials to stand up against the industry and a number of lawsuits filed in local state and federal courts to continue pressuring the state to increase its regulation of oil and gas facilities especially in residential areas and near schools the ruling however was good news for the canadians soon after on aug 11 2016 the canada pension plan investment board announced that it had finalized its deal with encana a new company was born crestone peak resources llp which the cppib registered with the state of colorado as a foreign limited liability company in delaware and listed its principle address as one queen street east in toronto the canadian pension board reported paying encana 609 million approximately 30 percent less than the 900 million purchase price that had been announced just months earlier for the right to drill in residential areas of colorado s urban core the deal included more than 100 operating legacy wells in boulder county that pre dated larger scale hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling facilities in wide use today because of the controversy that s inevitable when wells are so close to homes and schools they re known among industry insiders as toxic assets in an interview encana spokesman doug hock said the fact that many of the company s production sites in colorado were in areas where there was growing resistance to oil and gas development was a factor in its decision to sell to the cppib he emphasized however that it wasn t the main one they were good wells but they didn t fit into our growth strategy he said crestone in an email from its public relations department said there was nothing unusual about the price drop it s very common in acquisitions for the valuation of a company to change from once the acquisition is announced to final closing its statement read crestone declined to discuss specifics of the sale or current valuation because it is a private company the deal was done canada pension plan investment board was moving full steam ahead into a colorado firestorm toxic assets canada unlike the united states remains a signatory to the paris climate agreement which seeks to harness a global response to climate change by limiting greenhouse gas emissions amid rising environmental and regulatory concerns at least three canadian provinces have enacted policies pausing fracking since 2013 the country s growing movement to limit and more tightly regulate its own drilling operations has not prevented the ccpib from investing in extraction companies around the world in announcing its acquisition of encana s u s subsidiary its managing director and head of natural resources avik dey made it clear that the deal was motivated by profits this investment offers attractive economics and aligns well with our strategy for the energy sector he said we look forward to working with our partner to create value and grow the business dey and other cppib directors serve or have served on crestone s board the cppib declined to comment on its investment in colorado despite multiple requests for an interview we refer all questions to crestone said darryl konynenbelt cppib s director of global media relations most canadians would be surprised to know they own a fracking oil company in colorado said john bennett a senior policy advisor to the environmental group friends of the earth canada denise melanson 70 is one such canadian a retired medical social worker who lives in richibucpo new brunswick she receives two pensions from the cppib one that she paid into during her years as a medical social worker and the other what she calls an old age benefit that she started receiving when she was 65 when she learned that some of her benefits might be coming from fracking operations in colorado she said in a phone interview i was horrified melanson had been involved in educating her community about the health and environmental impacts from fracking and in passing the moratorium in new brunswick it appalls me that we are doing that to other people instead she said i d much rather not be receiving money that was earned by making other people miserable though most residents of the gas patch where crestone owns operations do not know about the canadian connection some who do are dismayed by what they perceive as an insult by our seemingly friendly neighbor to the north i have to wonder if the beneficiaries of the pension fund s investments understand what they re investing in said boulder county commissioner elise jones as she tells it virtually every elected official in the county as well as the overwhelming majority of residents oppose the kind of drilling plans crestone has proposed and wish they could halt them concerns range from the planned drilling locations in and around homes schools and boulder county open space holdings to negative health effects from the industrial facilities emissions to the oil and gas industry s impact on the denver metropolitan area s persistently poor air quality to climate change impacts from fossil fuel developments do these pensioners know how much opposition there is to their investment jones wonders if they did they d realize this is not wise or ethical it boggles the mind the political play in addition to its purchase of encana s controversial oil and gas operations crestone also invested in colorado politics and public policy oil and gas issues figured prominently up and down the 2018 ballot from the governor s race between republican oil and gas booster walker stapleton and democratic one time fractivist jared polis to several ballot initiatives crestone peak contributed 607 500 toward the tens of millions of dollars the industry spent to defeat proposition 112 the setback initiative that would have required new oil and gas development to be placed at least 2 500 feet from homes and schools crestone also donated to the pro industry group protect colorado which campaigned to defeat 112 and to other political groups backing republican state legislative candidates who support the oil and gas industry federal law requires that foreign owned companies contributions to state campaigns meet a two part test that they must be drawn from money made from u s operations and that the person making the decision to donate is a u s citizen since crestone is a privately held canadian owned company whose only public financial disclosure indicates its value has declined since being formed in 2016 it is unclear where the money came from and who made the decision to contribute to the election how would you know asked austin graham legal counsel for the non partisan campaign legal center in washington d c about half of crestone s contributions went to the senate majority fund a 527 political organization that worked to keep the state senate controlled by republicans who had reliably killed any legislation opposed by the energy industry colorado law allows 527 groups to receive unlimited contributions from anybody including foreign entities said steve bouey the campaign finance program manager for the colorado secretary of state s office the other organizations that crestone contributed to include independent expenditure committees which are also allowed to legally receive contributions from foreign owned corporations a crestone spokesperson stated in an email that crestone follows all state and federal laws and as a company operating in colorado allocates a certain amount of funds each year to dedicate to organizations and initiatives that are important to our team crestone leadership ultimately makes the decision on which organizations these funds are donated to graham from the campaign legal center said regardless of whether any laws were broken the cppib spent a substantial amount of money trying to influence colorado voters i think it s worth bringing to the public s attention eerie colorado crestone has applied for a comprehensive drilling plan cdp to start drilling in boulder county but the applications for drilling permits are still awaiting approval from the cogcc which is slated to meet about crestone s application in late april in boulder if approved the plans will have to survive an ongoing lawsuit filed by boulder county that a judge recently ruled must wait for the cogcc s final determination to move forward if crestone prevails in court the company will be subject to boulder county s oil and gas regulations that went into place in march 2017 those regulations in turn are likely to be challenged in more lawsuits a bill that would impose greater regulation upon the industry statewide in part by beefing up local control of drilling is now moving through the state legislature if passed and signed by the governor as expected it may bolster boulder country s position the impacts of oil and gas development near residential areas are plain to see across the county line to the east in adjacent weld county which has 21 694 active wells residents have been powerless to stop multi well pads and mini industrial complexes from popping up near homes and school playgrounds at the same time new tract homes have been built within 120 feet of existing oil and gas facilities since state regulations allow local land use decisions when they involve approving subdivisions next to oil and gas infrastructure pressure to put some brakes on the industry in colorado has been mounting over the past decade several fires at oil and gas sites and a deadly 2017 home explosion in weld county in 2017 from an abandoned pipeline located less than 200 feet from a home in firestone only added to the tensions so have recent scientific reports that weld county s hydrocarbon production was sullying boulder county s air and contributing significantly to increasing air pollution in the denver metro region that pollution has placed colorado in the crosshairs of the environmental protection agency for its worsening non attainment of federal clean air standards perhaps no place illuminates these conflicts more than erie which straddles boulder and weld counties what was a sleepy farming community with a population of about 2 000 in 1990 has grown to a bedroom community of about 25 000 residents today the first citizen complaint against crestone s operations with the cogcc was filed on nov 16 2016 just three months after the cppib encana deal was finalized noise from a drilling operation smack in the middle of town was so loud it was like a huge semi truck parked in our driveway according to the anonymous complaint other complaints poured in reporting rumbling and shaking of erie homes pictures falling off of walls and disturbing vibrations night and day for weeks on end dank smells emanated from the drilling sites which were just a few hundred feet away from rows of large tract homes parks schools a skate park and even the city offices residents started a black humor joke that their town should be renamed eerie monica korber 58 who works as a business consultant from her erie home recalls trying to sleep with her bed shaking through the night she asked other neighbors if they had experienced the same thing and soon dozens of people were sharing stories on social media and asking what this new company crestone was doing to rattle their lives so viscerally we never got a straight answer korber said soon erie residents were complaining at cogcc meetings and on the agency s website about noxious smells leaks nosebleeds headaches industrial noises and lights burning all night outside their bedroom windows korber learned that crestone was applying for even more permits to drill and drove to denver last october to speak at a coggc meeting she scolded the commissioners with her best grandmother of five voice i bet that not one of you lives in erie not one of the nine commissioners does erie s experience with the company isn t isolated the number of complaints filed against crestone is almost twice as many as the next five oil and gas companies conducting business in colorado combined more than 1 000 complaints against crestone s operations were filed with the cogcc between november 2016 and february 2019 the company with the second highest number of grievances is extraction oil and gas another relatively new interest with holdings in many residential areas on the front range which has been the subject of 245 complaints over the same time period the other major operators in the d j basin including noble anadarko kerr mcgee pdc and src collectively had 350 complaints over the same time period one likely reason most of those other top producers are operating on agricultural lands or in much less populated areas jason oates crestone s spokesman repeatedly has stated that residents have abused the complaint process in erie by organizing complaining campaigns nevertheless crestone s public relations department wrote in an email that while none of the complaints resulted in a violation of state standards by the cogcc or the cdphe we knew we needed to make some changes in our operations we took an above and beyond approach to further lessen the temporary impacts that we may have on neighboring communities one such flurry of impacts and complaints came after crestone s operations caused a release of toxic gases at a site in erie just 25 yards from the aspen ridge preparatory school playground in september 2017 crestone was plugging and abandoning a set of wells and had been venting large quantities of volatile organic compounds vocs for an indeterminate amount of time before a resident smelled noxious fumes and complained to the cogcc the agency documented a large release of vocs related to oil and gas emissions that have been linked to a number of health problems in colorado and around the world including increased rates of asthma childhood leukemia and low birth weight babies those toxic emissions wafted directly onto the school playground of the kiddie academy childcare center and the elementary school according to the cogcc s report on the incident the cogcc ordered crestone to cease operations until the problem was fixed but parents say they didn t hear about the leak for months mark kadlececk who has three children at aspen ridge found the notice of alleged violation posted on the cogcc website on oct 25 more than six weeks after the violation kadlecek wrote to the cogcc and local elected officials sputtering outrage all three of my young children between the ages of 6 and 8 years old attend aspen ridge he wrote this is a place that i thought they would be safe common sense mandates that oil and gas operations do not belong in close proximity to homes and schools after the public outcry crestone issued a statement that was so bland it further inflamed residents we sincerely apologize for this oversight in its emailed statement crestone added activity at the location wrapped up with no further incidents the cogcc fined crestone 10 000 according to mike leonard the agency s community relations manager christiaan van woudenberg one of erie s newly elected trustees says that the aspen ridge incident and crestone s other operations have led to one frustration after another different complaints about noise or traffic or vibrations or smells or lights or emissions need to be reported to different agencies which frequently don t communicate with each other the bigger picture he says is that when companies like crestone come into a small community such as erie dangling potential tax revenue and arguing as crestone spokesman oates said at a community meeting that there are no health impacts from fracking it is almost impossible not to be steamrolled local elected officials in places like erie broomfield and boulder say they are hamstrung by state laws that limit their ability to say no to new oil and gas development erie is fracked van woudenberg said in an interview we lost we re the cautionary tale a fraught investment crestone continues to face legal challenges that are increasing its cost of doing business in colorado the company has been involved in lawsuits protests leaks and alleged violations of state regulations in multiple communities including in weld county and broomfield a fast growing city and county halfway between boulder and denver crestone in turn has sued the state and at least one other oil and gas company alleging interference in its operations from what is known about crestone s financial picture it hasn t performed well to date while crestone is private there are several clues that the cppib s colorado investment may be problematic as of feb 15 2019 the cppib s website stated that the value of the investment had dropped to 543 million from the purchase price of 609 million another possible clue about crestone s financial situation comes from extraction oil and gas which went public in october 2016 at almost the same time the encana cppib crestone deal was finalized it s not possible to make a well pad to well pad comparison between the two companies since one is publicly traded and one is private with substantially different corporate structures and reporting requirements still many characteristics are similar including the fact that both companies started by purchasing larger companies toxic assets in populated communities along the front range both are buffeted by the oil price roller coaster from highs above 100 a barrel in late 2014 to a low of below 40 in early 2016 and has only rebounded to the mid 50 range today extraction was trading for 23 a share around the time of its october 2016

about future regulatory regimes international price fluctuations and the increasingly competitive cost of renewable energy technology other investors remain bullish on oil stocks but are moving away

operations are losing money evidence mounts that oil and gas operations have significant and growing environmental and health impacts liability from abandoned wells is getting more attention and places like boulder county and california are aggressively moving toward decarbonizing their energy supply then there s climate change which looms over the fossil fuel investment debate canada faces some cognitive dissonance with the cppib s fossil fuel portfolio financial and legal analysts as well as climate activists point out that canada cannot export its fossil fuel investments and still claim it is moving to reduce its carbon footprint in a report released in january entitled it is time two canadian law professors janis sarra of the university of british columbia and cynthia williams of the osgoode hall law school at york university conclude that the cppib has enormous potential to help shift governance practice various organizations in canada have tried to push the cppib toward a more sustainable lower carbon portfolio without much success the cppib has expressly avoided committing itself only to sustainable and socially responsible investing erie calling edmonton at a january 2019 conference hosted by the rocky mountain mineral law foundation crestone spokesman jason oates told the audience that his company had met all of the requirements laid out by the colorado oil and gas conservation commission and would forge ahead into boulder county despite resident and local governments objections it is how not if we are going to drill oates said sara loflin executive director of the league of oil and gas impacted coloradans logic attended the conference and was struck by what she called the arrogance of oates remarks in response to multiple communities concerns ever since crestone started doing business in colorado loflin said the company has only proposed moving closer to homes in higher risk areas in larger scale developments in an email a crestone spokesperson disputed loflin s assessment and said the company aims to operate safely responsibly efficiently and with minimal impact on local communities while acting as good stewards for the land air and water this is a priority for us because as coloradans we value these natural assets and we live here too in new brunswick retiree melanson sympathizes with coloradans affected by crestone s plans and intends to write a letter to the cppib it s utterly indecent what they re doing she said i don t want my pension coming from things like that back in erie resident monica korber says that she and her

by doug casey prediction 1 the end of retirement the average american can forget about retirement we ve all heard these stories about how the average american couldn t lay his hands on 1 000 to save his life his expenses aren t going away however even if his income does it seems like things have reached a critical mass and if the economy slows down there are going to be a lot of people losing their homes again they ll be unable to pay their credit card bills their car payments their student loans or anything else they aren t going to be able to buy anything they wound up in breadlines in the 30s but today 40 million americans have snap cards to take away the hunger pains and embarrassment of being penniless there could be 100 million in a few years i know this sounds outrageous because right now everything is running fairly smoothly the standard of living of the average middle class american has degraded slowly over decades but hasn t yet totally collapsed but that s the way it is a day before a volcano explodes or a day before an earthquake or minutes before an avalanche starts coming down this isn t a theoretical discussion most retirement plans are in serious jeopardy many pension funds are already seriously underwater even after a very long boom the situation is likely to deteriorate the stock market is in a bubble the bond market is in a hyper bubble a lot of value could disappear very quickly by the time this depression bottoms in today s dollars i don t know what the dollars are going to be worth the dow could trade at 5 000 or less we re going to see interest rates exceed what we saw in the early 1980s when the u s government was paying 15 from a retiree s point of view things are not going to improve it s going to get worse not better his savings if he has any are going to be attacked from several angles i don t see any way out of this unless friendly aliens land on the roof of the white house and present trump with some kind of magic technology prediction 2 a white male privilege tax and other radical tax hikes you ve got to remember that the prime directive of any organism whether it s an amoeba a person a corporation or a government is to survive bankrupt governments and they re all bankrupt because of welfare state policies are going to fight to survive the only way that they can survive is to tax more and print more money and that s exactly what they re going to do of course don t discount a war these fools actually believe that would stimulate the economy the way only turning lots of cities into smoking ruins can i suspect they ll try to make white males bear most of the burden that s partly because they still have most of the money and partly because it s become fashionable to hate white males in particular it s natural to want to hurt people that they think are the problem what marxists would say are the class enemy we re going to see much higher taxes among other unsavory things there s no other way to pay for welfare state programs except sell more debt to the fed which they ll also do by necessity inflation will get out of control as a result of course you ve got to remember that as recently as the eisenhower administration the top marginal tax rate was theoretically 91 the average person didn t pay anywhere remotely near that because it was a steeply progressive tax rate nobody did frankly especially the rich because there were loads of tax shelters which no longer exist hiding money offshore among other things was easy now these things are out of the question now there s no place to hide from the state and envy is rampant how bad could it get in sweden during the 1970s the marginal tax rate including their wealth tax was something like 102 so almost anything is possible of course they ll raise taxes radically it s time to eat the rich prediction 3 like venezuela socialism will conquer the u s its ideas already have first we should define what socialism is it s state ownership of the means of production it was supposed to be a passing stage on the road to communism communism is communal ownership of private goods houses cars shops and consumer items as well as capital goods nobody even talks about that anymore since capitalism has given most people so much stuff that they don t even have room to store it all we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us socialism in the u s is unlikely governments have found it s much more efficient to simply have the state control capital as opposed to owning and operating it it s so much easier to just take as much as they want of the profits then blame the capitalists if something goes wrong with delivery of the goods forgetting about north korea and cuba there are no socialist states anywhere in the world what we have instead are welfare states where the government provides some degree of free schooling free medical care free housing free food and so forth if not free then subsidized the next step is a guaranteed annual income the word socialism today is actually just shorthand for a welfare state which is what boobus americanus the hoi polloi really want they don t really care who owns the factories the fields and the mines what they care about is that somebody gives them a soft life when you give people the ability to vote themselves free stuff at somebody else s expense they ll do it but much worse they now actually think it s the right thing to do why mainly because of the propaganda that they ve absorbed through college and the media the entertainment world and numerous other places there s no question about the fact that the u s will turn into a full fledged welfare state socialism is basically about the forceful control of other people s lives and property it isn t just an intellectual failing it s actually a moral failing although perversely it s sold as being moral people buy it because they like to believe they re doing the right thing it will end with an economic collapse then a political and most importantly a cultural collapse prediction 4 a new 9 11 type event real or a contrived false flag it s entirely possible it s still completely undetermined what actually happened on 9 11 and who was actually behind it notwithstanding that considering how the u s government continues to provoke people all over the world there s certainly some group most likely mohammedans who ll decide to strike out against the great satan and as 9 11 showed regardless of who was actually responsible a very small number of people can have a very large effect on things especially when the system itself is critically unstable which it is today they might do something like mumbai in 2008 it took only two dozen fanatics with ordinary guns they turned the whole city totally on its head for days that was extremely cheap low tech and easy warfare has always been a matter of economics cheap trumps expensive there are scores of ways to severely disrupt an advanced society for a trivial investment on the other hand it s extremely expensive to disrupt a primitive society as the u s is discovering in afghanistan anyway terrorism is an extremely low cost method of warfare it will have a gigantic effect when someone decides to use it in the u s 9 11 was just an amuse bouche you can plan your life around something like that happening again the world is evolving at the rate of moore s law in many regards let me emphasize that military technology is changing too aircraft carriers b2s f35s m1 tanks and so forth are basically junk great for fighting the soviet union which no longer exists they serve no useful purpose in the kind of battles that are likely in the future if someone wants to attack the u s they re not going to use an icbm they re extremely expensive clunky and you can see where they come from guaranteeing retaliation it s total idiocy that even a maniac wouldn t bother with not when you can deliver a backpack nuke by fedex cheap and on time or you could use any commercial aircraft container ship or truck if you want to blame iran and really whip up the u s population there would be nothing like a small nuclear or radiological attack to do it it s a pity since they re a distant regional power with a failing economy who present about zero threat to the u s if i were to attempt putting my finger on exactly when the u s will go over the edge i would think the real catalyst might be the next 9 11 type event i don t doubt it s going to happen how are we any different than the germans in the 1920s they were one of the most civilized best educated countries in europe and they fell into the abyss
donald trump said he s nominating stephen moore a visiting fellow at the heritage foundation and a long time supporter of the president for a seat on the federal reserve board trump made the announcement friday to reporters traveling with him to palm beach florida confirming an earlier bloomberg news report the president later said in a tweet that moore is a very respected economist and said he has no doubt he will be an outstanding choice moore has emerged as an ardent critic of the federal reserve board under its current chairman jerome powell who fell out of favor with trump

guest post by joel bowman earlier in the week we wrote about a great convulsion of stupidity sweeping across the geopolitical spectrum want proof here s reuters with some paris a strong majority of people in wealthy countries want to tax the rich more and there is broad support for building up the welfare state in most countries a survey conducted for the oecd showed on tuesday in all of the 21 countries surveyed more than half of those people polled said they were in favour when asked should the government tax the rich more than they currently do in order to support the poor the oecd gave no definition of rich higher taxation of the rich has emerged as a political lightning rod in many wealthy countries with u s democrats proposing hikes and yellow vest protesters in france demanding the wealthy bear a bigger tax burden support was highest in portugal and greece both emerging from years of economic crisis at nearly 80 percent compared with an average of 68 percent the organisation for economic cooperation and development said imagine dear and patient reader asking the fattest man in the room for dietary tips or visiting a debtor s prison in search of investment advice or probing a celibate preacher for guidance in the realm of oh never mind you get the idea and yet here we are urged to take economic advice from the portuguese and the hellenes don t get us wrong we have nothing against the slow mediterranean lifestyle we love whiling away lazy afternoons on the iberian peninsular and we have an incurable affinity for greek culture and the classics in general but the portuguese are hardly ones to look to for guidance in matters financial as for the greeks they ve spent more than half their modern history either in outright sovereign default or on some kind of debt restructuring program a few years back while on tour around the aegean we were impelled to write about the ongoing greek tragedy for our friends at classical wisdom weekly see here the delian default but suppose we were to take counsel from these dubious stewards of economic prosperity what then alas it appears many on the progressive left in the u s are already heeding the sirens call take the ancestrally ambiguous democratic senator from massachusetts elizabeth warren the 2020 presidential hopeful wants to introduce an unconstitutional wealth tax on the tippy top of american citizens whether or not these individuals built their pile through voluntary trade or political graft doesn t seem to matter much to senator warren and certainly she has no incentive to pose the question according to public financial disclosure forms filed with federal election officials earlier this year warren and her academic professor husband have a combined net worth between 4 million and 11 million what matters of course is that rich people have money and warren wants it and she s not the only one with her eye on other people s prize take rising star of the left freshperson congressperson alexandria ocasio cortez aoc wants to levy a top marginal tax rate of 70 on the nation s high earners to help pay for a range of new government programs and initiatives others want even more economists peter diamond and emmanuel saez say the top rate should be slightly higher 73 and what discussion of other people s money would be complete without mention of vermont senator and part time doc brown impersonator bernie sanders in january of this year the bern introduced his for the 99 8 percent act in which he called for a dramatic expansion of the estate tax the top rate under his new death tax plan 77 then there are outright calls to simply abolish billionaires but what will all these confiscatory proposals achieve you might be wondering sanders squad reckons his plan will raise 2 2 trillion over ten years warren s nest predicts a 2 7 trillion haul for their team over the same period aoc isn t quite sure about the exact amount but rich people are bad anyway so of course these tactics well known to the submerging mediterranean economies may be just the beginning the thin edge of the proverbial wedge so let s fast forward a little to see what might be in store for socialist america in fact let s take the idea to its most extreme hypothetical end reductio ad absurdum forget mealy mouthed soak the rich measures in other words let s outright drown the bastards according to forbes there are 540 billionaires in the united states with a combined net worth of 2 4 trillion let s say we confiscate all their wealth raze their properties liquidate their bank accounts storm their corporate board rooms shut down their commercial interests at home and abroad never mind that without these companies employing millions of people walmart alone feeds 2 1 million greeters stackers drivers helpers etc welfare claims might suddenly spike and don t fret when tax receipts subsequently collapse and the country s gdp completely hollows out either we ll deal with that later for now the modus operandi is simple just steal everything ok now that we ve drowned the wealthiest producers in the country squeezed every drop of capital from their miserly clasp what now well we ve got a whopping 2 4 trillion in our back pocket time to plug some wealth gaps to go welfare shopping to fund some new new deals time for the biggest virtue signaling project funded by stolen money in modern history how far do you suppose one might get with such a grand haul potus 2019 budget weighs in at 4 7 trillion including a 750 billion increase to the military and 8 6 billion for the wall on current spending trajectories that stolen loot the entire wealth of the billionaire class is blown in just 6 months and that s not counting the cost of all the unicorn and rainbow programs promised to constituents in order to justify robbing the barons in the first place so even before thanksgiving this year deficits begin to widen again the national debt explodes and the economy resumes its inexorable march toward bankruptcy frustrated and forlorn we turn once again to the greek sages and the portuguese soothsayers for advice don t worry they assuage us go talk to your rich

president donald trump said friday that he will nominate stephen moore a conservative economic analyst and frequent critic of the federal reserve to fill a vacancy on the fed s seven member board moore a well known and often polarizing figure in washington political circles served as an adviser to trump during the 2016 campaign in that role he helped draft trump s tax cut plan trump has been harshly critical of the fed s rate increases even after the central bank announced this week that it foresees no hikes this year moore formerly chief economist for the conservative heritage foundation has also been critical of the policies of chairman jerome powell a fervent advocate of tax cuts moore is close to larry kudlow head of the white house national economic council the two collaborated in shaping the tax overhaul that trump signed into law at the end of 2017 leading to changes that largely favored tax cuts for corporations and wealthier individuals with the idea of spurring investment and growth story continues below advertisement watch federal reserve chair says case for raising interest rates has weakened 1 37 federal reserve chair says case for raising interest rates has weakened moore interviewed friday on bloomberg television after trump s announcement said his criticism of the fed including his suggestion that powell should perhaps be fired were probably written in a time of anger i think everyone would now acknowledge moore added that what they did in december with the rate increase was a very substantial mistake and the fed has thank god reversed that and changed directions asked whether trump might want him on the fed s board to check powell s influence and protect the administration s economic policies moore said the only thing trump told me was pursue policies that are good for the american workers he didn t really mention anything about differing with chairman powell one way or the other story continues below advertisement moore s nomination which the senate must confirm drew sharp criticism from some economists and historians breaking news from canada and around the world sent to your email as it happens it s unprecedented in the modern era particularly because he lacks expertise in areas under the fed s supervision like banking and monetary policy said gary richardson a historian of the fed and a professor at the university of california at irvine scott sumner the chair of monetary policy at george mason university s mercatus center said his concern is that moore accused the fed of providing too much aid after the 2008 financial crisis when the economy depended on help from the central bank moore has since urged the fed to be more generous in supporting the economy even though growth has strengthened in the past two years and less help is needed his policies appear to be going the wrong way sumner said watch the fed has gone crazy trump blasts federal reserve for raising interest rates 0 34 the fed has gone crazy trump blasts federal reserve for raising interest rates given his sharply partisan reputation moore could spark opposition among democrats in the senate but trump can score points with his core supporters and with the majority republicans in the senate by embracing a conservative activist for a fed role that would make him a watchdog over the economy story continues below advertisement freedomworks is proud to see president trump offer such a prestigious position to one of our own said adam brandon president of that conservative advocacy group i have no doubt that stephen moore would make an excellent member of the federal reserve board trump in his first two years in office has been able to reshape the central bank he nominated four of the current five members and he tapped powell who had been chosen for the fed board by president barack obama to succeed janet yellen as chairman if confirmed by the senate moore would fill one of two vacancies on the board the selection of moore marks a deviation from trump s previous choices for the board toward a more public figure who has long pushed conservative economic and political ideology in a march editorial in the wall street journal moore estimated that fed rate policies had reduced inflation adjusted economic growth by as much as 1 5 percentage points in the past six months moore proposed that the fed set short term rates with an eye toward stabilizing commodity prices rather than solely on overall inflation this approach moore has argued would have prevented the fed from raising rates as much as it has and he contended that this approach if adopted would help accelerate economic growth above 3 percent compared with the longer run average of 1 9 percent that fed officials have forecast story continues below advertisement watch markets fall after trump places tariffs on china 0 57 markets fall after trump places tariffs on china moore has often embraced a confrontational tone in his commentary on the fed in a 2012 wall street journal column he suggested that the chairman at the time ben bernanke had kept rates near zero and arranged for the fed to buy bonds in order to help barack obama win re election rather than help the economy recover from the financial crisis and great recession moore had earlier predicted in 2010 that the fed s low rates would ignite inflation and he advised investors to buy gold he pressed his case in 2011 warning on fox news we re starting to see that specter of inflation his warnings of runaway inflation proved off base the average inflation rate would fall from 3 1 percent in 2011 to near zero in 2015 story continues below advertisement with trump as president moore became a sharp critic of fed policies to shrink its balance sheet and return rates to what the central bank sees as a neutral level neither stimulating nor hindering growth he went so far as to suggest that trump might consider trying to fire powell for the rate hikes under his watch what the law says i believe is trump can replace the federal reserve chairman for cause moore said during a december radio interview and you know i would say well the cause is that he s wrecking our economy moore has frequently praised the administration on television and he co wrote the 2018 book trumponomics his partner on that book was art laffer who pioneered the republican doctrine that lower tax rates would accelerate economic growth in ways that could minimize debt but federal debt has jumped since trump s overhaul to the tax code surging nearly 77 per cent through the first four months of fiscal 2019 compared with the previous year

because companies based in fossil fuels were reinvesting a significant proportion of revenues from core business back into research and development r d in the early part of the decade the oil majors had investment portfolios that included solar wind hydrogen and biofuels bp and shell in particular developed successful photovoltaics pv businesses manufacturing modules based on crystalline si and thin film cuinse 2 respectively although by the mid 2000s the cost of electricity from solar pv was still prohibitively high prompting both bp and shell to exit solar pv they continued to focus investments in renewables including wind and a sector naturally aligned to hydrocarbon supply chains biofuels there is perhaps no better illustration of this period of exceptional economic growth than the march of the price of crude to an all time high of just over 145 barrel in july 2008 at which point the global economy crashed spectacularly and crude dropped to under 50 barrel in just six months as the ramifications of the global financial crisis gfc emerged the oil price reflected investor uncertainty towards the end of the decade with such uncertainty the oil majors divested significantly to focus on core large scale oil and gas projects this included in 2010 shell s exit from the london array wind farm which at the time was the world s biggest wind project the future for renewable energy seemed bleak step forward renewables a uk case study 2008 2018 in the uk government policy in response to the gfc was a reduction in public spending yet while other sectors suffered from funding cuts the government continued to deliver on a commitment to introduce a financial incentive scheme for renewable energy technologies known as feed in tariffs fits these had been successful in other countries such as germany and provided a key mechanism to achieve linked sustainability targets to curb co 2 emissions mandated by the government and the european union informed by pv system performance research at northumbria university the fit set for domestic pv installations offered an attractive return on investment for consumers of 10 20 over the course of 25 years depending on installation costs this was in stark contrast to savings rates on the high street that after factoring in inflation offered a negative return on investment the cost of the fit scheme was in fact borne by energy suppliers which in turn passed this on to consumers as a result under strong political pressure to reduce the cost of energy bills the uk government acted swiftly to ensure this window of opportunity lasted only 18 months by halving the fit rate in december 2011 nevertheless the overall result of the fit scheme was to increase the installed capacity of domestic pv installations in the uk by two orders of magnitude in just over two years from its introduction in other words an increase of 350 000 systems mostly on the roofs of houses this remarkable growth in domestic pv installations in the uk is only one part of a solar story in the uk which resulted in pv contributing a quarter of the total electricity supply on a sunny day in may 2017 growth in ground mounted solar farms in the 5 25 mw range kicked in early in 2013 slightly later than domestic systems most likely as a result of the longer incubation times associated with more complex planning and grid connection issues ultimately these projects became increasingly attractive large scale investments due to falling pv module prices by 2018 they added approximately 4 gw of supply which is around a third of today s overall pv capacity of around 12 gw for wind energy the story is just as compelling when one considers that in the uk alone 29 3 of electricity generation came from renewable energy fuel sources in 2017 and exactly half of this generation was from wind turbines this demonstrated strong growth from 2010 when wind energy contributed approximately 2 5 of electricity supply and provided a key contribution to energy security while meeting emissions targets similar to solar pv the main driver of this growth was also the introduction of financial incentive schemes notably although wind energy essentially remains subsidized in this market solar pv is moving rapidly towards being subsidy free while crucially remaining competitive the bigger picture present in contrast to the pv electricity share in the uk globally this figure stands at just 1 7 indicating plenty of untapped market potential history tells us that this figure is strongly sensitive to local subsidies which for example appear to have worked well in germany and the uk but not in spain where an over generous incentive scheme ultimately resulted in a solar tax in that case those who installed renewable energy technologies were ironically penalized because the incentive scheme rapidly became unaffordable the spanish case aside the biggest story in solar today is that the levelized cost of electricity lcoe from pv is now competitive with fossil fuel based sources the driver behind this trend is chinese pv manufacturers who continue to sell modules at barely more than the cost of raw materials despite european and us anti dumping policies some of these companies have posted very recent profit warnings that if reproduced across the sector will result in price stabilization or even rises however for now a notable consequence of the drop in the lcoe from pv alongside the paris agreement of 2016 is the market re entry of both bp and shell with recent investments in solar farms including bp s lightsource and shell s silicon ranch new technologies and sustainability challenges 2018 2030 so what do the past 18 years tell researchers working on advanced materials for energy first and foremost we need to be realistic and accept that for large scale power generation cost is fundamental in 2018 the pv market was 95 crystalline silicon this is sustained by the growth of large scale solar farms which have continued to drive down pv module prices through economies of scale to the extent that they may be considered almost a commodity product despite their success so far these pv modules are not necessarily suitable for new applications enabled by massive proliferation in distributed and interconnected devices because of scale limitations and the reliance on conventional less versatile semiconductor wafer processing fabrication tesla had some success in achieving miniaturization with their tesla solar roof tiles which look like regular tiles but operate as solar cells however although they created a lot of excitement on their release in 2016 they are seemingly not cheap or quick to install and so far uptake has been limited that said if efforts to overcome issues of scale and fabrication are successful in sectors such as transport and healthcare pv modules could offer benefits beyond basic power generation for example they could provide complementary or back up power sources that reduce range anxiety for electronic vehicle users facilitate ultra long flight for low orbit earth observation power small scale portable devices and generally provide a safety net for devices primarily fuelled by other means the combination of offering new benefits at a smaller more distributed scale would mean that pv doesn t have to compete with fossil fuels on a purely kwh basis pv technologies with new properties and functionalities such as thin film and perovskite which can be synthesized in solution on flexible substrates could then compete more effectively analysis reveals a relative insensitivity to the oil price but a sensitivity to subsidization an additional factor in recent pv competitiveness is appropriate integration with battery storage for example the recent installation of a 10 mw solar farm in bedfordshire uk without subsidy was enabled by the installation of a 6 mw battery there can be no doubt that the development of lithium batteries is enabling new applications such as electric aerotaxis where correct pv battery systems integration is vital but there is an important distinction from pv materials lithium is approximately 10 000 times less earth abundant than silicon comparison with indium suggests that although earth abundance will be important for cost it may not be prohibitive indium has been commercialized successfully in high value products such as indium tin oxide displays despite being 100 times scarcer than lithium toxicity is potentially a larger barrier to commercialization and has been identified as a strategic issue for sustainable innovation by the european commission most commercial solar pv modules are certified to the international electrotechnical commission s requirement of 0 8 degradation per year for 25 years which defines a natural timescale for replacement this means that new high efficiency pv technologies based on materials innovations for example in nanotechnology must be proven with a distinct value proposition as early as 2030 in mature markets where widespread replacement may occur within a relatively limited period however with materials sustainability also now a key driver researchers must add the lifecycle of an energy material to performance criteria replacement of pv modules also presents specific recycling challenges and while the aluminium frames have clear and accessible value encapsulated high value elements such as silver coated tabbing wires are technically more challenging and energy intensive to recover nevertheless this is an area that offers opportunities for innovation and is not unique to a particular pv cell technology similar to pv modules a typical wind turbine can be expected to be in operation for 20 25 years and replacement in a sector that has seen enormous recent expansion will generate significant quantities of materials excess again some components masts nacelles will be compatible with existing recycling supply chains but turbine blades which are glass or carbon fibre composites are not new and economic separation processes and approaches that target the interface between materials will be increasingly valuable analysis of the past 18 years in renewable and sustainable energy reveals a relative insensitivity to the oil price but a sensitivity to subsidization too little incentive makes it difficult to achieve critical mass while too much incentive defeats the objective however by the time effective subsidies are introduced technologies are a long way from the laboratory electric vehicles are an example application where critical mass has not yet been achieved although global leader norway is the exception with approximately 39 2 market penetration but although subsidy levels may vary from country to country they will universally apply to technology that is lithium based this is challenging for energy materials researchers particularly in the context of funding objectives that are increasingly linked to economic prosperity in the near term the materials innovations that have the greatest chance of success are those that play to new and niche markets in generation and storage together with those that enable energy efficiency and recovery of high value materials through viable recycling in the long term certain constraints will become more relaxed because the provision of new benefits such as autonomous battery recharging will provide a competitive advantage for pv technologies that are currently too expensive or have too short a shelf life to compete with silicon ultimately those who can convert energy cost competitively at the point of use have a strong proposition acknowledgements the author is particularly grateful to alex savidis of narec

stephen moore is a living embodiment of the sucking intellectual void at the core of conservative economics an inept pundit who has spent his career evangelizing the supply side dogma that tax cuts pay for themselves while shilling for republican officeholders all from well paid perches at think tanks and in the media lately the man has remade himself as a sycophantic hype man for donald trump s economic program after advising the president on tax policy during his campaign and now he may be headed to the federal reserve trump announced on twitter friday that he would nominate moore for a spot on the central bank s board of governors which would give him a say over its monetary policy decisions advertisement moore has bounced around elite gop circles over the decades as a sort of economic apparatchik and hack for hire in 1999 he co founded the club for growth a conservative advocacy group that pushes for tax cuts and served as its president until an angry group of board members booted him from the organization he landed at the wall street journal s editorial board and later became chief economist at the heritage foundation despite his lack of a ph d these days he s a distinguished visiting fellow there through his years of preaching tax cuts and deregulation as the one true path to growth he s acquired a reputation among economists a bit of a clown as paul krugman s put it predicting that bill clinton s tax hikes would bring disaster they didn t that george w bush s tax cuts would bring prosperity they didn t and that barack obama s policies were setting us up for 70s style stagflation they didn t in one amusing incident he managed to get banned from the pages of the kansas city star after one of his syndicated columns turned out to be factually impaired he and supply side guru art laffer were also key advisers behind kansas fiscally and politically disastrous tax cuts in spite of his own track record of failed predictions he has disparaged keynesian macroeconomics as witchcraft moore is in other words a bog standard republican commentator whose actual forays into policy have been a hash he was not always a trumpist however early in the 2016 republican primary he and fellow supply side media celebrity larry kudlow then a cnbc host wrote a national review article attacking trump s immigration and trade policies which clashed with old conservative orthodoxy later on however the two of them were drafted to help rewrite trump s tax plan and the pair became converts recently moore has co written a book about the glories of the president s policies titled trumponomics and served as a pro white house talking head on cnn advertisement if he is confirmed to the fed moore will almost certainly act as a reliable toady for the president he has spent much of his energy recently echoing trump s own complaints about the central bank savaging it for raising interests and claiming incorrectly that it has created widespread deflation while blaming it for putting a damper on trump s booming economy he has gone so far as to suggest the fed should be fired for economic malpractice unsurprisingly trump reportedly offered moore the fed job after reading one of his recent op eds thrashing the central bank advertisement advertisement advertisement donald trump wanted to drain the swamp he said in a recent interview with john catsimatidis well john the fed is the swamp the big question now that s been debated about is whether donald trump has the authority as president to replace the federal reserve chairman the law says he can replace the federal reserve chairman for cause i would say well the cause is that he s wrecking our economy note trump can t actually do that advertisement this is all unsurprisingly a bit of a reversal for moore who spent much of the obama years worrying that monetary policy was too loose he told glenn beck that the fed s money printing could lead to zimbabwe style hyperinflation and called the bank s bond buying program known as quantitative easing crack cocaine for wall street when other nations have tried to print their way to prosperity the story hasn t had a happy ending for argentina bolivia mexico and others easy money policies have crashed state economies and ended in misery he wrote he also chastised the federal reserve for not raising interest rates in september 2015 suggesting that janet yellen was setting the stage for another financial crisis fast forward a few years and he s sweatily demanding that the fed put more liquidity into the economy for the sake of a republican president advertisement advertisement how much harm could moore do at the fed probably not much for now his dovish instincts like trump s are directionally correct even if his talk about deflation is mostly nonsense the fed itself recently paused its interest rate hikes and while moore s specific recommendations on monetary policy are a little frightening he wants to peg interest rates to a basket of commodities which among other things would mean china s demand for raw goods would help determine our macroeconomic policies the man will be just one vote out of 12 on the federal open market committee which makes interest rate calls moore is also not the only republican to suddenly lose his devotion to hard money after spending the obama years calling for it heck he s not the only potential conservative fed nominee to reverse himself on it when it comes to monetary policy hypocrisy is the party line for the gop what is a bit disconcerting is that moore could be around for the next democratic president at which point we can probably count on him to push for decisions that sabotage growth advertisement advertisement but while moore might be an irredeemable hack trump s decision to offer him this job actually does say something positive about his own intellectual growth as a president for more than a year now trump has raged about the fed s hawkishness on inflation while failing to nominate candidates who actually share his views about easy money now finally he seems to have realized that the best way to influence the central bank isn t to tweet angrily about it it s to nominate people to it who will do absolutely whatever he wants
wall street was roiled friday by new signs that global economic growth is slowing the jitters triggered a sell off in stocks and sent bond yields sharply lower flashing a possible recession warning wall street was roiled friday by new signs that global economic growth is slowing the jitters triggered a sell off in stocks and sent bond yields sharply lower flashing a possible recession warning the wave of selling knocked 460 points off the dow jones industrial average and gave the benchmark s p 500 index its worst day since jan 3 the russell 2000 index of smaller company stocks fell more than the rest of the market as traders offloaded risker assets worried investors shifted money into bonds which sent yields much lower the yield on the 10 year treasury dropped to 2 43 percent from 2 54 percent late thursday a big move the slide in bond yields hurt bank stocks which along with technology companies accounted for much of the broad decline in stocks the utilities sector was the only one to eke out a gain what s really giving investors concern today is this weak global economic data here in the u s and in europe said jeff kravetz regional investment director for u s bank wealth management smaller company stocks are often the first to be sold by investors looking to reduce risk which explains why the russell 2000 was down more than the rest of the market small companies which are more dependent on the u s economy than big multinationals tend so suffer more in economic downturns when investors feel nervous about the economy and the outlook for the stock market they want to sell the riskiest types of stocks and that would definitely be small caps kravetz said the s p 500 index dropped 54 17 points or 1 9 percent to 2 800 71 the dow gave up 460 19 points or 1 8 percent to 25 502 32 the nasdaq composite which is heavily weighted with technology stocks slid 196 29 points or 2 5 percent to 7 642 67 the russell 2000 lost 56 49 points or 3 6 percent to 1 505 92 european stocks also finished sharply lower friday despite wavering from gains to losses throughout the week the s p 500 index is still up more than 11 percent so far in 2019 which still counts as a blockbuster start to a year the fear that gripped investors friday was fueled by a steadily dimming outlook for the global economy china the world s second largest economy after the united states is weakening and other economies that depend heavily on purchases in china have suffered as a result factory production in the euro currency alliance for instance has fallen at its steepest rate in about six years in germany europe s largest economy a survey of purchasing manager manufacturers posted its sharpest production drop in nearly six years orders to german factories have also tumbled key bond yields fell this week to their lowest levels in more than a year after the federal reserve said it was seeing slower growth in the economy and no longer expected to raise interest rates this year the yield on the benchmark 10 year treasury note which is used to set rates on mortgages and many other kinds of loans is now sharply lower from its recent high of 3 23 percent in early october in another worrying sign the yield on the 10 year treasury note fell friday below the yield on the three month treasury bill when that kind of inversion in bond yields occurs economists fear that it can signal a recession within the coming year that signal isn t always correct however the prospects of slowing global economic growth has motivated investors to rebalance their holdings as they digest the new reality said marina severinovsky investment strategist at schroeders we re sort of coming back to earth central banks have been positioning themselves to deal with the slowdown she said and that includes the federal reserve s expectations for no rate increases this year earlier this month the european central bank said it would push back the earliest date for interest rate increases it also said it would offer ultra cheap loans to banks supporting their ability to keep lending it s very positive that not just the fed but other policy makers have acknowledged the situation is kind of dangerous on the global slowdown and are taking action severinovsky said the decline in bond yields threatened the profitability of banks because it forces them to charge lower interest rates on loans bank of america slid 4 2 percent jpmorgan chase lost 3 percent citigroup dropped 4 6 percent and wells fargo fell 3 1 percent technology companies which would stand to lose more than other sectors in

oil and petroleum products carolyn kissane academic director and clinical professor at the center for global affairs at new york university leads the conversation on the geopolitics of oil faskianos thank you welcome to the final session of the winter spring 2023 cfr academic webinar series i m irina faskianos vice president of the national program and outreach here at cfr today s discussion is on the record and the video and transcript will be available on our website cfr org academic if you would like to share these materials with your colleagues or classmates as always cfr takes no institutional positions on matters of policy we are delighted to have carolyn kissane with us to discuss the geopolitics of oil dr kissane is the academic director of both the graduate program in global affairs and the graduate program in global security conflict and cybercrime at nyu s center for global affairs where she is also a clinical professor she also serves as director of the energy climate justice and sustainability lab in the school of professional studies at nyu she was named in 2013 by breaking energy as one of the top ten new york women in energy and top ten energy communicator she s a member of the council on foreign relations and the national committee on u s china relations and serves on several boards so carolyn thanks very much for doing this we really appreciate it i thought we could begin by talking about how has the geopolitics of oil changed especially vis à vis russia s war in ukraine and opec s recent announcement to cut oil production kissane well first of all i d just like to say thank you so very much for having me i m really delighted i am a big fan of cfr s academic webinars so to have the opportunity to participate in this in this way is very meaningful to me so thank you so wow there is so much happening in this space the geopolitics of oil this has been a tremendous fourteen months russia s reinvasion of ukraine very much upended the geopolitics of oil because russia is a significant producer one of the top three in the world and it s you know it s caused a kind of a reshaping a kind of a remapping of the of oil geopolitics and we ve seen some you know shifts in how countries think about oil security in light of larger questions about broader energy security questions and also on top of that is the ongoing energy transition coupled with you know climate change and the need to decarbonize so there s just it s been quite a you know a year and a half that has really sort of put energy security and oil security very much at the forefront of people s minds faskianos fantastic i thought maybe you had some really interesting data to show us and if you could walk us through those the trends you are seeing and really bring it to life that would be fantastic kissane sure so before i do i have a couple of slides and before i share my slides i think it s really important that sort of we understand how interconnected sort of the global energy system is and how interconnected we are when it comes to the flows of oil you know some countries are very well resourced endowed so they have oil and other countries do not so they need to import oil there s really no country in the world that doesn t need oil for larger national security issues and i think one of things that many people sort of are not necessarily aware of or think about is the amount of oil that gets produced every day so every day the world consumes over 100 million barrels a day and every day that 100 million barrels has to be has to be moved it has to be you know as part of getting it into the system getting it to its respective destinations and what we re not seeing which maybe some people may have thought that we would see at this point is we re not seeing a reduction in demand but we re seeing an expansion in demand and much of that global demand is coming out of asia and we re also of course seeing the with the reopening of china lots of really interesting questions as to what oil demand will be in china for the 2023 2024 years whether or not they will they will sort of put extra pressure on global demand and you know irina just also you know it s i m going to share this in my slides but you know last week s decision from opec to reduce production of course had an impact on the price of oil so when the decision was announced on sunday by monday morning we saw an uptick in the price it s stabilized but we are sort of looking at 80 plus a barrel oil and again lots of uncertainty as to what that s going to mean across economies that are in recessions experiencing sort of the beginnings of a recession and sort of what does it mean for the global economy where we may see sort of more energy inflation so one of the things that i really like to do when i teach the geopolitics of oil is sort of show some visuals because i think again sort of really reinforcing the interconnected nature of our global energy system but also sort of seeing where in the world is oil produced and where in the world are the are the importers and also just a couple of sort of fun pieces on what we have seen just this you know in the last week of course some of this you ll be familiar with those in the audience but this decision on the part of opec to reduce production by 1 2 million barrels a day again happening at a time not when we have an excess supply but when we re seeing a tight supply across the oil market so it came as a bit of a surprise to you know to even the most you know longstanding analysts and opec observers and again part of this is directed probably toward self interests on the part of saudi arabia and the oil producers that are really going to make the cuts but of course it also has an impact here for those of you that are sitting in the united states what does it mean then for prices that americans pay at the gas pump so the biden administration sort of came out after this decision was made in sort of being disappointed surprised that opec would make this decision now it s also important to sort of recognize that this is not just a singular opec decision this is part of now a larger opec and opec does also include russia as well as other countries like kazakhstan and mexico so the opec that we have historically known is now different because you have other countries that are not official members but nonetheless are part of what we now refer to as opec and these are the countries that are part of opec and really the country that s considered to be sort of in the driver s seat of opec is that of saudi arabia because saudi arabia is the largest producer within the opec organization producing anywhere from 10 to 11 million barrels a day venezuela has the largest reserves but it is far from being at capacity in terms of what it can what it can produce so just to kind of put that into perspective these are opec countries and their respective reserves and then non opec the united states being a non opec country but again this sort of this chart to the right shows you know again the world is consuming a little over 100 million barrels a day expected to increase over 2023 and into 2024 question marks as to when we may see peak oil demand but again to sort of link this to energy security energy security especially when it s in the context of oil security is making sure that we have adequate supply at affordable prices so when we see a reduction in supply at a time of tight markets that suggests that we re also going to see higher prices that s going to directly hit vulnerable economies and so again just to sort of point out sort of where in the world sort of are the top three oil producers the united states saudi arabia and russia russia remains in the top three canada as well our you know neighbor to the north and china is also a producer of oil the united states figure here also includes gas liquefied so liquid petroleum which the united states is endowed with a lot of both oil and natural gas and then the top oil consuming countries you have u s china and india now the united states is not the largest importer that position is now held by china but as far as consumption goes we consume over 20 million barrels a day again big question mark about china in terms of whether or not we will see higher demand coming out of china over the next year two years with china s reopening and what is being you know discussed as revenge tourism and more chinese who have accumulated a lot of savings 2 1 trillion how are they going to use that savings and whether or not after three years of being under lockdown restrictions whether or not we ll see impacts to demand and i think russia is there s lots of questions about russia and this is now we re fourteen months into you know russia s reinvasion of ukraine and i emphasize reinvasion because oftentimes we forget that you know russia invaded ukraine in 2014 but russia is still moving its oil and up until you know a few months ago its overall production and exports were as high at some points even higher than pre invasion now you have new countries that are takers of russian oil and they re buying it at discounted prices we see turkey singapore china has been a big buyer as well as india that they have been buying discounted russian oil lots of interesting questions that we could discuss about the oil price cap and seaborne embargo to europe but i think the takeaway from this slide is that russia continues to produce oil continues to sell it selling at a discounted price but there are still many countries in the world that are eager to take russian oil and again i m not going to go into this but i just love this slide to just emphasize the you know the world s pipelines these are the pipelines that help sort of the transit of oil something also that s really unique and interesting to look at is just tanker traffic so the tankers that carry oil around the world but again you know there are a lot of pipelines so twenty three two thousand three hundred and eighty one operational oil and gas pipelines again these are it s moving a lot of the oil that is consumed every day and then finally is this is you know one of the things that we oftentimes we think about the hundred million barrels a day that the world is consuming over 75 percent of the world s oil is controlled managed by state owned oil companies so saudi aramco being one pdvsa of venezuela being another but it s really important to sort of recognize the position that state owned companies have the rest is controlled or managed by international oil companies exxonmobil chevron eni total and a host of other host of other companies but again i think the you know to understand that nocs as they re referred to are very very important for understanding their role in the larger context of the geopolitics of oil and again what we saw last week coming out of opec this decision this is also being driven by state budget concerns this is again it s about the production of oil but it s also about you know governments and their budgets and oftentimes you know there is a desire to add more rather than you know more revenues rather than less so those are the slides that i have and i hope that they sort of provide some sort of context and a little bit of you know that we can discuss in the questions that i really look forward to answering from the audience faskianos thank you carolyn that was great so now we re going to go to all of you for your questions and comments gives queuing instructions all right so i m going to go to the first raised hand in the thing amadine hom go to you first and please accept the unmute yourself pause you are still muted pause ok i don t know are you there oh i think ok let s go to morton holbrook q yes good afternoon dr kissane what a shocking presentation laughs a hundred million barrels a day and it s going up notwithstanding the paris climate agreement of 2015 is that agreement simply a dead letter or is it having any effect on oil on fossil fuel production particularly oil production or what s the best scenario in terms of reducing dependence on fossil fuels considering the oil market thank you kissane well hi morton thank you so much for that excellent question yeah that s kind of why i emphasize that number is because a lot of people sort of just aren t aware of how much oil we continue to consume and again what the demand expectations are moving forward and these demand expectations are you know coming out of forecasts from the international energy agency so i think there s a big question as to when we see peak demand and you know if you look at bp scenarios they expect peak demand to happen you know before 2030 where as you know others kind of contest that they that they think that peak demand won t happen until after 2030 i mean again a lot depends on you know what we are now experiencing in the energy transition and how sort of quickly are we can we transition away from oil i think what s really critical when we re looking at oil is oftentimes we think only about the transportation sector so we re thinking about cars we re thinking about planes you know we re thinking about trucks and tankers and all these things but it s petrochemicals you know there s just a lot of oil that also goes into fertilizer so it really is across our economy and across economies across the global system one of the things that i always tell my students is even during covid where you had many countries right much of the world was experiencing some level of lockdown we did have a reduction in oil demand but it wasn t it wasn t like 20 million barrels it was under ten so the fact that now it s 2023 the world has reopened it s really hard to sort of see or to know with certainty is when we re going to see that see that reduction in demand now i think with the paris agreement what s also important is to note is you know if you re if you re in the oil and gas space and i was just at a conference earlier this morning where this was a point of conversation was you know what are the companies doing to reduce the emissions from production so how are they integrating carbon capture sequestration you know how are they managing the emissions that come from the production of fossil energy in this case that we re talking about oil and i think one of the things that i think if you sort of follow oil markets or a country like saudi arabia they are marketing low emission oil now we could you know we could sort of challenge well what does that you know what does that really mean but you are having you know countries that are now sort of competing to state that they have lower emitting carbon in the production in the production of oil and that s a whole other interesting sort of thing to look at in the context of the geopolitics of oil is to kind of understand the variation across emissions across different countries in the production of oil so we are you know again we are going to be going into cop 28 this fall again we are not seeing you know and we haven t seen a you know reduction in fossil energy demand again lots of people are sort of you know hoping that we ll start to see it sooner rather than later but for the time being and again you know to irina s first question that you know the last fourteen months and with you know with russia s invasion of ukraine it has both shown us that you know europe is sort of seeking to hasten the energy transition by building out more renewable energy and creating more opportunities to buy electric vehicles but there s still big swaths of the world that you know are still and have yet to move towards you know really reducing and that are actually going to see higher demand moving forward as their economies grow faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from jovana vujanic who is a graduate student at lewis university how big of an of an impact will the decision of the saudi energy minister to cut oil production have on the relationship between the united states and saudi arabia kissane love the question thank you so much yeah no it s a great one so my take is that of course this decision came as a bit of a surprise and it wasn t something that the united states you know wanted but i would say that the u s saudi relationship has been very tense for the last ten years and as part of that there are lots of different reasons for that but this is yet kind of another thing that saudi has done and again i think it s also saudi has taken a non alignment policy with relation to its position on russia and ukraine so it continues to you know it continues to have a relationship with russia it also has the relationship with ukraine as we saw you know china just brokered a very significant deal between saudi arabia and iran you know again saudi arabia and iran are two are two important producers for china so china is a large importer of oil so if you go back to world war the end of world war ii that s when the united states established the oil for security relationship with saudi arabia and as we have grown sort of more i wouldn t say independent but our as our own oil production has increased especially through the shale revolution our dependence on the middle east and saudi arabia more specifically has shifted so i think we re seeing a very different saudi arabia today which i think is going to be a challenge for the united states i think it s going to be very interesting to see what the summer holds last summer the biden administration did tap into the u s strategic petroleum reserves the largest the largest take in the history of the reserves which started in 1975 you know taking 180 million barrels out you know not because there was massive supply disruptions but because you know as the administration said it was you know it was it was it was a war it was a war specific decision because the you know russia s invasion of ukraine was causing energy prices to skyrocket and to cushion the american consumer and to better cushion the sort of the global economy the united states withdrew from the spr so i think the summer is going to be very interesting but i think we re going to see definitely much more attention in the years to come between the united states and saudi arabia it s not the relationship of the past this is a kind of a very new relationship that s a great question faskianos thank you thank you let s go curran flynn who has a raised hand q hello faskianos we can hear you but we re getting feedback so you might have two devices open q can you hear me now faskianos yes q that s better ok faskianos that s better thank you thank you so much q so i m here at king fahd university in saudi arabia right next to aramco here with my class from international relations and one of my students has a question nasser al nasir ph here he is q so thank you mrs carolyn my question is how could russia s use of alternative transportation methods such as the east siberian pipeline to china impact the u s market the domestic market and the role of the spr given potential insurance workarounds from russia s side such as ensuring russian tankers through their rdif fund and thank you to mrs irina kissane thank you and dr flynn thank you so much for having your students join this webinar so i m a little so the question is about the east siberian pipeline just could you would you mind repeating it i just want to make sure i have it i m clear on the question q so how could russia s use of alternative transportation methods such as the east siberian pipeline to china impact the u s energy markets i mean domestically and the spr given potential insurance workarounds from russia s side such as ensuring russian tankers to the rdif fund kissane yeah and that s a great question you know i think that you know begs a lot of things that we could be looking at right in terms of you know russia s kind of ability or capacity to sort of work around or find workarounds to the sanctions that were imposed and i think we ve seen sort of new markets so this kind of reshaping of the energy map with oil we see that as kind of in technicolor right whereas you know a lot of russian oil would go west is now going east you know china india being takers and of course you know other countries as well you know what will be its impact on the on the u s market i think that s you know again i do think the sanctions were sort of carefully put into place so that there wouldn t be massive disruptions so we again you know russia produces over 10 million barrels a day and about 7 million of those barrels are exported so you know if we lost all of that that would be a you know that would cause some very significant economic disruption globally we already saw you know impacts to sort of grains grain exports and food security in many different parts of the world so you know russia is finding different ways you have shadow tankers that russia is using to move to move its oil as you pointed out the east siberian pipeline you know i think there s only so much the united states can do or and european countries that are part of the sanctions regime can do to curtail russian exports of oil but i think that you know i think russia again has a has a desire and also you know revenue needs they re funding a very expensive war that they re finding ways to get their to get their oil out i think an interesting question is you know what does this mean in the years ahead the lack of investment for example that s going into russian energy infrastructure a lack of sort of any kind of western investment that is that is going in and what that is going to mean but again you know i think to your question i think we will see some you know we are seeing some impacts right there s a big question as to what you know what the next six months to a year will look like with regards to the reduction from opec and if we were to see a deeper curtailment on russian oil and you know would the united states then tap more into the spr we re now at you know we re down to seven hundred thousand barrels which of course is not insignificant but we also sort of have to be you know judicious about how we use the spr but thank you for the question faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from michael let s see trevett a ph d candidate at the university of southern mississippi china and other countries claim there are petroleum reserves under the south china sea what are your estimates of the potential amount there and has china begun to extract any of this oil kissane michael thank you so much that s a great question so china already is an oil producing country so you do have oil production in china in the south china sea i can t i can t say exactly i know that there have been geological tests that have shown the reserves again you do have you know you do have territorial concerns about sort of where is this you know can china can china tap those or seek to explore and tap those reserves again if there are if there is contention over the territory in which these reserves are located so you know china again one of the things that s very interesting about china is that china is an oil producer but china has seen over the last you know the last decade they have seen that they have experienced peak demand so i mean sorry peak supply so they are not producing as much as they used to and so you re seeing a year on year reduction in the producing capacity you know if you go back maybe five or six years ago there was lots of questions about if china could kind of replicate what happened in the united states around the shale oil revolution i think one of the big challenges for china is that of the you know where the shale reserves are located it s not near water lots of questions as to and some of it basically some of the tests have shown that it s it definitely is proving harder that you know they cannot sort of model the same level of development that we have seen in the united states so yeah no i think in the south china sea again i think we it s potentially possible that we might see it i wouldn t i wouldn t i wouldn t say it s soon faskianos thank you i m taking the next question from rob warren at the anglo american university of prague this question also got an upvote how do you foresee venezuela s role in the global oil market changing moving forward and can it be reintegrated into the global economy kissane oh these are all fantastic questions thank you all so much yeah venezuela is again you know venezuela has they have the largest reserves in the world as part of this webinar right you cfr had a kind of a primer on venezuelan and kind of you know you look at sort of where venezuela is and one of the biggest challenges confronting venezuela is both its politics but it s also it basically you know you don t have you don t have international oil service providers in the country i think the only the only one now that the u s the u s has sort of given a sanctions exemption to is that of chevron but i think yeah i mean if you were to see you know kind of shifts in the political regime and you were to see more openness then i think you could imagine you know venezuela having an opportunity or a pathway forward to be more integrated into the global energy system and the global oil system you know i think one of the big problems that venezuela faces is that most of its infrastructure is really old at this point and it would need a significant amount of reinvestment to get it up to a place that it could sort of meet its potential so you know venezuela is one of these countries that s not producing as much as it could right it has the potential to be producing 2 million plus more barrels per day but you know we ve seen that they really have just they went into freefall so i think that s a big issue and another big issue which god it goes back to an earlier question is that of emissions so the oil that comes out of venezuela is a very very heavy oil so it s it has very large carbon emissions associated with the production of that oil so that i think is again as we you know think about the emissions from oil production in countries that are sort of seeking to kind of market themselves as low emission producers you know venezuela definitely will have a very hard time recouping its where its oil sector was again it has the capacity it has the reserves but getting that getting that oil out of the ground right now you have a lot of significant above ground risks faskianos thank you i m going to go next to clemente abrokwaa raised hand so please unmute yourself q can you hear me please faskianos yes we can q thank you thank you so much for your for your talk i was also very shocked about the amount of barrels that we consume every day laughs i didn t know that but anyway i m from penn state university and my question is you just mentioned about the above ground you know effects and so the movement towards like electric vehicles and so on how do you think it is going to affect the african continent kissane thank you q i am i m thinking you know the economies and then infrastructure it will be very difficult for them to laughs move with the rest of the world in terms of electric vehicles and so on i just wanted your take on that kissane thank you clemente it s an excellent question yeah i mean you have countries across the african continent that not only have oil reserves but are already producing right nigeria is a is an oil producing country also has more capacity but again you have some above ground risks you also have the need for investment of new infrastructure i think one of the things that has been very interesting and i think it s getting it s getting more attention as it deserves is how western governments are some of i think a challenge across africa is that a lot of western governments have sort of said listen we re not going to invest in fossil fuels or also financial institutions western financial institutions we re not going to invest in fossil fuels or new projects that are fossil based and that you know that s problematic when you look across the african continent where you still don t have you know 100 percent energy access you know the idea of the transition to electric vehicles which is taking a very very long time even here across the across developed economies so the need for the infusion of more capital to go into you know across the continent of africa for oil and gas that s for their economies and for their own economic growth i think is really really pivotal and i think this is something that you know is being discussed across multilateral financial institutions and also you know is it hypocrisy right for western banks that have you know kind of funded the oil and gas industry or helped to fund the oil and gas industry in the united states and many different parts of the world and that are now sort of not allowing those funds to flow to africa and they have the again they have the they have the resources so you know is it you know the equity of some of these decisions that are being made i think is one that s is one that s really important and again i you know i said earlier in this talk is that you know all most of the demand for oil is not coming from north america and from europe all of the demand that we re seeing and new demand that we re going to see is coming from asia and is going to come from africa so again you know how are we going to make sure that that demand is met again going back to that idea of energy security so there is there is accessibility so there is reliable sources of energy at affordable prices you know without sort of thinking about kind of a whole of energy approach so i think it s very it s a very complex issue and i think you know western banks who have sort of taken very sharp positions on what they will and will not fund when it comes to new oil and gas projects are getting sort of challenged as to you know what does that mean then for you know countries across africa that are still very much in need of more energy not less and again recognizing that you know evs that again are still are you know we re seeing adoption here in the united states and across europe but it s a big big big adoption in china but it s very uneven so how do we ensure greater energy security for the continent of africa i think is a really critical question faskianos thank you i ll take the next question from kyle bales who is a senior at lewis university in romeoville illinois how is the war between russia and ukraine having an effect on the progress of the european green deal maybe you can tell us what the european define the european green deal for us carolyn give us the context for that kissane yes so again this is another fantastic question yeah the european green deal it s this is this is great yeah i mean a lot of people would say that the european green deal now is that the russia s invasion of ukraine has sort of said hey this is why the green deal is so important this is why we really need to more quickly transition to renewable energy because look what look what happened when we were dependent on russia for over 30 percent of our natural gas and look when russia you know illegally invades ukraine and suddenly weaponizes gas we are left very energy insecure it affects it affects consumers it affects industry across the continent so i think we re seeing not just through the green deal but we re also seeing through sort of european green industrial policy so in some ways akin to what you know we put into effect in this past summer is the inflation reduction act and we re seeing almost kind of this industrial competition around clean energy technologies and so europe is investing you know i think it s about 250 billion the united states it s about 370 billion towards the kind of the energy transition and helping to support domestic industries and companies to you know to be able to you know develop the technologies and to have the you know the opportunity to contribute to the energy transition so i think one thing though whenever i talk about europe it s really important is to sort of recognize that you know when you look across europe you have very different policies and kind of approaches to sort of thinking about energy and how quickly some countries want to transition and can transition whereas others you know are probably going to experience a slower transition so just really interesting example as you talked about the green deal is the eu taxonomy the green taxonomy that went into effect in the january of 2022 and there you had like really a lot of contention between france and germany because france wanted to make sure that nuclear was part of the green taxonomy germany was opposed right but germany wanted to make sure natural gas was part of the green taxonomy so ultimately in the end both natural gas and nuclear and again this was this predated russia s invasion of ukraine but in the eu green taxonomy you have you know you have both nuclear and natural gas in addition to other renewable energies that can make up this taxonomy that includes specific measures towards adaptation and mitigation for climate change so you know i think you re seeing this kind of some people call it a race a competition you know ideally it s you know we re kind of working together to because we re all sort of going in the same direction to you know support the transition and to reduce to reduce carbon emissions and to bring in more sort of cleaner energy technologies into our system faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from dr laeed zaghlami q yes good afternoon this is laeed good afternoon irina good afternoon carolyn i m very pleased to be part of your program just to want to be back to africa and particularly to nigeria how practical the two projects that nigeria is advocating for pipelines one from through algeria and the other one to morocco through western african countries how practical are these pipelines to supply gas to europe and parts of some african countries faskianos and dr zaghlami you are at algiers university correct q indeed irina yes i am professor at university of algiers faculty of information and communication faskianos thank you kissane dr laeed can i can i keep you on for just one second can i ask you what is the what is the status right now is it it s planned under construction where is what is the status of those two pipelines my understanding is that it s they re proposed but q yes well actually in practically the pipeline between algeria and abuja which means through niger and so forth is already in progress whereas the other project through thirteen western african countries they are supposed to be implemented by 2047 but is it is there any political game or something of strategic inaudible how practical how logical how efficiently will be for nigeria to have two similar project s kissane yeah no it s again thank you for the question you know pipelines again that s why i wanted to show the laughs kind of the map of pipelines is because you know a lot of pipelines transverse you know multiple countries right and this is this requires not just you know a lot of cooperation but it requires technically it also can be very complex to build to build pipelines and when you re talking about something like as you as you point out these are you know crossing many countries you know i think one of the again one of the issues is whether or not since you know what already is under construction i think you can you know with confidence that one will be completed anything that s not yet under construction and again the timeline 2047 is way out there a lot of a lot of uncertainty as to what the status of those projects will be moving forward for various reasons in terms of making sure that the investments are there someone i know that studies pipelines he says you know until the steel is in the ground you don t have the pipeline and so until you know that you ve got that you know you ve got all the oks and you feel that kind of security of being able to build it and being able to provide the resources to supply it and to move it i think algeria has been a really interesting case that hasn t gotten enough attention in terms of algerian gas that has that has helped support europe over the last years we ve seen an increase in algerian gas going into europe again a lot of attention on u s lng and the increase of liquefied natural gas exports into europe but also algeria has been you know very important for helping to support european energy security and make up for some of the losses of the of the russian gas and i think we ll see more attention on algeria and algeria s role as a you know as an important source of energy especially you know gas going into going into europe moving forward faskianos so i ll take the next written question from vincent brooks who is at harvard and diamondback energy board of directors how do you view the purchasing of discounted russian oil by india in particular relative to the purchasing by china how are they using the oil purchased and are you seeing more internal usage or external profit making sales in places like africa and what are the implications of all of this kissane right great great question so all of the above laughs in some ways right there is definitely sort of profits that are being made you know i was i was talking about this last week with someone and you know if you sort of put your shoe put yourself in the shoes of india right so india is a is a rapidly growing economy 1 4 billion you know if you had if you have very high energy inflation and high oil prices that s going to have ripples effects across the indian economy and so you know when you have a kind of opportunity to buy you know pretty steep discounted oil which you know they had been able to buy from russia you know for purposes of national security they ve been buying the oil and one of the things that s very interesting about india is that actually india has been building out its refining capacity so a lot of that oil is both for domestic and some of it is being sort of re exported but i think what we ve seen is that they re using that oil to also sort of enhance their capacity and capabilities as a rapidly emerging refining power in asia and we see that in some ways in china too so china even though oil demand was down in 2022 much of the oil that they were buying from russia went into its strategic supplies which you know they now have access to and again i think you know a big question is what we re going to see moving forward around oil demand in china wood mackenzie just published a really interesting piece kind of very bullish on the expectations for oil demand in china so whether or not they re going to continue to buy you know russian oil and again sort of taking advantage of these lower prices you know and i think i think one of the things that it s kind of an inconvenient truth whereas a lot of this oil trading used to happen in europe so european trading houses were kind of the main the main points of russian oil trade a lot of that has been moved out so you know russia has found ways to kind of bypass some of the sanctions and have set up in some cases they ve set up trading houses and some of those trading houses have been sort of set up in places that you know that they can sort of again bypass the compliance to the sanctions and you have some you have some russian oil traders that are making a lot of money laughs selling discounted oil and then reselling it a really interesting case a couple of months ago was out of malaysia malaysia announced or in the you know that they were that 1 5 million barrels were produced and sold but only malaysia doesn t produce that much so those were russian barrels that were sort of being sold under sort of the malaysian under the malaysian barrel so again i think china and india have you know have taken advantage some of this has again as i said has been re exported and some of it you know has been re exported through petroleum products because china and india you know both are building and have refining capacity faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from bhakti mirchandani at columbia university what global trajectory do you see for nuclear the russia ukraine crisis has taken some of the refining capacity offline and nuclear has the potential to change the geopolitics of energy and so what steps can be taken to foster nuclear energy kissane bhakti thank you and i was just at columbia earlier today for the center for global energy policy s conference yeah nuclear is very interesting right so when we re thinking about you know decarbonizing our energy systems you know nuclear plays a very important role because it s zero emitting so in certain parts of the world china being one saudi arabia you know you have a lot of new nuclear build you know in other parts of the world you have a lot of contention about nuclear we saw that even in germany which have you know three remaining nuclear power plants and even in the midst of massive energy crisis over the last year there was still sort of pushback about no those nuclear power plants need to be shut down whereas you would think ok in light of energy insecurity let s keep them open so you know france is an interesting country france had planned to reduce its nuclear capacity by 50 percent but this past year they pivoted and they ve said no we re actually going to build out more nuclear and we re sort of we re totally scrapping that idea of reducing nuclear energy and nuclear is very important for france s electricity system sweden has also announced that they are going to build new nuclear and they re going to increase by i think almost 50 percent again part of this is their to meet their targets of net zero we also see japan japan you know the fukushima disaster really turned japanese the japanese public off of nuclear very very deep opposition to restarting the nuclear power plants but this past year even though there s still safety concerns on the part of the public the public is also very concerned about energy insecurity and higher prices so nuclear being a domestic source of energy so i think when you look at you know net zero pathways i have not seen a net zero pathway that does not include nuclear so here in the united states the net zero america project out of princeton very important place for nuclear we just have a really hard time laughs building nuclear at cost so it s very expensive usually it s significant cost overruns and of course there is the i think they have a really significant pr problem people there s still a lot of concern about the safety of nuclear so i think to your point it s very very important for decarbonizing energy systems but you re going to see i think very disjointed approaches some countries are going are embracing nuclear and other countries are sort of doubling down on their opposition and are not going to allow nuclear to be part of the energy system faskianos we have so many questions and we are just not going to get to them all so i m going to take the next question from christian bonfili who s at torcuato di tella university in argentina so do you think carolyn that the landscape resulting from the ukraine invasion by russia vis à vis securitization of gas and energy between europe and russia could accelerate energy transition toward greener energy kissane great question i think in europe it is and i think you know many analysts would agree that the iea for example you know you had the you know how does europe continue you know to enhance and achieve energy security without the dependence on russia gas and a lot of that is through renewable energy you also have a lot of new attention on hydrogen and the role that hydrogen will play i think i think europe is being cautious and so they are not saying that they are going to completely move away from gas so as earlier questions are they getting gas from algeria or are they getting gas from norway are they getting more gas from the united states in the form of liquefied natural gas and then also an uncomfortable truth is they continue to get liquefied natural gas from russia so we ve seen an increase in lng from russia going into europe that said i think all in you are seeing that you know countries across europe are saying ok you know how can we enhance our energy security how do we build more sort of domestic energy sources solar wind we re seeing you know more rapid deployment you ve got a lot of questions about supply chains and things like that but i think overall i think the answer would be that it s quickening the energy transition faskianos so i will take the moderator prerogative to just ask the final question for you to close on and just to give us your top three what are the major challenges for the geopolitics of oil as you look out over the next five to ten year horizon that you would leave us with to be looking for kissane ok you know so i think what we saw right tensions between saudi arabia and the united states we also have a you know a hot war cold war depending on you know the term you want to use between the united states and china and lots of sort of questions as to what that s going to look like i think there s you know i think there s concern that you know we re not reducing demands but we re seeing tightening supply and so that s going to have you know very significant impacts for economies especially economies that are already very fragile economically fragile politically fragile so that concerns me a lot in terms of you know what happens when you know economies don t have adequate access to energy to make sure that their industries that their that consumers you know are able that the lights can stay on and you can get you know if you re dependent on cars you re depending on trucks like all these kinds of things are really really critical so i think we have to be very cautious moving forward that we don t take more out of the system before we have adequately set up the system to be resilient and to be able to sort of meet the energy security demands that are not are not they re not decreasing i think they are increasing and becoming even more

the wave of selling knocked 460 points off the dow jones industrial average and gave the benchmark s p 500 index its worst day since jan 3 the russell 2000 index of smaller company stocks fell more than the rest of the market as traders offloaded risker assets worried investors shifted money into bonds which sent yields much lower the yield on the 10 year treasury dropped to 2 43 percent from 2 54 percent late thursday a big move the slide in bond yields hurt bank stocks which along with technology companies accounted for much of the broad decline in stocks the utilities sector was the only one to eke out a gain what s really giving investors concern today is this weak global economic data here in the u s and in europe said jeff kravetz regional investment director for u s bank wealth management smaller company stocks are often the first to be sold by investors looking to reduce risk which explains why the russell 2000 was down more than the rest of the market small companies which are more dependent on the u s economy than big multinationals tend so suffer more in economic downturns the s p 500 index dropped 54 17 points or 1 9 percent to 2 800 71 the dow gave up 460 19 points

505 92 despite wavering from gains to losses throughout the week the s p 500 index is still up more than 11 percent so far in 2019 which still counts as a blockbuster start to a year the fear that gripped investors friday was fueled by a steadily dimming outlook for the global economy china the world s second largest economy after the united states is weakening and other economies that depend heavily on purchases in china have suffered as a result factory production in the euro currency alliance for instance has fallen at its steepest rate in about six years in germany europe s largest economy a survey of purchasing manager manufacturers posted its sharpest production drop in nearly six years orders to german factories have also tumbled key bond yields fell this week to their lowest levels in more than a year after the federal reserve said it was seeing slower growth in the economy and no longer expected to raise interest rates this year the yield on the benchmark 10 year treasury note which is used to set rates on mortgages and many other kinds of loans is now sharply lower from its recent high of 3 23 percent in early october in another worrying sign the yield on the 10 year treasury note fell friday below the yield on the three month treasury bill when that kind of inversion in bond yields occurs economists fear that it can signal a recession within the coming year that signal isn t always correct however the prospects of slowing global economic growth has motivated investors to rebalance their holdings as they digest the new reality said marina severinovsky investment strategist at schroeders we re sort of coming back to earth central banks have been positioning themselves to deal with the slowdown she said and that includes the federal reserve s expectations for no rate increases this year earlier this month the european central bank said it would push back the earliest date for interest rate increases it also said it would offer ultra cheap loans to banks supporting their ability to keep lending it s very positive that not just the fed but other policy makers have acknowledged the situation is kind of dangerous on the global slowdown and are taking action severinovsky said the decline in bond yields threatened the profitability of banks because it forces them to charge lower interest rates on loans bank of america slid 4

italian prime minister giuseppe conte will sign up his country saturday to china s belt and road initiative bri an ambitious trillion dollar transcontinental trade and infrastructure project the memorandum signing in rome is the centerpiece of chinese president xi jinping s three stop visit to europe and it will make italy the first g 7 nation to participate in china s so called new silk road italy s endorsement of the bri which spans eurasia as well as the middle east and parts of africa has prompted the disquiet not only of the united states but also of european union leaders who have voiced concern about beijing s growing political clout in europe and its use of commerce as a tool of statecraft the u s has been critical of the trillion dollar project and warned about the risks of debt trap diplomacy members of the eu are worried the plan could add to fissures in an already strained coalition they aren t alone in worrying about what the longer term consequences on italy might be if signing up for bri moves from symbolism into full participation matteo salvini head of the populist lega party which represents one half of italy s coalition government is indicating his opposition by staying away from the signing ceremony and won t be present at a scheduled gala dinner afterward salvini an ideological bedfellow of donald trump and friend of the u s president s former adviser steve bannon frets the bri risks turning italy into a chinese colony and will saddle it with more debt he also has publicly indicated his security concerns about allowing the chinese control of critical infrastructure including major ports before allowing someone to invest in the ports of trieste or genoa i would think about it not once but a hundred times salvini said earlier this month some italian officials in the economy and finance ministry have also offered behind the scenes warnings they argue that while engaging with beijing in this manner may help boost italian exports to china a prospect highlighted by xi in marketing bri it will likely result in a bigger boost for cheap chinese exports to italy such a scenario they caution could have a ruinous impact on domestic italian producers and workers if trade does take off significantly it might be a matter of short term gain but long term pain one official told voa despite the warnings as well as u s and eu disapproval of italy s bri endorsement conte and luigi di maio leader of the anti establishment five star movement which makes up half of the country s populist coalition government says chinese investment could kick start italy s sputtering economy several of the eu s smaller cash strapped nations have also signed up in the past two years to china s bri hoping that by doing so their economies will be boosted italy slipped into recession last year and its debt levels are among the highest in europe the populist coalition government came to power in june 2018 with high spending plans promising expensive pension reforms and a living wage for all italians italian ministers favoring bri accuse other large eu countries including france which is critical of the bri of hypocrisy saying they conduct multi million dollar deals anyway with china albeit outside the framework of the new silk road initiative the way we see it it is an opportunity for our companies to take the opportunity of china s growing importance in the world italy s under secretary of state for trade and investment michele geraci told foreign reporters but some italian officials worry that view might be short sighted they say while the bri may offer italy new funding sources the country is still lagging well behind the foreign investment levels it enjoyed before the 2008 global financial crash it could trigger a significant wave of chinese imports which would have long term detrimental consequences for italian industry employment and politics the officials in the country s finance ministry who declined to be identified for this article have been scrutinizing recent academic studies on the impact of chinese imports on local labor markets a series of studies including those by economists david autor david dorn and gordon hanson suggests that western countries and regions exposed to rising chinese import competition see a major jump in unemployment lower labor force participation and lower wages unskilled and manual workers are especially adversely affected the impacts are most visible in the local labor markets in which the industries exposed to foreign competition are concentrated adjustment in local labor markets is remarkably slow with wages and labor force participation rates remaining depressed and unemployment rates remaining elevated for at least a full decade after the china trade shock commences exposed workers experience greater job churning and reduced lifetime income noted autor dorn and hanson in a paper for the national bureau of economic research an influential u s based nonprofit other recent academic studies have noted that the regions of the u s and europe most impacted by trade with china are the ones which in recent elections and plebiscites have backed populist candidates and nationalist causes like brexit support fueled by anger at the effects of globalization brexit is britain s decision to leave the european union ironically looking to beijing for an economic boost and to alleviate economic deprivation could well hurt the workers and businesses who backed populists in the first place and who the populists want to help salvini gets that but the rest of the coalition doesn t observed an italian official credit voice of america voa

statements contained in this document non gaap financial measures in this press release futurefuel used adjusted ebitda as a key operating metric to measure both performance and liquidity adjusted ebitda is a non gaap financial measure adjusted ebitda is not a substitute for operating income net income or cash flow from operating activities each as determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of performance or liquidity adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of results as reported under gaap futurefuel defines adjusted ebitda as net income before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization expenses excluding when applicable non cash share based compensation expense public offering expenses acquisition related transaction costs purchase accounting adjustments loss on disposal of property and equipment gains or losses on derivative instruments other non operating income or expense information relating to adjusted ebitda is provided so that investors have the same data that management employs in assessing the overall operation and liquidity of futurefuel s business futurefuel s calculation of adjusted ebitda may be different from similarly titled measures used by other companies therefore the results of its calculation are not necessarily comparable to the results of other companies adjusted ebitda allows futurefuel s chief operating decision makers to assess the performance and liquidity of futurefuel s business on a consolidated basis to assess the ability of its operating segments to produce operating cash flow to fund working capital needs to fund capital expenditures and to pay dividends in particular futurefuel management believes that adjusted ebitda permits a comparative assessment of futurefuel s operating performance and liquidity relative to a performance and liquidity based on gaap results while isolating the effects of depreciation and amortization which may vary among its operating segments without any correlation to their underlying operating performance and of non cash stock based compensation expense which is a non cash expense that varies widely among similar companies and gains and losses on derivative instruments whose immediate recognition can cause net income to be volatile from quarter to quarter due to the timing of the valuation change in the derivative instruments relative to the sale of biofuel a table included in this earnings release reconciles adjusted ebitda with net income the most directly comparable gaap performance financial measure and a table reconciles adjusted ebitda with cash flows from operations the most directly comparable gaap liquidity financial measure futurefuel

in a story march 22 about the financial markets the associated press misspelled the name of asset management company schroders a corrected version of the story is below stocks bond yields fall sharply as growth worries spread new signs the global economic growth is slowing roiled wall street friday triggering a sell off in stocks that erased the market s gains for the week by damian j troise and alex veiga ap business writers wall street was roiled friday by new signs that global economic growth is slowing the jitters triggered a sell off in stocks and sent bond yields sharply lower flashing a possible recession warning the wave of selling knocked 460 points off the dow jones industrial average and gave the benchmark s p 500 index its worst day since jan 3 the russell 2000 index of smaller company stocks fell more than the rest of the market as traders offloaded risker assets worried investors shifted money into bonds which sent yields much lower the yield on the 10 year treasury dropped to 2 43 percent from 2 54 percent late thursday a big move the slide in bond yields hurt bank stocks which along with technology companies accounted for much of the broad decline in stocks the utilities sector was the only one to eke out a gain what s really giving investors concern today is this weak global economic data here in the u s and in europe said jeff kravetz regional investment director for u s bank wealth management the market s skid runs counter to what has been a strong start to the year on wall street as stocks rebounded from a steep slide at the end of 2018 the bull market for u s stocks recently marked its 10th anniversary and is now the longest ever the fear that gripped investors friday was fueled by a steadily dimming outlook for the global economy china the world s second largest economy after the united states is weakening and other economies that depend heavily on purchases in china have suffered as a result factory production in the euro currency alliance has fallen at its steepest rate in about six years in germany europe s largest economy a survey of purchasing manager manufacturers posted its sharpest production drop in nearly six years orders to german factories have also tumbled in another worrying sign the yield on the 10 year treasury note fell friday below the yield on the three month treasury bill when that kind of inversion in bond yields occurs economists fear that it can signal a recession within the coming year the s p 500 index dropped 54 17 points or 1 9 percent to 2 800 71 the dow gave up 460 19 points or 1 8 percent to 25 502 32 the nasdaq composite which is heavily weighted with technology stocks slid 196 29 points or 2 5 percent to 7 642 67 the russell 2000 lost 56 49 points or 3 6 percent to 1 505 92 european stocks also finished sharply lower friday despite wavering from gains to losses throughout the week the s p 500 index is still up more than 11 percent so far in 2019 which still counts as a blockbuster start to a year key bond yields fell this week to their lowest levels in more than a year after the federal reserve said it was seeing slower growth in the economy and no longer expected to raise interest rates this year the yield on the benchmark 10 year treasury note which is used to set rates on mortgages and many other kinds of loans is now sharply lower from its recent high of 3 23 percent in early october the prospects of slowing global economic growth has motivated investors to rebalance their holdings as they digest the new reality said marina severinovsky investment strategist at schroders we re sort of coming back to earth central banks have been positioning themselves to deal with the slowdown she said and that includes the federal reserve s expectations for no rate increases this year earlier this month the european central bank said it would push back the earliest date for interest rate increases it also said it would offer ultra cheap loans to banks supporting their ability to keep lending it s very positive that not just the fed but other policy makers have acknowledged the situation is kind of dangerous on the global slowdown and are taking action severinovsky said the decline in bond yields threatened the profitability of banks because it forces them to charge lower interest rates on loans bank of america slid 4 2 percent technology companies which would stand to lose more than other sectors in a slowing economy also took heavy losses western digital gave up 6 5 percent boeing dropped 2 8 percent after indonesia s flag carrier became the first airline to seek to cancel an order of 737 max 8 jets which have been involved in two fatal crashes in the past six months energy futures finished mostly lower benchmark u s crude oil

pundits have been buzzing in recent months about the slowdown of chinaâ s economic juggernaut there is evident cooling of gdp growth especially since the middle of last year and sales of cars and smartphones have been dropping steeply some high profile companies are flashing warnings of plunging sales and some even of job cuts yet despite the doom and gloom china continues to rack up one of the most enviable growth rates in the world adding the equivalent of â another australiaâ each year consumers continue to trade up to more expensive premium goods and some companies are registering record sales so the gloom is not uniform what do the facts tell us about what to expect in 2019 in this first edition of china brief we take a quick look at some of the key drivers shaping chinaâ s economy today 1 growth is slowingâ but china is still adding the equivalent of australia every year economic activity weakened in 2018 official statistics placed real gdp growth at 6 6 percent in 2018 the lowest rate since 1990 while some observers may challenge the precision of the official numbers this much is true the chinese economy is slowing the mckinsey global instituteâ s economic activity index which tracks the performance of the chinese economy by looking at a basket of 57 different indicators ranging from retail and property sales to electricity consumption echoes the dipping trend line in chinaâ s official gdp numbers exhibit 1 1 the economic activity index takes a broad set of factors into account and has fluctuated more than raw gdp over the last decade rising higher than gdp in the double digit period from 2005 2008 and then again from 2010 13 the index has been lower than gdp for the last four years and currently hovers at levels similar to 2015 16 when there were similar fears of a hard landing for chinaâ s high growth economy the economy is expected to continue to soften in 2019 with consensus forecasts expecting gdp growth to land somewhere between 6 0 and 6 2 percent this year yes chinaâ s economic engine is cooling down yet it continues to rack up one of the fastest rates of economic growth in the world given its enormous scale this translates into substantial additions in absolute terms this year china will add the equivalent of the entire australian economy to its gdp for many companies the real question is whether they can adapt quickly enough to slower growth or whether their strategies balance sheets and operations require higher growth to thrive or even survive for entrepreneurs who took growth rates and share price valuations for granted and who for instance pledged recently listed shares to secure funding for visionary projects the slowdown risks tipping this precarious balance into a real corporate disruption 2 the consumer story is still strong but also changing the raft of negative news from multinational and domestic companies in china that have seen their sales drop in recent months has triggered a wave of concern over the strength of chinaâ s consumer engine despite the headlines of plunging sales by apple and other multinational companies in recent months china continues to be the worldâ s best consumer story according to consensus forecasts chinese consumption is expected to grow by about 6 trillion from today through 2030 this enormous sum is equivalent to the combined consumption growth expected in the us and western europe over the same period double that of india and asean economies together chinaâ s economic rebalancing toward consumption and services continued they contributed about 76 percent and 60 percent of gdp growth respectively growth in retail sales edged lower to 9 0 percent in 2018 from 10 2 percent in 2017 reflecting weaker auto sales real per capita disposable income was 6 5 percent in 2018 in line with gdp growth and china created 13 6 million new urban jobs in 2018 exceeding the 11 million target beneath the slowdown lie changes in the patterns of consumption sharper drops in sales of individual companies or even of sales in categories like autos or cosmetics do not tell the whole story online sales for instance grew at a strong 24 percent for the first time in china we also see a new segment of customers trading down the success of pinduoduo a lower segment discounter appealing to customers explicitly trading downâ and which has disrupted chinaâ s e commerce duopoly an attacker of the attackers â indicates a maturing and changing market first tier city consumption remains very robust while lower tier cities soften could this simply reflect the larger â wealth bufferâ higher real estate values and affluence bolstering the confidence of wealthy consumers yet to feel the slowdown already apparent lower down the income scale the next few months will tell 3 the credit crunch is real the last ten years of stimulus and deleveraging is a story of â eight plus two â eight years of government stimulus after the global financial crisis followed by a couple years of conscious deleveraging and credit reduction the crisis kicked off a round of stimulus and financial liberalization measures that lasted for the next seven to eight years this led to the rapid growth of shadow banking and informal lending and spawned a range of experiments in debt issuance chinaâ s debt to gdp ratio soared from 120 percent in 2007 to 253 percent in q2 2018 higher than the ratios in germany and the united states however recently the efficacy of government stimulus has been waning each renminbi of economic stimulus that the government pumped into the economy delivered less in actual gdp growth than in the past the rise in icor the incremental capital output ratioâ the amount of money the government needs to put in to yield a unit of growthâ meant that economic stimulus was in other words getting more expensive china and the world inside a changing economic relationship years of priming the credit pump also created asset bubbles in the economy sustained through excess liquidity real estate prices have continued their upward climb even as nominal gdp growth has now settled into single digit territory since 2016 regulators have acknowledged these challenges and emphasized deleveraging the governmentâ s crack down on shadow banking and p2p lending including arrests of executives is having an additional dampening effect on the flow of credit this has led to a significant drop in credit availability over the past 24 months growth in outstanding credit fell from 13 percent in 2017 to 7 percent in 2018 below nominal gdp growth of 9 7 percent this reflects a marked contraction in shadow banking financing that grew by 13 percent in 2017 but declined by 7 percent in 2018 exhibit 2 2 it takes a lot to slow the chinese economy but the impact of the credit squeeze has started to be felt particularly among smaller enterprises in the private sector and among companies in tier three and four cities and since the chinese economy is increasingly dependent on consumption and services a squeeze on companies ultimately ripples through to incomes consumption and overall growth a lot of recent news reports have led many to believe that the trade spat between the us and china is leading to the current economic slowdown politicians have also used this as a convenient explanation but chinaâ s gdp is far less dependent on trade today than what some would have us believe in fact chinaâ s net trade surplus was only 1 7 percent of gdp in 2017 down from 8 percent in 2008 the effect may be more indirect impacting consumer confidence and causing private sector companies to hold off on making decisions to invest in more manufacturing capacity regulators are now figuring out ways to re open the credit spigots but they are moving more cautiously and are applying levers in a more targeted way than they did during the eight years of credit expansion for example the pboc peopleâ s bank of china has recently announced measures to boost bank liquidity through perpetual bond issuance this is intended to allow banks to issue bonds and recapitalize and lend more but under the condition that the target of lending achieves certain minimum credit standards ultimately china will have to chart a course between providing more stimulus with the resulting bubbles and externalities pushing through structural reforms of the state owned sector which may be politically sensitive or accepting slower overall growth rates these policy choices may be influenced as much by political and geopolitical factors as economic considerations the next few months will be indicative of which course we are on as well as whether we are in a longer or shorter period of economic slowdown 4 acquisition opportunities are opening up for fast movers the governmentâ s squeeze on credit put pressure on private sector liquidity and the number of bond defaults by private firms rose from 42 in 2017 to 147 in 2018 with the intense credit pressure being applied particularly to mid sized private sector companies we expect there could be a considerable round of consolidation on the horizon in the prior periods of credit tightening industry consolidation favored the state owned enterprises over their less well funded private competitors today a deeper capital market and the massive growth of private capital in china might change this dynamic somewhat the question for many private companies remains how much of their â powderâ is still dry or have they leveraged themselves up pegging their balance sheets to unsustainably higher growth rates and valuation assumptions this combined with a potentially increased openness to foreign direct investment across several sectors being discussed in broader trade related negotiations could create a window of opportunity for multinationals with scale and significance in china and the willingness to make bold moves to acquire domestic competitors caught in the credit squeeze ironically just as headlines about china become less exuberant now might be precisely the time to more purposefully step up presence and engagement to listen to a podcast conversation on this topic

benchmark s p 500 index its worst day since jan 3 the russell 2000 index of smaller company stocks fell more than the rest of the market as traders offloaded risker assets worried investors shifted money into bonds which sent yields much lower the yield on the 10 year treasury dropped to 2 43 percent from 2 54 percent late thursday a big move the slide in bond yields hurt bank stocks which along with technology companies accounted for much of the broad decline in stocks the utilities sector was the only one to eke out a gain what s really giving investors concern today is this weak global economic data here in the u s and in europe said jeff kravetz regional investment director for u s bank wealth management the market s skid runs counter to what has been a strong start to the year on wall street as stocks rebounded from a steep slide at the end of 2018 the bull market for u s stocks recently marked its 10th anniversary and is now the longest ever the fear that gripped investors friday was fueled by a steadily dimming outlook for the global economy china the world s second largest economy after the united states is weakening and other economies that depend heavily on purchases in china have suffered as a result factory production in the euro currency alliance has fallen at its steepest rate in about six years in germany europe s largest economy a survey of purchasing manager manufacturers posted its sharpest production drop in nearly six years orders to german factories have also tumbled in another worrying sign the yield on the 10 year treasury note fell friday below the yield on the three month treasury bill when that kind of inversion in bond yields occurs economists fear that it can signal a recession within the coming year the s p 500 index

500 index is still up more than 11 percent so far in 2019 which still counts as a blockbuster start to a year key bond yields fell this week to their lowest levels in more than a year after the federal reserve said it was seeing slower growth in the economy and no longer expected to raise interest rates this year the yield on the benchmark 10 year treasury note which is used to set rates on mortgages and many other kinds of loans is now sharply lower from its recent high of 3 23 percent in early october the prospects of slowing global economic growth has motivated investors to rebalance their holdings as they digest the new reality said marina severinovsky investment strategist at schroeders we re sort of coming back to earth central banks have been positioning themselves to deal with the slowdown she said and that includes the federal reserve s expectations for no rate increases this year earlier this month the european central bank said it would push back the earliest date for interest rate increases it also said it would offer ultra cheap loans to banks supporting their ability to keep lending it s very positive that not just the fed but other policy makers have acknowledged the situation is kind of dangerous on the global slowdown and are taking action severinovsky said the decline in bond yields threatened the profitability of banks because it forces them to charge lower interest rates on loans bank of america slid 4 2 percent technology companies which would stand to lose more than other sectors in a slowing economy also took heavy losses western

there is a certain trend of opinion amongst the liberal left particularly in the us which never felt very comfortable with the bolivarian revolution now in the midst of a serious and well organised attempt by washington to remove maduro s government they insist on equally blaming both sides for the crisis one which in their view can be resolved through negotiations between the government and the opposition a chief representative of this point of view is gabriel hetland who has written several articles on venezuela for the nation jacobin and other left wing publications his latest article venezuela s deadly blackout highlights the need for a negotiated resolution of the crisis sums up this argument neatly so it is useful to analyse it in some detail the article is full of inaccuracies and half truths but its main flaw is a mistaken analysis of the situation in venezuela one that avoids a class approach to the different forces involved from which hetland derives a completely utopian solution the devil s in the details let s start with some of the factual inaccuracies the caption of the picture illustrating the articles reads people collect water from a leaking pipeline along the guaire river the same line is then used within the article for effect it is false during the blackout there was lack of water supply as a result people resorted to collecting water from springs coming down the avila mountain some of these springs are canalised and then end up in the guaire river people were collecting water from two such springs on the side of the guaire notfrom a leaking pipe water pipes were actually not carrying water this might seem like a small detail but it has a certain importance the headlines in many of the newspapers claimed people were collecting water from the guaire river itself which is extremely polluted el nuevo herald in miami said desperate venezuelans collect rotten water in the midst of blackout the mass media exaggerates and sometimes publishes straight lies in order to fit into a narrative of harrowing crisis in venezuela in order to justify the need for foreign intervention or in any case regime change hetland is not new to this business and should know he needs to check all the details he uses in his story another one in the opening paragraph of his article hetland seeks to draw attention to how bad and long lasting the blackout was he does mention how power was intermittently restored on sunday and monday in parts of caracas and elsewhere but then ends the paragraph with a mention of the new york times headline with the new york times on monday publishing an article titled no end in sight to venezuela s blackout experts warn what s the conclusion he wants the reader to draw that the blackout is far from over in fact we don t know when power will be restored at all there is just a small detail it does not coincide with the facts by midnight 11 march power had been restored in merida zulia and táchira the last remaining states affected by the blackout hetland s article carries the date of 13 march when the blackout was already over and there were only a few smaller towns left affected in paragraph two hetland states the most alarming aspect of the blackout is the lack of power in hospitals of course the lack of power in hospitals is alarming and very dangerous however all hospitals in the country have their own independent power generators that activate in the event of an emergency a report by the opposition aligned ngo médicos por la salud published on 11 march in the evening a list of all 32 of the country s hospitals with a detailed explanation of their situation in all of them their own power plants were working with the exception of one where it was working intermittently heltand then adds to be blunt people are dying and more will die the longer the blackout continues to back up his assertion he links to a reuters report which quotes from medicos por la salud saying that 17 people have died as a result of problems with electricity supply when you then look at the ngo s own report the picture is less clear in the report about the state of hospitals which i quoted above of the 32 hospitals listed all bar two are marked as no deceased and the other two account for a total of three people dead in a separate report by the same ngo about the number of people who died during the blackout 24 are listed but no details are given as to the causes of death so these could be people who would have died regardless of the blackout again this might seem a small detail but details are important because they are what build a story a story can be constructed in two ways one would say hospitals dealt with the blackout by using their own emergency generators which greatly minimised the dangerous impact of lack of electricity the other says the most alarming aspect of the blackout is the lack of power in hospitals to be blunt people are dying and more will die you are more likely to write the second if you rely largely or solely on material from reuters and other such agencies and you are also more likely to stray from the truth what caused the blackout of course heltand s article is built around the blackout and so an explanation of the causes for it should be given what does he tell us about it he starts by saying there are two competing narratives a word i particularly hate but neither he goes on does justice to venezuela s reality in heltand s opinion the blackout and the broader crisis are not entirely the fault of maduro nor of the united states and the domestic opposition the urgency of the situation demands recognition of shared responsibility for the crisis but then hetland states that only the most myopic analysis could ignore the government s clear responsibility for the perilous state of venezuela s electric grid and goes on to give as an example the scandal of the tacoma hydro plant a project that was never finished as a result of corruption even here he gets some facts wrong by using a report that is now outdated however the question is how does a non functioning power plant relate to the current blackout everyone government and opposition agrees that something went wrong inside the control centre for the el guri hydro complex the dispute is about what caused the fault the opposition says it was a wildfire under the main high power line out of el guri while the government claims it was a cyber attack affecting the scada system that regulates the plant which produces 80 percent of venezuela s power what is heltand s opinion about this he does not say though he of course mentions the possibility of a cyberattack quoting an article from forbes he does not go into any of the details and his conclusion is clear available evidence suggests that the blackout was not caused by sabotage but by the electric grid being pushed to the brink by years of increased use and a lack of investment and maintenance available evidence perhaps heltand knows more than everyone else because so far neither the government nor the opposition have provided much if any evidence to back up their stories their arguments are mostly based on circumstantial evidence the opposition has not provided any evidence of the mysterious wildfire that they say affected the 765kv power line and then caused the el guri system to shut down which should be relatively simple if such a fire had occurred furthermore guaidó rejected the idea of a cyber attack as he alleged that the el guri hydro complex was controlled analogically something that is a straight lie all of these things are being widely discussed in venezuela with claims and counter claims being made heltand ignores all of this and simply claims that available evidence suggests that the blackout was not caused by sabotage without even mentioning what is this available evidence he bases himself upon or providing any useful links as a reference in fact he has already decided on an explanation that fits his narrative and has written a story that ignores the available evidence just to cover himself after having declared what the cause of the blackout is he adds getting to the bottom of the blackout is important journalists based in venezuela should investigate the possible causes yes mr hetland getting to the bottom of the blackout is important jumpìng to conclusions based on preconceived ideas does not help journalists based in venezuela have already done a very good job of attempting to establish what actually happened and this article in 15 y últimois perhaps one of the best efforts it was published on 11 march two days before hetland s article was published in the nation the path of negotiation however the main problem with heltand s article lies in the conclusions he draws calls for military intervention must be rejected one must recognize however the untenability of the status quo the combination of maduro s repressive and inept rule and debilitating us sanctions has brought venezuela to the edge of catastrophe the longer the situation continues the worse things will get yes on one thing we can certainly agree the situation in venezuela is bad and has significantly worsened over the last four or five years but what is the plausible path for resolving venezuela s crisis that he proposes first of all he accepts the premise that a peaceful transition needs to take place and this must be through free and fair elections here we see how our liberal critic in fact accepts all of the premises of regime change on which us imperialism bases its current assault on venezuela washington too says it is for a peaceful transition and above all for free elections in fact this is precisely what nominally they are trying to achieve with their policy of diplomatic pressure sanctions and the threat of military intervention hetland therefore assumes without explaining why that the presidential elections in 2018 were not free and fair and that therefore maduro is an illegitimate president otherwise why should there be new elections when he was just sworn in in january our liberal friend finds himself firmly in the camp of the venezuelan opposition and us imperialism his disagreement with imperialism seems to be just tactical he does not think that this outcome can or should be achieved through sanctions or military action he seems to will the ends but not the means how does he think this can be achieved then the only real hope for venezuela s future is the path of negotiations between the government and the opposition this is completely utopian and ignores venezuela s recent past in fact over the years there have been many negotiations between the government and the opposition the current attempt by imperialism is not the first already in april 2002 the opposition carried out a us backed coup barely three years into the chavez government when president chavez was returned to power by a mass movement of the poor what did he do he called on the opposition to the negotiating table how did they respond by immediately starting to prepare for another coup this time in the form of the sabotage of the oil industry and a bosses lockout which lasted from december 2002 until february 2003 and nearly crippled the economy the opposition does not want negotiations they want to crush the bolivarian revolution by any means necessary if they think they can achieve this via negotiations they will not object as long as their objectives are guaranteed the most recent attempt at negotiations was the 2016 17 talks in the dominican republic brokered amongst others by the former social democratic president of spain zapatero the main demand of the opposition in those talks was precisely free and fair early presidential elections when it seemed that an agreeable compromise had been reached and even a date for the elections had been fixed then the opposition under pressure from bogotá and washington decided to walk out of the talks zapatero was fuming and he advised the government to go ahead with the elections on the agreed date the election in which a section of the opposition led by henri falcon participated did take place maduro won and zapatero who acted as an observer vouched for the process but all of this appears to be a closed book to hetland and who is the government supposed to negotiate with throughout his article and in other writings hetland insists on establishing a difference between radical sectors of the opposition or sectors of the far right opposition and the opposition as a whole in practice on the ground such a difference does not exist the current coup attempt led in venezuela by guaidó is backed by all the opposition parties represented in the national assembly the 2016 violent riots which hetland mentions in his article were also part of a joint and unitedcampaign by the opposition as a whole the bulk of the opposition under pressure from washington boycotted the presidential election and expelled henri falcón from the mud democratic unity roundtable for taking part in it in any case how are these negotiations going to happen the government has said repeatedly that it is prepared to negotiate even with trump but the opposition has rejected any advances hetland suggests that perhaps the eu s international contact group could make this happen this is either naïve or seriously dangerous the main eu countries are completely subordinate to washington s strategy on venezuela it was spanish president sanchez who issued an eight day ultimatum to maduro to call presidential elections he was then joined by france the uk germany and the majority of eu members who went on to recognise guaidó as the legitimate president of venezuela the icg was only created in order to destroy mexico s independent initiative to find a negotiated solution when the icg representatives arrived in montevideo the uruguayan government under pressure abandoned its independent position and left mexico on its own you cannot have half a revolution to add to hetland s mythical unicorn of a democratic opposition he then adds that once the us is removed from the equation how by whom then we can hope hope springs eternal in the liberal breasts for a growth of a much broader opposition movement one in which the voices of the popular classes could have much more weight this is perhaps the crux of the matter the main problem in hetland s approach is the lack of any discussion of the class nature of this conflict the venezuelan opposition and behind it washington represents the interests of the country s oligarchy the rich and wealthy families that have ruled venezuela for over a 100 years and playing a subordinate role to us imperialism their mass base of support is mainly drawn from the middle class and upper middle class areas in the east of caracas and other major cities chavismo has its roots amongst the working class the poor peasants and the urban poor the opposition supporters have an irrational hatred a primal fear of the chavista masses during the violent opposition rioting in 2016 a young man orlando figuera was burnt alive and died as a result his crime being dark skinned and therefore looking both poor and like a chavista certainly in this opposition the voices of the popular classes have no weight for good reason most of the venezuelan poor and the working class have a healthy class instinct and they reject an opposition that they correctly see as representing los amos del valle the age old oligarchy abiding by the interests of imperialism the maduro government has had a policy of attempting to compromise with and make concessions to the ruling class this has eroded popular support for the bolivarian revolution what progressives need to discuss is the root cause of the crisis in venezuela and on that basis discuss a solution that benefits the country s working people the frightful economic crisis from which venezuela is suffering was triggered in 2014 by the collapse in the price of oil and has been aggravated by some of the government s policy decisions deficit financing paying the foreign debt widespread corruption and us sanctions but its root cause are the well meaning attempts of the bolivarian government to regulate the capitalist economy through price and foreign exchange controls and robust labour and trade union legislation in order to protect the interests of the many this does not work capitalism cannot be regulated if such a thing is attempted capitalists resort to any measures necessary legal or illegal to circumvent such controls establish systems by which they end up benefiting from them foreign currency speculation black marketeering hoarding and generally resort to sabotage investment strikes and capital flight venezuela is a textbook case of this there are therefore only two solutions to the untenable status quo hetland talks about one resolves the crisis in the benefit of the capitalist class and imperialism that is the one advocated by guaidó in his plan país with the backing of the us it involves privatising state owned companies opening up the public sector to private capital and above all opening up the oil industry which is what john bolton demanded this would mean making the poor and workers pay the full price of the crisis that is the opposition s programme and it certainly does not give any weight to the voices of the popular classes the other solution would be based on pursuing genuine revolutionary policies in the benefit of the majority a return to the tasks that chavez announced but left unfinished a socialist economy and a communal state a socialist economy would require the expropriation of the multinationals and the main capitalist groups in venezuela as well as the latifundia in order to create a democratic plan of production under workers control to satisfy the needs of the majority a communal state would imply putting power in the hands of workers committees peasant committees and neighbourhood councils so that the people can rule hetland seems to perceive only a handful of actors in venezuela the us the far right opposition a mythical democratic opposition and the maduro government however there is also a chavista revolutionary movement which is not the same as the government this can be found in the el maizal in organisations like alexis vive in the few remaining experiences of workers control and in the tens of thousands of poor and working class venezuelans who have come out in the last few weeks to oppose imperialist intervention but you will not find it in the pages of the mass media in the us they are in different degrees critical of the maduro government as a whole or at least of some of its worst aspects corruption bureaucracy etc but they know full well that the coming to power of guaidó on the back of an imperialist intervention would be a major disaster what progressives in the us should do is first and foremost oppose the imperialist policies of their government including sanctions and military intervention this should be done not just through writing articles but by organising a mass campaign in the streets and a mass education campaign amongst students and workers that campaign must distance itself from and challenge the main premises that imperialism is using to justify its intervention it does not mean suspending criticism of the maduro government but that criticism should be made from the point of view of the interests of venezuelan workers and peasants not with a view to pleasing liberal academics in the usa of course such a campaign needs to offer an analysis of what has gone wrong in venezuela but that analysis needs to be firmly based on a class perspective not on the utopian idea that eu brokered talks can somehow resolve the conflict between the interests of the venezuelan workers and poor and those of the oligarchy and imperialism the views expressed in this article are the author s own and do not necessarily reflect those of the venezuelanalysis editorial staff
on thursday january 31 at the central university of venezuela ucv juan guaidó self proclaimed interim president of venezuela presented a powerpoint on his vision for venezuela plan país la venezuela que viene country plan the venezuela to come this presentation was written according to guaidó himself by unnamed economic experts and national assembly deputies although it is not clear if it has been adopted as official national assembly policy while guaidó s presentation was widely reported in the international media the actual contents of the presentation received very little attention guaidó s plan país as well as the closely associated venezuela energética energized venezuela guaidó s party leader leopoldo lópez s 2017 plan for the nation s hydrocarbons industry lay out guaidó s vision of a healthy and economically sustainable venezuela however upon a closer reading it is clear that guaidó s vision fails to adequately address social and economic inequality a key goal of chavismo in reality juan guaidó s venezuela to come is a venezuela we have seen before one for the elites at the expense of lower socioeconomic sectors and the working class guaidó s presentation begins by outlining the opposition case for venezuela as a failed state providing an account compiled from various sources on the country s economic and social implosion the basic facts of which are by now well known the plan is presented as the antidote to this catastrophic situation blamed squarely on the failed economic system of socialism of the 21st century by destroying the country s productive apparatus arbitrary regulations and controls leading to appropriations which are then corruptly plundered here the key theme of individual effort is introduced as he claims such measures have destroyed the citizen s capacity to stand on their own two feet by punishing anyone who looks to provide for their family in a dignified manner by focusing on three main goals giving state power back to the people economically empowering venezuelans and re establishing democracy guaidó proposes a plan to recover venezuela from the current crisis free market faith with regard to giving state power back to the people guaidó emphasized that democracy and the state should be put at the people s gente service so that society can develop itself freely and with dignity to help promote entrepreneurship competition according to this logic empowering venezuelans to overcome structural poverty is directly tied to a reestablishment of free market principles which will supposedly enable society to organize itself in an autonomous manner to solve its problems guaidó therefore believes that economic prosperity in venezuela can only come about by removing state controls on private property he argues that this return to free market policies will solve venezuela s emergency and will allow venezuelans to reach their full potential therefore reinserting venezuela in the concert of free nations of the world and restoring the country s supposedly lost sovereignty guaidó also outlined a few short term priorities to help achieve these larger goals these are to stabilize the economy attend to the complex humanitarian emergency che reactivate the oil industry assure universal access to quality public services guarantee comprehensive citizen security and generate confidence and judicial security to achieve these aims guaidó stated that venezuela will obtain massive financing from four fundamental sources multilateral finance organizations and countries interested in the restoration of democracy and development in venezuela a profound debt restructuring macro economic and regulatory restructuring to attract international investment and recuperation of illegally sourced wealth guaidó s plan to revitalize the economy will involve anchoring the exchange rate to slow inflation dismantling present systems of state control and regulations recapitalizing the banks and reactivating the capital markets promoting international investment including in public companies and in the provision of public services it will address the humanitarian crisis through effective social protection programs as well as through promoting quality jobs and protection of the family income it will place special attention on health education and nutrition and promote jobs through community entrepreneurship programs increasing the minimum wage and creating a new census of beneficiaries to help identify those who need help while some of these goals don t sound particularly malfeasant in theory the presentation s emphasis on the involvement of the private sector through competitive tendering in the provision of public services is deeply concerning the state will only be responsible for the regulation and strict fulfillment of contracts maintaining the ownership of the assets direct subsidies will be provided initially according to the payment capacity of the different sectors of the population but the aim will be to eventually eliminate all subsidies the oil industry reactivating the oil industry is absolutely central to guaidó s program his government would approve a new hydrocarbons law which will include preserving the property of the nation over the oil fields permitting private capital as majority shareholder in oil projects designing a competitive fiscal regime maximizing production of gas and oil and creating a venezuelan hydrocarbons agency agencia venezolana de hidrocarburos avh to supervise the sector one of the most interesting and innovative aspects of guaidó s proposal relates to the notion of democratizing oil according to his plan drawn from the afore mentioned document venezuela energética each venezuelan citizen over 18 years old will receive direct benefits from the oil through a new assets fund for venezuelans based the document reassuringly states on norway s oil fund one of the richest sovereign wealth funds in the world this entity will have the following essential characteristics direct financing from oil sales that is from royalties taxes on profits and shareholding dividends direct ownership by the people with each venezuelan citizen on becoming 18 years old obtaining a personal account in the fpv with directly owned shares which will grow based on oil and gas sales this personal fund can only be used to finance essential needs i e medical insurance mortgages and education costs and will also be the basis of future pension entitlements according to guaidó the fund will be totally transparent with monthly statements on personal accounts provided to each citizen who will also be able to access a webpage to monitor daily activity of the fund it will also be controlled by an independent board without governmental interference the state or as the authors repeatedly insist the government will be financed by a 50 tax on each citizen s fund thus ensuring it s accountability to citizens it is not clear if this will be in addition to existing taxes on income and wealth or replace them through this fund the venezuela energética document makes clear how the other two objectives of guaidó s plan will be achieved the diversification of the economy and the transition to renewable energy the fpv will finance the development of new industries and a robust service sector including hundreds of small businesses again citing norway as an example despite the fact that norway rarely uses its oil fund for these purposes similarly while most of the oil would be exported these sales would finance the development of venezuela s hydroelectric solar and wind energy sources the document however is not clear what mechanisms it will use to achieve these goals the plan closes with two other key promises first comprehensive citizen security via the implementation of a new citizen security strategy which while vague on details promises a thorough structural reform of the public ministry and the national forensic and technical police cicpc including recruiting 120 000 well trained and equipped police additionally the plan promises international cooperation alliances increased preventative policing some form of citizen participation in policing better illuminated streets and renovated and new built prisons notably there is no timeline or financing details provided for these measures which seems to contradict guaidó s promise to reduce the role of the state he also promises a profound review of the justice system including doubling the number of judges in the first year who would be competitively selected and trained in a proposed new school for the judiciary other notable proposals are eliminating indefinite elections of public representatives a key measure introduced by referendum in 2009 combatting corruption among other measures including decentralizing individual states by increasing their powers at the local level while limiting those at the national level overall the plan aims to empower venezuelans to stand on their own two feet and guaidó argues that this can be achieved only with necessary financial support provided under the full rule of law which will thereby liberate the productive forces of the nation a country without a social policy in a previous article in 2014 i identified the preference of opposition parties for private sector activity over state activity both in the economy and in terms of poverty reduction as julio borges the now exiled leader of conservative party primero justicia justice first explained to me in an interview in february 2012 state led social provision aims at maintaining citizen dependence on the state whereas his preferred social policy is that the country does not need a social policy in other interviews conducted at that time with a variety of political and social actors linked to the venezuelan opposition there was a lack of concern for inequality be this socio economic racial or gender inequalities indeed many opposition linked actors i interviewed viewed this concern as more of a discursive strategy employed by chavismo to maintain its power rather than actual empirical social phenomena the current opposition proposals in plan país and venezuela energética continue to reflect these biases plan país is quite clear that the eventual aim in social provision is to eliminate it entirely by privatizing it the state will maintain ownership of assets and infrastructure but service provision itself will be entirely privatized and marketized despite references to universality these services will not be universal in the sense of equal access to all regardless of income as the document suggests that those deemed able will have to pay moreover health and education services will also be financed by the individualized income from the fpv assets fund a similar fate awaits pdvsa the state oil giant which would remain in state hands but be operated by private investors and removed from direct state management to that of an independent board the selection and composition of which remains unclear both documents are characterized by a negative attachment to the state with a preference for terms such as government additionally they shun the concept of collectivity with the people pueblo replaced by the much more general and less political people gente politics and the state therefore are demonized in favor of private individualized initiative which is depicted as the true nature of the venezuelan people and most perfectly expressed by the market this vision is reflected in the fpv assets fund whereby state oil reserves will be transformed into personalized accounts similar to bank accounts and funds allocated with no account taken for social racial or gender inequality the dividends for these are to be used to individually consume privatized essential services which are as is government subjected to a demand led consumer oriented model of citizen control the comparison with norway here is instructive norway is generally viewed as being one of the most equal countries in the world due in large part to a mix of universal welfare state access strong progressive taxation regimes and fair equitable employment regulations the norwegian oil fund then exists in the context of high levels of social equality brought about by a strong state moreover as noted norway does not provide citizens with individualized payments and investment from the fund in state spending is limited to around 4 per annum the venezuela of old the venezuela of juan guaidó s proposed plan país will by no means be a welfare state while the plan mentions consensual salary and labor regulations along international labor organization lines there is no mention of progressive taxation policies or tax policy at all for that matter one of the main aims of the country plan is to reduce and weaken the state rather than as in norway maintain its strength hence the fpv asset fund will most probably not reduce inequality and indeed may increase it as each citizen will be allocated an equal amount regardless of income in the context of a weak or almost non existent commitment to reducing inequality of any type rich venezuelans could conceivably use their fpv dividends to pay for expensive medical care or education services in the united states whereas the poor could not reinforcing existing class and other inequalities the plan then has little in common with the norwegian model and indeed seems its opposite moreover with the promise to immediately involve the imf and other international financial institutions in debt restructuring the opposition is further increasing the likelihood of exacerbating inequality as recent imf involvement in argentina shows in conclusion there is little in these proposals for poor venezuelans the venezuela to come looks conspicuously like the pre chávez unequal elite led venezuela of old

the obama administration worked hard to turn the economy around after trump inherited an economy that would have been a dream for any president he immediately set out to sabotage it and unfortunately his policies are finally kicking in strongly enough to wreck everything that obama did to right the economy bush left him and us but before we get into trump s disastrous policies one little note his utter and complete lack of leadership abilities are working hand in hand with bad policy to bring down the economy take this insane tweet from yesterday announcing that the treasury department had slapped additional sanctions on north korea and that just hours later trump was countermanding them how does something like that even happen was there a gnome working at treasury and doing whatever he wanted to do with no supervision trumponomics author stephen moore like trump a harsh critic of trump appointed fed chair jerome powell will soon be serving on the fed moore s worse yet trump announced that he is nominating another entirely unfit ideologue to a position where he will undoubtably harm everything he touches author stephen moore like trump a harsh critic of trump appointed fed chair jerome powell will soon be serving on the fed moore s primary area of pseudo expertise he is not an economist is fiscal policy wrote jonathan chait he is a dedicated advocate of supply side economics relentlessly promoting his fanatical hatred of redistribution and belief that lower taxes for the rich can and will unleash wondrous prosperity like nearly all supply siders he has clung to this dogma in the face of repeated spectacular failures ok tuck all that away for a moment while we consider two dire reports from bloomberg news friday morning on just after sunrise and one at 11am first was the announcement of a curve inversion an event that usually signals a recession is on the horizon the treasury yield curve inverted for the first time since the last crisis friday triggering the first reliable market signal of an impending recession and rate cutting cycle the gap between the three month and 10 year yields vanished as a surge of buying pushed the latter to a 14 month low of 2 416 percent inversion is considered a reliable harbinger of recession in the u s within roughly the next 18 months demand for government bonds gained momentum wednesday when u s central bank policy makers lowered both their growth projections and their interest rate outlook the majority of officials now envisages no hikes this year down from a median call of two at their december meeting traders took that dovish shift as their cue to dig into positions for a fed easing cycle pricing in a cut by the end of 2020 and a one in two chance of a reduction as soon as this year it looks like the global slowdown worries have been confirmed and the market is beginning to price in fed easing potential recession down the road said kathy jones chief fixed income strategist at charles schwab co it s clearly a sign that the market is worried about growth and moving into treasuries from riskier asset classes too abstract how about u s posts largest ever monthly budget deficit in february will trump call a market crash fake news largest monthly budget deficit ever key word ever seem like a big deal no and that duet deficit is obviously a result at least in part of falling tax revenues because of the catastrophic gop tax bill of last year and increased spending as trump attempts entirely unsuccessfully to buy his way into some kind of popularity the budget gap widened to 234 billion in february compared with a fiscal gap of 215 2 billion a year earlier that gap surpassed the previous monthly record of 231 7 billion set seven years ago according to data compiled by bloomberg february s shortfall helped push the deficit for the first five months of the government s fiscal year to 544 2 billion up almost 40 percent from the same period the previous year the treasury department said in its monthly budget report friday the release was delayed a week by the government shutdown earlier this year receipts dipped less than 1 percent to 1 3 trillion in the october february period from the previous year while spending accelerated 9 percent to 1 8 trillion the fiscal shortfall is widening following president donald trump s 1 5 trillion tax cuts package that s weighing on receipts and raising concerns about the national debt load which topped a record 22 trillion last month federal reserve chairman jerome powell reiterated his concern over the government deficit in a press conference wednesday saying that the nation s growing debt pile needs to be addressed at the same time there s a shift among some economists led by proponents of modern monetary theory on the dangers of a growing deficit with low inflation and cheap borrowing costs suggesting there s room for additional spending the treasury data show tax receipts declined for both corporations and individuals in the five month period while revenue from customs duties almost doubled boosted by income from tariffs imposed by the trump administration the 2017 tax law slashed the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent corporations have so far this fiscal year paid 59 2 billion compared to 73 5 billion in 2018 when the tax law was only partially in effect for some corporations in 2017 however the year before the law was enacted corporations had paid 87 4 billion at this point in the year individual income tax receipts dropped slightly from this point last year but have risen compared to some years before the tax law despite the law cutting tax rates for most people rising wages and lower unemployment have spurred higher tax revenue now think again about trump s newest appointment to the fed stephen moore s career as an economic analyst has been a decades long continuous procession of error and hackery it is not despite but precisely because of these errors that moore now finds himself in the astonishing position of having been offered a position on the federal reserve board by president trump was how chait put it or all their extravagant ignorance moore s beliefs on fiscal policy are actually more sophisticated and well developed than his views on monetary policy it is the latter that he would be in a position to influence as a federal reserve governor while the internal workings of his mind remain a matter of speculation i doubt he is consciously venal enough to tailor his thinking explicitly to partisan goals rather moore has extremely strong partisan instincts and extremely limited analytical skills the combination results inevitably in the latter giving way to the former he should not be permitted any position of

gone are the days in american presidential races when a candidate would rise or fall on policy differences today democrats choosing their candidate for the 2020 race are asking just one question does the person have what it takes to stay the course and defeat republican donald trump first the candidates will have to fight it out among themselves in debates this year and in party primary voting contests next year during which they could inflict serious damage on each other and dangerously weaken their candidacy in the general election so far 13 have formally declared their candidacy and at least seven others are also likely to decide to run here is a profile of the announced candidates and what their chances of success look like at this stage of the battle beto o rourke 46 robert francis o rourke beto is a common spanish nickname for robert is the son of melissa martha williams and judge pat francis o rourke whose forebears emigrated to texas from ireland in the 19th century to help build a railroad in the state the former three term congressman actively engages on irish issues such as protecting the good friday agreement and promoting trade between ireland and the us his platform tends to focus on the big picture with sweeping calls for unity reducing inequality and healing racial divisions but so far is short on specifics that flexibility especially on universal healthcare may not overly endear him to progressives but it could draw support from independents and even some moderate republicans and dent trump s strategy of painting democratic contenders as crazy socialists chances if o rourke were to become the democratic contender he could win his native texas in a battle against trump giving the party a huge advantage young energetic with little baggage he can appeal to the democratic party s middle ground and progressives alike his political prowess is matched only by his fundraising skills without which a successful bid is almost impossible he raised 6 1m 5 4m in the first 24 hours after launching his presidential campaign on march 14 crushing the first day hauls of many of his democratic competitors he could be the party s strongest candidate and is said to be the candidate trump most fears kamala harris 54 credit epa cj gunther kamala devi harris of california is the daughter of an indian mother and a jamaican father and was the first us senator of jamaican or indian ancestry she became a senator for california in 2016 before that she had been california s attorney general since becoming a senator harris has supported universal healthcare immigration reform lowering taxes for the working and middle classes while raising taxes on corporations and the wealthiest top 1 of americans chances harris is seen as a pragmatic progressive with a tough political skin and sharp skills as a former san francisco prosecutor her compelling personal story as the daughter of immigrants could also serve as a useful contrast to trump s anti immigrant rhetoric in a match up against him and draw crucial support from latinos and african americans in a cnn des moines register poll on march 10 almost half of democrats surveyed said her political views are about right and 12 said she s too liberal nearly 58 had a favourable opinion of the senator hers will be a sharp and disciplined campaign bernie sanders 77 credit epa tannen maury bernie sanders of vermont the longest serving independent senator in the us congress who usually votes with the democratic party on legislation enters the race with the strong advantage of national name recognition and a strong progressive record that won him wide appeal when he ran unsuccessfully against hillary clinton for the democratic nomination in 2016 sanders wants universal healthcare and higher taxes for the wealthy he would like to make public collages tuition free which he has proposed paying for by taxing financial transactions he also wants to increase social security benefits for retirees by subjecting all incomes above 250 000 220 000 to the 6 2 payroll tax chances the fact that sanders is not a member of the democratic party and instead describes himself as a democratic socialist is a boon for trump in his bid to cast all the candidates as too socialist for america he has a very high favourability rating among iowa voters 71 see him in a positive light and he is the first choice for 25 of likely voters his views are seen as too liberal 44 or about right 48 but against that voters may be wary of a replay of the 2016 democratic primaries and may be drawn instead to the newer generation of progressive candidates in the sanders mould in that case sanders could end up being a victim of his own success elizabeth warren 69 credit ap photo charles krupa file elizabeth warren like bernie sanders could be described as a liberal populist but one who is also tough and pragmatic she was elected to the us senate for massachusetts in 2012 capturing the seat held by the late senator ted kennedy she is a leading progressive in the party and backs healthcare for all the former harvard law professor has a long track record of opposing lobbyists and billionaires and has pledged to restore the us to a place where people can succeed if they work hard and play by the rules by holding billionaires and big corporations accountable warren wants to introduce a wealth tax of 2 on net worth over 50m 44m and 3 over 1bn 880m designed to raise 2 75trn 2 42trn over a decade all of which would help fund her policies chances she s tough and can be a rousing speaker on the campaign trail she has a detailed grasp of policy issues and a sharp academic mind but some question whether she can sufficiently connect with voters personally warren s favourability rating in the iowa poll took a hit among moderate democrats sanders and warren have similar favourable ratings among liberals 76 and 74 respectively but among moderates sanders gets 68 favourability while warren drops to 54 so the battle between them could be especially fiery cory booker 49 credit epa cj gunther cory booker has represented new jersey in the us senate since 2013 he emerged into the national spotlight as a crusading reformer taking on the established black power structure in newark new jersey in the early 2000s the african american senator launched his presidential campaign with an appeal to america s common purpose and a focus on social and racial equality booker is considered a social liberal who supports women s rights and same sex marriage he is a rhodes scholar and yale law graduate who was adept at promoting himself through the his early use of social media and focusing on an optimistic vision of america chances he connects well with voters who like his charismatic speaking style he will appeal to voters looking for an optimistic message but may be seen as too liberal to appeal to rural voters who want to focus more on jobs and economic wellbeing booker was once one of the top recipients of campaign donations from wall street but has since rejected donations from political action committees he is likely to run a dynamic campaign though it could be more about style than substance kirsten gillibrand 52 credit epa shawn thew kirsten gillibrand a former corporate lawyer was elected a senator for new york in 2009 succeeding hillary clinton who had vacated the seat in her first presidential bid gillibrand has irish links on her mother s side so perhaps it was no accident that she declared her presidential run on st patrick s day i am going to run for president of the united states because as a young mom i am going to fight for kids as hard as i would fight for my own she declared it is why i believe healthcare should be a right not a privilege it is why i believe we should have better public schools for our kids and i believe that anybody who wants to work hard enough should be able to get whatever job training they need to earn their way to the middle class she became known as the metoo senator after leading the push for fellow democratic senator al franken to resign after sexual misconduct allegations chances gillibrand was among the least liberal members of her party when she was in the house of representatives but in the senate she leaned more to the left and was voted the seventh most liberal member of the 46 person democratic group in the last congress she is likely to appeal to the more establishment wing of the party progressive voters are wary of her defence of the tobacco industry and her perceived anti immigrant platform a decade ago she will have her work cut out to bridge the gap during her campaign amy klobuchar 58 credit epa erik s lesser amy klobuchar another former corporate lawyer was the first woman elected to the us senate in minnesota in 2007 she has established a reputation as a matter of fact centrist tackling issues like healthcare and soaring drug pricing she wants to introduce new measures to make it easier for small and mid sized us businesses to export goods worldwide as she announced her entry into the democratic race on a snow covered stage in minneapolis along the banks of the mississippi on february 10 she declared that on her first day in the white house the us would rejoin the paris climate agreement chances because she is seen as not too far to the left nor too far to the right she will have strong appeal to crucial midwestern voters whom democrats desperately need to win back in the 2020 race in the 2016 race hillary clinton only won the previously strong democratic state by 44 000 votes klobuchar has tempered voters expectations about proposals such as healthcare for all and tuition free public colleges saying if i was a magic genie and could give that for everyone and we could afford it i would tulsi gabbard 37 credit alex wroblewski getty images tulsi gabbard has represented hawaii in the house of representatives since 2013 and is the first hindu member of congress before being elected to congress gabbard served in a field medical unit of the hawaii army national guard in a combat zone in iraq from 2004 to 2005 and was deployed to kuwait from 2008 to 2009 she was critical of us intervention in iraq libya and syria and has also denounced us involvement in the yemeni civil war when she declared her entry into the race in february she said she saw the 2020 election as a fight for the soul of america she wants to cut taxes on small businesses and farmers raise them on corporations and lower military spending chances gabbard initially excited the left because she was an outspoken economic progressive and an army veteran who objected to american intervention abroad but in the following years she staked out foreign policy positions that dismayed her supporters she joined republicans in demanding that barack obama use the term radical islam she was the member of congress most willing to advocate for syrian leader bashar al assad saying it was part of an effort to try to find a peaceful solution she may win the votes of some progressive democrats who want to reduce military spending but she may be seen as too controversial to win broad appeal julián castro 44 credit epa etienne laurent julián castro has never served in the us congress he was mayor of his native san antonio texas from 2009 until he joined president barack obama s cabinet as secretary of housing and urban development from 2014 to 2017 he supports healthcare for all and a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants as part of comprehensive immigration reform but he hasn t released many details of his platform although he s been a strong advocate of free trade chances in early polls castro finishes near the bottom of the pack though he will likely do well with latino voters but he has yet to establish a strong donor network or social media following that would help give him more name recognition on the national stage to boost his chances john hickenlooper 67 john hickenlooper who reinvented himself by starting a brewery after being laid off has been governor of colorado since 2011 he is another long shot candidate he has been a strong advocate for ending homelessness in america and has set up a number of programmes in his state to help provide housing he also favours strong gun control measures in the wake of the 2012 aurora theatre shooting that left 12 dead and dozens injured hickenlooper s state government passed background checks for those purchasing guns chances colorado is currently the number one economy in the us and hickenlooper markets himself as a centrist who can bring opposing interests to the table he touts himself as the right person to take on donald trump but not enough democratic voters are likely to agree john delaney 55 i had a great discussion about where the democratic party is headed and my campaign strategy with mitchellreports yesterday check out the full interview here john delaney johndelaney march 19 2019 john delaney a former congressman from maryland has been running for the democratic nomination since july 2107 but few democrats know much about him his central message is one of national unity and he believes he can work with republicans to get things done he is a wealthy entrepreneur worth about 100m 88m having launched two companies that trade on the new york stock exchange hardly surprising then that likes to declare his belief in capitalism the primary is going to be a choice between socialism and a more just form of capitalism he told rolling stone this month i believe in capitalism the free markets and the private economy just as well since he s essentially funding his race himself delaney opposed president trump s decision to withdraw the united states from the iran nuclear deal tweeting this is why putin helped trump campaign he knew trump is untrustworthy would back out of our global engagements tpp paris iran diminish our leadership in the world pulling back from our global leadership position is bad for our economy nat sec chances in 2017 fortune magazine named him in its list of the world s 50 greatest leaders centrist democrats like his pitch to improve workers rights education and infrastructure but he s likely to have insufficient broader appeal jay inslee 68 hey trevornoah how do i get one of these signs for my office pic twitter com xkmggabqyi jay inslee jayinslee march 19 2019 jay inslee is the governor of washington state and a former multiple term us congressman he was an outspoken critic of president george w bush s invasion of iraq in 2003 his major issue is protecting the environment and combating climate change we have exactly one chance left to defeat climate change and that s during the next administration he says stopping climate change can boost economic growth and create millions of new jobs as the us transitions to 100 clean energy and net zero greenhouse gas pollution he proposes removing subsidies and tax breaks for the fossil fuel industry chances his long history of battling climate change will work in his favour with progressive voters who support the green new deal a set of proposed economic stimulus programmes to address climate change and economic inequality andrew yang 44 this may be most innovative presidential campaign idea ever democratic candidate andrewyang may create a 3d lifelike hologram of himself to appear at campaign events here in iowa elsewhere allow people to see him speak while not actually here could be 100 places at once pic twitter com dyofmkj1ci douglas w burns douglaswburns march 21 2019 andrew yang the son of taiwanese immigrants entered the presidential race in november 2018 and that was essentially his first foray into the political world he is a businessman who founded venture for america which seeks to revitalise struggling urban centres by training and fostering entrepreneurs in cities such as detroit and new orleans he is really running on just one issue he wants everyone to have a universal basic income to counteract the worst effects of automation in the workforce chances high marks for ideas but he ll probably

worst case scenario obliterate observing eyes of his humiliation lee said meaning destroying the world that very quickly becomes an avenue a perceived solution for individuals with his personality structure make what you will of such medical predictions but the historical record tells a different story the back and forth with zahn is an instructive and comforting reminder about overstating trump s fragility the trump campaign in 2015 and 16 careened from kill shot to kill shot of course and just kept going right to the white house and that was not the first time he flashed his ability to mitigate calamity and deftly skirt what might have seemed like an inevitable comeuppance whether or not trump could remain not only financially solvent but reputationally intact was an open question for the entirety of the first half of the 1990s so many times he could have been snuffed stopped rendered a relative footnote his place in the history of this country limited to status as a gauche totem of a regrettable epoch of greed that needless to say is not how the tale played out trump is many things a developer a promoter a master media manipulator a grown old rich kid the president of the united states above all else though he is a survivor the ultimate survivor former trump casino executive jack o donnell told me recently but it s not just that trump has survived that s important to consider at this moment it s how he has done it armed with extraordinary audacity constitutional sangfroid a stomach for tumult an acumen for recasting obvious losses into strange sorts of wins and the prodigious safety net bequeathed by his wealthy wily father he has plowed past myriad hazards and he did it by tying himself tightly to his bankers and lenders in new york and to gaming industry regulators in new jersey who let him live large until they couldn t let him die without fatally wounding themselves he effectively inhabited hosts using them to get bigger and bigger in the 80s until he was practically perversely invincible by the 90s not only too big to fail as the late wayne barrett once told susan glasser and me but too big to jail perhaps his past escapes are the reason he appears oddly calm as most of the country leans forward awaiting word of bombshells from mueller over the weekend when outsiders perceived mounting anxiety in trump s twitter barrage people who spoke to trump by phone told reporters that he seemed to be in good spirits the volume of tweets they surmised was just a product of too much time on his hands in the white house his bravado and bluster can t mask his critics say the true jeopardy he faces the stakes now are too high the arena too large the political currents too strong for trump to expect the same results but if he does fail pinned to account by the weight of evidence uncovered by mueller one thing is certain it will be the first time

expectations that benchmark yield dropped below the yields on all maturities of t bills for the first time in 12 years a so called yield curve inversion that is often a harbinger of economic recession while such an inversion has traditionally been an indicator of a recession this time around it may be less about the prospects for the u s economy and more about spillovers from what is happening in

it looks like a textbook example of political meddling with a central bank in an emerging market except its happening in the us president donald trump on friday said he is nominating former campaign adviser stephen moore to be a governor of the federal reserve potentially putting a political loyalist in lockstep with trump s view on juicing the economy into the middle of fed deliberations heading into the 2020 election trump has gone from heckling fed chairman jerome powell on twitter to trying to give one of his allies a hand on the levers of us monetary policy that s a shift by the president who would previously opted for republican establishment fed picks including powell vice chairman richard clarida and vice chairman for supervision randal quarles as a fed governor a position that requires senate confirmation moore would be in a position to espouse his and the white houses view that the economy can grow much faster without generating inflation skeptics in an out of the fed still think sustained 3 per cent to 4 per cent growth is out of reach moore 59 co wrote in a march 13 op ed in the wall street journal nonsense in a bloomberg television interview on friday he called the feds decision to hike rates in december a substantial mistake while saying that he did not want to be a disruptor and i want to be somebody who can really help chairman powell moore s selection is just the latest step in trump s effort to exert control over the us central bank which was designed by congress to be independent from short term political pressure after months of the president s hectoring about interest rate hikes powell in january put monetary policy on hold then dined with him at the white house a few days later on wednesday powell went further effectively taking rate hikes off the table in 2019 under the threat of constant second guessing by the president and potentially soon working with a trump cheerleader inside the building fed officials may find it increasingly difficult to stay focused on keeping the institution at a distance from politics that s important because investors who purchase us treasuries trust the fed to ignore the wishes of politicians and do what it thinks is best for the economy in the long run powell s strategy so far is aimed at avoiding a downturn requiring rate cuts and the emergency bond purchases that drew bipartisan scorn a decade ago even if it means some people think he caved to a politician in the eyes of the world the fed has turned quite political said guy lebas chief fixed income strategist at janney montgomery scott in philadelphia but i dont think anyone in the eccles building sits around and says the president wants this lets deliver it he said referring to the feds washington headquarters fed spokeswoman michelle smith declined to comment powell is already in a precarious spot with interest rates the feds policy rate is now set at 2 25 per cent to 2 5 per cent during the last recession the federal funds rate was cut about 5 per centage points while that was an unusually deep contraction 2 5 per centage points leaves little room to stimulate the economy out of a slump with rates at zero the fed might need to restart purchases of longer term treasury securities for different reasons quantitative easing was unpopular with both republicans or democrats in 2011 moore attacked the second phase of the feds qe programme qe2 is just a fancy word for saying that what were doing right now is were monetizing our debt he told a november 2011 conference in palm beach florida according to a transcript of the event and so this is i think one of the scariest things more recently he is accused the fed of fomenting deflation rather than inflation saying powell was a bad choice for chairman the people on the federal reserve board should be thrown out for economic malpractice moore said dec 22 on red apple group chairman and chief executive john catsimatidiss radio show blaming an end of the year stock market swoon on the feds rate hikes although trump picked powell to lead the fed starting in february 2018 it didnt take long for him to regret his decision the president began expressing his displeasure with fed rate hiking and powell last summer after rates were raised in june the criticism peaked in december when in a tweet he called the fed the only problem facing the economy in one memorable line he asked monetary policy makers to feel the market at one stage trump discussed firing powell bloomberg news reported december 21 under fire from trump powell has tried to communicate directly to a broader audience of americans appearing on the cbs news programme 60 minutes and doing town hall discussions in an effort to demystify what his institution does he is also pledged to wear the carpets of capital hill out in an effort to explain the fed to us lawmakers powell and trump share the goal of a healthy economy my colleagues and i have one overarching goal to sustain the economic expansion with a strong job market and stable prices for the benefit of the american people powell said at the opening of his press conference wednesday explaining the decision the words reflect powell s awareness of the environment the fed finds itself in fighting a recession with limited tools would be one of the worst things for fed amid one of the biggest threats ever to its

president donald trump talks with reporters before boarding marine one on the south lawn of the white house friday march 22 2019 in washington ap photo evan vucci washington ap president donald trump said friday that he will nominate stephen moore a conservative economic analyst and frequent critic of the federal reserve to fill a vacancy on the fed s seven member board moore a well known and often polarizing figure in washington political circles served as an adviser to trump during the 2016 campaign in that role he helped draft trump s tax cut plan trump has been harshly critical of the fed s rate increases even after the central bank announced this week that it foresees no hikes this year moore formerly chief economist for the conservative heritage foundation has also been critical of the policies of chairman jerome powell a fervent advocate of tax cuts moore is close to larry kudlow head of the white house national economic council the two collaborated in shaping the tax overhaul that trump signed into law at the end of 2017 leading to changes that largely favored tax cuts for corporations and wealthier individuals with the idea of spurring investment and growth moore interviewed friday on bloomberg television after trump s announcement said his criticism of the fed including his suggestion that powell should perhaps be fired were probably written in a time of anger i think everyone would now acknowledge moore added that what they did in december with the rate increase was a very substantial mistake and the fed has thank god reversed that and changed directions asked whether trump might want him on the fed s board to check powell s influence and protect the administration s economic policies moore said the only thing trump told me was pursue policies that are good for the american workers he didn t really mention anything about differing with chairman powell one way or the other moore s nomination which the senate must confirm drew sharp criticism from some economists and historians it s unprecedented in the modern era particularly because he lacks expertise in areas under the fed s supervision like banking and monetary policy said gary richardson a historian of the fed and a professor at the university of california at irvine story continues scott sumner the chair of monetary policy at george mason university s mercatus center said his concern is that moore accused the fed of providing too much aid after the 2008 financial crisis when the economy depended on help from the central bank moore has since urged the fed to be more generous in supporting the economy even though growth has strengthened in the past two years and less help is needed his policies appear to be going the wrong way sumner said given his sharply partisan reputation moore could spark opposition among democrats in the senate but trump can score points with his core supporters and with the majority republicans in the senate by embracing a conservative activist for a fed role that would make him a watchdog over the economy freedomworks is proud to see president trump offer such a prestigious position to one of our own said adam brandon president of that conservative advocacy group i have no doubt that stephen moore would make an excellent member of the federal reserve board trump in his first two years in office has been able to reshape the central bank he nominated four of the current five members and he tapped powell who had been chosen for the fed board by president barack obama to succeed janet yellen as chairman if confirmed by the senate moore would fill one of two vacancies on the board the selection of moore marks a deviation from trump s previous choices for the board toward a more public figure who has long pushed conservative economic and political ideology in a march editorial in the wall street journal moore estimated that fed rate policies had reduced inflation adjusted economic growth by as much as 1 5 percentage points in the past six months moore proposed that the fed set short term rates with an eye toward stabilizing commodity prices rather than solely on overall inflation this approach moore has argued would have prevented the fed from raising rates as much as it has and he contended that this approach if adopted would help accelerate economic growth above 3 percent compared with the longer run average of 1 9 percent that fed officials have forecast moore has often embraced a confrontational tone in his commentary on the fed in a 2012 wall street journal column he suggested that the chairman at the time ben bernanke had kept rates near zero and arranged for the fed to buy bonds in order to help barack obama win re election rather than help the economy recover from the financial crisis and great recession moore had earlier predicted in 2010 that the fed s low rates would ignite inflation and he advised investors to buy gold he pressed his case in 2011 warning on fox news we re starting to see that specter of inflation his warnings of runaway inflation proved off base the average inflation rate would fall from 3 1 percent in 2011 to near zero in 2015 with trump as president moore became a sharp critic of fed policies to shrink its balance sheet and return rates to what the central bank sees as a neutral level neither stimulating nor hindering growth he went so far as to suggest that trump might consider trying to fire powell for the rate hikes under his watch what the law says i believe is trump can replace the federal reserve chairman for cause moore said during a december radio interview and you know i would say well the cause is that he s wrecking our economy moore has frequently praised the administration on television and he co wrote the 2018 book trumponomics his partner on that book was art laffer who pioneered the republican doctrine that lower tax rates would accelerate economic growth in ways that could minimize debt but federal debt has jumped since trump s overhaul to the tax code surging nearly 77 percent through the first four months of fiscal 2019 compared with the previous year ___ ap staff writers deb riechman and marcy gordon

stephen moore is a terrible choice for the fed only the best people dontcha know steven l taylor 28 comments via the nyt trump taps fed critic stephen moore for board seat president trump said on friday that he had offered a position on the federal reserve s board of governors to stephen moore a conservative economic adviser who has become an outspoken critic of the fed s interest rate policy mr moore has blamed the fed s rate increases over the past year for slowing economic growth and recently began calling on the central bank to begin cutting rates an economist at the conservative heritage foundation mr moore helped draft mr trump s tax proposals in the 2016 campaign and has served as an informal adviser ever since mr moore who has a master s degree in economics was the founder of the conservative club for growth and a past member of the wall street journal s editorial board the problem this this moore is a hack as jonathan chait bluntly put it trump nominates famous idiot stephen moore to federal reserve board i first started writing about moore in 1997 four years before president clinton had raised the top tax rate to 39 6 percent and supply siders had insisted this would without question cause tax revenues to drop this prediction was a necessary corollary of supply side economic theory which holds that tax revenue moves in the opposite direction of the top tax rate the prediction was spectacularly wrong revenue not only rose it rose much much faster than even the most optimistic advocates of clinton s plan had predicted in the years since i have continued following his career and he has shown no intellectual growth at all he is capable of writing entire columns that contain no true facts at all he made so many factual errors he achieved the rare feat of being banned from the pages of a midwestern newspaper he has sold his policy elixir to state governments which have promptly experienced massive fiscal crises as a direct result of listening to him he believes what he calls the heroes of the economy the entrepreneur the risk taker the one who innovates and creates the things we want to buy should be lionized and that the idea that a recession might be caused by anything other than excessively high rates on these heroes defies common sense he was pulled into trump s orbit during the 2016 campaign and co wrote a ludicrous hagiography of trump and his agenda by all appearances moore opposes mainstream fiscal theories because he simply doesn t understand them moore s beliefs on monetary policy it might be more accurate to describe them as impulses tend to default to partisanship during the obama presidency he warned that runaway government spending would produce hyperinflation in 2009 he appeared on glenn beck s program to wax hysteric in 2010 moore was still predicting hyperinflation and urging his audience to buy gold even by 2015 moore was still urging the federal reserve to raise interest rates we ve had seven years of zero interest rates and the lousiest recovery in 75 years he said so that s one reason a lot of us feel like it s time to get off the zero interest rate policy that last bit is amusing and speaks to the hackery as now he wants the fed to cut rates a more polite but no less worrying tone is set by the economist why stephen moore is unfit for the fed mr moore is certainly not alone in thinking the fed erred by raising interest rates last year the fed itself has become more doveish since then last december the board reckoned 2019 would see two interest rate rises on march 20th they revised that down to none a bigger concern is the winding path mr moore has taken to arrive at his conclusions it raises serious doubts about his judgment and ability to provide politically neutral advice during the obama administration he railed at the fed for keeping interest rates too low and also urged it to shrink the size of its balance sheet but then he became an advisor to the trump administration s election campaign he recently published a book entitled trumponomics with arthur laffer an economist and suddenly he turned from monetary policy hawk to dove it appears his instincts are informed less by sound principles of economic policy than by whatever he thinks most likely to please mr trump mr moore s nomination therefore appears to signal a worrying turn in mr trump s approach to the fed his previous nominees to its ranks have all been mainstream picks his last nominee to the board nellie liang an economist at the brookings institution was strongly endorsed by the fed s chairman jerome powell by contrast mr moore holds some views that amount to a rejection of mainstream macroeconomics emphasis mine or if one prefers bloomberg stephen moore is the wrong person for the fed board moore has been a think tank researcher and pundit for most of his career having worked at the conservative heritage foundation and the libertarian cato institute he served as chief economist for the former though he is not a trained academic economist he has a master s in economics from george mason university he has co founded multiple right leaning lobbying groups such as the club for growth and the free enterprise fund as well as serving on the wall street journal s editorial board at every stage he has advocated tirelessly for conservative policies tax cuts lower government spending and deregulation moore has made a career of what law professor james kwak calls economism a mix of simplistic economic models convenient assumptions and rhetoric designed to make it appear as if economics provides scientific support for conservative policy priorities there are many examples where wishful thinking appears to have distorted his assessments of economic conditions in 2015 for example he claimed that tax cuts in north carolina had caused a decline in the unemployment rate but as paul krugman quickly pointed out the reduction in unemployment was no greater than in the country as a whole and was in large part driven by workers dropping out the labor force in 2012 moore claimed that federal workers were paid 50 percent more than comparable private sector workers because their wages are 2 percent higher and their benefits are 48 percent higher this of course is a math error the pay difference is not the sum of the differences in wages and benefits but their weighted average and is thus much smaller than moore argued as a commentator moore has regularly made dubious economic claims such as the assertion that 2015 saw the strongest economy in 20 years the late 1990s would beg to differ or that the deficit was 1 trillion in 2017 it was slightly more than half of that when writing about the effects of state level tax cuts on employment in 2014 moore overstated recent job gains in low tax states and understated the gains in high tax states he has also made a number of unfounded claims regarding the outcomes of the affordable care act one of moore s biggest departures from the economic consensus is his belief that tax cuts mostly or completely pay for themselves through increased economic growth this belief sometimes cited by advocates of supply side economics is shared by almost no academic economists it goes on and on and on he is not an economist he is an ideologue and a pundit he is not fit for the position to which trump wishes to nominate him but of course trump s approach to complex issues is far more driven by pundits than experts indeed cnbc reports here s how trump decided to nominate stephen moore to the fed and what it means for jerome powell president donald trump decided to choose federal reserve skeptic stephen moore for the central bank s board after a discussion about a column in which moore argued the fed is stifling economic growth a senior administration official told cnbc on friday earlier this week trump spoke to national economic council director larry kudlow the president had seen a column in the wall street journal co written by moore with the headline the fed is a threat to growth in it moore argued that the last major obstacle to staying on this path is the deflationary monetary policy of the federal reserve trump asked his top economic advisor whether he had seen the column kudlow replied that he had and liked it a lot why isn t the fed chairman trump asked rhetorically after kudlow answered that the fed board had two openings the president asked his advisor to talk to moore about one of the posts kudlow asked whether moore was interested and he said he was trump offered moore the fed board job which will not become official until he goes through a vetting process sounds like an excellent dare i say tremendous process for selecting a person for such an important position if you need more vox has

the miserably failed humanitarian aid delivery into venezuela on february 23 is another nail in the coffin of the u s government s coup attempt against president nicolas maduro and the bolivarian revolutionary process in venezuela before this day the u s government and their allies including canada thought that their puppet self declared interim president juan guaidó still had a chance the u s government made a callous bet that the installation of guaidó together with a cruel and illegal sanctions campaign against venezuela would be enough to force the people of venezuela to overthrow the democratically elected government of president nicolas maduro however they were badly wrong the heroic people of venezuela have stood up in defence of their sovereignty self determination and their president nicolas maduro together they have defeated the imperialist attempted coup was the humanitarian aid ever humanitarian the u s government and guaidó together with major mainstream media have been spreading lies and manipulations about venezuela and president maduro to justify their illegal and anti democratic intervention it was especially clear when it came to how they built the case for the humanitarian aid delivery into venezuela scheduled for february 23 2019 how to hide an empire immerwahr daniel best price 15 69 buy new 17 24 as of 11 50 utc details a good place to start to uncover this deception is to ask the question was the humanitarian aid ever humanitarian before the aid was loaded onto u s military aircraft and flown into colombia it was already a disaster in the making the aid was to be provided and delivered by the usaid united states agency for international development both the red cross and the united nations rejected the humanitarian aid scheme of the u s government as a united nations spokesperson reminded reporters in new york city humanitarian action needs to be independent of political military or other objectives undoubtedly this was not the case with the usaid delivery the humanitarian aid was nothing but a thinly veiled pretext for furthering the u s backed coup against president maduro and what about the claim that the government of president maduro is not accepting international aid the week before the u s government s attempted aid delivery venezuela s health ministry reported that 64 containers amounting to 933 tons of medicine and medical aid arrived in venezuela mostly from china and cuba also in february the red cross increased its budget in venezuela to 18 million the united nations continues to work with the government of venezuela to provide food clothing and services to people in venezuela this includes 9 2 million in health and nutritional aid which the government of venezuela requested at the end of november 2018 to alleviate some of the devastating impacts of increasing u s sanctions the government of venezuela also receives support from the un world health organization who and the pan american health organization paho on immunization campaigns and disease control these few examples alone are much more than the 200 tons of humanitarian aid that the usaid was planning on delivering on february 23 the claim that president maduro does not accept international aid is also lie intended to demonize president maduro to win favour for u s intervention on february 23 the people of venezuela were not fooled by the usaid humanitarian aid scheme u s government stooge guaidó failed to bring enough supporters to the border to create the aid avalanche he promised the venezuelan army stood with the democratically elected government of president maduro and refused to accept humanitarian aid into venezuelan territory at the colombia venezuela border and rejected a similar stunt at the brazil venezuela border they recognized the aid for what it was a provocation by the u s government and their counter revolutionary right wing allies in colombia and venezuela what about sanctions the omission is just another form of lying and yes there is a glaring omission when it comes to the imperialist rhetoric and reporting about venezuela and venezuela s struggling economy sanctions as alfred de zayas independent expert on the promotion of a democratic and equitable international order from the united nations said in an interview on the empire files empirefiles what is particularly cynical is to cause an economic crisis that threatens to become a humanitarian crisis that is what the united states has done through the financial blockade through the sanctions u s canada european union and swiss sanctions are so pervasive that even to call the usaid humanitarian aid a band aid is an overstatement the u s government offered 20 million of aid to venezuela while at the same time these crippling sanctions rob the people of venezuela of more than 30 million a day imperialist aggression what we can learn from the attempted coup against venezuela since january 23 2019 the u s government has further increased the already devastating sanctions to enforce its coup effort the new restriction includes imposing strict sanctions against venezuela s state owned oil company petróleos de venezuela s a pdvsa as the u s government has consciously planned this will dramatically impact venezuela s imports and exports and continue to drain their economy of the u s dollars which are required for venezuela to participate in international trade additionally sanctions have enabled the u s government and their allies to steal billions of dollars that belong to venezuela which they are attempting to redirect to their appointed interim president guaido the stolen money includes 1 2 billion in gold that the bank of england refuses to give back to venezuela as well as billions of dollars in profits from citgo the u s based distribution arm of the pdsva oil company even before the pdvsa sanctions were implemented venezuela s imports had dropped from 60 billion a year in 2013 to 12 billion in 2017 at the same time the financial crimes control network fincen of the u s treasury has also been ordered to monitor any financial transactions that the government of venezuela makes in this way the u s and their imperialist allies prevent venezuela from paying for imports even when it has the funds for example when the government of venezuela went to purchase 300 000 doses of insulin citibank closed all their accounts and refused to complete the transaction is there an international consensus against president maduro no there is not an international consensus against the government of president maduro although the u s government claims to have the support of 50 countries that means that they do not have the support of the other 143 countries that are recognized by the united nations most of the world continues to stand with venezuela and the democratically elected government of maduro maduro s support includes almost the entire continent of africa except morocco and the entire region of asia and oceania except australia there is in fact not even a consensus in support of the coup from europe where italy greece norway slovakia cyprus and belarus have all refused to join with the united states in latin america and the caribbean the u s government and canada were even forced to create the so called lima group of countries because they could not convince enough member states in the organization of american states to support their campaign to overthrow the government of president maduro as just one example of international solidarity with venezuela caricom an organization that represents 15 states in the caribbean released a statement on february 25 the statement read the community maintains that the solution must come from among the venezuelan people and abides by the internationally recognized and accepted principles of non interference and non intervention in the affairs of states respect for sovereignty adherence to the rule of law and respect for human rights and democracy if no one supports president maduro how is he still president when was the last time you saw photos and videos tens of thousands of people mobilizing in the streets of cities all over venezuela in support of president maduro when was the last time you heard an interview with someone in venezuela calling for an end to cruel u s sanctions however if there is one thing that can be shown from the failed u s led coup in venezuela it is that the democratically elected government of president maduro continues to be very popular the coup against venezuela has failed because the mass majority of people in venezuela support the government and want to defend and continue to extend the gains they have made in the 20 years of the bolivarian revolutionary process legacy of ashes the h tim weiner best price 2 13 buy new 8 95 as of 06 40 utc details what are some of these gains by redirecting venezuela s wealth from the pockets of international corporations and the wealthiest venezuelans into social programs the bolivarian revolutionary process has brought millions of people out of extreme poverty there have been remarkable gains in housing healthcare and education including the eradication of illiteracy and the great housing mission gmvv which has constructed and delivered 2 5 million homes to venezuela s poorest and most marginalized people since 2011 despite the imperialist attempt to strangle their economy and starve the people of venezuela venezuela continues to rank high on the human development index hdi based on 2017 data the 2018 hdi reports that venezuela has a high human development putting the country 78th of 189 countries it means venezuela has a higher hdi then both brazil and colombia which are key right wing allies in the u s war drive because these well established statistics do not fit into the false narrative of the u s government they have been almost completely left out of mainstream media reporting on venezuela it s a media blackout the gains of the bolivarian revolutionary process and the voices of people in venezuela that support president maduro have been silenced by imperialist governments and their lackeys in mainstream media do the governments of the us and canada care about people in venezuela to answer this let s follow some of what the u s has said and done since the february 23 humanitarian aid failure on february 25 the u s government organized a summit in colombia to maintain momentum for puppet guaidó and their attempted coup u s vice president mike pence was there along with countries of the lima group including canada and 11 latin american right wing governments although the lima group stopped short of supporting u s military intervention in venezuela this summit further exposed that the u s government and their allies have no interest in the human rights of the people of venezuela to which the foreign minister of canada chrystia freeland replied we are discussing with our partners now ways that sanctions list can be expanded in order to have even more bite the government of canada s quick support for u s sanctions and aggression against venezuela is of no surprise as with the united states the government of canada could care less about the human rights of people in venezuela take a look at the twitter accounts of chrystia freeland or u s national security advisor john bolton they are all too happy to share evidence that the people of venezuela are struggling under their sanctions and brutality the government of canada is every bit as interested as the united states in overthrowing president maduro and reversing the gains of the bolivarian revolutionary process how else can the government of canada protect the interests of canadian mining and resource extraction companies in venezuela and throughout latin america surely letting a country like venezuela nationalize its natural resources and use those profits to build social services instead of lining the pockets of foreign corporations is out of the question to support the u s government in this dangerous proposal juan guaidó and his coup supporters promoted the concept of the responsibility to protect most recently responsibility to protect was used for the bloody imperialist assault against haiti in 2004 and libya in 2011 right wing u s senator marco rubio in fact made the direct connection between venezuela and libya when on february 24 he tweeted a photo of the murder of gadhafi within a long line of tweets on venezuela the people of haiti libya syria iraq afghanistan yemen and every other country that the u s government has destroyed with invasions sanctions bombing and covert and overt military operations would certainly disagree that the united states cared at all for their human rights and freedom build a united movement in solidarity with venezuela no lie from the mouth of anyone in the government of the u s or canada and no amount of media disinformation can erase the simple fact the people of venezuela have withstood a tremendous imperialist assault and continue to stand up for president maduro and the bolivarian revolutionary process this defeat however does not mean that the u s government and their allies including the government of canada will stop their attempts to overthrow the government of president maduro and reverse the gains made by poor working and oppressed people in the last 20 years of the bolivarian revolutionary process far from it as people living in the u s and canada and around the world it is our responsibility to stand against imperialist war and sanctions against venezuela we must build a stronger and more united movement to face this ongoing assault we must continue to show the world that venezuela is not alone note to readers please click the share buttons below forward this article to your email lists crosspost on your blog site internet forums etc

news analysis alaska is alice rogoff and if you watched the rise the fall and the implosion of what was the alaska dispatch news you know how that story ended where it began was with rogoff growing up in a comfortable upper class family marrying david rubenstein who eventually earned more money than many banks and as a result never needing to learn how to work for a living the parallel with alaska a state of which rogoff so badly wanted to be part isn t perfect but it s close alaska struggled and clawed for survival before oil was struck on the north slope in 1968 but ever since the crude started flowing in 1977 alaskans have been living easy on the money of oil industry s labor forty two years is a long time to live outside reality people become conditioned to the idea life will always be easy and the money will always be there certainly rogoff did money was not something she earned it was something given to her to spend because of who she was and she spent it with good

becoming an alaska somebody the money an alaska jury decided she owes him but on a societal level she wanted to help people especially alaska s native people alaskans have always been similarly well intentioned about 60 cents of every dollar the states spends today goes to finance education pay for healthcare for low income residents to support welfare or to provide for pensions why because alaskans left center or right want all the state s children to be educated want everyone to survive illness want to keep the poor from starving and want to thank those who worked to build the state

alaskans educated their own children fought off illness as best they could without medical providers left the weak behind to die and had no clue as to the meaning of the word pension and for almost two decades after the territory of alaska was replaced by the state of alaska good intentions were constrained by fiscal realities income tax before oil started gushing in the north alaska state government survived mainly on an income tax and spent about 500 million per year were the spending of 1975 adjusted for inflation and population growth and projected forward to today the state would be spending about 2 billion the state is spending more than twice that now why because it can because we can the state of alaska like rogoff is rich as of the end of february we were sitting on 63 9 billion in the permanent fund despite this republican gov mike dunleavy entered office proposing 1 6 billion in budget cuts he has been taking the predictable public beating ever since all politicians agree there is fat in the state budget right up until the time it comes time to go on a diet and then a lot of the fat becomes muscle anyone who has ever gone on a diet can understand the problem dieting is difficult you have to control your desires and alaskans have spent decades eating what they want not only that there is little real reason to diet yes it might make the budget look better but it s not like we re going to die tomorrow if we don t get things under control if the state goes on doing what it is doing and maintains itself by emptying the constitutional budget reserve fund cbrf and drawing down the state s earning reserve it can continue to pay full permanent fund dividends and survive through fiscal year 2028 and still be sitting on 63 billion in the permanent fund according to the state of alaska fiscal plan for fy20 fy29 released by the dunleavy administration this week with no accessible savings this scenario leaves few options and fewer assets for future alaskans the plan adds taxes or budget cuts would still be required but the conversation would just be delayed for a decade the short term benefits are highest in this scenario as no money is removed from the current economy and pfds are greater than in fiscal year 2019 fy19 as a result total household income in fy20 increases by about 1 3 billion and no subtractive impacts are felt by the current economy the dunleavy fiscal plan could be found here miracles the dunleavy plan refers to this as the kick the can down the road approach it is similar to rogoff s hope for a miracle plan that envisioned people lining up to buy newspapers in the age of the internet the kick the can down the road approach eventually needs a miracle too a big jump in oil prices this probably has a better chance than rogoff s miracle bp one of the oil majors was once projecting 100 per barrel oil would become the norm the price today is moving around 65 per barrel and most forecasts predict it will stay below 70 per barrel for a long time given this dunleavy has for better or worse rejected the miracle gamble the governor does not believe it is just to saddle future generations with the questionable fiscal decisions of today the fiscal plan says therefore he does not support this scenario instead his proposal is to cut democrat legislators have talked about new taxes neither option is all that good the dunleavy plan does offer a fourth option but promptly rejects that call for the use of permanent fund earnings to offset the deficit in order to maintain state spending this scenario inevitably leads to the demise of the pfd program as increased government spending eventually consumes the entire permanent fund draw the plan says ultimately this scenario still requires a future solution to the same problems currently facing the state the fiscal plan is 20 pages long and simplifies the state s budget issue about as much as it can be simplified it is doubtful many alaskans will read the document the plan also highlights the one thing on which all economists and most politicians do agree there is no simple solution to addressing the state s budget deficit every option comes at a cost the question is what trade offs are we willing to accept while reductions in state services are difficult decisions it is important to recognize the cost of not addressing the structural gap between revenues and expenditures dunleavy s big argument for majors cuts is a long game plan the economy takes a hit in the short term but the restoration of the permanent fund dividends help offset the damage and once the economy stabilizes in a state with a trimmed down bureaucracy a cap on spending another dunleavy proposal and requirements for alaskan approval of any new taxes the state will start to grow again the governor s plan signals to those wishing to invest in alaska that it has its fiscal house is in order and is open for business the plan results in higher levels of household income to support a higher standard of living avoids taxes that would hinder economic growth and ensures that alaskans continue to receive their individual share of alaska s resource wealth the plan argues removing uncertainty regarding future taxes will promote further investment and allow alaska s economy to grow and diversify that conclusion is speculative economically it s true that lower taxes and fiscal certainties encourage business investment but alaska has a lot of natural disincentives to business it s far from markets the cost of living is high the pool of skilled workers is small and more signalling that alaska is open for business might encourage investment in new alaska business but there s no guarantee and it s hard to see a promise of a better times in the future causing any government employees to willingly give up their jobs today there are reasons budget cutting is hard rogoff couldn t do it even though she had complete control over her business she ended up losing it all in bankruptcy dunleavy has only limited control over the state budget and is facing a tsunami of opposition to his proposed budget cuts the only thing legislators hate more than cutting budgets is imposing taxes the other option for getting the state s fiscal house in order whether alaska government can do either or simply kicks the can again remains to be seen the fiscal plan warns that a crisis near arguing that now the cbrf balance is at what many consider to be the minimum level needed for cash management and emergencies and it appears unlikely that high oil prices are going to save the day be that as it may there are political reasons for years of political inaction even if the results were not good the data clearly show that spending 16 billion out of savings over the last four years to support higher government spending did not get alaska out of a recession and did not significantly reduce unemployment the plan says fiscally that s a valid argument for changing course economically some are already arguing the dunleavy plan could make things worse lengthening the recession and increasing unemployment politically lawmakers are mainly thinking about what plan will get them re elected stay tuned
by reuters san francisco reuters the federal reserve s patient approach to monetary policy does not mean the u s central bank will not increase interest rates or cut them should the need arise the president of the atlanta federal reserve bank raphael bostic said on friday we may move up we may move down bostic said in remarks prepared for delivery to a monetary policy conference at the san francisco fed the comments were bostic s first since the fed made an unexpectedly dovish shift on wednesday eleven of its 17 policymakers forecast no rate hikes this year and fed chairman jerome powell cited low inflation a slowing global economy and risks like u s trade tensions with china for the need to remain patient for some time after the wednesday announcement financial markets which had already priced out any chance of a rate hike this year began pricing in the likelihood of a rate cut next year but to see the fed s recent pronouncements as a definitive signal that the central bank will hold rates steady for the balance of the year is not accurate bostic said on friday adding that patience does not constrain the fed s options i am open to all possibilities as we aim to support sustained economic expansion strong labour market conditions and inflation near the committee s symmetric 2 percent objective bostic said referring to the policy setting federal open market committee markets should understand that so i hope i have made my position clear in february bostic said he expected the fed would need to raise interest rates once this year after raising rates four times in 2018 he did not say how many rate hikes he now thinks are appropriate the fed has become increasingly worried about meeting its 2 percent inflation target and sceptical that the trump administration s tax cuts and deregulation will unleash faster economic growth so have financial markets data published earlier on friday showed u s manufacturing activity unexpectedly cooled in march a troubling sign for the u s economic outlook that helped push long term borrowing costs below short term ones an indication of near term risk and seen by many as a potential harbinger of recession the spread between yields on three month treasury bills and 10 year notes fell below zero for the first time since 2007 after u s manufacturing data missed estimates earlier on friday data out of germany showed the factory sector there was continuing to contract another worrying sign for the global economy reporting by ann saphir editing by leslie adler
age 47 address 1932 s 24th st occupation city councilwoman political party democrat education bachelor of arts in history yale college 1993 master s in comparative social policy university of oxford 1997 website leirionforlincoln com experience gaylor baird has served six years on the city council and was a member of the lincoln lancaster county planning commission and the lplan advisory committee that produced the 2040 comprehensive plan the strategic road map for lincoln s growth and development she s also been an active community volunteer organization endorsements lincoln firefighters union iaff local 644 lincoln police union nebraska conservation voters why are you running and what do you want to accomplish in office for me this is about family my parents were public school teachers and they taught me that a career can be dedicated to improving the lives of others as a mom i ve spent a lot of time focused on how to keep my three children safe provide for their basic needs give them a great quality of life and ensure they have the same opportunities as anyone else for a bright future as a former planning commissioner and your city councilwoman i have a 12 year track record of delivering on these same priorities for all of our children and families in lincoln as mayor i will continue to work to ensure our public safety to invest in the basics like streets and sidewalks to maintain our neighborhood parks trails pools playgrounds and libraries so essential to our quality of life and to address affordable housing every candidate includes public safety and streets as their top priorities in lean financial times how would you budget for parks libraries and other city services parks libraries programs for children and seniors and other city services are investments we make in keeping our community strong and vibrant modern cities compete for talented workers and a high quality of life is critical to attracting them innovative partnerships and thorough budget analysis are key to funding these services in 2018 i created the parks community challenge grant to incentivize private gifts for our park system and identified additional keno proceeds to restore bennett martin library s evening hours should voters approve a quarter cent hike in the city sales tax with proceeds earmarked for streets why or why not i am glad that lincoln residents will have the opportunity to decide whether they want to invest in improving our roads a coalition of neighborhood and business groups including the lincoln chamber of commerce supports this plan nearly a third of the revenue collected from this sales tax will come from people outside of lincoln who use our streets while this compromise package is not perfect it deserves support as it will inject needed funds into vital infrastructure ensuring that everyone has access to decent housing that they can afford has become a national topic what is your definition of affordable housing what should the city do to encourage or provide for more affordable housing i m the only mayoral candidate who took action in last year s budget to address the issue of affordable housing for a challenge this complex the city needs a variety of strategies focused on those who make 30 80 percent of median income we must improve the quality of our existing housing stock increase the supply of new housing partner with nonprofits like the lincoln housing authority and neighborworks and support the creation of community land trusts to establish permanently affordable housing with the rise in home values the city and other local governments could bring in more revenue by not reducing the property tax rate the additional tax revenue coming from the increase in appraised value has been called a windfall how should the city respond in 2017 when the county assessor greatly increased home valuations i led the effort to lower the property tax rate and shield homeowners from the full impact of the valuation increase because i understand the importance of acting with both the best interests of homeowners and responsible budgeting in mind this year we are experiencing a projected shortfall in sales tax receipts so we should wait to see the full revenue picture before finalizing the tax rate in 2012 the city council passed an ordinance protecting people from discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation in housing employment and public accommodations a referendum petition stopped the ordinance from going into effect the council has not rescinded the ordinance nor put the issue on the ballot if the state does not pass discrimination protection based on sexual orientation and gender identity this session should the city council put the proposed fairness ordinance on the ballot for a citywide vote why or why not if we want to be on the right side of history attract and retain a talented workforce and simply be good people to our neighbors then we must end discrimination against our lgbtq friends and family no one should have to endure a vote on their civil rights however if efforts to pass statewide legislation fall short then with the lgbtq community s leadership and support lincoln should work to ensure success at the ballot box some lincoln residents including members of nebraskans against gun violence believe the city council should pass a safe gun storage ordinance do you think the city should require gun owners to lock up guns in their homes i support responsible gun ownership and i am pleased that a task force that includes mental health providers law enforcement gun owners parents and community members of diverse viewpoints on this issue is examining how to prevent child access to firearms and to promote responsible storage of firearms this is an important process to undertake before making any decisions on a safe storage ordinance and i look forward to having a community conversation about their recommendations the city has banned cardboard from the city landfill and required local haulers to provide curbside recycling service should the city go further by banning other recyclable products paper plastic from the landfill what changes if any would you propose for the recycling program recycling diverts waste and extends the life of our public landfills reducing pressure on taxpayer dollars every year that we can put off the expense of a new landfill we have more money available in our city budget for other important infrastructure recycling is not only good for our environment it s also good for our city s bottom line should we recycle more yes what role should the city take in planning and paying for bike paths on streets or wider sidewalks and bike trails separate paths for bikes and walkers while cars are our primary means of transportation lincoln should plan for bike paths and trails alternatives that relieve pressure on parking reduce traffic and air pollution and make our city a more attractive place to live bike facilities comprise the smallest portion of our city s transportation budget and lincoln should continue to secure grants to help pay for them by combining implementation of the bike network with other street projects we can create efficiencies that reduce costs is climate change real and what are its likely causes does the city have any role in trying to help curb climate change our accelerated rate of climate change is real and man made and we must do our part to mitigate the risks posed to our economy environment and quality of life i voted for lincoln s partnership with unl to create renewable energy systems at innovation campus greenlight lincoln to reduce traffic congestion and air pollution biogas to fuel city buses community solar projects and an environmental action plan that s currently moving us toward citywide led streetlights saving energy and taxpayer dollars winter weather has created an abundance of potholes do you think the city does enough to address the problem is there anything it should change the citizens transportation coalition determined lincoln has a 21 million gap in funds needed to adequately maintain our streets including pothole repair work i have voted for increases in road maintenance funding every year i have been in office in 2017 i supported buying equipment that sped up pothole repair by 50 percent with increased effectiveness as long as nebraska has freezing winters and cold temperatures we ll be fighting against potholes it is an ongoing responsibility that i take seriously
moore has been a think tank researcher and pundit for most of his career having worked at the conservative heritage foundation and the libertarian cato institute he served as chief economist for the former though he is not a trained academic economist he has a master s in economics from george mason university president donald trump has said that he plans to nominate stephen moore a writer and policy analyst for a position on the federal reserve board he has co founded multiple right leaning lobbying groups such as the club for growth and the free enterprise fund as well as serving on the wall street journal s editorial board at every stage he has advocated tirelessly for conservative policies tax cuts lower government spending and deregulation loading moore has made a career of what law professor james kwak calls economism a mix of simplistic economic models convenient assumptions and rhetoric designed to make it appear as if economics provides scientific support for conservative policy priorities there are many examples where wishful thinking appears to have distorted his assessments of economic conditions in 2015 for example he claimed that tax cuts in north carolina had caused a decline in the unemployment rate but as paul krugman quickly pointed out the reduction in unemployment was no greater than in the country as a whole and was in large part driven by workers dropping out of the labour force in 2012 moore claimed that federal workers were paid 50 per cent more than comparable private sector workers because their wages are 2 per cent higher and their benefits are 48 per cent higher this of course is a math error the pay difference is not the sum of the differences in wages and benefits but their weighted average and is thus much smaller than moore argued
huge oil refinery at h tota controversies and major questions over project by namini wijedasa view s view s by namini wijedasa the son of a controversial indian politician from the dravida munnetra kazhagam dmk is a director in not just one but two companies recently incorporated in sri lanka the second was set up ostensibly to implement a us 3 85 billion rs 685 5 billion oil refinery project in hambantota but the initiative is mired in confusion the sri lankan government first announced the involvement of the omani ministry of oil and gas however oman swiftly denied it had any part in the multibillion dollar investment this contradicted multiple documents including cabinet and board of investment boi papers the sunday times has seen that conclusively say the omani ministry will hold a 30 percent stake in the relevant joint venture with the remaining 70 percent going to silver park international pte ltd of singapore the boi then issued a statement admitting that â there is no agreement that has been signed between omanâ s ministryâ of oil and gas and silver park international pte ltd with regard to equity arrangements of the project â but the oman oil company â has registered their firm intention to participate in equity up to 30 percent subject to reaching agreement between the partiesâ it said indicating that the omani participation had been heavily overplayed well before a deal was made yesterday the development strategies and international trade ministry circulated an â urgentâ media statement announcing that oman s oil and gas minister mohammed hamad al rumhi had arrived in colombo with the chief executive officer of oman oil refineries and petroleum industries co orpic for the groundbreaking ceremony of the oil refinery in hambantota this too said orpic â has expressed its firm interestâ in partnering with silver park international in the project it is clear therefore that the proposed deal between silver park and the omani entity is still

authority for establishment of the hambantota industrial zone in which such projects could be established the process however is time consuming â and the investor has expressed deep concern on delay in allocating landâ â considering above and to prevent the investor from shifting to another country the boi has applied to allocate 200 acres of land from the mirijjawila export processing zone on a

desalination facility storage tanks etc without further delay â the cabinet has been told with such allocation of land the boi will reportedly conduct a site specific eia while the investor will be

with expectations for a deal high on both sides u s and chinese trade negotiators are working under a tight time frame experts express concern that an agreement cobbled together beneath a ticking clock might disappoint corporate america and wall street reported plans for a meeting between president donald trump and his counterpart xi jinping appear to have been postponed to an as yet undetermined date possibly in april although the two countries have made public statements touting the progress made so far leaders of u s based trade groups say they have been relegated to reading the tea leaves from the sidelines some three weeks after the white house s self imposed deadline of march 1 a week ago it seemed like we were close to an agreement said craig allen president of the u s china business council i think that delay could be a cause for concern that we re not as close to an agreement as we could be he said the business community hasn t been kept fully apprised by the administration of what s going on in the negotiations said rufus yerxa president of the national foreign trade council the trump administration has touted pledges from beijing to buy more soybeans and liquid natural gas from the u s as evidence of its progress in negotiations while this would help the agriculture and energy sectors and likely score the president political points in regions he will have to defend in the 2020 election it doesn t address the biggest problems u s multinationals face in china my feeling is that the chinese have to offer meaningful changes in the way they treat foreign companies and foreign investment yerxa said we really don t know how significant the differences are between the two sides he said on key issues like protection of intellectual property and beijing s state support for its domestic businesses that compete with american firms an agreement by china to buy more u s goods also would raise the trade deficit on that export category which has risen to a record 891 billion under trump the president previously has railed against the size of the trade deficit saying on twitter last year the u s has been ripped off by other countries for years on trade boeing s current woes further complicate the situation regarding the trade deficit the plane manufacturer said last year that chinese airlines would buy 7 690 planes over roughly the next two decades for a combined value of 1 2 trillion now according to bloomberg china is said to be considering striking boeing s troubled 737 max jet from the list of goods it planned to purchase from the u s following two high profile crashes within six months that investigators say bear similarities three quarters of those chinese purchases would be single aisle aircraft boeing had said a forecast that is now in jeopardy since the max is the new version of boeing s single aisle best seller the 737 the max is currently grounded by air transport agencies worldwide even if the u s trade delegation can navigate the added complication of its biggest export driver being taken out of the equation analysts say any deal that fails to address the structural reforms sought by the u s on practices like joint partnership requirements and forced technology transfers could make the losses incurred by some american companies for naught some revenue will come back quickly soft boycotts tariff related price increases etcetera but they might have to rework their supply chains which will be a long lasting and costly issue said sameer samana senior global market strategist at the wells fargo investment institute some companies may never recover from the damage the tariffs have caused especially the smaller overly leveraged firms said george kiraly founder and cio of the lodestar advisory group forecasts of future economic loss paint a similarly disheartening picture a report published by the rhodium group a consulting firm in conjunction with the u s chamber of commerce found that the trade war s collective impact on the country s gdp could reach 1 trillion over a 10 year period across all tariff escalation scenarios the tech sector a key driver of the current market rally would be especially hard hit import tariffs can shield domestic production from competition that can encourage inefficiencies one thing is clear we see a pretty strong negative impact on productivity and resource allocation said lauren gloudeman a senior analyst at the rhodium group of more immediate concern a failure by u s negotiators to win key concessions could have ramifications on the stock market if the scope of any deal is less comprehensive than wall street expected investors may face a reckoning markets might rally a bit further but a lot of optimism is now priced in on the announcement of a trade deal samana said we still think a deal is the most likely outcome but it s hard to tell what the quality of the deal will be in terms of how whether it deals with the tougher issues he said any trade deal announced between the u s and china is likely to disappoint kiraly cautioned it will likely be a case of buy the rumor sell the news for the markets it s pretty much priced in as stocks have rallied strongly in anticipation of a deal he said jacob kirkegaard senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics suggested that members of trump s trade team might be starting to realize the intractability of their predicament from a diplomatic as well as an economic perspective underneath all of this you increasingly have the realization in the administration i think that you re not going to get these fundamental changes in the chinese economic model he said pointing out that state support and protectionism are key tenets of its economic model it s clear that xi jinping believes these enterprises are very important for china s future kirkegaard said he s not going to change his economic philosophy and master plan for china to get this deal even with the biggest economy in the world the u s has few effective mechanisms for oversight and enforcement in forging a bilateral trade deal without the international backing of groups like the world trade organization a bilateral agreement is very difficult to enforce said allen of the u s china business council these are ideological and emotional as well as practical and nationalistic issues on both sides that does not lend itself to stability and predictability trade negotiators for the u s could insist that beijing demonstrate its willingness to address american concerns before it rolls back trade sanctions but keeping tariffs in place is likely to be a nonstarter for the chinese delegation creating a stalemate with no obvious path forward unless one side or the other yields a hastily forged trade pact that centers around china s willingness to purchase more american goods might let trump claim a victory in the run up to an election year analysts warned though that any

moore has been a think tank researcher and pundit for most of his career having worked at the conservative heritage foundation and the libertarian cato institute he served as chief economist for the former though he is not a trained academic economist he has a master s in economics from george mason university president donald trump has said that he plans to nominate stephen moore a writer and policy analyst for a position on the federal reserve board he has co founded multiple right leaning lobbying groups such as the club for growth and the free enterprise fund as well as serving on the wall street journal s editorial board at every stage he has advocated tirelessly for conservative policies tax cuts lower government spending and deregulation loading moore has made a career of what law professor james kwak calls economism a mix of simplistic economic models convenient assumptions and rhetoric designed to make it appear as if economics provides scientific support for conservative policy priorities there are many examples where wishful thinking appears to have distorted his assessments of economic conditions in 2015 for example he claimed that tax cuts in north carolina had caused a decline in the unemployment rate but as paul krugman quickly pointed out the reduction in unemployment was no greater than in the country as a whole and was in large part driven by workers dropping out of the labour force in 2012 moore claimed that federal workers were paid 50 per cent more than comparable private sector workers because their wages are 2 per cent higher and their benefits are 48 per cent higher this of course is a math error the pay difference is not the sum of the differences in wages and benefits but their weighted average and is thus much smaller than moore argued
president donald trump said friday that he will nominate stephen moore a conservative economic analyst and frequent critic of the federal reserve to fill a vacancy on the fed s seven member board moore a well known and often polarizing figure in washington political circles served as an adviser to trump during the 2016 campaign in that role he helped draft trump s tax cut plan trump has been harshly critical of the fed s rate increases even after the central bank announced this week that it foresees no hikes this year moore formerly chief economist for the conservative heritage foundation has also been critical of the policies of chairman jerome powell a fervent advocate of tax cuts moore is close to larry kudlow head of the white house national economic council the two collaborated in shaping the tax overhaul that trump signed into law at the end of 2017 leading to changes that largely favored tax cuts for corporations and wealthier individuals with the idea of spurring investment and growth moore interviewed friday on bloomberg television after trump s announcement said his criticism of the fed including his suggestion that powell should perhaps be fired were probably written in a time of anger i think everyone would now acknowledge moore added that what they did in december with the rate increase was a very substantial mistake and the fed has thank god reversed that and changed directions asked whether trump might want him on the fed s board to check powell s influence and protect the administration s economic policies moore said the only thing trump told me was pursue policies that are good for the american workers he didn t really mention anything about differing with chairman powell one way or the other moore s nomination which the senate must confirm drew sharp criticism from some economists and historians it s unprecedented in the modern era particularly because he lacks expertise in areas under the fed s supervision like banking and monetary policy said gary richardson a historian of the fed and a professor at the university of california at irvine scott sumner the chair of monetary policy at george mason university s mercatus center said his concern is that moore accused the fed of providing too much aid after the 2008 financial crisis when the economy depended on help from the central bank moore has since urged the fed to be more generous in supporting the economy even though growth has strengthened in the past two years and less help is needed his policies appear to be going the wrong way sumner said given his sharply partisan reputation moore could spark opposition among democrats in the senate but trump can score points with his core supporters and with the majority republicans in the senate by embracing a conservative activist for a fed role that would make him a watchdog over the economy freedomworks is proud to see president trump offer such a prestigious position to one of our own said adam brandon president of that conservative advocacy group i have no doubt that stephen moore would make an excellent member of the federal reserve board trump in his first two years in office has been able to reshape the central bank he nominated four of the current five members and he tapped powell who had been chosen for the fed board by president barack obama to succeed janet yellen as chairman if confirmed by the senate moore would fill one of two vacancies on the board the selection of moore marks a deviation from trump s previous choices for the board toward a more public figure who has long pushed conservative economic and political ideology in a march editorial in the wall street journal moore estimated that fed rate policies had reduced inflation adjusted economic growth by as much as 1 5 percentage points in the past six months moore proposed that the fed set short term rates with an eye toward stabilizing commodity prices rather than solely on overall inflation this approach moore has argued would have prevented the fed from raising rates as much as it has and he contended that this approach if adopted would help accelerate economic growth above 3 percent compared with the longer run average of 1 9 percent that fed officials have forecast moore has often embraced a confrontational tone in his commentary on the fed in a 2012 wall street journal column he suggested that the chairman at the time ben bernanke had kept rates near zero and arranged for the fed to buy bonds in order to help barack obama win re election rather than help the economy recover from the financial crisis and great recession moore had earlier predicted in 2010 that the fed s low rates would ignite inflation and he advised investors to buy gold he pressed his case in 2011 warning on fox news we re starting to see that specter of inflation his warnings of runaway inflation proved off base the average inflation rate would fall from 3 1 percent in 2011 to near zero in 2015 with trump as president moore became a sharp critic of fed policies to shrink its balance sheet and return rates to what the central bank sees as a neutral level neither stimulating nor hindering growth he went so far as to suggest that trump might consider trying to fire powell for the rate hikes under his watch what the law says i believe is trump can replace the federal reserve chairman for cause moore said during a december radio interview and you know i would say well the cause is that he s wrecking our economy moore has frequently praised the administration on television and he co wrote the 2018 book trumponomics his partner on that book was art laffer who pioneered the republican doctrine that lower tax rates would accelerate economic growth in ways that could minimize debt but federal debt has jumped since trump s overhaul to the tax code surging nearly 77 percent through the first four months of fiscal 2019 compared with the previous year

the federal reserve s patient approach to monetary policy is no guarantee that it will leave interest rates where they are for the rest of the year the president of the atlanta federal reserve bank raphael bostic said on friday standing pat is definitely an option but depending on how the economy responds moving rates up or moving them down are both on the table for me bostic said at the close of a monetary policy conference at the san francisco fed the comments were among the first made by a fed policymaker since the us central bank made an unexpectedly dovish shift on wednesday forecasts released at the end of its two day policy meeting showed 11 of the fed s 17 policymakers anticipate no rate increases this year compared with just two who had that forecast in december chairman jerome powell cited low inflation a slowing global economy and risks like us trade tension with china for the need to remain patient for some time he said economic data for now was giving no definite signal for what the fed s next move should be after the wednesday announcement financial markets which had already priced out any chance of a rate hike this year began pricing in the likelihood of a rate cut next year and on friday a key part of the u s treasury market inverted for the first time since 2007 with long term rates falling below short term ones in what is historically a harbinger of recession bostic who spent most of his speech extolling the benefits of the fed s new ample reserves approach to monetary policy took time at the end to deliver a message to markets directly about what he said was an inaccurate reading of the fed s intention the fed s patience he said does not mean it has ruled out any rate rises for the rest of the year and it does not constrain its options i am open to all possibilities as we aim to support sustained economic expansion strong labor market conditions and inflation near the committee s symmetric 2 percent objective bostic said referring to the policy setting federal open market committee markets should understand that so i hope i have made my position clear asked about what level of inflation would prompt a rate increase he said he wasn t focused on an exact point estimate inflation could rise a few decimal points above the fed s 2 percent target and not be a worry he said but if other economic data including from the labor market along with inflation readings suggest that the economy may be overheating then i think that i d be comfortable to move he said in february bostic said he expected the fed would need to raise interest rates once this year after doing so four times in 2018 he did not say how many rate increases he now thinks are appropriate the fed has become increasingly worried about meeting its 2 percent inflation target and skeptical that the trump administration s tax cuts and deregulation will unleash faster economic growth so have financial markets the spread between yields on three month treasury bills and 10 year notes fell below zero for the first time since 2007 after u s manufacturing data fell short of estimates earlier on friday data out of germany showed the factory sector there was continuing to contract another worrying sign for the global economy

backflip mr minack said but if i am interpreting it correctly so it was not simply a panicked reaction to market ructions or political tweets the backflip seems eminently defensible i don t think the

this is clearly a concern given that past yield curve inversions have preceded us recessions but there are several things to allow for amp capital s investment strategist shane oliver said for one thing it does sometimes send off false signals and there is often a considerable lag before a recession sets in so even if it becomes decisively inverted now recession may not arrive till mid next year and historically the share market has peaked three to six months before recessions so it would be too far away for markets to anticipate dr oliver said however friday s falls in us and eurozone shares weak global pmis the risks around flattening or inverted yield curves and ongoing trade risks do highlight the significant risk of a correction in share markets after their deep v rebound from december lows so what matters what is the single most important fundamental variable for global equities right now chinese growth according to the investment bank jp morgan better chinese growth would be an important domino that could catalyse a string of virtuous events including an improved eurozone economic backdrop europe is very sensitive to china the broker told clients over the weekend data out of china has been mildly encouraging of late adjusting for the lunar new year but investors will want to see clearer signs of an upward inflection before declaring the coast is clear the resumption of us china trade talks will be a key event for markets this week reuters damir sagolj while there aren t too many big events on the calendar this week the resumption of trade talks between the us and china is likely to be the most significant jp morgan says a deal is much more likely than not although it will still probably take a couple of months to settle the investment bank s analysis can be broken down into probabilities best case 15 per cent odds the us and china formally unveil a full and final trade agreement by the end of april with credible monitoring and enforcement mechanisms along with large purchase commitments from beijing 1 trillion or more over 5 6 years and expanded market access for american companies all tariffs dropped good case 35 per cent odds the same as best case but while incremental tariffs are taken off the table some tariffs removed and some stay until deal is signed neutral case 25 per cent odds the same as best case but all existing tariffs stay in place with the us promising to remove them gradually over the course of six months pending chinese compliance with the deal sub par case 10 per cent the two sides don t reach a resolution until as late as july or august and all existing tariffs stay in place while additional talks occur bad case 10 per cent odds the us and china prove incapable of reaching a trade agreement by the end of april and us president donald trump moves forward with tariffs on the incremental us250 billion worth of chinese imports worst case 5 per cent odds the us china negotiations collapse in acrimony and mr trump moves forward with tariffs on all chinese imports the second us250 billion tranche at the full 25 per cent rate quiet week data wise it s a bit of snooze this week with all respects to rba assistant governors luci ellis and christopher kent who have speaking engagements planned the only local data of any note is private sector credit on friday it has been slowing for the past year dragged down by investor lending and more recently by owner occupier loans so expect more of the same personal loans have also fallen while business lending has held up the consensus view is another soft month overseas data is probably not worth staying up for either best idea is to give it all a cursory glance the morning after australia date event comment forecast tuesday 26 3 2019 rba

this is clearly a concern given that past yield curve inversions have preceded us recessions but there are several things to allow for amp capital s investment strategist shane oliver said for one thing it does sometimes send off false signals and there is often a considerable lag before a recession sets in so even if it becomes decisively inverted now recession may not arrive till mid next year and historically the share market has peaked three to six months before recessions so it would be too far away for markets to anticipate dr oliver said however friday s falls in us and eurozone shares weak global pmis the risks around flattening or inverted yield curves and ongoing trade risks do highlight the significant risk of a correction in share markets after their deep v rebound from december lows so what matters what is the single most important fundamental variable for global equities right now chinese growth according to the investment bank jp morgan better chinese growth would

the us and china is likely to be the most significant jp morgan says a deal is much more likely than not although it will still probably take a couple of months to settle the investment bank s

mechanisms along with large purchase commitments from beijing 1 trillion or more over 5 6 years and expanded market access for american companies all tariffs dropped good case 35 per cent odds the same as best case but while incremental tariffs are taken off the table some tariffs removed and some stay until deal is signed neutral case 25 per cent odds the same as best case but all existing tariffs stay in place with the us promising to remove them gradually over the course of six months pending chinese compliance with the deal sub par case 10 per cent the two sides don t reach a

the us government has increased pressure against caracas mainly by targeting the oil industry caracas march 15 2019 venezuelanalysis com the us is considering new sanctions that would stop visa mastercard and other financial service companies from processing payments in venezuela according to a white house official quoted by reuters the purpose of these sanctions is to continue to deprive the illegitimate maduro regime of access to funds the official said according to the reuters report the measures would aim to block state owned financial institutions access to the international financial system while exempting everyday venezuelans but no details were offered it is also unclear at the time of writing whether the measure would affect debit cards as well as credit cards with the former being the most common form of payment in venezuela given the cash shortages caused by hyperinflation us sanctions have also seen two shipping companies sever ties with venezuelan state oil company pdvsa us based mcquilling partners and german bernhard schulte shipmanagement bsm which managed 4 and 15 tankers for pdvsa respectively have recently announced they are no longer providing oil shipping services to the venezuelan firm making it harder for caracas to place its crude in global markets the us treasury department imposed a de facto oil embargo against venezuela in late january forbidding us companies from dealing with pdvsa and freezing venezuelan assets in the us chief among them us based pdvsa subsidiary citgo on thursday the treasury s office of foreign assets control ofac extended a license for citgo to maintain its operations for a further 18 months although the company is barred from sending any profits back to venezuela self proclaimed interim president juan guaido has attempted to nominate new executive boards for citgo and pdvsa with legal battles expected in us and international courts after the venezuelan government vowed to protect its assets venezuelan oil production has fallen steeply over the past couple years as a result of underinvestment lack of maintenance and us led financial sanctions opec sources put the february output at 1 million barrels per day bpd down from 1 67 million bpd in february 2018 us officials have explicitly targeted the oil industry responsible for over 90 percent of the country s foreign currency income secondary sanctions against non us companies dealing with venezuelan oil have also been floated and secretary of state mike pompeo disclosed on monday that he had talks with india s foreign minister vijay gokhale to get indian companies to stop buying venezuelan oil caracas has scrambled to find new oil buyers following the us embargo with india the main cash buyer the threat of further sanctions comes as the venezuelan economy shows tentative signs of escaping the hyperinflationary spiral that has gripped the caribbean country since early last year according to the opposition controlled national assembly s financial commission inflation was 53 7 percent in february down from 191 6 percent to in january hyperinflation is defined as a monthly inflation above 50 percent and venezuela has been mired in hyperinflation since november 2017 the venezuelan government unveiled a comprehensive series of economic measures in august including a monetary reconversion a devaluation of the currency exchange rate and pegging the currency to the petro cryptocurrency however the measures failed to deter hyperinflation forcing the government to raise salaries by devaluing the bolivar petro exchange rate the venezuelan central bank changed course in december aggressively devaluing the sovereign bolivar bss with respect to the dollar in the official dicom foreign currency auctions until it overtook the black market exchange rate in late january at around 3 300 bss per dollar the black market rate has hovered around this value ever since economists have credited this policy along with measures meant to restrict the amount of bolivars in circulation for the stabilization or even decrease in some prices but have warned that this comes at the expense of a contracted demand

us special envoy to venezuela elliott abrams has threatened even harsher sanctions against the south american country as washington s efforts to oust the maduro government continue to falter ap the failure of the february 23 humanitarian aid provocation on the venezuelan border was a serious blow for trump s ongoing coup attempt there were mutual recriminations between self appointed guaidó colombian president duque and us vice president pence the us could not get a consensus from its own lima cartel allies in favour of military intervention the coup was losing momentum then on march 7 just days after guaidó s anti climactic return to caracas the country was plunged into a nationwide blackout from which it has not yet fully recovered what caused it how is it related to the regime change attempt and most importantly what are imperialism s plans and how can they be fought february 23 was supposed to be the coup s d day the idea was never to actually deliver humanitarian aid into the country but rather to create a people s power moment where large crowds of opposition supporters on both sides of the border defied the venezuelan armed forces which when faced with a large crowd of peaceful demonstrators would then switch sides and join trump s puppet juan guaidó on the day however things did not go according to washington s plan the crowds of opposition supporters did not materialise in the expected numbers aid trucks did not cross the border and by the end of the day rubio abrams and guaidó were left with egg all over their faces they made a big story about maduro burning the aid trucks at the santander bridge on the colombian border us officials even insisted this justified military intervention under the geneva convention never mind the fact that the convention only applies in cases of war the fact is that the aid truck that was burned was set on fire by a peaceful opposition supporter throwing a molotov cocktail at the venezuelan border guards several media outlets telesur rt explained that this was the case right from the beginning and even produced video footage to prove it that did not stop us officials like marco rubio and john bolton from blaming maduro and the chorus of the world s bourgeois mass media from parroting the lie each of the trucks burned by maduro carried 20 tons of food medicine this is a crime if international law means anything he must pay a high price for this 23fayudahumanitaria marco rubio marcorubio february 23 2019 masked thugs civilians killed by live rounds and the burning of trucks carrying badly needed food and medicine this has been maduro s response to peaceful efforts to help venezuelans countries that still recognize maduro should take note of what they are endorsing pic twitter com klsebd2m5a john bolton ambjohnbolton february 23 2019 now two weeks too late even the new york times has been forced to admit that one claim that appears to be backed up by video footage is that the protesters started the fire the same ny times investigation also concludes that the venezuelan government was right in saying the us and the opposition were lying about the trucks containing medicine the claim about a shipment of medicine too appears to be unsubstantiated according to videos and interviews the admission by the ny times though it is unlikely to be covered as widely as the initial false reports is very significant we knew the us was lying right from the beginning as there was proof now it has been forced to admit it this should provide a salutary lesson for the next time the us or its venezuelan opposition make any outrageous claims about the maduro regime the lesson is question everything washington and the mass media tell you about a government they want to overthrow that evening as if on cue the venezuelan opposition social media operation started to explode with the hashtag intervencionmilitarya militaryinterventionnow aimed at putting pressure on the us and its allies to launch a military intervention in the country the campaign is very revealing as to the character of the opposition pro imperialist and traitors to their own country but also as to the morale of their ranks they do not think they are the agents of change but rather invest all their hopes in trump having been defeated on february 23 the meeting of the lima group of countries in bogotá the following morning was a further setback let us remember that the lima group more accurately known as the lima cartel is an ad hoc group of countries created with the explicit aim of overthrowing the venezuelan government when the us could not get enough votes at the organisation of american states for its bellicose resolutions before the meeting even started there were public statements by chile brazil and paraguay explicitly ruling out military intervention the case of brazil is noteworthy because there is a major split within bolsonaro s cabinet and between him and the armed forces under pressure from the generals and his own vice president general hamilton mourão the far right president has been forced to retreat from several of his public statements specifically support for the transfer of the brazilian embassy to jerusalem and granting the us army access to a military base in brazil when the lima group decided in january to cut off all contact with the venezuelan armed forces the brazilians kept communication lines open the brazilian army went as far as vetoing the presence of us soldiers in the border with venezuela as part of the so called humanitarian aid operation on 23 february contrary to the attitude of the colombian state which turned a blind eye and even helped the opposition rioters on the border with venezuela the brazilians contained them and prevented clashes the reason is not that the brazilian generals are in any way progressive nor that they stand by the principle of sovereignty but rather they understand that any major conflict in venezuela including the possibility of a civil war could have a major impact on brazil with which it shares a large and inhospitable border the last thing the brazilian generals want is accidentally getting sucked into a major armed conflict in venezuela which they know would not be a simple affair faced with such reluctance the bogotá meeting on 25 february ended with a statement that used strong words of condemnation and issued unspecified threats but did not contain any serious commitment to the next steps in the regime change operation the us announced the inclusion of a few more venezuelan officials on their sanctions list including four regional governors hardly the military intervention now that the opposition demanded media reports have talked of recriminations from mike pence who had cut off his trip to south korea to attend the meeting to guaidó according to one report pence told guaidó that everything was failing in the offensive against the chavista regime the biggest complaint was because of the continued loyalty of the armed forces to maduro apparently guaidó had promised the us that if they were to get the main world leaders to recognise him at least half of the high ranking officers would defect it didn t happen the other main criticism was regarding the venezuelan opposition s appraisal that maduro s social base had disintegrated the crisis revealed that support for the government has in fact diminished but is not inexistent of course one should take such reports with a pinch of salt as sources are not quoted however the general frustration of the us with the venezuelan coup is very real and makes this particular report plausible another report in the wall street journal talked of chilean president piñera and colombian president duque also being angry at guaidó at the meeting the opposition had publicly sold the plan by promising that an outpouring of venezuelans on both sides of the border would link up mr maduro s security forces would back down and truckloads of aid would enter for hungry venezuelans i think they built up expectations that weren t carried out said an opposition operative who was familiar with the discussions they built up that there was going to be more aid that it would get in and that the military would rise up and it didn t happen that way the wsj article is quite detailed as time passed kept asking guaidó where are the people who are coming from the other side said the person the responses weren t satisfactory he added everything failed coordination information organization said a senior latin american official the picture painted here is of an angry exchange in which all blamed guaidó when in reality washington is responsible for the whole design of the coup the us officials in charge of the coup were so frustrated that they started a completely ridiculous polemic against the media cnn included which had started to described guaidó as self proclaimed or leader of the opposition as opposed to giving him the title of the interim president a title that washington had worked so hard to create must watch exchange betwee statedeputyspox palladino who complains media calls guaidó self appointed or opposition leader instead of interim president and apdiplowriter who points out only 50 countries out of the un s 190 have recognised him pic twitter com g0iijzpngr jorge martin marxistjorge march 6 2019 the hawks in trump s administration bolton pompeo and abrams made a series of fatal miscalculations first they assumed maduro had no support whatsoever underestimating the strength of anti imperialist feeling in the face of a brazen us coup attempt and the fact that while support for chavismo has diminished it still managed to get over 30 percent of the census to vote for maduro a year ago moreover in the last few weeks there has been a series of impressive anti imperialist mass rallies led by diosdado cabello in all states in the country second they thought that the opposition was able to mobilise large numbers of people who are prepared to go all the way in an open clash with the government in fact the opposition ranks having been betrayed by their own leaders in 2017 and defeated in their previous attempts in 2013 and 2014 are distrustful of the opposition leaders and sceptical about their own ability to remove the government they hate they have put all their illusions and hopes in a us led military intervention and that is a state of mind which can produce a large rally for instance on january 23 but not a sustained mobilisation to overthrow maduro the failure of february 23 furthermore left guaidó abroad in colombia he thought he would come back victorious at the head of a us convoy of humanitarian aid but found himself having violated a court order not to leave the country and stranded in bogotá he started a short tour of latin america on board a colombian plane but soon the us called him to order he discarded a plan to continue his tour in europe and was told in no uncertain terms that he had to return to venezuela as he was losing momentum again abrams bolton and rubio attempted to build up guaidó s return as another d day baiting maduro to arrest him on arrival in order to build a casus belli for foreign intervention it resulted in another flop guaidó returned on march 4 the assembled eu ambassadors received him at the airport and then he went to a rally in the east of caracas but to his disappointment and that of his minders in the us he was not arrested although he should have been arrested there were plenty of reasons to do so blackout then came the blackout starting on thursday march 7 just before 5pm a major power failure affected 18 out of the country s 23 states and the capital district in caracas the metro stopped working and tens of thousands had to walk their way home in the dark after a few hours it became clear that this was a major incident and power would not be restored quickly the government decreed friday a national holiday the country s main electricity generator the simon bolivar hydroelectric plant known as el guri dam had crashed el guri produces about 80 percent of the country s electricity and restoring it is a delicate operation it is now more than four days since the initial incident and power is only slowly being restored in many parts of the country over the weekend on several occasions electricity was returned to different parts of the country only to be switched off again the situation is serious the government decreed another holiday for march 11 and 12 back up electricity generators keep power supply to essential installations like hospitals but there are serious problems with public transport shops do not accept card payments and many have increased prices and resorted to only accepting payment in dollars there are also problems with the water supply telecommunications phone and internet are very intermittent and food stored in fridges and freezers risks being lost etc the government has blamed the blackout on sabotage at el guri and of course washington and the opposition have been quick to reject such idea blaming the power cut on a wildfire affecting the 765kv power line between el guri and the malena substation this would have brought down the power line and then in turn triggered a security stoppage at the el guri hydro plant however the opposition have produced no actual evidence of such a fire and the new york times correspondent anatoly kurmanaev has rejected this hypothesis the government s claim is that there was a cyberattack against the system that controls the el guri turbines and regulates power generation and supply down the 765kv line to malena the government has also declared that when power was restored on saturday march 9 there was another such attack and that these attacks have been carried out by us imperialism for those tempted to dismiss these accusations as a conspiracy theory let us look at the following facts first the us and the mass media blatantly lied about the burning of the aid truck just two weeks ago furthermore what credibility has marco rubio got on march 10 he tweeted there had been an explosion at a german dam when in reality a venezuelan opposition journalist by the name of germán dam had reported an explosion at a power substation in an even more callous twist rubio reported 80 babies having died at a hospital in maracaibo due to the blackout only to be corrected by the chief of the wall street journal south america bureau the hospital had recorded no neonatal deaths none zero ninguna why should we believe anything these people say and another one marcorubio denounces 80 babies have died in a hospital in venezuela due to the blackout to be corrected by the head of the wall street journal latin america no babies died none handsoffvenezuela pic twitter com osevkcrlzb jorge martin marxistjorge march 11 2019 secondly such an attack is possible and has been carried out before even on supervisory control and data acquisition systems that are not online for those interested just look up the us and israeli made stuxnet virus which was used to attack iran s nuclear power programme in 2010 that virus specifically attacked siemens control systems like many of those that run the el guri turbines an article in forbes by a specialist admits in the case of venezuela the idea of a government like the united states remotely interfering with its power grid is actually quite realistic given the u s government s longstanding concern with venezuela s government it is likely that the u s already maintains a deep presence within the country s national infrastructure grid making it relatively straightforward to interfere with grid operations the country s outdated internet and power infrastructure present few formidable challenges to such operations and make it relatively easy to remove any traces of foreign intervention widespread power and connectivity outages like the one venezuela experienced last week are also straight from the modern cyber playbook while the article in the end says a different scenario is highly likely it nevertheless highlights the inability to definitively discount u s or other foreign intervention third there is the matter of timing the coup was stalling guaidó had returned to the country but was clearly losing momentum what better time to implement a major attack on the electricity grid to demonstrate that the government is not in control turn the population against the government and further intensify the propaganda about humanitarian crisis and chaos minutes after the outage was reported rubio bolton and guaidó were already furiously and callously tweeting blame for the government and almost gloating at peoples suffering the blackout has also taken place just days before the arrival of the eu international contact group mission which is to investigate in situ whether there is a humanitarian crisis or not how convenient of course to any explanation of the blackout its severity and its prolonged nature we must add several other factors one is the fact that the venezuelan grid has been starved of investment and maintenance for several years something the left wing of the bolivarian movement has discussed openly the us is quick to point out this as the main cause forgetting that sanctions have prevented the country from re negotiating its foreign debt which has sucked in an increasing amount of the country s foreign reserves we must add that the maduro government has chosen to pay the foreign debt and hand over preferential dollars to the capitalists rather than use these reserves differently this means that sabotage is taking place in a system that has already been weakened and therefore can be more easily damaged another is the fact that thousands of workers have left their jobs in the industry as a result of the economic crisis which has destroyed completely the purchasing power of wages the first to leave were the more experienced and highly skilled precisely those who will be needed most now when it comes to bringing back a very delicate and finely tuned system this process of abandonment was aggravated after the last currency conversion in august 2018 when the government destroyed collective bargaining and wage differentials in the public sector a third is that some of these problems would have been alleviated or perhaps prevented had the workers in the industry maintained the levels of workers control introduced during the chavez government let us not forget that electricity workers at one point were at the forefront of the struggle for workers control which was undone by the bureaucracy finally the more recent us sanctions on pdvsa have prevented venezuela from importing and producing the fuel needed for the thermoelectric plants that should have provided a back up when el guri hydro went down what next for imperialism the situation in venezuela depends greatly on factors that are developing behind the scenes it is impossible to say what is actually happening in the military barracks and in the officers quarters the whole policy of us imperialism is designed to put pressure on them by making the situation in the country unbearable so that the generals perhaps draw the conclusion that their interests might be best served by removing maduro from power this is achieved by sanctions designed to hurt the economy the latest development on this front are the threats issued by bolton and abrams to punish not only us companies trading with pdvsa or the venezuelan government but also financial institutions in third countries the aim is clear to completely strangle the venezuelan economy until it chokes the government into giving up this is a criminal policy that is hurting the poor and workers of venezuela first and foremost completely discrediting the idea that washington is at all concerned about an alleged humanitarian crisis as for the possibility of military intervention it is clear that the us would like latin american countries to front it but there is no appetite in the lima group for military adventures which can prove costly and damaging that leaves the us with very few options the main one being to increase the pressure through sanctions sabotage provocations etc this much was admitted by elliot abrams in a conversation with two russian pranksters when he thought he was talking to the swiss president he said we think it is a mistake tactically to give them endless reassurances that there will never be american military action but i can tell you this is not what we are doing what we are doing is exactly what you see financial pressure economic pressure diplomatic pressure to this we have to add the ideas likely harboured by some in the us administration about the creation of a free venezuelan army and their president getting control of some territory preferably close to the border perhaps in tachira in a repeat of operations used in syria and libya an article in bloomberg has revealed that renegade venezuelan former general cliver alcalá had a group of 200 armed men in colombia ready to cross the border on 23 february but he was stopped by the colombians rubio has also played up the issue of military defectors and guaidó met with a group of them in cúcuta praising them for defecting and warning that we will have to cross back there is also a sense of urgency for the likes of bolton pompeo abrams and rubio they hoped for a quick resolution in this push for regime change back in january but they failed they probably calculate that they need a resolution well before the 2020 election in the us frustration and impatience only make them more dangerous and ready to deploy tricks they have not yet used as we have argued before this ongoing imperialist coup attempt can only be fought back with revolutionary measures striking blows against the coup plotters at home and their puppet masters abroad that means arresting them and putting them on trial expropriating the coup plotting oligarchy as well as the multinationals above all the revolutionary organisation of the people from below needs to be strengthened by arming and developing the militias in every working class neighbourhood introducing workers control in all factories and workplaces and generally unleashing the revolutionary initiative of the masses internationally we need to continue and strengthen the campaign against our own imperialist governments in the us the eu and the lima group countries all of whom are to one degree or another involved in this reactionary plot the views expressed in this

the government stopped reporting inflation rates in late 2018 but anyone who shops regularly knows that it is at least 40 percent and the government is not having much success dealing with the constantly rising prices and shortages of consumer and commercial items the inflation is particularly painful this time of year when springtime and traditional long before islam or christianity showed up nowruz festival of fire celebrations this is a collection of cultural customs many of them over 4 000 years old that have survived as a major holiday the islamic dictatorship tried to ban nowruz mainly because they shared many beliefs with the pre islamic zoroastrian religion of iran recent protests often involved people condemning islam and openly advocating a return to zoroastrianism doing nowruz right means lots of special foods and recipes and this year most iranians cannot afford the food treats because the essential ingredients are either too expensive or simply not available in many parts of the country there are other shortages after a few months of trying even senior officials are criticizing european and russian efforts to help iran cope with the revived american sanctions iran was able to persuade the eu european union to assist iran in getting around the sanctions the americans restored because of iran violating the 2015 treaty that lifted most of the sanctions iran offered eu nations lucrative economic opportunities in return for cooperation in getting around the american sanctions the eu created the spv special purpose vehicle which is basically an eu approved barter system that makes it easy for iran to sell trade with the eu via barter rather than use dollars iran uses a similar system with russia and china there were great hopes for the spv but so far it has been a major disappointment to the many iranians seeking to overthrow the religious dictatorship that has made life miserable for over four decades iranian leaders considered the spv a major victory if only because it reduces cooperation between the united states and the eu spv looked good on paper but in practice it did not work part of the problem was that iran has few friends and when faced with the choice of going along with sanctions or making a little effort to use spv many nations and international businesses preferred to abandon iran rather than take on the american sanction enforcement efforts the europeans say they will keep working on getting spv to work in the meantime the government says it is trying to get some cryptocurrency bitcoin and blockchain working these days that is a sign that you have run out of practical ideas iran has deployed a lot of ingenuity in exporting oil in violation of the sanctions the problem is there are not many new ideas and recycling the old ones stumbles over the fact there are a lot of people who know how to detect and disrupt the classic smuggling techniques the americans are particularly good at that because they have been at it since the 1990s when saddam hussein of iraq was the chief violator articles and technical reports were written about how best to detect the oil smuggling and even though iran has access to that information it is difficult to come up with something unique and effective smuggling efforts have some success but not enough to make a significant difference this could be seen in the continuing decline of iranian oil exports while the smuggling scams reduce the decline in exports it has not been able to halt or reverse it moreover foreign economists agree that the sanctions put the iranian economy into a severe recession in 2018 that is continuing into 2019 iranian gdp is expected to shrink by over three percent in 2019 the government is trying to put all the blame for economic problems on the united states and the american sanctions that bit of rhetoric has been rendered obsolete by the growing popular anger at the corruption and mismanagement of their own government punishing protestors the government has cracked down hard on the continuing protests those identified as leaders or most damaging have been jailed and accused of whatever crimes seemed most appropriate a lot is forbidden in iran because the religious dictatorship is run by senior clerics who can declare anything an enemy of islam and prosecute anyone associated with the newly created criminal act this approach has reduced the public protests somewhat but the popular anger remains and is still there the major complaint of iranians is how their government has mismanaged the economy over the four decades the clerics have been in charge since the clerics took over in 1979 iraq has been perpetually at war first with iraq for nine bloody years and since then with israel america and anyone the clerics felt was a problem including troublesome expatriate iranians for three decades the war against israel and america the two great satans has been largely one sided but increasingly expensive as the iranian defeats piled up it didn t take long for many iranians to figure out that this war against former allies was not really a war but rather an excuse for the clerics to spend a lot of money on an army of islamic terrorists whose main job was to protect the ruling clerics from the iranian people the clerics thought they could control popular dissent by maintaining a militia of religiously minded volunteers could earn some extra cash and other favors by bullying or beating anyone who openly opposed the religious dictatorship these government approved thugs were a common feature of dictatorships nazis and communists both used them by the 1990s the government had organized street gangs composed of young men who are islamic conservatives paid to break up pro reform demonstrations by force and attack any groups that openly oppose the government for whatever reason there has always been the risk that a series of street brawls could escalate and lead to another mass revolution like the one in 1979 so far that has been avoided but more and more of the young men who were prime candidates to join these gangs have changed sides once more there are protests and even attacks on local religious leaders in towns and cities that do not have a lot of religious conservatives or a local islamic conservative militia unit the militia had a name the basj which provided the manpower for pro government street gangs since the 1990s when popular protests against the dictatorship became more common and threatening the basj is actually part of the irgc iranian revolutionary guard corps whose main job is to protect the religious rulers from any internal threat including from the national police or regular armed forces although the basj officially has 11 million members less than ten percent of that number can actually be depended on there are about 700 000 basj who can be activated quickly and used to suppress public protests by force or intimidation about 15 percent of the basj are full time and these leaders are having a more difficult time finding reliable basj members to do the dirty work most basj members joined to protect iran from foreign foes not fellow iranians a lot of basj members are out in the streets protesting and this creates some interesting discussions between protestors and the basj sent to disperse the protest in many areas of iran the local basj can no longer muster much of a street gang sending a few basj the full time leaders to deal with a protest does not work a major cause of the declining basj morale is the government admitting that there has been a lot of corruption yet no clerics and few family members of clerics have been prosecuted and convicted most basj know from personal experience that the ruling clerics and their growing families account for a lot if not most of the corruption the government efforts to blame it all on non clerics has not gained much traction and is apparently having the opposite effect that s largely because the government cannot control the internet embarrassing news about corruption in clerical families gets around often accompanied by pictures and video this is no centralized conspiracy to discredit the religious dictatorship but a popular effort to find out more about who the crooks are as a popular movement these online journalists are impossible to stop there is no leadership or centralized organization directing this growing evidence collecting and publicizing of the corruption the government will not prosecute one response to this has been some dramatic adjustments to government spending the irgc budget for foreign operations especially syria and lebanon have been cut apparently in a big way the iranian mercenary force in syria is undergoing a reorganization and downsizing the irgc explains this away by describing it as a redeployment for the attack on israel the reality is that there is a lot less cash to pursue that goal and the irgc is actually trying to avoid more airstrikes by israel which continues to win this war with iran in lebanon the well established since the 1980s when founded by the irgc hezbollah has done the unthinkable and is asking the public for donations because iranian subsidies have been cut apparently drastically the iran government is spending more money to relieve the economic problems most iranian face but that won t be enough as it has become common knowledge again via the internet that iran has fallen behind the rest of the world economically and in a big way all those expatriate iranians report this in various ways and provide personal testimony with lots of pictures and video life is usually much better for iranians outside of iran while the government prefers to blame the sanctions and the revival of many sanctions by the americans for many of iran s problems most iranians note that life did not improve much within a year of sanctions were lifted in 2015 and the reason was internal that realization triggered growing popular anti government protests that just get worse actually it gets worse than that because neighboring iraq which iran hoped to annex or at least turn into a compliant client state is not cooperating in part because arab shia have always disliked the iranian indo european shia and vice versa iraqi shia get regular reports of how badly iran still after thousands of years treats its arab minority so while the shia dominated government of iraq pretends to be friendly and grateful towards iran it is becoming obvious to iran that this is all for show and not real opinion polls in iraq make it clear that most iraqis are hostile to iran and iranian intentions these suspicious attitudes are on the rise this does not mean the iraqis are above making some cash in somewhat questionable transactions but bending the knee to iran is not on the menu for arabs the scariest thing about iranians is that seem to be better at admitting mistakes and changing their ways that is why iran has been the local superpower for thousands of years history has shown repeatedly that iran is its own worst enemy but also capable of recovering from the most devastating self inflicted damage if iran gets into recovery mode which the ruling clerics want to avoid the local arabs are in big trouble so the arab policy towards iran is to be polite and try to keep them corrupt and ineffective that may not work because a growing number of senior iranian clerics are admitting what the real cause of iranian woes is and it is among the senior religious establishment it is one of those we have met the enemy and it is us moments that are so common in iranian history syria there are a number of complications in syria that have led to a stalemate iran has problems with israel in syria as well as its own allies the iranians want the syrian government controlled by the assad clan to accept iranian domination as hezbollah does in lebanon and agrees with turkey the syrian kurds should not get autonomy and should accept rule by the iran backed syrian government as well as turkish control of border areas iran has a major problem in that no one wants them in syria much less acting as an occupying military force in syria dedicated to starting a war with israel the russians would prefer that the turks and iranians got out of syria and that the assads and kurds worked out a compromise which the two seem willing to do the americans israelis and most other middle eastern nations agree with this approach israel wants iran out of syria and would prefer that the kurds got their autonomy israel is willing to make a peace deal with syria and turkey israel has successfully attacked iranian efforts to build a military infrastructure bases arms factories forces on the israeli border in syria and this has made the iranian leadership angrier and very frustrated iran is seen as even more unstable and unpredictable than turkey russia has taken the lead in brokering agreements that would solve most of these disagreements so far there has been limited success with only israel willing to work with russia israel and russia have been cooperating in syria for years but turkey and iran are determined to have their way despite the opposition they are encountering afghanistan the current effort to negotiate a peace deal with the taliban in afghanistan is not popular with iranians the taliban are seen as inherently anti iranian iran also has issues with the afghan drug gangs who continue to produce with pakistani cooperation all that heroin opium and hashish much of it gets out of afghanistan via iran and that has turned the iran afghan border into an increasingly bloody battle zone march 21 2019 in the southeast sistan baluchistan province on the border of pakistani baluchistan irgc troops were pleased to hear that pakistan had rescued four iranian soldiers who had been taken in october 2018 by iranian sunni baluchi separatists pakistan handed over the four iranians the search is still on for all the iranian rebels responsible and who operate from bases in pakistan and frequently cross the border to carry out attacks in the irgc forces who guard the border during the 2018 incident the separatists took prisoners and got them out of the country pakistan reported that the four were found being held in an area where the borders of iran afghanistan and pakistan met and rescued by pakistani commandos this violence has been going on for decades and never needed any outside assistance to keep going pakistan keeps getting blamed for the continued presence of iranian sunni separatists in pakistani baluchistan pakistan tries but the baluchis live on both sides of the border and iranian and pakistani baluchis want to create an independent baluchistan that includes a chunk of southeast iran where most of the iranian baluchis live one of the usual suspects iranian separatist group jaish al adl is particularly hated by the iranians in late 2018 iran threatened to send troops across the pakistani border to find and destroy iranian jaish al adl camps in pakistan if the pakistani security forces did not take action and neither did the irgc march 20 2019 the government revealed and praised an agreement with turkey that enables joint iranian turkish military operations against turkish and iranian kurdish separatists the most recent operation was against turkish pkk groups operating on both sides of the turkish iranian border an iranian student group has documented and publicized another incident of corruption among senior clerics this one involved stealing real estate in a very expensive tehran neighborhood since the government is officially cracking down on corruption anyone who compiles convincing proof of corruption can put the special anti corruption prosecutors in an embarrassing position this is especially true now as the government has been forced to allow prosecution of senior clerics and their family members for corruption or face even more popular anger there are other side effects to these corruption prosecutions some of the accused will document other misbehavior of the government like support for foreign or iranian islamic terrorist groups as part of their defense march 15 2019 russia apparently supplied iran with the zero click cell phone hacking tech which iranians recently used to hack the phone of an israeli politician it s unclear if this was an authorized transfer of technology to iran or an illegal one both methods are used for iran to get needed items from russia march 14 2019 dozens of iranian uavs were seen in the air near the strait of hormuz iran described it as practice for a mass uav attack on israel using about ten stealthy based on a captured american rq 170s uavs and many more conventional designs iran regularly tests israeli detection and defenses against their uavs by having hezbollah fly one into israel from lebanon or syria iran believes it has detected an israeli vulnerability although those test flights also provided israel with a list of improvements they can make in their ability to deal with these uavs israel is bombing iranian weapons construction and storage facilities in syria and lebanon to prevent such a uav attack from being launched from those two countries which would be more difficult to deal with than one launched from iran which would have to be one way march 13 2019 israeli intelligence released aerial photos showing construction of what israel describes as an iranian weapons factory in western syria outside the port of latakia israel also released aerial photos of a similar missile plant in iran march 12 2019 iran and iraq have agreed to reestablish railroad connections and revive the 1975 treaty that settled long standing disputes over joint use of a waterway that served as part of the iran iraq border march 11 2019 iran awarded the commander of the quds force qassem soleimani the nation s highest award quds is the irgc branch that stirs up and sustains pro iran terrorism overseas quds is largely responsible for terrorism attacks against israel and for the very expensive iranian efforts in syria lebanon yemen iran and many other lesser operations like in venezuela quds recently had its budget cut drastically and the clerical leadership wanted soleimani to know that it wasn t personal march 10 2019 a senior iranian cleric spoke out against the conditions in iran that cause the best educated and most capable iranians to emigrate and not come back because economic and other opportunities are much better in the west some iranian economists have put a price on this calculating that the loss of 150 200 000 iranians a year to migration costs iran over 100 billion a year opinion polls show that about two million iranians want to immigrate the college educated are the most likely to do it because the unemployment rate among the college graduates is about 20 percent march 9 2019 the government is trying to revive its maritime smuggling routes to syria by obtaining port management agreements with syria iran is running into resistance from russia as well as lebanon who fear that this will turn the local coasts into a combat zone as israel and the americans put intensive and heavily armed scrutiny on the area although the assad government will not openly defy iranian requests it has learned how to quietly cooperate with other nations especially russia that will be blunt with iran in opposing iranian proposals seen as too dangerous to work march 2 2019 israeli media is reporting the presence of iranian mercenaries based near the israeli border with most of these iranian forces east of the golan heights portion of the border it is also believed that iran still has hezbollah members pretending to be syrian soldiers operating an iranian observation post along the golan heights border to keep iranian commanders current on what is happening on both sides of the border iran believes many syrian civilians and even syrian soldiers along the golan border are not fans of iran actually israelis have seen examples of this increasingly since 2011 march 1 2019 because of the air battles in kashmir between pakistan and india afghan air transports could not use pakistani air space to reach india for the first time iran allowed afghan transports to reach india via iranian air space to the indian ocean and then east to india this took a lot longer and was more expensive in terms of fuel and other operating expenses via pakistan the flights take 90 minutes via iran the same flights take 300 minutes thus passengers had to pay 300 to fly to india versus the usual rate of 160 the air space closures lasted until late march february 27 2019 iran recently announced it had built a new type of submarine the 660 ton fateh iran claims this sub could remain submerged up to 200 meters 650 feet for up to five weeks apparently using a periscope length snorkel a pipe type device to bring in air and expel diesel engine fumes and fire locally built hoveizeh cruise missiles with a range of 1 300 kilometers and able to reach israel hoveizeh was designed to be fired from a truck but iran implies it has developed a version that can be expelled from a torpedo tube get to the surface and get into the air no evidence of that being tested yet iran has announced plans to build kilo type subs but no such activity has been detected for the last five years iran has been working on the 1 200 ton besat but it is unclear when this sub will be completed the fateh may be an intermediate step in attempting a larger boat like besat that is similar to the kilo february 23 2019 in syria the commander of iranian forces in syria said that 90 percent of iranian goals had been achieved and iran was now concentrating on rebuilding the syrian armed forces not mentioned was any efforts to destroy israel and this was deliberately downplayed in an effort to avoid more israeli airstrikes iran has withdrawn its forces from the israeli border and has greatly reduced weapons shipments to syria the israelis are still watching and apparently still willing and able to launch airstrikes on iranian forces in northern sinai gaza qatar an iranian ally that has provided hamas which runs gaza with over 1 1 billion in aid since 2012 has told hamas that it is halting it 10 million monthly payment to keep the gaza electrical supply system operating over the last year qatar has cut most cash aid to hamas partly this is because it is so difficult to get the cash into gaza but the main reason is that qatar wants the cash to go towards improving the economy and living standards for gaza residents iran backs hamas in preferring to use most aid especially cash to improve military forces and the ability to carry out terror operations in israel and egypt qatar continues to provide cash for gaza but only if qatari officials can supervise the use of that money this restricts the ability of hamas to divert the aid to military projects february 22 2019 commercial satellite photos appear to show that iran attempted and failed to launch another satellite into orbit in late january

venezuela collapse looting hunger blackouts december 17 2018 planet money podcast bonus indicator the measure of a tragedy it s hard to understand how bad a country is doing with figures like inflation rate unemployment rate and their minimum wage a better way to understand a nation s living standards is how many calories a person could afford to buy a day earning a minimum wage if they spent all of their money on food that is the food with the most calories which in venezuela has sometimes been pasta or flour and today is the yucca plant venezuelans could by 57 000 calories in 2012 with one day s wages and several dozen eggs but today a person can afford just 900 calories or 2 eggs it would take a venezuelan 6 weeks to be able to afford one big mac earning minimum wage since the average person needs 2 000 calories a day as well as calories to feed their family and also housing clothing medicine and so on it s not surprising that the average venezuelan lost 24 pounds last year and that venezuela probably has the highest murder rate in the world the result is that at least 10 of venezuelans have emigrated nearly 3 million people if that many proportionally left the u s we d

s oil production is experiencing deteriorating quality raises a new cause for concern for the crumbling south american nation reuters reported that its oil shipments are soiled with high levels of water salt or metals that can cause problems for refineries which has led to 200 million in cancellations of oil contracts making venezuela even less able to make debt payments since oil is the only

people took to the streets in three venezuelan states looting stores to find food maracaibo in the western state of zulia is the epicenter of thefts on tuesday alone venezuelans raided pharmacies shopping malls supermarkets and even trucks with food in seven different areas of the city although at least nine people were arrested and 2 000 security officers were deployed in the state zulia s secretary of government giovanny villalobos asked citizens not to leave their homes there are violent people out there that can harm you he warned in caracas the venezuelan capital citizens reported looting in at least three areas of the city twitter users reported that thefts occurred throughout the night in the industrial zone of la california campo rico and buena vista the same happened in carabobo a state in central venezuela supermarkets employees from valencia told the panam post that besides no longer receiving the same amount of food as before they must deal with angry venezuelans who come to the stores only to find out there s little to buy purchases in supermarkets are rationed through a fingerprint system that does not allow venezuelans to acquire the same regulated food for two weeks due to the country s mangled economy millions must stand in long lines for hours just to purchase basic products which many resell for extra income as the country s minimum wage is far from enough to cover a family s needs on wednesday the venezuelan chamber of food cavidea said in a statement that most companies only have 15 days worth of stocked food according to the union the production of food will continue to dwindle because raw materials as well as local and foreign inputs are depleted in the statement cavidea reported that they are 300 days overdue on payments to suppliers and it s been 200 days since the national government last authorized the purchase of dollars under the foreign currency control system the latest survey of living conditions encovi showed that more than 3 million venezuelans eat only twice a day or less the rampart inflation and low wages make it increasingly more difficult for people to afford food fruits and vegetables have disappeared from shopping lists what you buy is what fills your stomach more 40 percent of the basic groceries is made up of corn flour rice pasta and fat but not even that incomplete diet venezuelans can live on because those food products are hard to come by since their prices are controlled by the government they are scarce and more people demand them the survey also notes the rise of diseases such as gastritis with an increase of 25 percent in 2015 followed by poisoning 24 11 percent parasites 17 86 percent and bacteria 10 71 percent the results of this study are consistent with the testimony of venezuelan women who told the panam post that because everything is so expensive that they prefer to eat twice a day and leave lunch for their children that way they can make do with the

by ann saphir san francisco reuters the federal reserve s patient approach to monetary policy is no guarantee that it will leave interest rates where they are for the rest of the year the president of the atlanta federal reserve bank raphael bostic said on friday standing pat is definitely an option but depending on how the economy responds moving rates up or moving them down are both on the table for me bostic said at the close of a monetary policy conference at the san francisco fed the comments were among the first made by a fed policymaker since the u s central bank made an unexpectedly dovish shift on wednesday forecasts released at the end of its two day policy meeting showed 11 of the fed s 17 policymakers anticipate no rate increases this year compared with just two who had that forecast in december chairman jerome powell cited low inflation a slowing global economy and risks like u s trade tension with china for the need to remain patient for some time he said economic data for now was giving no definite signal for what the fed s next move should be after the wednesday announcement financial markets which had already priced out any chance of a rate hike this year began pricing in the likelihood of a rate cut next year and on friday a key part of the u s treasury market inverted for the first time since 2007 with long term rates falling below short term ones in what is historically a harbinger of recession bostic who spent most of his speech extolling the benefits of the fed s new ample reserves approach to monetary policy took time at the end to deliver a message to markets directly about what he said was an inaccurate reading of the fed s intention the fed s patience he said does not mean it has ruled out any rate rises for the rest of the year and it does not constrain its options i am open to all possibilities as we aim to support sustained economic expansion strong labor market conditions and inflation near the committee s symmetric 2 percent objective bostic said referring to the policy setting federal open market committee markets should understand that so i hope i have made my position clear asked about what level of inflation would prompt a rate increase he said he wasn t focused on an exact point estimate inflation could rise a few decimal points above the fed s 2 percent target and not be a worry he said but if other economic data including from the labor market along with inflation readings suggest that the economy may be overheating then i think that i d be comfortable to move he said in february bostic said he expected the fed would need to raise interest rates once this year after doing so four times in 2018 he did not say how many rate increases he now thinks are appropriate the fed has become increasingly worried about meeting its 2 percent inflation target and skeptical that the trump administration s tax cuts and deregulation will unleash faster economic growth so have financial markets the spread between yields on three month treasury bills and 10 year notes fell below zero for the first time since 2007 after u s manufacturing data fell short of estimates earlier on friday data out of germany showed the factory sector there was continuing to contract another worrying sign for the global economy
kerawalapitiya lng power plant tender imbroglio by c a chandraprema courtesy the island even though the unp opened up the economy in 1977 and eschewed the protectionist closed economic model followed by the preceding sirima bandaranaike government the unp at least when it was under j r jayewardene never took leave of their senses despite their stated ideology of an open economy when common sense or a lack of alternatives required it the old unp was not averse to adopt policies that looked slfpish for example when the pelwatte sugar co was started in the 1980s sugar was produced in a factory with foreign collaboration from sugarcane grown in the moneragala district and the duties on imported sugar were increased slightly so as to make the sugar from pelwatte competitive on the local market after a few years if this writer recalls correctly it was not necessary to maintain the import duty because pelwatte sugar could be sold at the world market price even if pelwatte sugar would always need to be protected with a tariff on imported sugar it still made sense to continue with it the reason why the unp government of the time started that sugar factory was because there was no other means for the people of moneragala to make a proper living ranjan wijeratine was one of the principal backers of the pelwatte project since paddy cultivation could not be carried out in the moneragala district sugar was deemed to be the ideal cash crop for the people living there pelwatte sugar which was started in the 1980s is an example of how people like j r jayewardene and ranjan wijeratne were able to put commonsense before ideology for the benefit of the people and the country of course as one can imagine that was an era when capitalist enterprise was considered to be evil and there were voices raised from the opposition alleging that the people were being made to consume imported sugar at a higher price so that a capitalist enterprise could make money but that is not how people will look at that endeavour now today the prevailing attitude is that if it is a local enterprise or at least a largely local enterprise using local inputs that is ipso facto a good thing irrespective of whether the operation is owned by the government or the private sector it is now respectable to be a local capitalist foreign ownership however is another matter altogether the greater the extent of foreign involvement the less attractive the entity becomes people are questioning the wisdom behind the sale of a part of the ceylon petroleum corporation fuel distribution network to the indian oil company that transaction has enabled the indians to import fuel sell it in sri lanka and repatriate their profits there is no technology transfer or anything that sri lanka gets out of it and the suspicion is that that sale was motivated only by the need for someone to make a killing on bribes the slogan ganna ape de now has traction among the people that slogan in fact is gaining traction even in countries like the usa which was once an ardent advocate of free trade the ideology of free trade taken to its logical conclusion would mean that if a country cannot produce something at less than the world market price of that item then it made sense to import it that kind of an approach is however not conducive to ensuring livelihoods for all people in an economy the only arrangement that makes sense is a mix of free trade with the promotion and protection of certain industries which are of importance to the economy for the food security of the nation and for the livelihoods of the people the question that arises is whether the present procurement guidelines of the government and the attitudes of the people entrusted with implementing it reflect this commonsense approach we see from the current controversy surrounding the award of the tender to construct a 300 mw heavy fuel oil liquid natural gas power plant in kerawalapitiya that sri lanka s procurement appeal s board places local largely government owned companies on an equal footing with largely foreign owned entities that approach will be necessary if the said project is funded by a multilateral donor like the adb or the world bank because those institutions being multilateral lending organizations require open international bidding for their projects however when funding for a project is obtained through the export financing arrangements of certain countries the recipient is required to select a bidder from among a few nominated by the lender when a country does not obtain multilateral or bilateral funding for a project but invites tenders for important infrastructure projects on a build operate own and transfer basis that constitutes a business opportunity in sri lanka since there is an own and operate component in it in addition to the building and transferring one would think that largely locally owned entities should be given priority in awarding such tenders so that the profits do not flow out of sri lanka or that such outflow would be minimized what has happened with regard to the kerawalapitiya lng power project is that a largely local and largely government owned company has been sidelined in favour of a mainly foreign consortium with junior local partners at least it is clear that when it comes to the rival bidder the technical and engineering expertise available will be whatever the foreign partner brings in lng power plant tender proposals for a 300 mw heavy fuel oil liquid natural gas fired power plant at kerawalapitiya were called through public advertisement on 16 november 2016 by the ceb on build operate own and transfer basis eight proposals were received and the bids were opened on 21 april 2017 the technical evaluation committee tec had rejected two bids out of eight on the ground that they have not met the minimum functional specifications and has recommended six bids for financial evaluation including five bids that had not included some of the necessary equipment that was subject to the condition that the five bidders concerned would provide the required installations without any additional cost to the ceb the standing cabinet appointed procurement committee scapc had rejected the conditional recommendation of tec and has directed the tec to open the financial proposal of the only bid which was commercially and technically responsive however when tec opened this bid it was found that there is no hard copy of the signed financial bid only a soft copy had been submitted the bid had then been rejected thereafter the ministry of power and renewable energy had proposed to the cabinet to give all eight bidders equal opportunity to correct the errors and resubmit technical and financial proposals the cabinet on 29 august 2017 had directed scapc to follow the tec recommendation and open the five bids recommended by the tec pursuant to that evaluation on 04 april 2018 scapc had decided to accept the proposal of lakdhanavi ltd which was the lowest bid received as recommended by tec an unsuccessful bidder m s consortium of gcl windforce renewgen appealed to the procurement appeals board pab against the award of the tender to lakdhanavi ltd citing among others the following issues conflict of interest between the project entity ceb and lakdhanavi ltd reliance of lakdhanavi on government concessions financial viability of lakdhanavi bid loss to the ceb an effective major shareholder of lakdlianavi return on investment based on figures quoted by lakdhanavi additional equity investment by lakdhanavi shareholders it will be noticed that the last four matters raised with the procurements appeal board by the appellant m s consortium of gcl windforce renewgen appear to be designed to protect the ceb and lakdhanavi from themselves a rival bidder was arguing that if the tender was awarded to lakdhanavi its shareholders mainly the government would have to invest additional equity to see the project through and that its owning entity the ceb would suffer losses as the return on investment was not sufficient the pab upheld the argument of a conflict of interest between the ceb and lakdhanavi ltd on the following grounds lakdhanavi ltd is a subsidiary of the ceb and the latter includes the former even in its consolidated accounts the connection between the two entities being that the ceb has 63 controlling shares of lanka transformers limited holdings pvt ltd and ltl in turn holds 81 6 shares of lakdhanavi the chairman and general manager of the ceb are ex officio directors of lanka transformers limited and ceb holds the right to appoint another 03 members to the 08 member board three directors of ltl not the ceb representatives represent the director board of lakdhanavi the technical evaluation committee consists of 13 members and nine of them are ceb officers out of the five members of scapc one officer is from the ceb due to this conflict of interest donor agencies such as wb adb and jica do not allow lakdhanavi to participate in ceb tenders during the pre bid meeting several international bidders had complained that the bid is tailor made for lakdanavi ltd as the procurement entity is their parent company one would think that the very fact that the ceb has a subsidiary which is quite capable of carrying out this project should have clinched the deal for lakdhanavi without having to compete with other companies it is quite clear that lakdhanavi has the technical expertise and the engineering know how to do the project on their own whereas the other bidders would be dependent on their foreign partners to do the actual construction and maintenance of the power plant since the ceb owns the majority shares in lakdhanavi why would it have been wrong to simply award the project to lakdhanavi as an internal arrangement this is a prime example of the ideology of free trade taking precedence over commonsense we saw the same thing happening with regard to the sale of government securities when the rajapaksa government was in power the principal way for bonds to be sold was through direct placements with primary dealers at an agreed interest rate to the new rulers who came into power in january 2015 such an arrangement smacked of a command economy and they made auctions the main way in which bonds were sold the result of that was the great bond scam and a doubling of the interest rate which in turn has had a knock on effect throughout the economy and has contributed in no small measure to the slowdown of the economy what that showed was that one cannot run a country without having the commonsense to dispense with ideology when the necessity to do so arises the procurements appeal board based on the representations of the appellant made further observations on the kerawalapitiya lng power plant tender which were designed to protect the ceb and lakdhanavi from themselves as follows the recommended bidder lakdhanavi has submitted the lowest financial bid of us 175 million for the construction of the power plant with the lowest tariff of rs 14 98 per kilo watt hour a project of this nature cannot be completed with us 175mn the bid prices of all other bidders are around us 300 million on an earlier occasion lakdhanavi had put in a bid price for the 300 mw heavy fuel oil combined cycle power plant in kerawalapitiya at us 225 million but had spent us 310 million to complete the project the tec had stated in a report that lakdhanavi has informed their bank that the total project cost is us 330mn including the cost of machinery from germany estimated at us 190mn however they have submitted a bid for us 175mn the bid price is based on the assumption that they are entitled to vat nbt and pal exemptions for machinery scapc has inquired from tec the practicability of building the power plant at the capital cost of us 175 million the tec referring to power plant cost in the asian region including china and stated it varies from us 155mn to us 292mn and therefore the quoted price of us 175mn can be considered practical the pab had stated that it is most surprising to note that tec had not taken into account the usd 330 million cost of the previous power plant constructed by lakdhanavi in kerawalapitiya in deciding whether a 300 mw thermal power plant could be built for usd 175 million furthermore the pab observed that the lakdhanavi tariff has been computed without vat nbt and ports and airports levy assuming exemption from such taxes the other bidders have included these taxes in their estimates scapc tec has requested clarification from lakdhanavi regarding their willingness to bear the cost of vat nbt and pal on import of plant and machinery during the construction period without changing the tariff offered in their financial proposal the pab observed that the mere act of making that inquiry amounts to unfair tender practice in favour of lakdhanavi the pab had accepted the argument of the appellant about the inadequacy of the equity rate of return per annum of around 7 that can be expected on the figures quoted by lakdhanavi with other additional costs such as cost of vat nbt and pal on imports at implementation if there is no increase in the tariff the return may be around 5 with such rate of return on investment that the pab observed that the banks would not be willing to lend money to lakdhanavi for the project the mere fact that the pab made an issue of the tax that had to be paid in relation to an entity that belongs largely to the very government imposing such taxes shows how far we have deviated from commonsense that is a matter that should have been decided between the ceb which owns lakdhanavi and the treasury the pab concluded that without considering any of these issues in the financial proposal tec has given full score of 25 points to lakdhanavi bid which cannot justified the scap and tec had asked lakdhanavi to give confirmation that they will bear the cost of vat and nbt lakdhanavi had given the undertaking that if they are deprived of a vat nbt and pal exemption for importation of machinery and equipment they will consider such payments as an extra cost and absorb it the technical evaluation committee had recommended awarding the tender to lakdhanavi on the strength of this undertaking the pab further noted that lakdanavi ltd was not sure of the funding sources of their project even by the time they came for the appeal hearing representative of lakdanavi ltd had stated that they are negotiating with the national development bank to obtain funds when further details on the loan were requested by the pab representatives of lakdanavi had stated that once they receive the letter of intent they will discuss further details about the project financing that is not surprising because given the profile of lakdhanavi they would have had the confidence of being able to raise that money from the local banking system lakdhanavi ltd and its parent company lanka transformers ltd which are both entities in which the government has a majority stake claim some impressive achievements lakdhanavi as a ceb subsidiary lakdhanavi ltd was set up in 1996 to get into the thermal power generation business as a subsidiary of lanka transformers ltd ltl the ceylon electricity board ceb has 63 of the shares in lanka transformers ltd and ltl in turn owns 81 6 shares of lakdhanavi having started with a 25mw power plant lakdhanavi set up heladhanavi ltd a 100 mw power plant as a joint venture with hemas plc it also built the 300mw combined cycle power plant in kerawalapitiya lakdhanavi has constructed a thermal power plant in the maldives in 2016 and have three thermal projects totaling 215 mw in bangaladesh the parent company of lakdhanavi lanka transformers ltd ltl was started as a joint venture with 70 holding by ceb and 30 by bonar long a scottish company in 1980 to manufacture transformers for the use of the ceb the factory was located in moratuwa with a capacity to produce 700 transformers since then there have been no imports of transformers to sri lanka ltl has supplied more than 40 000 transformers to the ceb from 2003 ltl has been exporting transformers and now exports more transformers than it sells within sri lanka the moratuwa factory now produces more than 4 000 transformers annually in 2015 ltl had acquired a indian switchgear company in india which manufactures components required by power utilities in 1991 ltl set up a galvanizing facility to protect steel structures such as transmission towers used by the ceb from corrosion it now does galvanizing for the construction industry as well in 1996 ltl set up a modern steel fabrication facility in bandaragama in addition to this they have ventured into mini hydropower stations wind power facilities and also got into hydro power projects in nepal ltl also constructs transmission lines and substations and has a specialized subsidiary called ceylex engineering which now does projects in tanzania kenya and ethiopia as well celyex is involved in constructing five power plants totaling 600mw capacity in bangladesh as a contractor the diversification of ltl has been such that in 2017 ltl had only 16 of its revenue from the ceb and the rest would come from overseas or from the private sector in sri lanka or other government entities that use the services of ltl and its many offshoots one would think that any company that gets more than 80 of its revenue from exports and services offered to the private sector can be trusted to know what it can and cannot finance one of the reasons why the pab did not award the tender to lakdhanavi is because they were not sure whether the bank is aware that the bidder has to bear an additional rs 3 billion for payment of vat nbt and pal and an additional rs one billion for the lng compressor which are not included in the tariff the pab observed that a clear financing plan is necessary because there is no time for bidders to look for funding after getting the letter of intent as that will delay the construction that sounds hollow in a country where power projects have been delayed for years and decades for an umpteen number of reasons how many years did it take for any government to screw up enough courage to build the norochcholai and upper kotmale power projects why is the proposed sampur power plant still in abeyance in such circimstances what difference will the passage of a few weeks or months make while lakdhanavi finds a suitable funder from among the local banking community if a company has done consistently well and has a large export market local banks will be falling over one another to give money to such a company the pab held that the tec s behavior is biased or irresponsible because it gave full marks for the lakdhanavi financing plan despite the shortcomings of their financial proposal and that tec has not paid due diligence to the financial viability of the project they therefore recommended that the award to lakdhanavi be reversed and the tender awarded to gcl windforce renewgen at the tariff of rs 15 97 per kilowatt hour the question that arises in all this is if the ceb has a subsidiary that has already carried out a very similar project locally and is doing thermal power plants overseas why was this project not handed over to them as an internal arrangement
