obinna chima wonders if west african countries can ever meet the target of adopting a single currency in the region especially with january 2020 no longer achievable it is almost two decades when the idea of adopting a single currency in west africa was conceived however till date the region is still far from achieving this objective which some analysts have now likened to a journey to nowhere at a meeting organised by the economic community of west african states ecowas ministerial committee of ministers of finance and governors of central banks in the region held in abuja last week the focus once more was on the proposed single currency initiative for the region in 2000 the countries of west africa expressed their desire to speed up the process of monetary integration this then crystallised in a project for the two phased creation of a single currency in west africa under this plan in the first phase a single currency called eco was to be launched by member states of the west african monetary zone wamz in january 2015 this was however launched in june this year eco was expected to boost economic development in the region and improve cross border trade but in the second phase of the agreement wamz was to merge with west african monetary union wamu to create a single currency in all fifteen ecowas member states by january 2020 according to a report by the african development bank afdb for the eco to be implemented ten convergence criteria were set out by the west african monetary institute wami these were divided into four primary and six secondary criteria the four primary criteria to be achieved by each member country are a single digit inflation rate at the end of each year a fiscal deficit of no more than four per cent of the gross domestic product gdp a central bank deficit financing of no more than 10 per cent of the previous year s tax revenue and gross external reserves that can give import cover for a minimum of three months on the other hand the six secondary criteria to be achieved by each member country are prohibition of new domestic default payments and liquidation of existing ones tax revenue should be equal to or greater than 20 percent of the gdp wage bill to tax revenue equal to or less than 35 per cent public investment to tax revenue equal to or greater than 20 per cent a stable real exchange rate and positive real interest rate west africa currently covers 15 countries and eight currencies being used in the region they include the cedi used in ghana dalasi gambia liberian dollar liberia escudo cape verde guinean franc guinea leone sierra leone naira nigeria and cfaf franc used by 8 member countries of the west african monetary union benin burkina faso cote d ivoire guinea bissau mali niger senegal and togo to proponents of the single currency initiative which is to emulate the euro that is currently being used by the eurozone they believe it would offer west african countries the opportunity to pool their monetary resources in order to pursue their common and individual objectives however with few days to the 2020 target it is clear that the objective of adopting a single currency will not materialise in august 2018 wami had raised concerns that no member country of the west african monetary zone wamz including nigeria had met all convergence criteria towards the implementation of a single currency for the sub region situation report nigeria s minister of finance budget and national planning mrs zainab ahmed at the weekend gave a clear picture of where the region currently stands regarding the single currency initiative according to ahmed the 2020 implementation deadline set for the adoption of single currency by ecowas member states is constrained by the continuing macroeconomic vulnerabilities in the respective economies she stated that till date only togo out of the 15 ecowas member countries has been able to fulfil all four convergence criteria required for a smooth transition by the target date nevertheless she said the regional economies were improving despite the global slowdown as they continue to record relative stability in oil production and prices and increasing investment in agriculture ahmed noted that nigeria had nonetheless continued to record progress towards meeting the macroeconomic criteria particular as it regards its debt levels specifically the minister said togo remained the only country that has met the convergence criteria within the last two years a development which makes it difficult to operationalise the proposed currency union which is already christened as eco she further admitted that macroeconomic stability remains uncertain in the region she said there had been a failure by most ecowas countries to implement critical roadmap activities to achieving the target nevertheless she said some significant progress had been recorded by member states in the areas of inflation targeting flexible exchange rate the establishment of the ecowas central bank as well as the adopted eco as the single currency ahmed further enjoined the gathering to be steadfast towards meeting all convergence criteria for a smooth monetary union noting that nigeria currently supported the established of ecowas central bank in no distant future she tasked the meeting to work out a befitting name and location for the institution which is expected to facilitate regional trade among others ahmed also seized the opportunity to reassure the ecowas member countries that the country remained committed to trade liberalisation is the target achievable to the director general west african institute of financial and economic management waifem dr baba musa the issue of having a single currency within the ecowas is a laudable initiative that has to be carefully implemented he pointed out that the idea was to imitate europe which is made up of countries that are much more developed in education transportation infrastructure and other aspects of economic life musa explained we have also seen how they have developed over the years and the issues that are arising so if you are a late starter you are to take advantage of it and avoid the mistakes of those who preceded you the objective of this is to promote the economic prosperity of the 15 ecowas countries the idea is as a nigerian if i want to go to sierra leone or gambia i do not need to take us dollars there if i have an eco i could just collect eco and go and do my business and then come back so rather than taking the foreign exchange rate of the nation to go to another country to do business i would use my local currency to do that so the cost of business is expected to go down if we implement the eco but the truth is that have we met the conditions to bring the currency on board which is the issue we have had what we call the convergence criteria and in 2015 there was an agreement amongst the heads of states that there must be sustained meeting so as to be able to reach the convergence level in terms of convergence what we found was that that a country would meet all the convergence in year one in a year two later they would miss some which has been the trait amongst all of them that shows us some things we need to look at continuing musa pointed out that if countries are missing the convergence criteria what are the reasons in many cases we do not determine the price of commodities that affect revenue and so many other indicators so are we designing policies that respond to those volatilities in many cases you find out that countries are not implementing policies that avoid those types of volatilities which brings us to the issue of continuing fiscal sustainability because most of the targets that are missed relate to the fiscal issues in this case what it tells us is that we need to look inward into our fiscal and make it sustainable so that it would be able to meet these convergence criteria they have announced that by 2020 we would have a single currency the implementation would start but not in a physical form rather it might be a virtual currency pending when all the countries would converge and address the issue on the aspect of politics it is really about educating our politicians to understand the relevance of economics and at least implement policies that would stabilise the economy tahiru azaaviele liedong who is an assistant professor of strategy at the university of bath argued that a single currency could help address west africa s monetary problems such as the lack of independence of central banks and non convertibility of some currencies according to him ultimately a single currency and its associated regional institutions could also boost investor confidence and promote trade within the sub region but sadly africa does not trade with itself overseas trade represents 80 per cent of total trade on the continent trade between african countries accounts for a woeful 15 per cent compared to 40 per cent and 60 per cent between north american and european countries respectively the story is not different for west africa where trade between countries is extremely low in the current circumstances the necessity of a single currency is untenable if trade is the main motivation except the regional commission is hoping west africa will trade more with itself or attract more investors after the launch liedong stated in a publication to the lead economist and director of the african governance and development institute dr simplice asongu ensuring that all members meet the convergence criteria is only the first step toward creating a successful west african currency union he however pointed out that ecowas countries were already beset by insecurity and corruption and they currently have many arbitrary tariff and non tariff barriers in place furthermore the region s supply chain infrastructure remains inadequate and should nigeria join the union could be subject to a significant structural imbalance with africa s largest economy nigeria accounts for 67 per cent of the bloc s total gdp asongu noted according to him complicating matters further was the extent to which outside forces especially france would shape the currency union s trajectory ecowas includes eight francophone countries benin burkina faso côte d ivoire guinea bissau mali niger senegal and togo that have had a single currency the west african cfa franc since the days of french colonial rule in fact it was initially proposed that ecowas s remaining seven countries cape verde the gambia ghana guinea liberia nigeria and sierra leone should first form a monetary union on their own once this new currency union had proved functional and valuable for its members it would be much easier to convince those using the cfa franc to join their west african partners after all the france backed currency which is currently pegged to the euro offers significant advantages including exchange rate stability and lower interest rates members of the west african cfa franc currency union might not want to risk these benefits by joining an unproven currency union with countries that have a history of high interest and inflation rates and france itself has an interest in the cfa franc countries rejection of the eco because they deposit half of their foreign reserves in the french treasury he explained also the brookings institution a washington based non profit public policy organisation noted that this initiative can only become feasible if member states are willing to subordinate national interests to regional interests the washington based non profit organisation wondered if nigeria would ever give up its currency the naira the bottom line here is that even with strong institutions of governance the euro experiment continues to face serious challenges both economic and political at the outset the deutsche mark was seen as a success of hard money orthodoxy a stable currency regime protected from manipulation for political ends embedded in the postwar industrial success of the then west germany it won praise from capitals around europe the euro lessons show that even with robust institutions and strong political commitment sustaining a single currency remains a challenge these challenges are likely to be much more difficult to surmount in west africa where the pre conditions for success including strong political will and robust institutions are evidently absent it added the institution stressed that the proposed currency would clearly not be the panacea for west africa s myriad problems including high levels of unemployment especially among the burgeoning population of youth and the increasing numbers of the poor the lessons from the eurozone highlight continuing challenges among a group of highly developed countries with very strong institutions ecowas will do well to heed these lessons second efforts by member states to strengthen domestic macroeconomic frameworks are important third concerted efforts must be made to reduce the inordinate bureaucratic delays that severely constrain exports and imports at the border launching the single regional currency the eco by january 2020 is at best an expensive distraction that the people of west africa can ill afford at this particular moment it stated from the foregoing achieving the single currency target next year or even in the coming years would be a herculean task and the initiative will not in any way benefit nigeria considering the size and level of sophistication of its economy compared with others in nigeria if nigeria succumbs to this pressure the country may end up using its resources to fund the union what west africa needs to do presently is to focus on significantly improving trade within the region before considering talking about adopting a single currency
for three years jordan one of the middle east s smallest economies has pursued an austerity programme as the resource scarce kingdom faces the twin challenges of dealing with a high debt burden and hosting more than one million refugees now the country which has historically relied of foreign aid and grants to finance its budget has rolled out a stimulus package that pivots to a new growth focused policy that seeks to revive the economy the most difficult reforms are behind us and the promising future lies ahead king abdullah ii said in his opening speech to parliament last month heralding in the government s new approach in response to growth dipping below 2 per cent this year and unemployment reaching 19 2 per cent in the second quarter of 2019 according to the world bank the government has introduced over the last month a multiphase package designed to stimulate industry investment real estate job creation and exports as part of the measures the jordanian government has issued a guarantee that tax incentives and regulations agreed with external investors will be locked for a 10 year period and not be subject to change a welcome relief those who say investment policy has changed abruptly with the carousel of seven governments over the past nine years to bolster industry which accounts for 20 per cent of jordan s gdp the government lowered electricity tariffs for the sector by 0 01 jordanian dinars dh0 05 per kilowatt hour from 0 085 dinars per kw h to 0 075 dinars out of recognition that energy costs now account for 40 per cent of production costs the government also lowered income tax on small and medium enterprises to 17 per cent from 20 per cent in a bid to wean the country off its reliance on an estimated 900 000 guest workers the cabinet also introduced an incentive worth 240 dinars for every foreign worker replaced with a jordanian the growth focused package also turned to real estate a sector which has witnessed a 20 per cent downturn in 2019 by waiving property registration and transfer fees for first time homebuyers and reducing such fees on all transactions by 50 per cent until the end of the year to help consumers the government gave public sector employees their first salary raise in a decade increasing payments to government employees and civil and military retirees by an average of 20 dinars per month the stimulus package has been costly the incentives are expected to add an estimated 300 million dinars to jordan s budget deficit pushing it to 1 2 billion billion dinars for 2020 at a time when amman is attempting to cut public debt it is also negotiating the renewal of a three year credit line from the washington based lender worth 713 million dh2 6bn yet the government is billing the stimulus as an investment to grow the jordanian economy there are already early signs of success after 10 months of downward returns the real estate sector witnessed a 90 per cent year on year increase in transactions in november 2019 analysts have particularly praised the government s assurances to local and international investors some of whom were heading to more attractive environments in nearby turkey and egypt this gives investors confidence that the government won t change the policy suddenly when the government itself changes in two years says zayyan zawaneh economic analyst and former adviser to the governor of the central bank of jordan the imf has agreed with the jordanian government that the priorities for the coming years are to maintain economic stability boost growth create jobs and strengthen social protection as it continues talks for a new three year funding deal citing the kingdom s important progress in maintaining economic and financial stability yet economists and business leaders question whether the stimulus package represents the deep shift in economic policy needed to stimulate growth and bolster government revenue in the medium to long term after seven years of imf policy we did not secure economic growth as expected growth remains at 2 per cent and it is time for the government to realise it is time for a new approach says jawad anani former royal court chief who served as deputy prime minister for economic affairs from 2016 17 the total preoccupation with the budget deficit made the government budget focused to the point where it became growth blind he said amman chamber of industry points out that many of the reductions are a return to the status quo two years ago but may not necessarily be enough to revive certain sectors this is one positive step in the right direction no government has ever introduced a stimulus package before but we need more than a status quo we need to address fuel costs energy and accessing markets says musa saket vice chairman of the amman chamber of industry and an economic analyst the largest obstacle in jordanian economic policy analysts and business leaders agree is its continued reliance on sales tax for the bulk of its revenue currently 65 per cent of all government tax receipts and half of its total revenue comes from sales tax in comparison despite recent increases income tax accounts for 20 per cent of tax revenue and 16 per cent of overall government revenue analysts say the reliance on sales tax has left the government vulnerable to local market volatility the problem is when the market declines or purchasing power declines government revenues decline says mr zawwaneh the economist this is what is happening right now the average jordanian citizen pays 26 per cent of his or her income in taxes according to government statistics released last year but wages have remained largely stagnant over most of the past decade while various developments such as rising energy prices and the influx of over one million syrian refugees has seen prices rise across all sectors we are glad to get a raise yes but it is not commensurate with the cost of living said murad munir a government clerk in amman who saw his salary increase by 20 dinars to 420 dinars a month if the government lowers sales tax or reviews the tax system so those at the top pay more that will be a true relief for us the amman chamber of industry and the jordan chamber of commerce say that by being required to pay sales tax to the government up front each year before a single commercial transaction is made capital and liquidity are tied up preventing small and medium enterprises from expanding the jordan chamber of commerce has also urged the government to amend a system which requires importers and traders to pay not only customs fees based on the value and classification of goods but also a separate fixed 5 per cent customs fee and an additional 6 per cent customs declaration fee on each shipment the commercial sector says it has carried a disproportionate burden of austerity measures the jordan chamber of commerce says that smes in the non industrial and non financial sectors now pay 3 billion dinars each year in sales tax directly to the government 780 million dinars in income tax and 265 million dinars in customs tax mohammed awad once sold turkish made men s and women s clothing under a now defunct free trade agreement between amman and ankara and now imports overstock and irregular apparel sold in bulk from the us uk and europe he says he is struggling to sell imports at cost prices the government has provided a few incentives to foreign investors and large industries but the shopkeeper like me are waiting for our turn says mr awad razzaz has pledged that the government will crack down on tax evasion and will work on tightening loopholes for income tax dodging as well as reviewing the entire tax system in the months ahead we jordanians have been used to economic dark days mr awad says as he gestures to his unlit amman storefront we are waiting and hoping to see the sun
how to trade geopolitical risks talking points the global economy is showing increasing weakness and fragility eroding economic fortitude exposes markets to geopolitical risks examples of political threats in asia latin america and europe see our free guide to learn how to use economic news in your trading strategy analyzing geopolitical risks as 2019 continues to unfold political risks are growing increasingly relevant to watch as their capacity for inducing market wide volatility is significantly expanding globally liberal oriented ideologies that is those favoring free trade and integrated capital markets are being undermined by nationalist and populist movements the result though not always is violent volatility stemming from uncertainty against the backdrop of a slowing global economy and central banks pausing or reversing their rate hike cycles the introduction of additional uncertainty will likely create even more volatility what makes political risk so dangerous and elusive is the limited ability investors have for pricing it in traders may therefore find themselves hot under the collar as the global political landscape continues to unpredictably shift generally speaking markets do not really care about political categorizations but are more concerned with the economic policies embedded in the agenda of whoever holds the reigns of the sovereign policies that stimulate economic growth typically acts as a magnet for investors looking to park capital where it will garner the highest yield these include the implementation of fiscal stimulus plans fortifying property rights allowing for goods and capital to flow freely and dissolving growth sapping regulations if these policies create adequate inflationary pressure it could prompt the central bank to raise interest rates as a response and lead to a stronger exchange rate for the country concerned conversely if you have a government whose underlying ideological predilections go against the gradient of globalization this may cause capital flight regimes that seek to rip out the threads that have sown economic and political integration usually create a moat of uncertainty that investors do not want to traverse themes of ultra nationalism protectionism and populism have frequently shown to have market disrupting effects if a state undergoes an ideological realignment traders will assess the situation to see if it radically alters their risk reward set up if so investors may then reallocate their capital and re formulate their trading strategies that tilt the balance of risk to reward in their favor however in doing so volatility will likely follow as the reformulated trading strategy is reflected in the market wide redistribution of capital across various assets europe eurosceptic populism in italy in italy the 2018 election roiled regional markets and eventually rippled almost throughout the entire financial system the ascendancy of the anti establishment right wing lega nord and ideologically ambivalent 5 star movement was founded on a campaign of populism with a built in rejection of the status quo the uncertainty accompanying this new regime was then promptly priced in and resulted in significantly volatility the risk premium for holding italy s assets rose and was reflected in an over one hundred percent spike in italian 10 year bond yields due to investors demanding a higher return for tolerating what they perceived to be a higher level of risk this was also reflected in the dramatic widening of the spread on credit default swaps on italian sovereign debt due to increased fears that italy could be the next epicenter of another eu debt crisis eurusd eurchf plummeted as mediterranean sovereign bond yields spiked amid fears of another eurozone debt crisis the us dollar japanese yen and swiss franc all gained at the expense of the euro as investors re directed their capital to anti risk assets the euro s suffering is being prolonged by the dispute between rome and brussels over the former s budgetary ambitions the government s fiscal exceptionalism is a feature of their anti establishment nature that in turn introduced greater uncertainty and was then reflected in a weaker euro latin america nationalist populism in brazil while president jair bolsonaro is generally characterized as a fire brand nationalist with populist underpinnings the market reaction to his ascendency was met with open arms by investors his appointment of paulo guedes a university of chicago trained economist with a penchant for privatization and regulatory restructuring boosted sentiment and investor s confidence on brazilian assets ibovespa daily chart since june 2018 the benchmark ibovespa equity index has risen over 46 percent compared with only a little over 9 percent in the s p 500 over the same time period during the election in october the ibovespa rose over 12 percent in one month as polls revealed that bolsonaro was going to triumph over his left wing counterpart fernando haddad ibovespa spiked almost five percent after october 7 vote and polls showed bolsonaro in the lead since bolsonaro s ascension to the presidency the oscillations in equity markets and rate of capital inflow frequently move in tandem with the level of progress on his market disrupting pension reforms investors are anticipating these structural adjustment will be strong enough to pull brazil s economy away from the precipice of a recession and toward a strong growth trajectory unburdened by unsustainable public spending asia hindu nationalism in india the re election of prime minister narendra modi was broadly welcome by markets though lingering concerns were raised about the effect of hindu nationalism on regional stability however modi also has a reputation of being a business friendly politician his election lured investors into diverting a significant amount of capital into indian assets following his ascendancy to the presidency however the optimistic outlook from investors could be undermined if risk appetite sours amid rising tensions in the region in the first breathes of 2019 india pakistan relations drastically escalated amid a skirmish over the disputed kashmir region ever since the 1947 partition the hostility between the two nuclear powers has always remained a regional risk india nifty 50 benchmark equity index s p 500 futures and audjpy fall amid political volatility nationalist campaigns and governments are embedded with political risk because the very nature of such a regime relies on displaying strength and frequently equates compromise with capitulation in times of political volatility and economic fragility the financial impact of a diplomatic breakdown is amplified by the fact that a resolution to a dispute will likely be prolonged due to the inherently stubborn nature of nationalist regimes us president donald trump and modi employ a similar brand of strong rhetoric both on the campaign trail and within their respective administrations in a rather ironic way their ideological similarity may in fact be a force that causes a rift in diplomatic relations tensions between the two have escalated recently with markets worrying that washington may start another trade war in asia only this time it will be with india why political risks matter for trading countless studies have shown that a significant decline in living standards from war or a severe recession increases the propensity for voters to occupy radical positions on the political spectrum as such people are more likely to deviate from market friendly policies such as capital integration and trade liberalization and instead focus on measures that turn away from globalization and are deleteriously inward facing the modern globalized economy is interconnected both politically and economically and therefore any systemic shock has a high probability of echoing out into the

will comply with the recommendations of the 2019 aic code this in most material respects is the same as the frc code save that there is greater flexibility regarding the tenure of office of the chairman outlook in a world where growth looks challenged and sources of yield are increasingly scarce our investment universe stands out frontier markets remain the fastest growing countries in the world as demonstrated by the dividends paid by the company our holdings generate an attractive yield the markets have de rated meaningfully over the last couple of years enabling the managers to find companies with strong earnings growth profiles trading on very attractive valuations as such the board believes that frontier markets remain an attractive proposition for the medium to long term investor the board believes that the company s broadened investable universe provides the investment managers with the flexibility to adjust the portfolio s geographic exposure to take advantage of opportunities across frontier markets annual general meeting the agm of the company will be held at blackrock s offices at 12 throgmorton avenue london ec2n 2dl on tuesday 4 february 2020 at 12 00 noon details of the business of the meeting are set out in the notice of meeting in the annual report the investment managers will make a presentation to shareholders on the company s progress and the outlook for frontier markets my fellow directors and i look forward to meeting shareholders at this year s agm and encourage you to attend audley twiston davies chairman 5 december 2019 investment managers report for the year ended 30 september 2019 portfolio market commentary during the twelve months to 30 september 2019 the company returned 1 5 on a us dollar basis with dividends reinvested versus its benchmark index which was flat and returned 0 0 the msci frontier market index returned 5 9 while the msci emerging markets index returned 2 0 over the same period since inception the company has returned 46 5 compared to 35 8 return of its benchmark index and 29 6 return of the msci frontier market index while msci emerging markets index has lagged returning 11 8 2019 was a somewhat frustrating year for the company as frontier markets went not just broadly but exactly nowhere returning exactly 0 0 over the 12 months to the end of september whilst there were highs greece vietnam and lows argentina malaysia within that the aggregate performance is still disappointing fundamentally investors expect that price performance will follow earnings growth and companies that are able to sustainably grow their earnings should see strong share price performance blackrock proprietary data shows how the earnings of the companies in our portfolio have grown over the past five years and how the overall value of our frontier markets portfolio has developed whilst the earnings have grown consistently at an average rate of around 10 p a this has not been the case for the portfolio s value there has been a substantial de rating of these frontier markets earnings we believe valuations are now at very attractive levels around the cheapest that we have seen since we

strategy review of performance investments in greece proved the benefits of a patient approach during the year after falling nearly 40 during the first quarter of the year our holding in national bank of greece subsequently rose more than 150 to become the largest single stock contributor to performance the positive performance came as the bank showed substantial progress in reducing exposure to defaulted loans we made a particularly timely switch between alpha bank and national bank of greece during the year recognising the substantial differentiation in provision coverage between the two banks which was subsequently reflected in very differentiated share price performance our patience was also repaid in vietnam where holdings in mobile world 32 and fpt 37 both showed very strong performance after an unremarkable 2018 both 9 the company has held both of these names for nearly 5 years mobile world has been a phenomenal success story the company started life retailing mobile phones and has expanded from this into wider consumer electronics and for the last couple of years has entered the supermarket space whilst this remains a daunting challenge the extent of white goods space in a country as underpenetrated as vietnam is enviable fpt a digital technology company offers similar long term growth potential positions in indonesia rose following the re election of joko widodo as president he is expected to continue to follow market friendly policies and continue the reform path initiated during his first administration our position in semen indonesia a building materials manufacturer 23 rose as the company announced a takeover of rival holcim indonesia which is expected to have a substantial beneficial impact on future margins mitra adiperkasa a clothing and speciality retailer 29 rose as the company reported strong same store sales growth and improved margins through the year frontier markets is a volatile universe this means that opportunities are frequently presented to an active manager to trade mis priced stocks the last year was no different in this respect one such example included thai beverage 31 which we were able to buy at very attractive levels in q4 2018 having historically been able to take market share from multinational peers in thailand the company bought a majority stake in sabeco a previously state owned vietnamese brewer with the intention of repeating this strategy however the stock sold off substantially post acquisition on market fears that the company had overpaid for the acquisition as at september 2019 the stock was trading at almost exactly the same price as it had been two years previously in september 2017 airarabia 30 is another very similar example where again the stock was trading at a similar price to two years ago as at the end of september 2019 here the sell off was perhaps more justified as the company had to write off substantial portions of its investment book in connection with the downfall of abraaj group a middle eastern private equity group although raising some questions around management judgement the write off had no impact on company operations which have continued to show very strong growth as the company has taken market share across the middle east the example of argentina reinforces our belief in the importance of diversification our expectation was that mr macri had a good chance to win a second term in the argentine elections if he had been able to we believe that this would have given argentina the best hope of economic normalisation that we have seen in our lifetimes however this view proved icorrect mr macri performed surprisingly poorly in the primary elections which correctly foresaw the outcome of the october elections which were won by alberto fernandez returning the country to peronist rule the argentine market fell more than 50 on the day following this election this was the 2nd largest usd single day fall that any country index anywhere in the world has seen over the last 60 years hence our holdings in energy company ypf 39 and energy utility pampa energia 62 detracted from returns our position in telecommunications company telecom malaysia 26 contributed well to returns as the stock bounced from a very low valuation we have since exited the position overall performance in malaysia was disappointing during the year our holding in british american tobacco malaysia 49 hurt returns following disappointing earnings results which saw higher costs and a larger than expected decline in the legal tobacco market an expected government crackdown on the illegal market has failed to impact on illicit volumes as expected other disappointing stocks in the portfolio included alior bank in poland which fell 43 during the year as the company reported a substantial deterioration in its asset quality we have subsequently exited the position as we believe that the company still has insufficient provisions on its balance sheet portfolio activity in general individual stock turnover in the portfolio has been fairly low during the year as patient long term investors we have maintained positions in conviction positions where we think valuations are fundamentally cheap given the volatility we see across our markets we will add and reduce the size of positions with market moves and we have continued this practice through the year trimming winners and topping up losers we have substantially increased our holdings in the philippines moving from a net short position to a net long position over the year in an increasingly growth challenged world we think that the philippines will continue to grow faster than its peers and that this will be supportive for valuations every country that we invest in carries inherent risks we believe that investing in a diversified portfolio is the best approach to frontier markets we substantially reduced our holdings in argentina post the primary elections in august given our view that in order to roll over the dollar debt outstanding the country will require a level of fiscal adjustment that will be very challenging for the new administration to meet we exited most of our positions in kuwait the market rose substantially following the announcement in june that msci will upgrade kuwait to emerging market status subsequent to the exchange meeting certain conditions by november 2019 we believe that our holdings reached fair value and have exited national bank of kuwait and mobile telecommunications zain outlook whilst expectations for global growth look increasingly challenged frontier markets continue to offer exposure to countries that we believe have high structural growth we note that a lot of stocks in our universe are trading at extremely low valuations whilst offering very attractive dividend yields which we view as a rewarding opportunity for long term patient investors sam vecht and emily fletcher blackrock investment management uk limited 5

losses on the exposed positions the cost of purchasing the securities held through long cfd positions directly in the market would have amounted to us 116 598 000 at the time of purchase and subsequent market movement in prices have resulted in unrealised gains on the long cfd positions of us 2 072 000 resulting in the value of the total market exposure to the underlying securities

investments decreasing to us 16 254 000 at 30 september 2019 if the short positions had been closed on 30 september 2019 this would have resulted in a gain of us 286 000 for the company p notes are

value of the underlying shares to which the portfolio is exposed via the contract 3 the gross market exposure column for cash and cash equivalents has been adjusted to assume the company purchased

material change will be made to the investment policy without the approval of shareholders by ordinary resolution a detailed analysis of the company s portfolio has been provided above investment approach and process portfolio construction is a continuous process with the investment manager analysing constantly the impact of new ideas and information on the portfolio as a whole the approach is flexible varying through market and economic cycles to create a portfolio appropriate to the focused and unconstrained strategy of the company the macroeconomic environment is factored into all portfolio decisions in general macroeconomic analysis is a more dominant factor in investment decision making when the outlook is negative the macro process is comprised of three parts political assessment macroeconomic analysis and appraisal of the valuation of a country s market which can only take place with thorough analysis of stock specific opportunities the investment manager s research team generates ideas from a diverse range of sources these include frequent travel to the markets in which the company invests and regular conversations with contacts that allow the frontiers team to assess the entire eco system around a company namely competitors suppliers financiers customers and regulators the team leverages the internal research network sharing information between blackrock s investment teams using a proprietary research application and database and develops insights from macroeconomic analysis the board believes that blackrock s research platform is a significant competitive advantage both in terms of information specific to emerging and frontier market equities and through its global insights across asset classes access to companies is extremely good given blackrock s market presence which makes it possible to develop a detailed knowledge of a company and its management the research process focuses on cash flow and future earnings growth as the investment team believes that this is ultimately the driver of share prices over time the process is designed with the aim of identifying companies that can translate top line revenue growth to free cash flow and investing in these companies when the analysis suggests that the cash flow stream is undervalued financial models are developed focusing on company financials particularly cash flow statements rather than relying on third party research esg factors can be useful and relevant indicators for investment purposes and can help portfolio managers with their decision making through identifying potentially negative events or corporate behaviour this results in the expectation that there will be an outperformance bias towards better governed companies in the long run the portfolio managers work closely with blackrock s investment stewardship team bis to assess the governance quality of companies and investigate any potential issues risks or opportunities specific to corporate governance the portfolio management team leverages local expertise bis and investors in its proprietary risk based approach financial statement integrity is central to the analysis where bis applies a range of systematic measures to highlight companies accounting ratios in its assessment of balance sheet and earnings quality risks for other categories under the corporate governance umbrella e g audit quality board accountability executive pay and ownership and control bis flags risks based on internal research including regulatory filings announcements and public news feeds governance g data from msci esg research manager and other data sources may also be employed for supporting consideration environmental e and social s factors are primarily assessed using msci data examining whether specific e s exposure exists and if so to determine how well such exposure is being managed further information on the manager s approach to esg and socially responsible investing can be found in the corporate governance report in the annual report the investment managers research team monitors differing levels of risk throughout the process and believes that avoiding major downside events can generate significant outperformance over the long term inputs from blackrock s risk quantitative analysis team rqa are an integral part of the investment process rqa analyse market and portfolio risk

are set out below performance measured against the benchmark at each meeting the board reviews the performance of the portfolio as well as the net asset value and share price for the company and compares this to the return of the company s benchmark the board considers this to be an important key performance indicator and has determined that it should also be used to calculate whether a performance fee is payable to blackrock the company s absolute and relative performance is set out in the performance record table above share rating the directors recognise the importance to investors that the company s share price should not trade at a significant discount or premium to nav accordingly the directors monitor the share rating closely and will consider share repurchases in

ratios to understand the impact on the company s relative performance of the various components such as asset allocation and stock selection the board also reviews the performance of the company against a peer group of frontier market open and closed ended funds principal risks the board has in place a robust process to identify assess and monitor the principal risks of the company including those that they consider would threaten its business model future performance solvency or liquidity a core element of this is the company s risk register which identifies the risks facing the company and assesses the likelihood and potential impact of each risk and the quality of the controls operating to mitigate the risk a residual risk rating is then calculated for each risk based on the outcome of this assessment this approach allows the effect of any mitigating procedures to be reflected in the final assessment the register its method of preparation and the operation of the key controls in blackrock s and other third party service providers systems of internal control are reviewed on a regular basis by the company s audit and management engagement committee in order to gain a more comprehensive understanding of blackrock s and other third party service providers risk management processes and how these apply to the company s business the audit and management engagement committee periodically receives presentations from blackrock s internal audit and risk quantitative analysis teams and reviews service organisation control soc 1 reports from blackrock and the company s custodian and fund accountant the bank of new york mellon international limited the current risk register includes a range of risks spread between performance risk income dividend risk legal regulatory risk counterparty risk operational risk market risk political risk and financial risk the principal risks and uncertainties faced by the company during the year together with the potential effects controls and mitigating factors are set out below principal risk mitigation control investment performance risk the board is responsible for setting the investment policy to fulfil the company

regularly reviews the company s investment mandate and long term strategy has set and regularly reviews the investment guidelines and has put in place appropriate limits on levels of gearing and the use of derivatives receives from the investment manager a regular explanation of stock selection decisions portfolio gearing and any changes in gearing and the rationale for the composition of the investment portfolio receives from the investment manager regular reporting on the portfolio s exposure through derivatives including the extent to which the portfolio is geared in this manner and the value of any short positions monitors the maintenance of an adequate spread of investments in order to minimise the risks associated with particular countries or factors specific to particular sectors based on the diversification requirements inherent in the company s investment policy and regularly reviews detailed performance attribution analyses income dividend risk the amount of dividends and future dividend growth will depend on the company s underlying portfolio in addition any change in the tax treatment of the dividends or interest received by the company including as a result of withholding taxes or exchange controls imposed by jurisdictions in which the company invests may reduce the level of dividends received by shareholders the company does not have a policy of actively seeking income the board monitors this risk through the receipt of detailed income forecasts and considers the level of income at each meeting the company also has a revenue reserve and powers to pay dividends from capital which could potentially be used to support the company s dividend if required legal regulatory risk the company has been approved by hm revenue customs as an investment trust subject to continuing to meet the relevant eligibility conditions and operates as an investment trust in accordance with chapter 4 of part 24 of the corporation tax act 2010 as such the company is exempt from capital gains tax on the profits realised from the sale of its investments any breach of the relevant eligibility conditions could lead to the company losing its investment trust status and being subject to corporation tax on capital gains realised within the company s portfolio in such event the investment returns of the company may be adversely affected any serious breach could result in the company and or the directors being fined or the subject of criminal proceedings or the suspension of the company s shares which would in turn lead to a breach of the corporation tax act 2010 amongst other relevant laws and regulations the company is required to comply with the provisions of the companies act 2006 the alternative investment fund managers directive the market abuse act the uk listing rules and the disclosure guidance transparency rules the investment manager monitors investment movements the level of forecast income and expenditure and the amount of proposed dividends if any to ensure that the provisions of chapter 4 of part 24 of the corporation tax act 2010 are not breached and the results are reported to the board at each meeting following authorisation under the alternative investment fund managers directive aifmd the company and its appointed alternative investment fund manager aifm are subject to the risks that the requirements of this directive are not correctly complied with the board and the aifm also monitor changes in government policy and legislation which may have an impact on the company compliance with the accounting standards applicable to quoted companies and those applicable to investment trusts are also regularly monitored to ensure compliance the company secretary and the company s professional advisers monitor developments in relevant laws and regulations and provide regular reports to the board in respect of the company s compliance counterparty risk the company s investment policy also permits the use of both exchange traded and over the counter derivatives including contracts for difference the potential loss that the company could incur if a counterparty is unable or unwilling to perform on its commitments due diligence is undertaken before contracts are entered into and exposures are diversified across a number of counterparties the board reviews the controls put in place by the investment manager to monitor and to minimise counterparty exposure which include intra day monitoring of exposures to ensure that these are within set limits operational risk in common with most other investment trust companies the company has no employees the company therefore relies upon the services provided by third parties and is dependent on the control systems of blackrock the investment manager and aifm and of the bank of new york mellon international limited the depositary and fund accountant which ensures safe custody of the company s assets and maintains the company s accounting records the company s share register is maintained by the registrar computershare failure by any service provider to carry out its obligations to the company could have a material adverse effect on the company s performance disruption to the accounting payment systems or custody records as a result of a cyber attack or otherwise could impact the monitoring and reporting of the company s financial position the security of the company s assets dealing procedures accounting records and maintenance of regulatory and legal requirements depend on the effective operation of these systems the board reviews the overall performance of the manager investment manager and all other third party service providers and compliance with the investment management agreement on a regular basis the fund accountant s and the manager s internal control processes are regularly tested and monitored throughout the year and are evidenced through their service organisation control soc 1 reports which are subject to review by an independent service assurance auditor the soc 1 reports provide assurance in respect of the effective operation of internal controls the company s assets are subject to a strict liability regime and in the event of a loss of financial assets held in custody the depositary must return assets of an identical type or the corresponding amount unless able to demonstrate that the loss was a result of an event beyond its reasonable control the board considers succession arrangements for key employees of the manager and the investment manager and receives reports on the business continuity arrangements for the company s key service providers the board also receives regular reports from blackrock s internal audit function political risk investments in the frontiers universe may include a higher element of risk compared to more developed markets due to greater political instability political and diplomatic events in the frontiers universe where the company invests for example governmental instability corruption adverse changes in legislation or other diplomatic developments such as the outbreak of war or imposition of sanctions could substantially and adversely affect the economies of such countries or the value of the company s investments in those countries the investment manager mitigates this risk by applying stringent controls over where investments are made and through close monitoring of political risks the investment manager s approach to filtering the investment universe takes account of the political background to regions and is backed up by rigorous stock specific research and risk analysis individually and collectively in constructing the portfolio the management team has a wide network of business and political contacts which provides economic insights with public and private bodies this enables the investment manager to assess potential investments in an informed and disciplined way as well as being able to conduct regular monitoring of investments once made however given the nature of political risk all investments will be exposed to a degree of risk and the investment manager will ensure that the portfolio remains diversified across countries to mitigate the risk financial risk the company s investment activities expose it to a variety of financial risks which include foreign currency risk liquidity risk currency risk and interest rate risk details of these risks are disclosed in note 18 to the financial statements together with a summary of the policies for managing these risks market risk market risk arises from volatility in the prices of the company s investments it represents the potential loss the company might suffer through realising investments in the face of negative market movements the securities markets of the frontiers universe are not as large as the more established securities markets and have substantially less trading volume which may result in a lack of liquidity and higher price volatility there are a limited number of attractive investment opportunities in frontier markets and this may lead to a delay in investment and may affect the price at which such investments may be made and reduce potential investment returns for the company there is also exposure to currency market and political risk due to the location of the operation of the businesses in which the company may invest as a consequence of this and other market factors the company may invest in a concentrated portfolio of shares and this focus may result in higher risk when compared to a portfolio that has spread or diversified investments more broadly corruption also remains a significant issue across the frontiers universe and the effects of corruption could have a material adverse effect on the company s performance accounting auditing and financial reporting standards and practices and disclosure requirements applicable to many companies in developing countries may be less rigorous than in developed markets as a result there may be less information available publicly to investors in these securities and such information as is available is often less reliable the company also gains exposure to the frontiers universe by investing indirectly through promissory notes p notes which presents additional risk to the company as p notes are uncollateralised resulting in the company being subject to full counterparty risk via the p note issuer p notes also present liquidity issues as the company being a captive client of a p note issuer may only be able to realise its investment through the p note issuer and this may have a negative impact on the liquidity of the p notes which does not correlate to the liquidity of the underlying security market risk represents the risks of investment in a particular market country or geographic region therefore this is largely outside of the scope of the board s control however the board carefully considers asset allocation stock selection and levels of gearing on a regular basis and has set investment restrictions and guidelines which are monitored and reported on by the investment manager market risk is also mitigated through portfolio diversification across countries and regions the board monitors the implementation and results of the investment process with the investment manager regularly the investment manager also regularly reports to the board on relative market risks associated with investment in such regions further information is provided under political risk viability statement in accordance with provision c 2 2 of the uk corporate governance code the directors have assessed the prospects of the company over a longer period than the 12 months referred to by the going concern guidelines the board conducted this review for the period up to the agm in 2024 in determining this period the board took into account the company s investment objective to achieve long term capital growth and the fact that on or around the agm in 2021 it will be necessary for the board to formulate and submit to shareholders proposals which may constitute a tender offer and or other method of distribution as was the case in 2016 to provide an opportunity to realise the value of their investment in the company at nav less applicable costs in making this assessment the board has considered the following factors the company s principal risks as set out above the ongoing relevance of the company s investment objective in the current environment and the level of ongoing demand for the company s ordinary shares the board has also considered a number of financial metrics including the level of current and historic ongoing charges incurred by the company the company s borrowings and its ability to meet its liabilities as they fall due the premium or discount to nav the level of income generated by the company future income forecasts and the liquidity of the company s portfolio the company is an investment company with a relatively liquid equity portfolio as at 30 september 2019 92 3 of the equity portfolio was capable of being realised in less than 20 days and largely fixed overheads excluding performance fees which comprise a very small percentage of net assets 1 39 in addition any performance fees are capped at 1 of gross assets in years where the nav per share has fallen or 2 5 of gross assets in years where the nav per share has increased therefore the board has concluded that even in exceptionally stressed operating conditions the company would comfortably be able to meet its ongoing operating costs as they fall due however investment companies may face other challenges such as regulatory changes and the tax treatment of investment trusts or a significant decrease in size due to substantial share buy back activity which may result in the company no longer being of sufficient market capitalisation to represent viable investment propositions or no longer being able to continue in operation the board has also considered the adverse impact of potential changes in law regulation and taxation and the matter of foreign exchange risk they have determined that although there are a number of potential risks associated with the brexit process any transition following any agreement and the legal fiscal and regulatory landscape thereafter they do not believe that this represents a material threat to the company s strategy and business model nor do they believe that the investment manager would be materially impeded in achieving the company s investment objective in addition the level of complexity uncertainty and general lack of information present a number of potential outcomes and scenarios which may or may not prove to be malign or benign and or supportive of the investment manager in achieving the company s investment objective the board has determined that the factors considered are applicable to the period up to the agm in 2024 and beyond based on the results of their analysis the directors have a reasonable expectation that the company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment future prospects the board s main focus is on the achievement of capital growth and the future of the company is dependent upon the success of the investment strategy the outlook for the company is discussed in both the chairman s statement and the investment manager s report in the annual report social community and human rights issues as an investment trust the company has no direct social or community responsibilities however the company believes that it is in shareholders interests to consider environmental social and governance factors and human rights issues when selecting and retaining investments details of the company s policy on socially responsible investment are set out in the annual report modern slavery as an investment vehicle the company does not provide goods or services in the normal course of business and does not have customers accordingly the directors consider that the company is not required to make any slavery or human trafficking statement under the modern slavery act 2015 in any event the board considers the company s supply chain dealing predominantly with professional advisers and service providers in the financial services industry to be low risk in relation to this matter directors gender representation and employees the directors of the company on 30 september 2019 all of whom with the exception of katrina hart who was appointed

financial statements 1 principal activity the principal activity of the company is that of an investment trust company within the meaning of section 1158 of the corporation tax act 2010 the company was incorporated on 15 october 2010 and this is the ninth annual report 2 accounting policies the principal accounting policies adopted by the company are set out below a basis of preparation the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards ifrs as adopted by the european union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the companies act 2006 all of the company s operations are of a continuing nature insofar as the statement of recommended practice sorp for investment trust companies and venture capital trusts issued by the association of investment companies aic in november 2014 and updated in february 2018 is compatible with ifrs the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the guidance set out in the sorp substantially all of the assets of the company consist of securities that are readily realisable and accordingly the directors believe that the company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future consequently the directors have determined that it is appropriate for the financial statements to be prepared on a going concern basis the company s financial statements are presented in us dollars which is the functional currency of the company and the currency of the primary economic environment in which the company operates all values are rounded to the nearest thousand dollars us 000 except where otherwise indicated ifrs standards that have yet to be adopted a number of new standards amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for the annual periods beginning after 1 january 2019 and have not been applied in preparing these financial statements none of these are expected to have a significant effect on the measurement of the amounts recognised in the financial statements of the company ifrs 16 leases effective 1 january 2019 specifies accounting for leases and removes the distinction between operating and finance leases this standard is not applicable to the company as it has no leases ifric 23 uncertainty over income tax treatments seeks to provide clarity on how to account for uncertainty over income tax treatments and specifies that an entity must consider whether it is probable that the relevant tax authority will accept each tax treatment or group of tax treatments that it plans to use in its income tax filing the interpretation also requires companies to reassess the judgements and estimates applied if facts and circumstances change the interpretation is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 january 2019 the interpretation would require the company to recognise uncertain tax positions which are more than probable within its financial statements the interprepation is unlikely to have any impact on the financial statements of the company adoption of new and amended standards and interpretations ifrs 9 financial instruments the classification and measurement requirements of ifrs 9 have been adopted retrospectively as of the date of initial application on 1 october 2018 however the company has chosen to take advantage of the option not to restate comparatives therefore the 2018 comparative figures are presented and measured under ias 39 all financial assets previously held at fair value continue to be measured at fair value and accordingly there has been no impact as a result of the adoption of ifrs 9 all financial assets that were classified as loans and receivables and measured at amortised cost continue to be so and there was no significant impact of expected credit losses on financial assets measured at amortised cost ifrs 15 revenue from contracts with customers the company adopted ifrs 15 as of the date of initial application of 1 october 2018 ifrs 15 replaces ias 18 revenue and establishes a five step model to account for r
overview the important week is off to a slow start while the msci asia pacific benchmark extended its gains for a third session european and us shares are struggling the dow jones stoxx 600 is consolidating its pre weekend 1 rally while us shares are trading heavier after rallying for the last three sessions benchmark 10 year yields rose in asia in response to the firmer us rates after the employment data but european yields and treasuries are around 2 3 bp lower italian and greek benchmark yields are 5 6 bp lower the dollar is mixed it is heavier against sterling yen and euro while the scandis and dollar bloc are softer the quiet turnover appears light among emerging markets the turkish lira and south african rand are nursing losses while the mexican peso is building on its pre weekend gains the jp morgan emerging market currency index is slipping after a three day rally in the second half of last week gold is firm after testing 60 a barrel before the weekend wti for january delivery has slipped back below 59 last week it rallied 7 3 the most since june asia pacific rarely do revised gdp figures capture the market s attention however japan s sharp upward revision to q3 gdp is notable first is the magnitude the 0 1 quarter over quarter gain initially reported was revised to 0 4 that lifted the quarterly annualized pace to 1 8 from 0 2 private consumption was revised higher to 0 5 from 0 4 but business investment doubled from the initial estimate of 0 9 to 1 8 second the surge in activity ironically will make the slowdown in q4 even more pronounced some forecasts call for a 2 7 contraction in q4 the boj meets next week and there is already speculation that it will lower its economic assessment china reported reserves and trade data over the weekend the dollar value of reserves slipped and is understood as more likely an issue of valuation dollar strengthened and bond prices fell than intervention per se the trade data was more interesting exports fell 1 1 year over year and were weaker than median forecasts in the bloomberg and reuters surveys 0 8 and 1 0 respectively still given that china s exports to the us are off 23 china appears to have found other markets for its goods imports rose by 0 3 helped by a 41 surge in soy imports from the us were up 2 7 china s willingness to waive its tariffs on us soy and pork is not a sign of goodwill that many in the media suggest given the shortage and the resulting surge in prices which will again be evident in this week s cpi report a more compelling argument is based on china s domestic needs moreover china moved unilaterally boosting the importation of us foodstuffs prior to an agreement being struck or any quid pro quo separately while one does not need to subscribe to theories of international relations of the inevitable clash between the us and china we have argued the current dynamics are pushing in that direction we see the trade conflict as just the tip of a larger and multi dimensional confrontation china has responded to the us campaign against huawei and other chinese companies and the us penchant for sanctioning chinese businesses by launching a campaign of its own that fits well into its broader import substitution strategy it has announced that state and public businesses have three years to replace foreign computers and software with domestic products the goal is to achieve about one third in 2020 half in 2021 and the remainder in 2022 the dollar is testing last week s low a little below jpy108 45 it met offers in early asia near jpy108 70 and has not managed to re challenge that area in europe options for about 1 16 bln struck in the jpy108 60 jpy1080 70 area that expires today may help cap the greenback there is a 2 5 bln option at jpy109 that expires tomorrow to keep in mind as well below jpy108 45 initial support is seen around jpy108 25 there is a 1 bln option at jpy108 that rolls off tomorrow too the australian dollar is drifting toward last week s low 0 6815 while last week s high near 0 6860 tested several times appears to offer formidable near term resistance the dollar slipped against the chinese yuan in the last three sessions of last week but firmed today it reached about cny7 0435 late in the mainland session before consolidating europe as the uk election draws near the tory lead appears to have widened the latest survation poll puts it ahead of labour by 14 percentage points this expectation that brexit can finally be wrapped up continues to underpin sterling which made a new high for the move today 1 3180 in the european morning on a tory majority many look for sterling to reach around 1 35 our caution is that give sterling s rally and the technical indicators that are getting stretched there is risk of

exports unexpectedly rose by 1 2 most economists had looked for a slight decline following the 1 5 increase in exports in september make its the best two month performance in a couple of years imports which were forecast to decline by 0 1 were flat and follows a revised 1 2 increase in september the initial estimate was 1 3 the euro is in about a 25 tick range above 1 1050 as its pre weekend drop in response to the us jobs data is consolidated the light buying appears to be running out of steam in the european morning and recently it has been trading heavier in the north american session the 20 day moving average is near 1 1045 and a break could spur a test on the 1 10 area sterling s five day advance against the dollar was arrested by the us jobs data and the small decline it recorded

data before the weekend and the market may be particularly sensitive to additional disappointments mexico reports november cpi figures the year over year rate is expected to be little changed around 3 the central bank meets on december 19 a decline in consumer prices may encourage speculation of a rate cut currently only a small chance of a cut is expected meanwhile mexico is push back against washington s demands that american officials are allowed to enter mexico to inspect labor conditions as part of the new demands for the usmca deal this appears to be emerging as a sticking point in the attempt to get democrat support for the new agreement which mexico s congress has already approved another contentious issue is the origination of the steel slab to make autos the us insists the

join the all time highs club mike mcglone bloomberg intelligence what we said then what we say now michael j kosares usa gold review outlook january 2019 headline article will 2019 be the year of the big breakout for gold what we said then in each of the last three years gold has gotten off to a strong start only to fizzle as the year moved along will 2019 be the year gold finally breaks the pattern a good many investors fund managers and analysts think that 2019 might very well be the year when gold breaks the restraints and pushes to higher ground what we say now though we would not characterize 2019 as a breakout year gold has certainly thrown off the restraints as a result it has been a very good year thus far per friday s close 12 6 2019 gold is up almost 13 8 on the year even after accounting for last week s selloff silver is up 13 7 on the year if the current gains hold through the end of december 2019 it will be gold s best year since 2010 chart courtesy st louis federal reserve source ice benchmark administration iba february 2019 headline article the 12 trillion federal debt bombshell who on earth or in global finance will buy this looming mountain of treasuries what we said then the rhinoceros in the room could very well have been how the federal government will go about financing the 12 trillion in debt goldman s beth hammack earlier brought to the treasury secretary s attention and what role the federal reserve intends to play in the process china and japan america s two largest financiers by far have withdrawn from the market and there is no certainty as to when they might return that leaves domestic u s private investors and financial institutions to fill the yawning gap and failing that the federal reserve with a new round of quantitative easing what we say now some call it stealth qe others call it qe lite the fed itself will not admit to a new form of quantitative easing but the numbers speak for themselves since september according to a bianco research study the fed has injected nearly 324 billion into the monetary system in the form of overnight repo liquidity in addition it is injecting another 60 billion per month in outright purchases of treasury paper from commercial banks those purchases are scheduled to continue at least into the second quarter of 2020 fed repo operations are on going with many expecting even greater injections as year end book squaring comes into play as for the national debt it pushed over the 23 trillion mark in november with budget experts warning that we may be entering an extended period of deficits exceeding 1 trillion annually all of which brings us back to the rhinoceros in the room the central bank policies required to deal with it and their potential repercussions in financial markets chart courtesy of bianco research march 2019 headline article gold in the age of high speed electronic trading what we said then because gold does not rely on the performance of another party it is detached from the matrix of interlocking counter party risk and occupies a unique place on the financial balance sheet as an asset of last resort and the final arbiter of value that is why nation states and central banks hold large amounts of it on their own balance sheets and why funds and institutions are more and more moving to it as an offset against other trading strategies investors have always viewed gold as a reliable hedge against inflation and deflation in the years to come they might very well come to know it as an effective hedge against computer generated financial mayhem as well what we say now in an insightful and entertaining piece recently published at the daily reckoning website james ricards writes stock markets are no longer traded by humans with different perspectives stocks are traded by robots and robots are dumb they act automatically based on source code and algorithms developed by coders and applied mathematicians who don t necessarily know much about the psychology of markets robots buy or sell based on headlines or keywords though we have yet to experience market mayhem the result of non human thinking we do not back down from our previous assessment this is a good time says ricards to lighten up on equity exposure and reallocate to bonds cash and gold july 2019 headline article summer doldrums turned upside down gold s june upturn separates 2019 from the pack what we said then gold trading usually gives pundits dealers and investors a break at some point over the summer observes adrian ash at bullionvault but like 2007 2008 2009 2011 and 2016 this year is proving no time to take your eye off the market and if 2019 is going to see an old skool summer lull in gold trading it won t feel much like a discount up at these prices with a range of economic and geopolitical issues preying on investor psychology particularly at the funds and institutions that have fueled the upside this year the summer of 2019

in london from there it traded quietly and unevenly sideways until the 1 30 p m est comex close and it didn t do a thing after that the high and low ticks in gold were reported as 1 485 30 and 1 463 30 in the february contract gold was closed in new york on friday afternoon at 1 459 70 spot down 15 80 on the day net volume was on the heavier side but nearly as heavy as one might expect at 293 000

o clock noon in zurich and then it jumped around a bit until about 12 30 p m in new york and didn t do a thing after that platinum finished the friday session at 894 spot down a dollar on the day palladium traded quietly and unevenly sideways and was back at unchanged by the zurich open it was sold quietly lower from there until around 2 p m cet 8 a m est it rallied a bit from that point before chopping unevenly sideways from about 10 40 a m in new york trading onwards platinum finished the day at 1 860 spot up 5 dollars on the day and at a new record high close the dollar index closed very late on thursday afternoon in new york at 97 41 and opened down about 2 basis points once trading commenced around 7 45 p m est on thursday evening which was 8 45 a m china standard time on their friday morning it traded very quietly sideways from that juncture until it began to tick a bit higher starting at 9 a m in london it blasted higher at 8 30 a m in new york when the job

7000 up 29 basis points from thursday s close i doubt very much if you need me to tell you that this dollar index dow rally and the engineered price declines in silver and gold had anything to do with free markets yesterday here s the dxy chart courtesy of bloomberg click to enlarge and here s the 5 year u s dollar index chart thanks to the good folks over at the stockcharts com internet site the delta between its close 97 66 and the close on the dxy chart above was 4 basis points on friday click to enlarge to enlarge as well the gold shares gapped down a bit over two percent at the open and after a brief rally that lasted until shortly before 11 a m in new york trading they were sold very quietly lower for the remainder of the friday session the hui closed lower by 2 78 percent the silver equities gapped down about three percent at the 9 30 a m open in new york on friday morning and they wandered quietly and unevenly lower until trading ended at 4 00 p m est nick laird s intraday silver sentiment silver 7 index got clubbed by 4 22 percent click to enlarge if necessary and here s nick s 1 year silver sentiment silver 7 index chart updated with friday s doji click to enlarge as well yes it was ugly but you have to remember that for every share sold in a panic there were willing buyers waiting and it s a given that those shares sold now reside in the strongest of hands here are two charts from nick that show what s been happening for the week month and year to date the first one shows the changes in gold silver platinum and palladium for the past trading week in both percent and dollar and cents terms as of their friday closes in new york along with the changes in the hui and the silver 7 index here s the weekly chart and it s not as happy looking as it was before friday s price activity but it should still be noted that the stand out feature here is how well the silver equities are holding up vs the underlying precious metal that goes for the gold shares as well but it s not as prominent click to enlarge there s no month to date chart because it s the same as the weekly chart here s the year to date chart it s still all green across the board of course and the silver equities are now outperforming the gold shares ytd compared to the gains in their respective underlying precious metals this has become the norm over the last month or so but palladium s gain continues to tower above all others click to enlarge da boyz kept their powder dry until friday and the jobs report but how well they did won t be known until next friday s cot report it also remains to be seen if they are able to press their advantage into next week or was yesterday s engineered price decline all there is but the outperformance of the silver equities on a weekly month to date and now year to date basis is the standout feature on both of the above charts so i m still quite content to be all in and overweighted in the silver equities the cme daily delivery report showed that 1 888 gold and 29 silver contracts were posted for delivery within the comex approved depositories on tuesday in gold there were five short issuers in total and three largest starting with jpmorgan with 1 277 contracts out of its client account in distant second and third spots were abn amro with 381 contracts out of its client account with goldman sachs issuing 160 contracts out of its in house proprietary trading account there were 14 long stoppers in total and head and shoulder above all once again was jpmorgan picking up 1 294 contracts for its client account in very distant second place was scotia capital scotiabank with 154 contracts for its own account and in third place was citigroup stopping 134 contracts 112 contracts for its own account plus 22 for its client account in silver there four short issuers and advantage was the biggest with 14 contracts from its client account there were five long stoppers and the largest of them was jpmorgan with 12 contracts for its client account issuers and stoppers report is here the link to yesterday sis so far this month there have been 11 629 gold contracts issued and stopped and that number in silver is 2 794 contracts the cme preliminary report for the friday trading session showed that gold open interest in december declined by 271 contracts leaving 2 275 contracts still open minus the 1 888 mentioned a few paragraphs ago thursday s daily delivery report showed that 845 gold contracts were actually posted for delivery on monday so that means that 845 271 574 more gold contracts just got added to the december delivery month silver o i in december declined by only 1 contract leaving 913 still around minus the 29 silver contracts mentioned a few paragraphs ago thursday s daily delivery report showed that 61 silver contracts were actually posted for delivery on monday so that means that 61 1 60 more silver contracts were added to december there was a withdrawal from gld yesterday as an authorized participant took out 75 348 troy ounces and there was a fairly decent withdrawal from slv as an authorized participant removed 1 868 540 troy ounces ted would suspect that regardless of whether this was a plain vanilla withdrawal or a conversion of shares for physical metal jpmorgan owns this silver now in other gold and silver etfs minus comex and slv gld movements there was a net 36 030 troy ounces of gold withdrawn but in silver there was a net 389 011 troy ounces added there was no sales report from the u s mint month to date the mint has sold 500 troy ounces of gold eagles

the first one shows the amount of gold imported and exported into and out of the u k during the month of september during the month they imported 199 9 tonnes and shipped out 24 3 tonnes this is the third month in a row that imports have exceeded exports by a very wide margin click to enlarge the next two charts shows the countries and tonnages that they received gold from and the second shows the countries and amounts they shipped gold to during september click to enlarge for both the commitment of traders report for positions held at the close of comex trading on tuesday december 3 showed virtually no change in the commercial net short position in silver and an increase in the commercial net short position in gold but nearly as much as ted had feared but having said that friday s price action in both these precious metals makes this cot report plus the companion bank participation report pretty much yesterday s news but i ll go through the motions anyway in silver the commercial net short position increased by an insignificant 426 contracts or 2 13 million troy ounces of paper silver they arrived at that number by reducing their long position by 3 023 contracts and they reduced their short position by 2 597 contracts it s the difference between those two numbers that represents their change for the reporting week under the hood in the disaggregated cot report was somewhat of a surprise as the managed money traders actually reduced their net long position by 3 966 contracts reducing their long position by 2 565 contracts and adding 1 401 short contracts it s the sum of those last two numbers that represent that 3 966 contract change for the reporting week it was the traders in the other two categories as always that made up the difference as both increased their net long positions the other reportables increased their net long position by 1 683 contracts and the nonreportable small traders increased their net long position by 2 709 contracts the sum of those two numbers 4 392 contracts represents their change for the reporting week the difference between that number and what the managed money traders did 4 392 minus 3 966 equals the 426 contract change in the commercial net short position which it must do with the new bank participation report in hand ted pegs jpmorgan s short position in silver somewhere between 10 12 000 contracts the commercial net short position in silver now sits at 371 5 million troy ounces which is certainly bearish on its face but not as wildly bearish as it appears to be in gold here s the 3 year cot chart for silver from nick laird and this week s change is immaterial and barely registers click to enlarge as i pointed out above this cot report for silver is already wildly out of date after friday s engineered price decline on the jobs report so i m mostly providing it for entertainment purposes in gold the commercial net short position increased by a further 17 320 contracts or 1 73 million troy ounces of paper gold they arrived at that number by adding 12 372 long contracts and they also increased their short position by 29 692 contracts it s the difference between those two numbers that represents their change for the reporting week under the hood in the disaggregated cot report it was mostly managed money traders that made up for that change as they added 13 552 long contracts and reduced their already small short position by a further 123 contracts it s the sum of those two numbers 13 675 contracts that makes up their change for the reporting week as is always the case it was the traders in the other reportables and nonreportable small trader categories that made up the difference the former category did most of the heavy lifting as they increased their net long position by 5 396 contracts and the nonreportable small traders reduced their net long position during the reporting week by 1 751 contracts so 13 675 plus 5 396 minus 1 751 equals 17 320 contracts which is the change in the commercial net short position ted puts jpmorgan s short position in gold at around 30 000 contracts up about 5 000 contracts from last week s cot report the commercial net short position in gold is now up to 32 28 million troy ounces which is not a new record high but very close and still an obscene and grotesque amount here s nick s 3 year cot chart for gold and the increase should be noted click to enlarge one would expect that all of this deterioration in gold during the reporting week has disappeared as of the close of comex trading on friday but that leaves the managed money traders still very long both the gold and silver markets and unless the big 7 commercial traders can force these managed money traders to puke up more longs and go massively short the commercial traders are still in a financial hole of some size in the other metals the manged money traders in palladium increased their net long position by by a further 650 comex contracts and are net long the palladium market by 13 961 contracts just under 55 percent of the total open interest total open interest in palladium is 25 563 comex contracts it s a very tiny and illiquid market and as you already know it doesn t take more than a handful of contracts to move the price by a significant amount in platinum the managed money traders decreased their net long position by a tiny 312 contracts the managed money traders are still net long the platinum market by 27 562 comex contracts a bit over 30 percent of the total open interest the other two categories are still mega net long against jpmorgan et al as well in copper the managed money traders increased their net short position in that metal by a further 7 751 comex contracts during the reporting week and are net short copper 45 573 contracts 1 14 billion pounds of the stuff that s a bit over 21 percent of total open interest here s nick laird s days to cover chart updated with the cot data for positions held at the close of comex trading on tuesday it shows the days of world production that it would take to cover the short positions of the big 4 and big 5 through 8 traders in each physically traded commodity on the comex click to enlarge for the current reporting week the big 4 traders are short 144 days of world silver production down 1 day from last week s cot report and the 5 through 8 large traders are short an additional 72 days of world silver production up 1 day from last week s cot report for a total of 216 days that the big 8 are short unchanged from last week this represents seven months of world silver production or about 504 million troy ounces of paper silver held short by the big 8 in the cot report above the commercial net short position in silver was reported by the cme group as 371 million troy ounces as mentioned in the previous paragraph the short position of the big 8 traders is 504 million troy ounces the short position of the big 8 traders is larger than the total commercial net short position by around 504 371 133 million troy ounces the reason for the difference in those numbers as it always is is that ted s raptors the 28 odd small commercial traders other than the big 8 are net long that amount another way of stating this is that if you removed the big 8 commercial traders from that category the remaining traders in the commercial category are net long the comex silver market it s the big 8 against everyone else a situation that has existed for about three decades in both silver and gold as i mentioned in my cot commentary in silver above ted figures that jpmorgan is short around 10 12 000 comex contracts 60 million troy ounces of paper silver using the higher number which works out to around 26 days of world silver production the jpmorgan is short based on the numbers in the paragraph below that puts jpmorgan in the big 4 category once again but probably at the bottom of that list and if they re only short 10 000 comex contracts instead of the 12 000 that i calculated that puts them back in the 5 through 8 category the big 4 traders in silver are short 144 days of world silver production in total that s 36 days of world silver production each on average the four traders in the 5 through 8 category are short around 72 days of world silver production in total which is 18 days of world silver production each on average the big 8 commercial traders are short 49 0 percent of the entire open interest in silver in the comex futures market which is up a tiny bit from the 48 2 percent they were short in last week s report and once whatever market neutral spread trades are subtracted out that percentage would be around the 55 percent mark in gold it s now 40 6 percent of the total comex open interest that the big 8 are short up a bit from the 36 6 percent they were short in last week s report and a bit over 40 percent once the market neutral spread trades are subtracted out in gold the big 4 are short 65 days of world gold production up 2 days from last week s cot report the 5 through 8 are short another 34 days of world production up 1 day from last week s report for a total of 99 days of world gold production held short by the big 8 up 3 days from last week s cot report based on these numbers the big 4 in gold hold about 66 percent of the total short position held by the big 8 about unchanged from last week s report the concentrated short position within a concentrated short position in silver platinum and palladium held by the big 4 commercial traders are about 67 72 and 77 percent respectively of the short positions held by the big 8 the red and green bars on the above chart silver is unchanged from last week s cot report platinum is down 1 percentage point and palladium is up 4 percentage points the december bank participation report data is extracted directly from yesterday s commitment of traders report it shows the number of futures contracts both long and short that are held by all the u s and non u s banks as of tuesday s cut off in all comex traded products for this one day a month we get to see what the world s banks are up to in the precious metals and they re usually up to quite a bit in gold 4 u s banks are net short 100 534 comex contracts in the december s bpr in november s bank participation report these same 4 u s banks were net short 107 948 contracts so there was a bit of a decrease of 7 414 comex contracts from a month ago which isn t much jpmorgan citigroup and hsbc usa would hold the lion s share of this short position but as to who other u s bank might be that is short in this bpr i haven t a clue but it s a given that their short position would not be material ted mentioned on the phone yesterday that jpmorgan is short around 30 000 contracts of the total net short position held by the 4 u s banks as of tuesday s cot report that s 30 percent of the total short interest held by these same banks that makes me suspect that jpmorgan may not be the biggest short holder in comex gold futures that title most likely belongs to citigroup now also in gold 32 non u s banks are net short 104 690 comex gold contracts in the november s bpr 32 non u s banks were net short 94 722 comex contracts so the month over month change shows an increase of 9 968 contracts which just about negates the decrease in the short position of the 4 u s banks at the low back in the august 2018 bpr these same non u s banks held a net short position in gold of only 1 960 contacts however as i always say at this point i suspect that there s at least two large non u s bank in this group one of which would include scotiabank it s certainly possible that it could be the bis in the no 1 spot but regardless of who this second non u s bank is the short positions in gold held by the remaining 30 non u s banks are immaterial as of this bank participation report 36 banks are net short 29 3 percent of the entire open interest in gold in the comex futures market which basically unchanged from the 29 4 percent they were short in the november bpr here s nick s bpr chart for gold going back to 2000 charts 4 and 5 are the key ones here note the blow out in the short positions of the non u s banks when scotiabank s comex short position was outed by the cftc in october of 2012 click to enlarge in silver 4 u s banks are net short 31 818 comex contracts in december s bpr in november s bpr the net short position of these same 4 u s banks was 28 448 contracts so the short position of the u s banks is up 3 370 contracts month over month and most assuredly that increase comes courtesy of jpmorgan which ted pointed out was up to about 10 12 000 contracts held short by them as in gold the three biggest short holders in silver of the four u s banks in total would be jpmorgan citigroup and hsbc usa whoever the remaining u s bank may be their short position like the short position of the smallest u s bank in gold would be immaterial in the grand scheme of things also in silver 21 non u s banks are net short 43 879 comex contracts in the december bpr which is up a bit from the 41 978 contracts that 23 non u s banks were short in the november bpr i would suspect that canada s scotiabank holds a goodly chunk of the short position of these non u s banks i believe that a number of the remaining 21 non u s banks may actually net long the comex futures market in silver but even if they aren t the remaining short positions divided up between these other 19 non u s banks are immaterial and have always been so this is a jpmorgan run operation as short seller of last resort end of story as of december s bank participation report 25 banks are net short 36 8 percent of the entire open interest in the comex futures market in silver up a decent amount from the 31 0 percent that they were net short in the november bpr and much much more than the lion s share of that is held by citigroup hsbc usa jpmorgan scotiabank and maybe one other non u s bank which i suspect may be the bis here s the bpr chart for silver note in chart 4 the blow out in the non u s bank short position in october of 2012 when scotiabank was brought in from the cold also note august 2008 when jpmorgan took over the silver short position of bear stearns the red bars it s very noticeable in chart 4 and really stands out like the proverbial sore thumb it is in chart 5 click to enlarge in platinum 5 u s banks are net short 21 506 comex contracts in the december bank participation report in the november bpr these same banks were net short 22 383 comex contracts so there s been a slight decrease month over month 877 contracts worth also in platinum 21 non u s banks are net short 22 834 comex contracts in the december bpr which is up a bit from the 21 234 comex contracts that 20 non u s banks were net short in the november bpr and as of december s bank participation report 26 banks are net short a grotesque 48 7 percent of platinum s total open interest in the comex futures market which is up a bit from the 47 5 percent they were net short in november s bpr here s the bank participation report chart for platinum click to enlarge in palladium 4 u s banks are net short 6 831 comex contracts in the december bpr which is up a tiny bit from the 6 530 contracts that these same 4 u s banks were net short in the november bpr also in palladium 15 non u s banks are net short 2 179 comex contracts which is up a bit from the 1 899 comex contracts that 14 non u s banks were short in the november bpr but when you divide up the short positions of these 15 non u s banks more or less equally they re completely immaterial especially when compared to the positions held by the 4 u s banks and as you already know palladium is very tiny market and these numbers attest to that as of this bank participation report 19 banks are net short 35 3 percent of the entire comex open interest in palladium up a decent amount from the 30 6 percent of total open interest that 14 banks were net short in november here s the palladium bpr chart and as i point out every month you should note that the u s banks were almost nowhere to be seen in the comex futures market in this precious metal until the middle of 2007 and they became the predominant and controlling factor by the end of q1 of 2013 and are even more so today click to enlarge jpmorgan et al are facing some rather serious and long term headwinds but that fact hasn t prevented them from engineering a price decline of some size on friday so they re iron grip on precious metal prices remains unchanged but as always and because of their massive physical holdings in both silver and gold jpmorgan continues to be in a position to double cross the rest of the short holders in both silver and gold if they so choose and as i said in this space last month whether they will they or they won t remains to be seen i only have a small handful of stories for you today critical reads

november s order book was down 21 from october don ake ftr vice president of commercial vehicles commented the stalling of freight growth is causing fleets to exercise caution in placing orders for 2020 there will still be plenty of freight to haul so we expect fleets will continue to be profitable and to replace older equipment however there won t be a need for much additional equipment on the

enlarge for those hoping that the details might serve up better news they too were disappointed full time employment was down 38 4k and the private sector shed 50 2k the jobless rate also rose sharply up four ticks and also the biggest monthly jump since the recession to 5 9 putting it together bmo s grading system gave this report a 12 1 rating out of 100 which is pretty much as bad as it can possibly get it is in fact the worst rating in about six years of tracking the bmo economist wasn t alone in slamming the report it s a terrible jobs report said wells fargo strategist brendan mckenna there s really not much you can point to that is positive about those numbers we ll probably hover around these levels til year end hours worked fell 0 3 and remain an area of persistent disappointment they re now up just 0 25 y y much more muted than the 1 6 annual job gain oddly enough the one area of strength was wages with growth accelerating to match a cycle high at 4 5 y y

bubbles expand the greater the underlying fragilities ensuring timid central bankers unwilling to risk reining in excess this was the problem in the late twenties and in 2006 2007 i would argue this has been a fundamental dilemma for central bankers persistently now for going on a decade especially after the bernanke fed targeted risk assets as the key reflationary mechanism central banks have been loath to do anything that might risk upsetting the markets remember the 2011 exit strategy promptly scrapped in favor of another doubling of the fed s balance sheet to 4 5 tn by 2014 from my analytical perspective things have followed the worst case scenario now for over three decades alan greenspan s assurances and loose monetary policy after the 1987 crash spurred decade of greed excesses that culminated with bubbles in junk bonds m a and coastal real estate the response to severe early nineties bank impairment and recession was aggressive monetary stimulus and the active promotion of wall street finance gses mbs abs derivatives hedge funds proprietary trading etc once the boom in highly speculative market based credit took hold there was no turning back the 1994 bond bust ensured the fed was done with the type of rate increases that might actually impinge speculation and tighten financial conditions the mexican bailout guaranteed fledgling bubbles would run wild in southeast asia and elsewhere the ltcm russia market bailout ensured bubble dynamics turned absolutely crazy in technology stocks and u s corporate credit things took a turn for the worse following the tech bubble collapse with wall street cheering on the federal reserve fatefully targeted mortgage credit as the key mechanism for system reflation a doubling of mortgage debt in just over six years was one of history s more reckless monetary inflations the panicked response to the collapsing mortgage finance bubble fomented by far the greatest monetary inflation the world has ever experienced china em japan treasury debt central bank credit speculative leverage everywhere the global government finance bubble saw egregious excess break out at the foundation of finance central bank credit and sovereign debt it was a slippery slope no turning back the sordid history of inflationism has been replayed once monetary inflation commences it becomes virtually impossible to stop yet the possibility of a trade agreement economic expansion and some inflationary pressures could prove problematic rising bond yields would put pressure on highly leveraged and vulnerable markets in all the discussion of repo market issues and challenges the key point is somehow missed accommodating and promoting a market that finances speculative leveraging virtually guarantees problematic bubbles how could this lesson not have been learned in 2008 now it s a global bubble with all the issues of financial fragility economic maladjustment and wealth redistribution on an unprecedented scale very worthwhile weekly commentary appeared on his website very early on saturday morning est and another link to it is doug sweekly commentary appeared on his website very early on saturday

citing fear driven demand for the precious metal gold cannot fully replace government bonds in a portfolio but the case to reallocate a portion of normal bond exposure to gold is as strong as ever goldman analysts including sabine schels said in a note friday we still see upside in gold as late cycle concerns and heightened political uncertainty will likely support investment demand for bullion as a defensive asset the precious metal climbed to a six year high in september as the federal reserve cut borrowing costs and the total pile of debt yielding less than zero climbed to a record 17

blast from the past is one i ve posted before but it s been awhile and is hands down the most recognized of all organ works it s johann sebastian bach s toccata fugue in d minor bwv 565 which was composed in the very early 1700s there are a lot of videos on the internet to choose from but this one is my favourite with netherland s wonder kid gert van hoef doing the honours here it s an ancient organ with only two manuals and with organs such as these he has two people pulling stops as well as turning pages this is where the expression pulling all the stops comes from and they re pretty much all out by the end of the performance the link is friday s price activity although disappointing wasn t all that surprising as the big 8 commercial traders with or without jpmorgan s participation pulled their bids on the job numbers and the manged money traders responded as they normally do however that won t be know for sure until next week s cot report but even if jpmorgan wasn t involved in that price decline it s a given that they were buying longs and covering shorts like the bandits they are and as i mentioned at the end of my bank participation report discussion they re in a position to pull ted s double cross of the remaining big 7 commercial traders any time they wish despite that engineered price decline the volume in gold wasn t all that heavy but it was way up there in silver so it certainly appears that da boyz were more successful in their attempts in silver than in gold it remains to be seen if they re going to push their advantage in the days ahead or was that it here are the 6 month charts for the four precious metals plus copper and wtic the pounding that silver and gold took should be noted and also the fact that both platinum and palladium were left untouched on friday during the comex trading session copper was closed back above its 200 day moving average for the first time in a long while and wtic had its fifth up day in a row and is back above its 200 day moving average as well click to enlarge like all the other statistics coming out of the u s government those job numbers yesterday were massaged to perfection and as zero hedge correctly mentions in a story in the critical reads section a lot of those permanent jobs added in november were the gm employees going back to work after the strike and as bill bonner pointed out in an article headlined america s hidden depression rings even more true today than when the article was first posted what we see is claptrap the dots don t connect in a labor pool with barely any increase in average wages if some wages are going up other wages must be going down and in a country where growth is concentrated in a few urban suburban conglomerates washington d c new york san francisco etc there must be a lot of places where people are not drinking cappuccinos sending their children to private schools or listening to npr in the bottom half of the u s population 117 million adults earn an average annual wage of 16 000 a year these people are worse off than they were at the end of the last century and probably worse off than they were when the fake money era began in 1971 but we ll let you draw your own conclusion fox news had a few things to say about how the influence and corruption of wall street hedge funds has slowly crept into rural america now that they ve raped and pillaged everything else the banner headline on the screen reads paul singer the world s most feared investor the youtube com video is datelined tuesday december 3 and the link is then tucker carlson ofhad a few things to say about how the influence and corruption of wall street hedge funds has slowly crept into rural america now that they ve raped and pillaged everything else the banner headline on the screen reads thevideo is datelined tuesday december 3 and the link is here couple the above with the fact that wall street the new york banking syndicate along with the federal reserve have removed all price discovery from any markets that matter things will continue along until the whole thing collapses in a heap and collapse it will the average person in the street thinks everything is ok because the government is telling them so and the major u s stock indices are hitting new all time highs just about every week jobs are plentiful and interest rates are low so what s the worry but a lot of them figured out some time ago that things weren t right in this world even though they couldn t quite put their finger on it and the election of donald trump was the end result of that the problem is that this massive intervention in all market either by willful act or jawboning is all bread and circuses for john q public as it was for the citizens of rome as the republic fell into ruin behind that propaganda is an economic financial and monetary system that floated off the rails long ago and is only kept going by massive money printing debt issuance not even negative interest rates will save the u s now it has been tried in europe and japan and look where that s got them as i along with many others now have been pointing out for a long while and only became crystal clear in september when the fed announced their temporary repo scheme this is a trap from which there is no escape none whatsoever it has become print or die which has immediately morphed into print and die of course the die was cast the moment that nixon took the world off of what was left of the bretton woods based gold standard back in august of 1971 and we ve been slowly circling the drain since but with the fed announcement in september it became abundantly clear to a lot of people that the u s financial system had crossed the black hole equivalent of an event horizon and the fate of the u s along with the rest of the world was sealed not that it wasn t before mind you but the events of september was proof positive that the time between now and the end of all things is accelerating at warp speed we re only one black swan or false flag away from total collapse it will be too big even for the world s banks to fix and they may have no desire to do so as i keep saying the end will come by either circumstance or design or a combination of both since the system cannot be saved the imf and other key world central banks may precipitate the end themselves and at a time of their choosing besides the ultimate economic financial and monetary chaos that will follow this event what will most certainly return at some point will be a gold backed currency of some sort as we have noticed at an ever increasing rate over the last few years many countries as quietly as they can have been buying gold or repatriating gold they already own as fast as they can without alarming their citizenry and i also suspect that this price management scheme in the precious metals will end in a similar fashion when jpmorgan desires it or even more likely when they re requested to step aside that will come concurrently with the end of all things and may even be the event that precipitates it at that point as i and many others have stated in the past he who has the gold makes the rules that will certainly include jpmorgan and judging by the amount money going into the precious metal equities depositories etfs and mutual funds over the last fifteen years or so us as well i m still all in and i

slightly in november according to a new york fed survey the median outlook for what inflation will be over the next three years rose by 0 1 percentage point to 2 5 the survey found expectations for inflation over the next 12 months rose slightly by 0 02 percentage point to 2 4 in october both inflation outlooks were at a series low for the survey which began in 2013 capital economics is bullish on both the c and norway s krone a key reason why higher oil prices have not led the loonie and the krone to strengthen is that the monetary policy stance in both canada and norway is already relatively hawkish despite easing by the fed and the ecb the bank of canada has kept policy on hold and norges bank actually hiked three times before pausing in september neither has signalled an intention to ease policy but given the fragile global economy there is also little chance that either will hike rates soon so there has been limited scope for higher oil prices to translate into higher interest rate differentials similar to what happened in 2013 14 when the oil price correlation turned negative looking ahead though we forecast that the price of brent oil will rise further to us70 barrel by the end of 2020 from us64 now and we think that the boc and the nb will continue to keep rates on hold even as the ecb and other central banks ease policy this suggests to us that the

2019 getty images a homeless man sleeping under posters of newly elected president alberto fernández and his running mate vice president cristina fernández de kirchner buenos aires october 28 2019 buenos aires there is an old argentine wisecrack that says a person who leaves argentina for six months and then returns finds the country completely transformed but someone who returns after an absence of ten years finds that things are more or less as he or she left them it is a joke but one whose accuracy would seem to be borne out by the results of the october 27 general election that repudiated the neoliberal government of mauricio macri and his cambiemos let s change party that had been in power since 2015 and instead made alberto fernández president and former president cristina fernández de kirchner the new vice president thus restored to power were the peronists who have ruled argentina for nearly twenty three out of the thirty six years since the restoration of democracy in 1983 the outcome seemed to confirm then what remains the conventional wisdom for a large part of the argentine population peronist and anti peronist alike that peronism is argentina s natural party of government this conviction helps explain why macri s election in 2015 was seen as a political earthquake here was a neoliberal albeit one of the softer type elected in profoundly corporatist argentina but the same belief also accounts for why macri s repudiation by voters now seems a reversion to the political norm in argentina and consigns macri to being the exception that proved the rule since he has become the only sitting president in modern argentine history to have stood for re election and lost such meta political considerations aside there were sound practical reasons for argentine voters to return the peronists to power macri had promised much from the curbing of inflation to a business friendly modern economy and financial system freed from the shackles of the currency controls imposed by de kirchner usually known as cristina argentine politicians increasingly go by their first names in fact but not macri which is testimony in itself macri had also vowed to the rampant corruption that first néstor kirchner who had preceded cristina as president of argentina and died in 2010 and then cristina herself and her cronies had indulged in to an extent outrageous even by argentine standards as the former peronist politician turned political commentator and novelist jorge asís put it to me recently compared to cristina carlos menem a notoriously corrupt peronist president of the 1990s had been little more than a pickpocket on the subway most daringly of all macri ran in 2015 on a platform to reduce poverty to zero as president he never repeated that promise but macri did encourage the argentine people to judge him on whether or not he had successfully reduced economic hardship and they did in short although there have doubtless been worse governments in argentine history not to mention the six times in the twentieth century the military has seized power none has failed to live up to its promises quite so spectacularly and ineptly as macri s all politicians are narcissists granted but mauricio macri was an incompetent narcissist headstrong unwilling to take advice from all but a small circle of sycophants and given to mistaking his wishes for reality corrupt as cristina is even her enemies acknowledge that she s highly intelligent whereas even many of his supporters concede at least off the record that macri is not all that bright more important the distance between the radiant economic future macri promised and the havoc his administration wrought is all but immeasurable as federico sturzenegger who headed the argentine central bank during the first two and a half years of macri s term wrote in the immediate aftermath of fernández s election with a fall in per capita income of close to 10 percent and cumulative inflation higher than 300 percent in his four years it would be easy to declare his presidency a failure which in terms of economic results it was alberto and cristina could hardly have said it better themselves vastly rich himself besotted by fantasies about the wisdom of the global markets macri often came across as a left peronist caricature of a neoliberal utterly out of touch with the way poor argentines lived so much so that the inhabitants of buenos aires slums into which the macri government had poured money notably villa 31 a sprawling immigrant area in the shadow of an expressway voted overwhelmingly for alberto and cristina last month this dumbfounded the macri people i spoke with after the august primary election they had been expecting gratitude but as polls showed and as reporting in la nación a conservative newspaper that had supported macri confirmed his team were thinking like technocrats not politicians people might accept the government s largesse but since they perceived it as offered with disdain they were if anything less favorably disposed to macri than ever advertisement the disdain in fact flowed both ways there was a snobbery toward macri throughout his term particularly from the political elite that it s important to distinguish from the resentment toward macri so common among poor argentines in argentina this elite traditionally goes to high powered public high schools and public universities whereas macri s circle largely went to private catholic schools and universities institutions more noted for their rugby prowess than their academic rigor indeed one of the dismissive terms for macri and his close advisers was newman boys after the prep school macri attended as josé natanson the left leaning editor of the argentine edition of le monde diplomatique who was then writing a book trying to explain macri s victory told me in 2015 for the most part we quite simply don t know many of these people they come from a quite different world from ours but if the political elite was dismayed the cultural and artistic elite which as in most countries overwhelmingly breaks left was appalled and outraged both in private and in the pages of the cristinista daily página 12 there was much hysterical talk about macri s victory representing a return of the military dictatorship this buenos aires based intellectual circle always jealous in guarding its privileges is inordinately full of itself the only other country that comes close is france this can be picturesque argentina after all is a country where 800 lacanian psychoanalysts can issue an open letter protesting the overthrow of evo morales in bolivia and violence against the anti government demonstrators in chile during the presidential campaign another such open letter supporting the alberto cristina ticket attracted many if not most of the nation s leading writers artists musicians and theater and film people in contrast an open letter in support of macri garnered the support of only a handful of cultural notables though it did slightly better with economists for all that lopsideness of signatories a number of the best known on the alberto cristina side were not peronists in any traditional sense but had rather been won over by the kirchners themselves the gospel of these cristinistas was not the writings of juan perón or even the cult of evita but rather the left populist theories of ernesto laclau and chantal mouffe combined with bolivarian fantasies of the sort that fidel castro once succeeded in schooling the venezuelan leader hugo chávez their enthusiasm could become so extravagant that horacio gonzález a distinguished sociologist and head of the national library of argentina during cristina s second term could tell me in all sincerity that reports of the kirchners corruption were wildly overstated were they true he said one could not breathe he paused and after a histrionically deep breath added but you see i m breathing in a less defensive vein the argentine political theorist ricardo forster who along with gonzález and a few others had founded in 2008 the pro kirchner carta abierta open letter group of intellectuals told me that his support for cristina was based partly on his conviction that she was the most transgressive of all political leaders in the americas the recruitment of these intellectuals moral support was carefully planned in fact by the kirchners according to julio bárbaro an old line peronist who had been secretary of state for culture during menem s presidency and served under the kirchners on the agency regulating communications néstor came into office in 2003 by something of a fluke with only a small share of the popular vote a governor from the deep south of the country with little recognition in buenos aires he saw that he needed to legitimize himself undoing the impunity that the argentine military had enjoyed since the end of the dictatorship in 1983 was an obvious way of gaining favor with leftist intellectuals particularly an older generation of writers and artists such as luisa valenzuela and mempo giardinelli and leading human rights activists like horacio verbitsky and hebe de bonafini of the mothers of plaza de mayo group another such move in 2008 was a trust busting initiative to break up the media empire of the clarín group with which the kirchners had been on good terms until then bárbaro s view is a jaundiced one he believes the left intelligentsia was flattered by the kirchners attention and their willingness to appoint some among them to senior roles in the cultural apparatus of the argentine state such outreach cost the kirchners little he says but gave them the moral high ground as well as support from circles outside of peronist ranks even as they robbed the country blind this helps explain why many argentines accepted for a surprisingly long time macri s claims that their hardships were caused by the mess cristina had made of the economy there was some justification for this or surprisingly little way of proving it either way for during the last years of cristina s government axel kicillof the then minister of the economy now the governor elect of the buenos aires province ordered the national statistical bureau to stop publishing its research relevant to poverty as a result it is difficult to know by how severe the increase in poverty has been during the macri years providing at least some room for macri s supporters to defend his record advertisement from the beginning of 2018 however this position became unsustainable as inflation and interest rates rose sharply and the value of the argentine peso plummeted poverty spiked most of all in and around buenos aires leaders of left wing social movements notably juan grabois a charismatic young activist from a peronist background widely seen in argentina as having the ear of pope francis report there is now a nutrition crisis particularly for children in poor areas of the city and the surrounding province grabois is often accused by his critics of being an alarmist but statistics gathered by the catholic church as well as testimony from the priests who run emergency food centers largely bear him out juan mabromata afp via getty images then president cristina fernández de kirchner at an unveiling of a bust of her husband and former president néstor kirchner on her last day of office buenos aires december 9 2015 voting patterns in argentine presidential elections have been fairly stable since néstor became president the cristinistas can count on about 35 percent of the vote and cambiemos on about 32 percent so as in so many democratic countries the voters in the middle are the prize argentina s singularity though is that many maybe most of these voters in the middle are peronists just not kirchnerists in other words they are more narrowly argentine nationalist and less third worldist albeit that cristina s actions in government have rarely if ever matched her more militant rhetoric what might be called maduro lite some of her supporters are a different story in electoral terms this means that when peronism is united it is likely to win when divided likely lose in 2015 it was divided with another senior peronist leader sergio massa opposing the cristina anointed daniel scioli in the first round of elections under argentina s somewhat byzantine electoral system this entailed a run off between the two candidates with the most votes macri and scioli playing on cristina s widespread unpopularity macri won but by a vote margin of less than three percentage points from this can be inferred that as argentine political opinion now stands a peronist can win in the first round but an anti peronist can t the challenge for cambiemos then in 2019 was to secure enough votes in the first round to thwart an outright peronist victory and then to hope to repeat its winning strategy of 2015 a year before the election macri and his people were relatively sanguine about their chances cristina was thought to be as hated as ever by wide swaths of the population so much so that old line peronists made no secret of their opposition to her running again and their quest to find someone who could stand in her stead in the macrista scenario cristina would stand and a center right peronist massa again or perhaps alberto fernández who had been néstor s and then briefly cristina s chief of staff but like massa became a fierce critic of her corruption her economic policy and her authoritarianism for his part macri and his surrogates would turn to the one weapon remaining in their ideological arsenal the fear many argentines particularly among the middle classes felt when contemplating the prospect of cristina s returning to power so this was the cambiemos plan macri would come in second in the first round and then go on to defeat cristina in the run off it all seemed to make sense until one day in may it didn t for cristina was way ahead of them for all her fiery rhetoric cristina has shown herself to be a canny politician she saw just as clearly as the macri people what peronism s challenge would be in the 2019 election she first assented to a reconciliation with alberto which some commentators claim was brokered by pope francis himself a devoted peronist as a young man then came cristina s masterstroke on may 18 she announced via a youtube video and on social media that she had asked alberto to run for president while she would run as his vice president peronism was united in electoral alliance baptized with some justice as el frente de todos the front of everyone this left the macristas strategy in shambles made worse when sergio massa having reportedly turned down feelers from macri s team to become cambiemos s vice presidential candidate rallied behind alberto and cristina meanwhile there was nowhere to hide from macri s catastrophic stewardship of the argentine economy after the argentine president macri had been forced in september 2018 to go cap in hand to the international monetary fund to secure a 57 billion loan the largest in the imf s history it was clear from the start that argentina could not honor its repayment terms and economic conditionalities and that these would have to be renegotiated after the election whoever won the macristas soldiered on as though the iron law of electoral politics in any country not in the grip of a war environmental disaster or refugee emergency it s the economy stupid in james carville s phrase somehow did not apply to argentina never wavering in their defense of radical individualism they would tell you that argentines did not want to go back to the corporatist past only when the results of the primaries that argentina holds two and half months before the general election showed alberto and cristiana winning by 47 percent of the vote to macri s 32 percent a margin of victory so crushing that there was no realistic chance of macri making it to a runoff did the macristas realize the delusion of their it s cristina stupid strategy they tricked themselves grabois the activist suggested to me but if defeat in the presidential election did indeed prove to be inevitable the macristas could derive some comfort that their leader managed to claw back 2 2 million voters in the second leg and that in the lower house of parliament the chamber of deputies cambiemos won only one seat fewer than the peronists this mattered because any constitutional change alberto and cristina might propose would require a two thirds majority so cambiemos have an effective veto over any measure they deem too radical a closer look at the vote though confirms that when peronism is united it wins eitan abramovich afp via getty images a mocking portrait of then argentine president mauricio macri after the peso had tumbled in value against the us dollar buenos aires august 31 2018 in alberto the voters have elected a sort of peronist everyman in spanish there is a distinction between the words persona person and personaje meaning a personage or important figure cristina was the latter so was macri but as one of alberto s friends put it in a documentary by la nación alberto is a person not a personage alberto also reflects the protean nature of peronism it can be anything right left corporatist capitalist carlos menem s government in the 1990s represented rightist peronism at its apogee néstor kirchner veered rightward during his presidency while cristina flirted with left populist bolivarian rhetoric but unlike maduro in venezuela or evo morales in bolivia remained on excellent terms with most multinational interests most controversially awarding the us oil giant chevron for example a sweetheart deal over the development of the vaca muerta shale oil and gas fields in northern patagonia in this cristina often seemed to live up to another favorite argentine joke in which juan peron s motorcade arrives at a red light and his chauffeur asks my general what should i do when it turns green to which peron replies turn on the left indicator and make a right for all her formidable qualities though cristina is no perón and once alberto is sworn in on december 10 it seems highly unlikely that she could force him to do her bidding let alone stand down in her favor as some macristas continue to predict will happen even though it has done so only once in argentine history in 1973 when the left peronist politician héctor josé cámpora was elected president but resigned in order to clear the field for perón himself newly returned from his spanish exile to run and win this is not to say that cristina will not be the most powerful vice president in modern argentine history not least because of the influence her enemies would say the control she exerts over the peronist deputies and senators in congress it is far from clear though that cristina still wants to be president she has an adult daughter who is extremely ill and being treated in cuba she is also under pressure from numerous pending court cases charging her with corruption though it is improbable that she will be convicted let alone incarcerated in argentina indictments tend to rain down on the party that is out of power not on the incumbent leaders as the great investigative reporter for la nación hugo alconada mon has documented in his book la raíz de todos los males the root of all evils the argentine political system is organized around corruption and impunity and whatever else divides them both the peronists and their adversaries are enthusiastic backers of winners thanks to this system alberto is no exception to this and shortly before the president elect s inauguration alconada published an article linking a close adviser of alberto s to one of the worst corruption scandals of cristina s second term alberto will certainly need to revise the unfavorable terms of the deal macri concluded with the imf but this may not be as difficult as some observers think given that if argentina is on the hook so is the imf it is far from clear that the institution s new director kristalina georgieva can afford the political and institutional ramifications of yet another argentine default which could be as catastrophic as the one that occurred at the end of 2001 not to mention the effect such a default would have on any future political ambitions she may have most importantly or at least so it is widely rumored either at some point becoming head of the european central bank the job her predecessor at the imf christine lagarde has just assumed it is easy to wax apocalyptic about argentina most though not all of its industries are uncompetitive it is too dependent on exports of agricultural commodities above all soybeans its labor unions are wildly corrupt and exert too great an influence the public sector is bloated and phantom jobs are commonplace education is underfunded and overstretched and social mobility has ground to a halt the country may indeed be a very unfinished utopia as the political commentator ignacio zuleta once called it but it s hardly on the brink of collapse as much as alarmism is a national neurosis in argentina the country remains a highly desirable destination for immigrants not only from andean countries and the disaster that is venezuela but also from east asia and in smaller but growing numbers africa the higher education system may not be what it once was but argentine universities continue to turn out extremely well qualified and motivated young people and the country s cultural prowess above all in literature but also in music and the plastic arts remains a jewel there are even some industries nuclear energy being the most obvious that can compete with the world s best perhaps most important argentina is coming to seem an oasis of calm and stability in latin america compared to what is already happening in chile bolivia and venezuela and what may occur in brazil with lula s release from prison galvanizing opposition to the bolsonaro government argentines themselves often complain bitterly about the country s being riven in two ideologically yet that divide which they call la grieta the crack or the rift does not seem worse than what one sees in the united states the uk or france let alone brazil rather unwisely though alberto has promised as president to close la grieta that scarcely seems likely the fault line simply goes too deep and according to some who know him his flaws are uncomfortably close to macri s most notably an inability to delegate let s assume alberto successfully renegotiates the imf loan the four major trade union federations which are peronist after all as well the social movements led by people like grabois will surely give alberto some months grace perhaps even a year this will be very good news but what will he do for them and what will happen after sooner or later though alberto s status as the anti macri will pall just as surely as being the anti cristina palled for macri the economist simon kuznets once joked that there were four kinds of economies in the world developed countries underdeveloped countries japan and argentina he meant this in the most negative sense imaginable and one might be mistaken for thinking that guillermo nielsen one of alberto s chief economic advisers agreed with him when he insisted during the election campaign that argentina today is not a feasible economy but the emphasis was on today and what nielsen implied was simply the conventional wisdom of the argentine political establishment that peronist and non peronist alike prefers to blame that the country s economic travails on opponents policies rather than on any permanent structural problem but kuznets had a point and economic success in argentina has been the exception not the rule menem s government in the 1990s for example stayed afloat on monies accrued from the privatization of state industries the prosperity coinciding with néstor kirchner s first government owed much to a vertiginous rise in the prices of agricultural commodities in world markets no such deus ex machina is likely to smooth alberto s passage as president even if he defies the expectations of both his neoliberal critics and the radical social movement activists and turns out to be a much better president than macri it is difficult to see him extracting either the economy or the polity from the morass in which argentina finds itself

many people have the impression that recessions come from financial missteps such as the us subprime loan fiasco if energy is involved at all the problem comes from high oil prices as supply becomes inadequate to meet demand the real situation is different we already seem to be on the road toward a new crisis this crisis is likely to be much worse than the great recession of 2008 2009 this time a major problem is likely to be energy prices that are too low for producers last time a major problem was oil prices that were too high for consumers the problem is different but it is in some ways symmetric last time the united states seemed to be the epicenter this time my analysis indicates china is likely to be the epicenter last time the world economy was coming off a high growth period this time the world economy is already somewhat depressed even before hitting headwinds these differences plus the strange physics based way that the world economy is organized explain why the outcome seems likely to be worse this time than in 2008 2009 i recently explained what i see as happening in a presentation for actuaries recession likely expect a bend in trend lines this post is based on this presentation omitting the strictly insurance related portions the big thing that the vast majority of people do not understand is how important energy is to the economy because of this issue i started my presentation with this slide after an opportunity for discussion i offered the explanation that the role of food for humans is very much parallel to the need for energy of various types for the world economy food provides people with the energy required if they are to have the ability to think move and speak energy products of many kinds enable the activities that we associate with gdp for example energy consumption enables machinery to operate and goods to be transported using data from smil as well as more recent bp data we can estimate how fast energy consumption has been growing over a very long period nearly 200 years we can see that the highest energy consumption growth occurred in the 1961 to 1970 period the second highest growth occurred in the 1951 to 1960 period these are periods we associate with rapid gdp growth and prosperity on the next slide i show the same data displayed in a different way on this slide i make two changes in the way the data are displayed the increases in energy consumption are split into two components a energy used to support population growth and b all other which i describe as energy used to support improvement in living standards a different graphing approach is used note that when population growth corresponds to the full amount of energy consumption growth in other words at times when there is no red area above the blue area energy consumption per capita is flat high growth in energy consumption per capita seems to correspond to rising living standards as occurred in the 1950s and 1960s while i label the all other category as if it is simply changes in living standards there are other components as well one breakdown might be the following true improvement in living standards additional energy investments required to offset diminishing returns increasing use of energy for overhead items that don t get back to individuals such as energy used to fight pollution or to allow globalization efficiency improvements allowing available energy to be more productive efficiency improvements item 4 will allow more energy to be available for improvement in living standards while items 2 and 3 in the above list act in the opposite direction we do not know to what extent these items really offset each other thus all other improvement in living standards is only a rough approximation we can see from slide 6 that whenever there is no red area above the blue area flat living standards or flat energy per capita adverse events seem to happen for example the us civil war 1861 1865 came at a time of low energy consumption growth the great depression of the 1930s came during another period of low energy consumption per capita growth world war i came at the beginning of this period and world war ii came at the end the collapse of the central government of the soviet union in 1991 ushered in a decade of low world energy consumption growth in part because of the loss of the central currency of the soviet union the china coal note at the end pertains to the way that china and its coal supply has helped pull the world economy forward since 2001 this benefit seems to be already declining slide 7 shows china s energy production by fuel coal production in red soared after china was added to the world trade organization in december 2001 beginning about 2012 china s coal production began to plateau depleting mines and low prices for coal have kept production flat imports can be used as substitutes to some extent but it is difficult to keep costs low enough and provide adequate total supply with the loss of growth in china s coal production its economy has had to cut back each year we read about coal mine closures and miners needing to find new jobs we know that china discontinued its paper and plastic recycling business as of january 1 2018 china has also been cutting back on solar subsidies leading to fewer jobs installing solar panels all of these types of changes reduce the number of people who can afford to buy high priced goods such as new homes vehicles and smart phones it is becoming increasingly clear that china is being forced to cut back on heavy industrialization because of its coal difficulties slide 8 shows automobile purchases for six large economies china is by far the largest of these economies in terms of auto sales china s auto sales began to slide in 2018 and are sliding further in 2019 about 11 if we look back at the time of the 2008 2009 recession we see that auto sales of the us dropped precipitously the united states was the country that led the world into recession the inability of us citizens to buy cars was a sign that something was seriously wrong now we are seeing a similar pattern in china china has reported that its gdp growth rate has been slightly lower during 2019 but we really don t know how much lower the amounts it publishes are too smooth to be believed the actual gdp growth rate is believed to be lower than the recently reported 6 0 but no one knows by precisely how much figure 8b gives a little more information about recent car sales by country we can see from this chart that based on data through october 2019 world automobile sales are expected to fall by about the same percentage 3 in 2019 as during the recession year of 2008 i find this disturbing we can also see the huge impact that china has had on keeping world private passenger auto sales rising the world economy looked like it was headed into recession in january 2016 when world oil prices were very low but a spike in china s automobile sales at that time helped keep total world automobile sales rising and allowed world oil prices to rise from their low point in the next sections i provide some background regarding this story slide 10 shows the way that i visualize the world economy self organizing and growing the economy grows by adding new layers of businesses products consumers and laws unneeded products such as buggy whips are dropped from the bottom unprofitable businesses close in some sense the economy is hollow because of these deletions it cannot easily go backward because for example the support services for widespread use of transport using horses are lacking energy is used to operate all aspects of the system one part of the system is a self organizing financial system that helps decide through wage levels who gets the benefit of the goods and services that are made this financial system includes self organizing interest rates and self organizing commodity prices the most important connection within the economy is the one i show at the center as consumers employees consumers are very dependent on their wages as employees if the economy is to continue to operate workers must receive high enough wages to purchase the goods and services the economy produces even the lower paid workers need to be able to afford food housing and transportation or the economy will tend to collapse when we look back through the history on slides 4 5 and 6 we see that the growth of energy consumption is very important in how economies operate the theories of ilya prigogine explain why this is the case when adequate flows of energy are available self organizing systems are able to grow few economists today include energy consumption in their models however economic theory has grown over time in its own ivory tower like other academic subjects it depends on early theories and the process of peer review the views expressed must also be pleasing to those in power who would like everyone to believe that politicians rather than the laws of physics are in charge there are many types of self organizing systems that grow they all directly or indirectly require energy plants and animals of all types are self organizing systems that grow hurricanes grow using the energy that they get from warm water governments grow from the tax revenue that they are able to collect they use the revenue to buy energy products such as electricity to operate governmental offices oil to build roads and operate police cars and natural gas to heat buildings the internet grows through the revenue collected to provide its services the internet uses revenue to buy computers made with energy products and electricity to operate those computers nearly all 0f the energy we use is hidden for example modern food production is very much dependent on energy consumption agricultural machines are made using energy products soil amendments including organic soil amendments are transported using fossil fuel energy refrigeration is possible through the use of energy hybrid seeds are only possible through energy consumption planting seeds by digging with a stick would only use human energy but such a process would be terribly inefficient most of us can easily recognize today s goods and services such as those listed promises of future goods and services act like promises of future energy supplies this happens because creating goods and services that people can actually use requires energy supplies of the appropriate type when people get cash or a check they expect to use it to buy goods and services creating these goods and services requires energy consumption if there is no energy of the right type available the goods and services won t be available to fulfill the promises promises of future goods and services tend to grow faster than actual goods and services because it is these promises that in some sense pull the economy along for example if a young person gets a loan s he can often buy a new car the fact that a new car is being purchased leads to more jobs in the supply line leading up to new car production or if a business takes out a loan or sells shares of stock it can use the proceeds to hire employees it is these growing wages that keep the system operating as long as the economy is growing rapidly the mismatch between growing debt and actual output doesn t become apparent as the economy slows some workers find themselves working fewer hours some businesses become less profitable and lay off workers to try to restore profitability the catch is with fewer workers the economy slows even more it usually takes more debt at lower interest rates to get out of such an economic slowdown there is a lot of confusion about prices demand is what people through their wages and debt can afford as economists tell us price depends on supply and demand in the short term prices tend to bounce around a lot the short term buyers of oil are oil refineries they need to keep their employees busy if they see a shortage of oil they may bid up the price of oil to allow their workers to continue to be employed over the longer term prices of all energy products tend to depend on consumers ability to afford finished products like cars homes and cell phones producing these objects and shipping them takes energy they also use energy as they operate the various energy prices shown here are simply a few of the many many energy prices that we see around the world strangely enough prices of all energy products tend to fluctuate together over the longer term prices depend on affordability of end products such as cars homes computers food and clothing our problem since about 2012 has been lack of affordability of end products the primary way of raising affordability is by increasing productivity increased productivity is made possible by increasingly leveraging human labor with devices that are built with energy and are operated using energy for example a worker with a ditch digging machine is much more productive than a ditch digger with only a shovel an analyst is more productive with a computer and internet access than with only pencil and paper with higher productivity more goods are produced in total as long as not too much of this productive output is skimmed off the top by governments or by business hierarchy or to pay for the devices and their fuel it is possible for each worker to afford more goods and services raising total demand an alternative way of raising affordability is by adding more debt at ever lower interest rates this approach tends to make goods such as cars homes and factories appear more affordable because their monthly payments are lower this added debt approach only works as long as the economy is growing quickly enough if the economy slows too much the added debt leads to financial crashes of many types many people think that they know the amount of oil that can be extracted based on the current technology and the assumption that prices will eventually rise high enough to extract all of the fossil fuels that seem to be available for example the international energy agency has prepared reports in which it shows expected oil availability if oil prices rise to 300 per barrel the catch is that even if oil prices can bounce high it is not clear that they can stay very high the current price of oil is only in the 55 to 65 per barrel range a price of 300 per barrel will allow oil extraction using very advanced technology we don t have any evidence that oil prices can stay this high because demand comes primarily from wages prices cannot stay high without adequate support from wage levels of course the issue is not just oil prices staying sufficiently high natural gas coal uranium and electricity prices all have difficulty rising high enough and staying high enough commodity prices such as copper and steel have the same issue there are many people who say of course oil prices will rise oil is a necessity they forget that it is really a two way tug of war between producers getting a high enough price to be profitable and consumers getting a low enough price to be affordable there will be a winner and a loser people also forget that most commodity use is hidden we see the fuel we buy for our personal vehicles but there are a huge quantity of oil products required for shipping goods paving roads growing food and for many other uses that we are not aware of while we might be able to pay a little more to fill our gasoline tank most of us would not be able to simultaneously pay more for food transported goods of all kinds and road maintenance economists often assume that if energy prices rise wages will rise as well if we look at the data historically however it doesn t work that way at all what happens is the opposite average wages tend to rise as long as oil prices stay low once oil prices spike average wages tend to flatten out the amounts shown on slide 24 are average wages computed by taking the total inflation adjusted wages for the population in total and dividing by population when oil prices spike recession soon sets in the reason why average wages fall is partly because more people become unemployed other workers find it necessary to accept lower paying jobs many people focus on the run up in oil prices to july 2008 an equally important point is the fact that the world economy has not been able to maintain these high prices since july 2008 the general price trend has been downward the cuts by opec have not had a material impact citizens of the united states europe and japan are used to thinking of high energy prices as being a problem because they are from countries that require substantial imported energy to maintain their gdp for example greece will sell fewer trips on its tour boats if oil prices are high this will have an adverse impact on employment and the ability to repay debt with interest if a country is an oil exporting country low oil prices are an even worse problem this happens because oil exporting countries tend to earn a large share of their revenue from taxes on the sale of oil these taxes can be much higher if oil is selling for say 120 per barrel than if it is selling for 60 per barrel these tax dollars are used to provide subsidies to offset the high cost of imported food they are also used to build industry and infrastructure to provide employment to the population if oil prices are too low oil exporting countries will tend to cut back on oil production in fact this has been happening for opec for the entire year of 2019 similar problems occur if commodity prices of any kind coal natural gas uranium steel copper etc stay too low for an extended period producers go bankrupt or they stop production or they pay their employees so poorly that the employees go on strike sometimes they may even start rioting many of the riots around the world today are related to low commodity prices the world experienced spiking oil prices in the period leading up to mid 2008 these high prices caused a recession and much lower prices followed the chart on slide 28 gives a somewhat exaggerated view of what goes wrong with high oil prices if the price of oil suddenly spikes to two or three times its previous price both the price of food and gasoline are likely to increase this change tends to lead to a big shift in a family s budget debt payments such as for a home and car are pretty much fixed so the big increase in food and gasoline prices must be taken out of the budget earmarked for everything else this leads to cutbacks in discretionary spending such as vacations restaurant meals and charitable contributions in a short time there are layoffs in discretionary sectors those who are laid off are more prone to defaults on loan payments the problem soon escalates to a recession with high unemployment and low oil prices strangely enough central banks push back against high oil prices as well they know that high oil prices lead to high food prices citizens of energy importing countries will be unhappy with elected officials if oil and food prices rise thus central banks tend to raise short term interest rates as soon as they become concerned about high oil and food prices the recession that follows will quickly bring food and energy prices back down if food and energy prices fall the low prices will be the problem of the energy producers oil exporters will find their tax revenue too low but the high price problem of oil importers will be gone you will recall that the rapid energy consumption growth periods were 1961 to 1970 and 1951 to 1960 during these periods the economy was growing almost too quickly the federal reserve was able to keep raising interest rates as a way of holding down economic growth it was not until 1981 that the pattern changed from raising interest rates to falling interest rates since 1981 the us federal reserve and other central banks have been reducing interest rates lowering interest rates and rising debt levels as mentioned previously makes goods appear more affordable because of lower monthly payments the concern now is that interest rates are about as low as they can go central banks no longer have room to offset recessionary tendencies because of slow growth in energy consumption by lowering short term interest rates most people never consider the possibility of low energy prices leading to collapse it looks to me like this is the danger facing us today let s start by looking back at what happened in 1991 when the central government of the soviet union collapsed in 1991 the individual republics making up the soviet union were left on their own to find new currencies and new trading partners satellite countries of the soviet union were affected as well slide 31 shows that the consumption of many types of resources dropped for many years for the whole area the low point was not reached until 1998 if we look back to see what had happened previously the soviet union was an oil producer and exporter when oil prices were high in the 1973 to 1980 period the soviet union prospered but then low prices came along at least partly because the us federal reserve raised interest rates to 20 in the 1980 1981 period see figure 29b the long term low oil prices in some sense indicated that the world economy was producing too much oil some inefficient area s of production needed to leave the soviet union may have been singled out by the self organizing economy because it used energy products in a less efficient manner than other economies its adverse outcome may also have reflected the fact that its cost of production was higher leaving less of the sale price for reinvestment and taxes the soviet union is an example of what can happen if oil prices stay too low for several years the central government of such an economy can collapse when commodity prices are too low the economies of countries exporting those commodities are stressed this is why we see so many uprisings in commodity producing countries right now iraq with its oil has been having protests chile with its copper and lithium exports has been seeing protests south africa with its exports of coal precious metals and gems has been having riots with some escalation any of these low price situations could lead to an overturned government in slide 36 i give an example of two different kinds of ingredients in a cake ones that are substitutable the flavoring which can be vanilla almond or something else ones that are not substitutable the flour which is the energy product with too small a quantity of flour all we can do is make a smaller cake perhaps we can substitute a different energy product but electricity most certainly will not do some bacteria eat electricity but humans do not substitutability is limited even within energy products carriers economists make models focusing on the special case when a material is not essential for the economy this gives a misleading impression if they had looked back at what happened when energy supplies were low relative to population growth as we saw on slide 6 they could make much better models we seem to be sitting on the edge of some form of collapse for at least parts of the world economy right now without enough energy consumption growth top level organizations such as the european union the united nations and the world trade organization are especially at risk of collapse one of our big problems today is excessive wage disparity high wage workers rarely have trouble being able to afford homes cars vacations and air conditioning it is non elite workers the ones who have not been able to find high paying jobs who have an affordability problem the wage disparity problem is an outgrowth of how the physics of the economy works if there are not enough goods and services to go around the physics of the economy effectively freezes out some of the workers under this arrangement there will be some survivors even if there is not quite enough for everyone in some sense the best adapted are able to survive if the inadequate supply of finished goods and services were spread around evenly there might be no survivors at all the thing that is key is that workers need to be able to afford finished goods and services produced by the economy if too large a share of wages goes to high paid workers or to owners of robots there is not enough left over for the regular employees many workers have seen their jobs disappear as their employers moved production to another country where wages were lower or jobs can remain but the wages will fall from the low wage competition us income disparity seems to be as great as it was in about 1930 at the time of the great depression if we look at historical world energy consumption by fuel we observe that it has been rising the vast majority of the time the little dip that we see about 2008 2009 occurred at the time of the great recession it doesn t take much of a cutback in energy consumption to cause a major problem back at slide 20 i remarked the primary way of raising affordability is by increasing productivity increased productivity is made possible by increasingly leveraging human labor with devices that are built with energy and are operated using energy the world economy requires growing energy supply of suitable kinds to operate if the quantity of energy available is reduced productivity is likely to nosedive this is true even if the reduction is intentional and seems to be for a good cause such as reducing co2 emissions we seem to be heading for a contraction in energy supplies now because of continued low energy prices fossil fuels are in some sense leaving us whether we like it or not world coal production has been flat to falling since 2012 ipcc scenarios assume a very different pattern fossil fuel use especially coal will grow indefinitely presumably because of high prices and improved technology many people are hoping that wind solar and hydroelectric will someday replace fossil fuels i consider this highly unlikely because all three are made using fossil fuels furthermore these renewables in total represented only 10 of world energy supply in 2018 the 10 is divided as follows wind 2 solar 1 and hydroelectric 7 there clearly is a correlation between gdp growth and energy consumption growth china with its growing coal use was pulling the world economy along especially in the 2002 to 2012 period recently it has lost much of this ability in my opinion trump s tariffs are not the cause of our current trade problems tariffs seem to be enacted whenever growth in energy consumption per capita is very low tariffs were enacted both immediately before the us civil war and at the time of the great depression the problem is that jobs that pay well indirectly require significant energy consumption when growth in energy consumption per capita is low it becomes impossible to find enough jobs that pay well for everyone tariffs are used in an attempt to keep jobs that pay well at home we don t know quite what will happen the closest analogy is the great depression of the 1930s more financial problems seem likely in fact they could escalate quite quickly more strikes such as those currently going on in france seem likely the situation is likely to play out a little differently in various countries the physics of the situation seems to try to keep some parts of the system operating if at all possible but as mentioned at slide 10 the self organizing system deletes parts of the economy that are no longer needed we no longer have an economy that can operate with horse and buggy for example we can t just go backwards to an economy of an earlier era we are already seeing changes in this direction hong kong s protests are in the news practically daily germany is experiencing job layoffs we know that in an interconnected world a recession that starts in one large country is likely to eventually affect much of the rest of the world now we are in a waiting period waiting to see what happens next major changes seem likely over the next five years but they could happen much sooner

microsoft amazon ceo and founder jeff bezos has had issues with president trump largely stemming from trump s accusations that bezos company is underpaying taxes the question is whether the president of the united states should be allowed to use the budget of dod to pursue his own personal and political ends the formal complaint said economist and former chairman of the federal reserve paul volcker passed away over the weekend at the age of 92 volcker understood the importance of cycles in relation to the economy published in 1978 the rediscovery of the business cycle reintroduced the concept of cycles and their effect on the economy to the western world the rediscovery of the business cycle is a sign of the times not much more than a decade ago in what now seems a more innocent age the new economics had become orthodoxy its basic tenet repeated in similar words in speech after speech in article after article was described by one of its leaders as the conviction that business cycles were not inevitable that government policy could and should keep the economy close to a path of steady real growth at a constant target rate of unemployment of course some minor fluctuations in economic activity were not ruled out but the impression was conveyed that they were more the consequence of misguided political judgments of practical men beguiled by the mythology of the old orthodoxy of balanced budgets and of occasional errors in forecasting than of deficiency in our basic knowledge of how the economy worked or in the adequacy of the tools of policy the avant garde of the profession began to look elsewhere to problems of welfare economics and income distribution for new challenges of course the handling of the economic consequences of the vietnam war was an obvious blot on the record but that after all reflected more political than economic judgments by the early 1970s the persistence of inflationary pressures even in the face of mild recession began to flash some danger signals the responses of the economy to the twisting of the dials of monetary and fiscal policy no longer seemed quite so predictable but it was not until the events of 1974 and 1975 when a recession sprung on an unsuspecting world with an intensity unmatched in the post world war ii period that the lessons of the new economics were seriously challenged the rediscovery of the business

us at or find us on twitter ancagurzu paola_tamma and makaoro driving the day politicians take over we re entering the final week of the cop25 climate talks in madrid senior national officials arrive this week to try to hammer out some of the most politically challenging elements of the paris climate accord they include rules on how to use carbon markets and trade emissions reductions as well as financial support for developing countries reeling from climate related shocks such as hurricanes storms and floods zack colman and kalina have the breakdown on what to expect this week here or scroll below carbon markets so far a deal to craft carbon market rules to help reduce emissions has proven elusive in the first week of technical talks the eu won t back an agreement if it doesn t help cut emissions or threatens environmental integrity an eu negotiator told kalina which means the talks could continue next year at the cop26 that s also a position pushed by environmental campaigners worried that a weak deal here would lock in loopholes for decades to come the eu has been adamant from the outset that it won t tolerate rules that would allow for double counting meaning that traded emission cuts would be recorded by both buyers and sellers the eu has zero willingness to compromise on double counting the eu negotiator said but brazil is digging in its heels on the issue and resisting eu pressure pushing ambition environmental campaigners and vulnerable least developed and island nations want this year s climate summit to send a strong signal for countries to up their climate plans next year negotiations over the text on the cop s formal outcome are ongoing with big emerging economies such as india and brazil resisting attempts to tie them to raising their climate pledges next year kalina is told campaigners meanwhile warn about a possible failure we are halfway through this climate conference and we re yet to see the energy on the streets translate into political energy at the negotiating table greenpeace s jennifer morgan said saturday adding that leaders in madrid have a moral and democratic obligation to make sure the sounds of their footsteps are heard in the halls of power climate protests hit madrid youth activists flooded the streets of the spanish capital on friday part of a global protest hoping to ramp up pressure on negotiators and politicians taking part in the cop25 this protest has a very simple message we need to do more we cannot allow ourselves to lose more decades years and weeks said teresa ribera spain s acting minister for the ecological transition kalina and zack have more here or below what about africa following initial drama over the request of the african group of negotiators to discuss the special circumstances of their continent something that upset other developing nations especially latin american countries the groups chief negotiators held a presser on saturday to calm the waves it is not a competition of who s more vulnerable chief negotiator mohamed nasr from egypt said saturday but he cautioned it s important that wealthy nations understand they need to boost financial and other support to ensure that regions such as africa choose clean energy options instead of exploiting fossil fuels you will see how much of minerals including oil gas coal and others there are in africa nasr said there is a sustainable path for africa to take and not so sustainable a message from fuelseurope a survey run by independent polling company opinium and commissioned by fuelseurope shows that eu consumers ask their governments to do more to support the development of multiple low carbon solutions identifying the lack of incentives as the main obstacle to the uptake of low carbon

obtained by eline schaart here are some key dates to keep in mind and here is the full story or find it below by march proposal for a european climate law that would enshrine an objective for the eu to become climate neutral by 2050 in legislation mid 2020 proposal for a smart sector integration which is meant to explore how electrification can reach other sectors like transport and buildings by october proposal for a comprehensive plan to increase the eu s 2030 emissions reduction target to at least 50 percent and toward 55 percent by october an assessment of countries final 2030 national energy and climate plans which are due in less than a month the october date is in brackets meaning it could change by the fourth quarter of 2020 adopt a new eu strategy on adaptation to climate change the date is still in square brackets the need to revise how the bloc adapts to climate change was one of the proposals in a briefing book prepared by the commission s climate department which we reported on by 2021 proposal for a carbon border adjustment mechanism for selected sectors by june 2021 proposal to revise energy legislation to reflect the eu s climate ambitions including the renewable energy and energy efficiency directives this confirms what energy commissioner kadri simson cautiously hinted at during her hearing that s also the date for a proposal to extend the eu s emissions trading system to the maritime sector and reduce free allowances for airlines and also for revising co2 emissions reduction goals for cars in case you missed it here are the dates between december 11 and march 31 for when the commission is expected to discuss its key proposals in the college of commissioners february 26 is flagged for the climate law proposal regions views on green deal the committee of the regions last week set out its non binding resolution on the commission s green deal pledge we can no longer close our eyes to the climate emergency if the green transition does not start in our cities in our municipalities it will not happen at all said karl heinz lambertz head of the body representing sub national governments it s a message heeded by the commission on thursday frans timmermans the commission s point man on the green deal made its own plea to regional governments whether we take control of this or whether we just let this happen there is going to be a transformation he said we need every single one of you to be an integral part of this for us to succeed how trump could cost us companies a climate bonanza u s president donald trump s planned pullout from the paris climate agreement has some u s companies worried that a business opportunity worth hundreds of billions of dollars is going to pass them by the withdrawal could lock u s

the planet christine lagarde seems less keen to make big pledges on using the european central bank to fight climate change now that she s actually in office the newly appointed ecb president this week began rowing back on her call to put the institution s financial firepower into greening the economy the mandate of the ecb is not about climate change she said she described the environment and other objectives as perhaps not primary ones but secondary ones bjarke smith meyer has the story here or below meanwhile the european banking authority warned friday that banks should act now to tackle climate change by measuring green lending on their books and creating sustainable business strategies the paris based eba published its action plan on sustainable finance outlining a timeline for its own legal mandates on environmental social and governance esg factors energy markets record low support levels for green energy in denmark the danish energy agency said friday this year s technology neutral tender to support renewable energy projects provided record low support levels for onshore wind and solar projects the agency received a total of seven tenders with projects totalling 135 megawatts for onshore wind and 136 mw for solar power plants all of them were accepted for a total support of 157 million krone 21 million the low support levels needed means only 61 percent of the allocated budget was used the agency said energy technology decarbonizing the heating sector the eu could decarbonize its heating and cooling sector in a cost effective way by 2050 if member states build a total of 21 500 new district heating systems and integrate them into the bloc s increasingly smart energy systems according to a study from aalborg university heating and cooling is responsible for about half of the eu s energy consumption and the new commission is expected to focus on the matter as part of its push to help renovate the bloc s buildings and boost the use of smart technology more findings the study commissioned by heating and cooling company danfoss and french utility engie found that with the right balance between investments in end user savings and investments in decarbonized energy supply an affordable decarbonization is possible by reducing space heating demands by 30 percent by improving the energy efficiency of district energy systems and moving from a supply to a demand driven system with automatic controls savings of up to 40 percent can be achieved it found green jet fuel finland s neste is one of europe s largest sustainable fuel

told saim saeed in a phone interview for years the european aviation industry and policymakers have paid lip service to alternative fuels heralding them as the silver bullet that will decarbonize the

sputter on carbon market disputes by zack colman and kalina oroschakoff madrid u n climate change talks enter the final week here on monday as senior national officials arrive to try to hammer out rules to link the nascent carbon markets that are deemed critical to reaching the targets under the paris agreement so far a deal to craft an international trading market to help reduce the carbon pollution driving up temperatures has proven elusive to the legions of largely technical experts gathered at the cop25 conference in the spanish capital since last week negotiators acknowledged that translating world leaders lofty promises to protect the climate into an actionable set of rules by the end of the conference on friday will be a daunting task whenever you come here you reach for the moon and in the end of the day you reach the fence said tosi mpanu mpanu a negotiator from the democratic republic of congo the outstanding issues on the table are some of the most politically challenging elements of the paris climate accord left over from last year s conference in poland in addition to establishing the rules for international carbon trading they include hiking the funding that rich nations provide to help developing countries adapt to the changing climate and rising seas and setting out a common schedule for nations to update their greenhouse gas goals negotiators are still far from reaching a deal as evidenced by several delays in delivering a clear set of proposals to govern carbon trading a hurdle that has prompted some countries such as south africa and india to harden their positions and call for even more aggressive action they re trying to escalate here which is not the best sign said brad schallert deputy director of international climate cooperation for the world wildlife fund environmental foreign and finance ministers from many countries are joining the second week of talks to apply political pressure hoping to break stalemates they won t be joined by top u s officials however who have skipped the meeting after president donald trump started the one year countdown in november to pull the world s second largest polluter out of the pact negotiated by his predecessor former president barack obama most heads of state are sitting out the madrid talks since this year s conference is viewed as building out the technical rules in the agreement in contrast with next year s cop26 talks in glasgow where countries are expected to update their national climate plans as expected the most fraught discussions are over designing the rules that would underpin trading carbon emissions and offsets across borders negotiators want to set rules to ensure the system that allows polluters to buy credits from countries and projects that cut emissions will result in actual emissions reductions that wouldn t otherwise have happened brazil which under president jair bolsonaro has backed away from climate action is taking a hard line stance by insisting any emissions reductions from its massive forests or other projects can be used both for its own paris targets as well as by the countries that pay it opponents say that amounts to double counting that will undermine the emissions trading system and few believe the country s position is tenable since it so far has attracted no major allies the eu has zero willingness to compromise on double counting an eu negotiator said brazil also wants to transfer old credits created through the 1997 kyoto protocol to the new paris system even though those credits were largely ineffective at reducing emissions that stance has support from india and saudi arabia observers said china the world s largest greenhouse gas emitter has been somewhat quiet in public but holds many of those older credits veterans of the climate talks suggested brazil s position may be little more than saber rattling in an effort to secure a generous transition of old credits to the paris system but reviving those credits would water down the paris agreement by allowing potentially billions of tons worth of questionable emissions credits to satisfy national emissions goals said kelley kizzier associate vice president of international climate with the environmental defense fund it doesn t make any sense kizzier said of brazil s posture it s a major reason why countries would walk away from a deal here climate finance fight little progress has been made in overcoming one of the biggest hurdles in the talks increasing the financial support that rich industrialized nations send to poorer countries to help them develop clean energy and adapt to more ferocious storms or devastating droughts developing countries especially african nations small island states and latin american states are leading an effort to implement a levy on carbon emissions trading between countries so far wealthy countries have resisted that type of fee which they say was not included in the paris agreement countries are also haggling over the percentage of funding from carbon offset projects that will be diverted into the adaptation fund which was part of the original paris deal south africa has suggested 6 percent wwf s schallert said which would go beyond previously discussed limits chile which is hosting the conference that was moved from santiago only weeks ago has also pressed for countries to propose steeper emissions cuts than they pledged in 2015 in paris even if those previous targets are met the world will fall short of the greenhouse gas reductions needed to keep global temperatures rising above the 2 degree target that was agreed in paris that scientists say is critical in heading off the worst effect of climate change we will try to make as many countries commit to update their cop president carolina schmidt the chilean environment minister said last week she is backed by the least developed and vulnerable island nations which are seeking a clear signal countries are serious about their efforts but after the first week of talks that effort is not going well officials from brazil and india pushed back on schmidt s call to increase their targets at a wednesday meeting said shuo li a senior global policy adviser with greenpeace china instead they pressed for negotiators in madrid to focus on implementing the paris agreement rather than trying to increase their emission reduction goals so soon but increasing that climate ambition is critical issue for small island states since many may become uninhabitable if cuts in greenhouse gas emissions aren t far deeper than what the industrialized countries promised in paris this is supposed to be the ambition cop we cannot wait another year for ambitious climate action it must start now said lois m young of belize who heads a negotiating bloc made up of small island states some developing nations such as india and others in the group countries that includes bangladesh vietnam saudi arabia and egypt have suggested setting up a monitoring regime to evaluate whether developed nations met the marks they set before 2020 said elliot diringer executive vice president with the center for climate and energy solutions underscoring a long simmering distrust between the developed and developing worlds aligning climate plans talks on trying to get countries national plans to cover the same time spans continues to run into resistance with some negotiators blaming the european union though it appears to be a technical matter aligning the timing of nations emissions pledges under the paris agreement would make it easier to compare and speed up emission reductions eu regulation for instance runs on a 10 year cycle something climate campaigners are keen to trim to five years brussels has balked at that concerned that changes clash with the eu s long winded political process that typically takes years to get legislation past european lawmakers and eu member states under the paris agreement countries have some years still to work out those rules in detail but country blocs such as the africa group won t let up congo s mpanu mpanu said saturday that the countries backed a five year cycle if you allow for 10 year cycles you lock in weak ambition he said it is important for us to come every five years and actually review reassess where we are at loss and damage another thorny issue that politicians will have to grapple with this week is how to support developing countries devastated by hurricanes floods and other climate related shocks called loss and damage in climate negotiators lingo vulnerable countries say they want a mechanism to help guarantee financial support something wealthy nations have traditionally resisted but negotiations in recent days suggest there may be signs that decades old resistance from wealthier nations to consider the issue is thawing as the worsening effects of climate change raise pressure on countries to reach a compromise but that doesn t mean that vulnerable countries are close to getting what they are asking for the struggle over the next few days will be to get wealthy nations to give up their long held opposition to the loss and damage issues that were first put on the agenda in 1991 by vanuatu a nation of islands in the south pacific for the last six years developing countries have not seen progress on loss and damage finance said harjeet singh advocacy group action aid s global lead on climate change who is involved in the negotiations singh said australia the u s canada and japan in particular are blocking the loss and damage effort and called on the eu to break the deadlock and actually start engaging with these proposals protests hit madrid as frustration over climate failure boils over by kalina oroschakoff and zack colman madrid youth activists flooded the streets of the spanish capital on friday part of a global protest hoping to ramp up pressure on negotiators and politicians taking part in the cop25 climate talks as dusk settled thousands of banner carrying demonstrators marched north from madrid s main train station on paseo del prado a main thoroughfare that on friday evening belonged to pedestrians this protest has a very simple message we need to do more we cannot allow ourselves to lose more decades years and weeks said teresa ribera spain s acting minister for the ecological transition in a statement this message invites climate action all over the planet the march was organized by the activist group fridays for future that has sparked student walkouts around the world to prod political leaders into swifter action on climate change it came as the first week of the united nations cop25 climate change conference drew to a close next week politicians will take over from technical negotiators as they try to hammer out a global carbon trading system but technical details and slow motion negotiations aren t enough for activists increasingly worried about the drumbeat of scientific reports showing that the world isn t making enough progress to avoid the grimmest consequences of climate change basically nothing has happened the climate crisis is still being ignored by those in power 16 year old swede greta thunberg said at a friday press conference before she and others hit the streets it is not a sustainable solution that children skip school we cannot go on like that while the main thrust of this year s summit is figuring out how to set up a global carbon market something called for in article 6 of the paris agreement the street protests are increasing pressure on countries to move faster on cutting greenhouse gas emissions although it s not formally part of this year s summit campaigners and vulnerable countries are pushing behind the scenes to ensure that the text that comes out of madrid includes a strong call for countries to boost their emissions pledges next year when negotiators meet for the cop26 in glasgow however major emitters such as the united states india and brazil show little sign of boosting their emissions cuts the u s last month also started the formal process of leaving the paris deal china the world s leading emitter is under pressure to do more but hasn t yet committed gloomy reports further delay will bring more disastrous outcomes scientists at the cop25 climate summit warned friday saying weather extremes are a new normal putting millions of people at risk we have still a window open but it is very narrow we have 10 more years and that depends on ecosystems still continuing to be a functioning carbon sink said johan rockström director of the potsdam institute for climate impact research despite growing use of renewables fossil emissions continue to rise and the world is far from reaching the paris agreement s goals it s clear that protests are having an impact the eu saw a green wave in this year s european election and the bloc is moving to become climate neutral by 2050 but patricia espinosa the u n s climate chief on friday cautioned that climate change is a threat multiplier that could unleash social clashes if you have a problem of inequalities the effect of climate change will deepen that problem if you have a problem of poverty climate change will deepen the problem and therefore the likelihood of more social unrest will be there she said the protests aren t just happening in well heeled places like sweden and spain uganda is also seeing climate demonstrations although they are met with police brutality and the risk of arrest said vanessa nakate a ugandan activist there are already people dying as a result of this crisis so it is not a matter of the future it s a matter of now nakate said youth campaigners from vulnerable islands at the summit on friday warned that failure to act was a matter of life and death world leaders need to know that people like me are watching them the text we put down today on paper at cop is what our future will look like brianna fruean from samoa and a member of the pacific climate warriors initiatives told reporters at the conference it would be the greatest injustice the world has ever committed in our lifetime if we lose an island and people don t have a home to go back to that prospect is becoming more likely if emissions continue to rise breaching the limit of 1 5 degrees of warming the paris agreement s aspirational target is a planetary boundary we pass at our own peril putting all future generations at risk rockström said the current 1 degree of warming is already moving toward potentially irreversible change such as accelerated melting of greenland and west antarctic ice sheets drying of rainforests and thawing of arctic permafrost he said commission outlines green deal in internal document by eline schaart the european commission is fleshing out the details of its green deal plan in an internal presentation obtained by politico the document outlines the commission s green deal ambitions which will be presented on december 11 the briefer presentation is making the rounds of brussels policymakers this week it confirms commission president ursula von der leyen s plan to propose a european climate law that would enshrine an objective for the eu to become climate neutral by 2050 in legislation by march it also talks of the eu executive s ambition to present a comprehensive plan to increase the eu s 2030 emissions reduction target to at least 50 percent and toward 55 percent in a responsible way by october 2020 the current 2030 target is a 40 percent emissions cut compared with 1990 levels the document which is not dated sketches out a 35 billion just transition mechanism meant to help people and industries to transition to a low carbon economy von der leyen earlier this week said the commission was working towards an aspirational target of mobilizing 100 billion of total investments during the next budget cycle from 2021 until 2027 the document also proposes extending the eu s emissions trading system to the maritime sector and to reduce free allowances for airlines by june 2021 in line with von der leyen s political agenda on the zero pollution ambition the commission said it wants to adopt a water quality action plan as well as an air pollution action plan which would include a review of air quality standards to align them with world health organization guidelines according to the presentation the commission will also present its farm to fork strategy in the spring while rolling out a set of initiatives from the end of 2020 including targets to reduce chemical pesticides by 50 percent by 2030 it also mentioned reducing the use of fertilizers by 2030 without setting a number the commission also said it wants to present a chemical innovation strategy in june 2020 followed by a package of regulatory measures by to help the bloc s transition to a circular economy the commission is planning to adopt an eu industrial strategy and new circular action plan by march confirming a commission draft agenda of upcoming cabinet meetings the document also suggests that the commission will propose legislative reforms tackling waste as well as stimulate energy intensive industrial sectors to become more climate neutral and to market circular products under a so called green oath to do no harm the commission said it wants to revamp the environmental implementation review process to ensure better and more effective implementation and enforcement of existing environmental legislation how trump could cost us companies a climate bonanza by zack colman u s president donald trump s planned pullout from the paris climate agreement has some u s companies worried that a business opportunity worth hundreds of billions of dollars is going to pass them by the withdrawal could lock u s businesses out of a huge portion of the rapidly growing global market already worth an estimated 164 billion that seeks to put an economic price on the greenhouse gases warming the planet a potential economic loss causing concern among american based companies such as the food and candy maker mars negotiators from nearly 200 nations began meeting on monday at a u n climate conference where the discussions include the details of how carbon trading markets could help meet the paris agreement s goals for heading off the worst consequences of global warming but trump s exit plan would leave the united states as the only country on earth not part of the paris deal and potentially left out of the economic bounty the pullout could also hurt foreign companies with large u s operations such as the oil giant royal dutch shell and the canada based electricity producer capital power and it may damage american entrepreneurs efforts to lure investments for technologies that could help stem the worst effects of climate change to the extent that we re not in the paris agreement that creates a competitive advantage for other countries said jon sohn the director of u s government relations at capital power the u s should be in those markets trump has defended the paris exit as a blow for u s economic sovereignty contending that the non binding pact that the obama administration negotiated in 2015 would mean lost jobs lower wages shuttered factories and vastly diminished economic production for the united states but the push to reduce the world s carbon pollution is also creating major economic opportunities those include trading systems already present in parts of europe and the u s in which companies essentially buy and sell the right to pollute a setup that gives polluters an economic incentive to cut back while generating new income for businesses that help clean the atmosphere one company hoping to seize on that opportunity is carbon engineering a canadian firm that operates a pilot project in texas designed to suck carbon emissions from the air and store them underground such a project could lure overseas customers who need to offset their carbon pollution but that s less likely if reductions inside the u s don t count in a global market would that emissions reduction be recognized in an international scheme asked ceo steve oldham and my frank answer to that is i don t know david antonioli who heads an organization that runs a carbon credit market called the verified carbon standard had a firmer answer for oldham he d be out of luck antonioli the ceo of verra said it s still uncertain whether technologies like carbon capture and storage will be a part of any united nations climate program u s negotiators at the nearly 200 nation gathering in madrid could try to shape the program s design to include them though it is not clear how much clout they will have in light of trump s pledge to exit the paris pact as soon as november 2020 rep jared huffman d calif said the trump administration s paris exit would leave u s businesses in a worse place with respect to the carbon market huffman said state department negotiators he met with on a democratic congressional delegation s trip to madrid over the weekend told him it would try to create a system that benefits u s companies but he questioned their ability to do so nobody s going to listen to you you have no leverage huffman said he told state negotiators i wish them well i think we do want a global offset and trading program that works for american businesses they re going to be a big part of it but their ability to even do that effectively has been undermined state declined response citing ongoing negotiations markets for trading greenhouse gas emissions are already a surging business more than doubling globally in 2018 to 164 billion according to analysts at the financial data firm refinitiv most of that was inside the european union s emission trading system china plans to launch its own market which would be the world s largest nearly double the size of the european market the u s also has its own regional carbon trading markets including one covering nine northeastern states and another in which california has joined forces with the canadian province of quebec supporters of pollution trading markets promote them as a business friendly way to help the earth often pointing to a successful george h w bush era program that helped slash acid rain pollution in the 1990s but republicans have more recently turned hostile to the concept former new jersey gov chris christie pulled his state out of the northeastern carbon market and trump s justice department filed a lawsuit in october calling the california quebec market unconstitutional the pullout s economic threat to u s businesses has attracted far less attention so far outside a small circle of companies it is almost not a conversation we re having said ryan martel policy director with the business sustainability advocacy group ceres if the u s is not in the paris agreement it s an open question if the u s could participate in some of these international carbon pricing programs companies like mars and the detroit electric utility dte energy which aims to be carbon neutral by 2050 have pressed their arguments through trade groups such as the international emissions trading association or the business council on sustainable energy which have met with career state department negotiators who are participating in the madrid talks both companies have also told the trump administration that leaving the paris accord would diminish growth in new industries and raise costs for u s businesses by foreclosing participation in the trading program negotiators in madrid have begun circulating language about how global carbon markets should operate though the final decisions aren t likely to be finished until the conference ends on dec 13 but people in the industry are already expressing worries trading credits created through a u n system would require sign off between buyer and seller something the u s companies might not be allowed to do if the u s isn t part of the paris agreement said dirk forrister ceo and president of the international emissions trading association whose members include chevron dow shell and bp and it s not clear that countries whose companies trade emissions credits with u s companies would be allowed to count those credits toward their paris linked greenhouse gas pledges jeopardizing the economic viability of dealing in credits to american businesses even if a future u s president rejoins the paris agreement forrister said u s companies would face higher credit costs as their entry to the markets tightens competition and drives up prices for credits existing carbon pricing systems like the one california operates with quebec would also be in limbo as the california credits would possess no value because buyers would have no assurance the u s had accurately accounted for those reductions said jeff swartz the climate policy and carbon pricing director at advisory and investment firm south pole which has worked on u n pilot programs the program itself could continue to exist but it s not clear canada could count credits quebec purchases from california toward the reduction goal it set as part of the paris agreement if the u s pulls out of paris then indeed it will be very hard for the u s to sell emission reductions to other countries for achievement of their targets under the paris agreement he said in an email swartz said it is possible however that negotiators in madrid would allow some participation from u s states or regions or that u s companies could pursue offsets through other third party carbon markets the discussions over carbon trading come as companies have increasingly supported the idea of an economy wide price on carbon rather than sector by sector greenhouse gas regulations international emissions trading association members like bp shell and the french oil and gas company total have lined up behind the climate leadership council s carbon dividend proposal which would tax emissions and issue rebates to consumers developed by republican luminaries james baker and george shultz airlines and agricultural companies have also shown an interest in the trade in credits said ceres martel and kelley kizzier associate vice president for international climate with the environmental defense fund kizzier said many of those companies haven t found enough high quality credits on the market adding that loose accounting systems can cloud whether the credits are tied to actual emissions reductions those accounting issues are among the questions that the negotiations in madrid will attempt to resolve companies set ambitious voluntary goals because they believe there is business value such as supply chain risk reduction and pr in doing so kizzier said in an email if they are not able to achieve reductions in their own business ecosystem fast enough they may need to purchase offsets to achieve their goals don t bank on the ecb saving the planet by bjarke smith meyer christine lagarde seems less keen to make big pledges on using the european central bank to fight climate change now she s actually in office the newly appointed ecb president this week began rowing back on her call to put the institution s financial firepower into greening the economy her future colleagues on the executive board are also talking down the power of what frankfurt can do for the environment the mandate of the ecb is not about climate change lagarde told eu lawmakers during her first public hearing as president on monday the central bank is primarily tasked with safeguarding price and financial stability i m fundamentally convinced that fighting climate change has to be a central plank of policy the frenchwoman told the european parliament s committee on economic and monetary affairs econ however she described the environment and other objectives as perhaps not primary ones but secondary ones back when she was a nominee seeking parliament s support lagarde suggested using the ecb s 2 7 trillion bond buying program to support green business at a september hearing before the econ committee she said the program known in central banking as quantitative easing qe could buy assets based on the taxonomy of green business just agreed by brussels her staff will very likely have informed her about potential limitations to use qe to fight climate change said ing s chief economist carsten brzeski the 63 year old s earlier climate pledges enthralled lawmakers and showed lagarde s willingness to talk on political challenges in the job her fresh comments come as the new european commission prepares to unveil its green deal package of initiatives next week despite facing a lack of funds to reduce the bloc s greenhouse emissions protesters are also descending on cop25 climate talks in madrid to urge governments to take the fight against climate change more seriously the move to reduce talk of environmentalism also comes after jens weidmann germany s influential central bank governor shot down the idea in october stating that green politicking should be left to politicians or otherwise central bank independence could be under threat i agree with mister weidmann lagarde said monday but it doesn t stop us from looking in our operations and identifying how we can be effective the ecb could instead put greater focus on climate change in its macroeconomic projections and make sure that supervised banks are taking environmental risks seriously lagarde said the ecb can also make sure its corporate pension portfolio for employees holds greener assets from dreams to reality ecb watchers and think tankers chalk up the change in tone to lagarde confronting the realities of the job and unrealistic expectations maybe people expected more and that s why she gives details that are less that what some people wanted said grégory claeys who s a research fellow at brussels think tank bruegel i never thought she would go for a fundamental change of the ecb s instruments or grand schemes secondary policies will still have some impact he said future colleagues on the ecb s six person executive board are reinforcing the pragmatic approach two current nominees to the board german professor isabel schnabel and italian central banker fabio panetta downplayed how much the ecb can do in their own parliament hearings this week eurozone leaders are set to approve their candidacies later this month i think that one has to stress that the ecb will not be the institution that is able to really deal with climate change schnabel told the econ committee on tuesday this needs to be done by the governments panetta told committee lawmakers on the same day that the sheer size of the ecb s bond buying program would swallow up the green bond market which amounts to some 250 billion market neutrality the size of the green market is not the only limitation to green qe the bond buying program is guided by the principle of market neutrality which ensures that debt from a coal mining company is treated the same as that of a wind power producer for example an upcoming review of the ecb s monetary policy toolkit could revisit that principle lagarde told lawmakers monday but she refused to predict any future changes that might come from the review which would need the support of eurozone central bankers in the ecb s governing council stan jourdan the head of campaign group positive money europe is hopeful he said in an email that the review could still tweak the ecb s investment criteria to reduce the amount of brown assets from carbon heavy companies on its portfolio that probably won t make much of a difference according to claeys of bruegel it will only add up for a few basis points on the cost for brown assets he said stressing that the onus is brussels and eu governments to introduce climate change initiatives such as a tax on carbon emissions overall might have a marginal positive effect in the fight against climate change and it will show that they care about the issue he said neste looks to new commission to give sustainable fuel industry a jump by saim saeed finnish producer neste is one of europe s largest sustainable fuel providers so far it s been a tough sell for years the european aviation industry and policymakers have paid lip service to alternative fuels heralding them as the silver bullet that will decarbonize the sector but the reality is that global uptake of sustainable aviation fuel is still negligible less than 0 1 percent of the total jet fuel consumed in 2018 according to the international energy agency we have 100 000 tons of capacity but we re not selling 100 000 tons neither do i expect that we will sell 100 000 tons in 2020 neste ceo peter vanacker told politico in a phone interview in the meantime climate activists like greta thunberg are piling huge pressure on the aviation industry to decarbonize leading to a renewed call for more sustainable fuels to be available at competitive prices but green fuel is three times more expensive than kerosene we believe governments need to create a regulatory framework that enables these renewable solutions and make them also more competitive to fossil alternatives while ensuring there is a level playing field in the aviation industry between airlines vanacker said neste uses old cooking oil and animal products as some of its raw materials but the company has gotten flak from green groups for relying on palm fatty acid distillate a residue of palm oil which they say causes deforestation and provides limited carbon savings a claim that vanacker denied why is the market for sustainable fuels not yet mature if you go back five to 10 years then it s very clear the approvals were not there yet the product was still not available to markets that s one element the approvals came in the last three years approximately it has been a journey and these things especially in aviation take time nobody wants to take a risk which is absolutely the right thing to do these approvals and qualifications were very intensive they also take resources and time it s only recently that a couple of companies have the approvals and the experience and now it s about execution if there would have been a regulatory framework five to eight years ago there was simply no product how quickly is the market growing now the approvals are there i would say still very slow we have 100 000 tons of capacity but we re not selling 100 000 tons neither do i expect that we will sell 100 000 tons in 2020 why because the acceptance is quite slow on the one hand we don t have regulatory frameworks with some exceptions in some countries if one looks at the reality the fact is that renewable jet fuel is more expensive than at current oil prices if you look at the incentive schemes in place they are not sufficient to close that gap or to make it attractive also in renewable energy directive 2 airlines and renewable fuel producers were calling for a multiplier of 2 0 it ended up at 1 2 but only 1 2 there are some incentives in place but the key question is are they going far enough is it really helping to set a level playing field on one hand and reduce the cost gap between current prices of kerosene and renewable jet fuel some of your fuel also comes from palm oil is that correct we are using all type of waste and residue we started with used cooking oil that is one stream of waste and residue it can be animal fat fish fat but also there is a residue that comes out of manufacturing of palm oil the so called fatty acid pfad if the food is landing on the ground then it decomposes during that decomposition there is this fatty acid that is being created and not used anywhere it is a residue there is not going to be palm oil produced because of pfad what proportion of your volumes come from pfad we have not disclosed the exact composition the only thing i can refer to is a minority is coming from pfad it s a competitive decision where do you stop if one asks for pfad then the next one asks for used cooking oil then which company do you source it from and so on and so on last year the vast majority of our products came from used cooking oil animal fats and all these kinds of products our renewable jet fuel is not based upon crude palm oil are you hopeful for favorable policies from the new commission if you look at what commission president ursula von der leyen said in the mission letter to the transport commissioner she clearly said increasing the uptake of sustainable and alternative transport fuels for air transport is a priority we do believe that governments do need to eventually start with a lower percentage for a blending mandate start with lower percentages at the beginning if there would be a mandate of 10 percent as of 2022 that would not be feasible it needs to be a journey a pathway just like norway has done you need to start at 0 5 percent these investments take four to five years until they start producing these are huge investments if they are going up predictably then the industry can follow and investments can be taken accordingly are you interested in power to liquid technologies there is a lot of buzz around those new technologies a bit like the internet bubble at the beginning these technologies are still small scale very expensive seven times 10 times more expensive and above the market conditions are not there but if i compare it to 10 years ago when we built the first industrial scale renewable product facility in finland the design was 200 000 tons our upcoming singapore plant is 1 3 million tons the costs have come down substantially and that s what i d expect if you have great research and development people and working closely together with partners then there will be different type of technologies in the long term this interview has been edited for length and clarity
it has been said and it has been repeated social policies have been the major victims of neoliberal globalisation during the past forty years attention for social protection and social development everywhere shifted towards poverty reduction the imf s international monetary fund and the world bank s prescriptions continuously implied cuts in social spending and targeted policies in the south while austerity was introduced in the north with negative consequences on welfare states and labour law the changing world of work and the fundamental societal changes migration ageing women on the labour market recently gave rise to some timid discussions on social protection the only real debate that took place in the north concerned the possible introduction of a universal basic income a basically liberal idea that almost inevitably would make an end to welfare states while the asian crisis of 1998 and the global financial crisis of 2008 clearly demonstrated the need for protection of people in general and workers in particular the resistance that existed within several un organisations towards the poverty focus of the bretton woods organisations gained momentum and slowly the imf and the world bank adopted a more open attitude agreeing with some of the basic ideas of the ilo international labour organisation unicef the un s fund for children unrisd research institute on social development and undesa department on economic and social affairs however the road is bumpy and while the ilo and the world bank now cooperate in a project for universal social protection several questions remain on if and how and why the world bank is changing its discourse and its practices in a recent report the world bank proposes a new social contract this article tries to find out what the world bank is really up to and whether the new approach can make a positive end to the neoliberal era a bit of history when in 1990 after ten years of structural adjustment the world bank proposed to make poverty reduction the main objective of all development policies the first reactions were very positive however it soon became clear that this poverty focus did not in any way change the structural adjustment policies and that moreover the world bank and undp united nations development programme explicitly condemned social security policies beyond poverty reduction furthermore the comprehensive action programmes that were adopted at a whole series of un world conferences on the environment on human rights on women social development habitat population were swept away in 2000 by a very short list of eight millennium development goals mdgs the objective was to reduce extreme poverty by half between 1990 and 2015 an objective that was globally met thanks to china and india but that regionally fell short of its stated aim the mdg s were replaced in 2015 by the sustainable development goals sdgs with a broader ambition but with a limited potential of being achieved by 2030 in the meantime all un organisations worked on programmes of social protection and even inequality the world bank published a first proposal for social protection in 2000 and called it risk management the research department of the imf examined the impact of labour market institutions tax systems and even neoliberalism noting it might have had negative consequences in terms of inequality at the ilo the eight major international conventions on labour were bundled as core labour standards in 1998 a programme of decent work was adopted as from 1999 an independent report on the social dimension of globalisation was written in 2005 a declaration on social justice was adopted in 2008 and in 2012 a recommendation on social protection floors was welcomed it was minimal and did raise some important questions but it was clearly a step in the right direction in 2013 the world bank published its world development report on jobs with some innovative ideas that showed a willingness and at the same time a reluctance to move forward in a document of 2012 it had added labour to its new strategy of sharing prosperity employment laws are needed to protect workers from arbitrary or unfair treatment it said it claimed its indicators are consistent with ilo conventions though they do not cover its core labour standards but upholding core labour standards is central to protecting workers and improving their productivity while this was a huge step forward for the world bank it wanted to strike the right balance between protection and competitiveness it was one of the first texts in which the world bank implicitly accepted trade unions and collective bargaining in the world development report 2013 on jobs it is said that collective bargaining does not have a major impact as well as that there is little evidence on the impact of trade unions though it also added that there is no consensus on what the content of labour policies should be as for the imf it started to question its own policies and its possible role in the promotion of social protection in a report of its independent evaluation office this report of 2017 noted that the imf has moved beyond its traditional fiscal centric approach to recognize that social protection can also be macro critical for broader reasons including social and political stability concerns however the imf warns that it will not follow the rights based and universal approach of the ilo the imf and the ilo staff do not speak the same language if some social policy is accepted today by the imf it is only to the extent that it contributes to stability and that it avoids social protest not scaring the public and to avoid reputational risk if it is now concerned about inequality it is because its research department pointed out that it hampers growth the imf in the same way as the world bank only agrees with targeted policies to the poor and insists continuously on better targeting even if imf studies speak about the possible role of trade unions and of taxes redistribution is not on the agenda in its 2019 strategy for social spending the imf notes that in a significant number of instances social spending decreased in program countries there is a demand for a clear strategy that would provide guidance on a more effective imf engagement on social spending issues more particularly on specific areas such as pensions reform minimum wages or unemployment insurance also reporting on a meeting on this topic it is said that the imf should not take a leading role on this and that social protection should never become a condition for help finally the 2019 world development report of the world bank on the changing world of work gives more clarity on the ideas already launched in 2013 and a first proposal for a comprehensive social protection plan these ideas are now coherently presented in a white paper on social protection or better risk sharing policies with a full programme of what it might become in the future it is the document that will be analysed below while this slow but clear evolution of the financial organisations should be welcomed it also contains some worrying ideas new proposals what is it the world bank wants us to think about first of all what we are talking about is a white paper its objectives are to scrutinize the relevance and effects of prevailing risk sharing policies in low and middle income countries to take account of how global drivers of disruption shape and diversify the ways in which people work in light of this diversity to propose alternative and more relevant risk sharing policies and ways to augment and improve current policies to make them more relevant and responsive to peoples needs and to map a reasonable transition path from the current policy approach to an alternative approach that substantially extends protection to a greater portion of working people and their families this volume is a contribution to the broader global discussion of the changing nature of work and how policy can shape its implications for the well being of people the world bank now prefers to speak of risk sharing instead of social protection probably because it wants to focus on the insurance idea and discard ideas about redistribution and indeed also on protection of people itself it is a purely economic approach with an insurance logic it speaks of risk sharing policies broadly in reference to the set of institutions regulations and interventions that societies put in place to help households manage shocks to their livelihoods these policies include formal rules and structures that regulate market interactions worker protections and other labour market institutions and instruments that help people pool risks social assistance and social insurance save and insure affordably and effectively mandatory and incentivized individual savings and other financial instruments and recover from losses in the wake of shocks to their livelihoods active reemployment measures the programme consists of four packages the most important part for the world bank and in fact the bulk of what this document is about is a guaranteed minimum of transfers and subsidized premiums this is what formerly was called poverty reduction but has now become a poverty prevention package with a minimum income and minimum insurances in the second circle is what is usually called social insurance or social security that is obligatory contributions to a risk sharing pool however the world bank remains strongly against obligatory contributions burdening the wage bill and hopes to minimize them thanks to the first guaranteed minimum package and a consequential reduction of the redistribution element this second layer is purely for consumption smoothing and premium subsidies can be paid out of the general budget it becomes then a mandated and individually financed insurance system in the third circle are the privately financed systems for which governments can organize some nudges since too many people do not feel inclined to buy insurances the fourth circle is purely voluntary and privately funded how each segment of the proposed package is financed matters for the efficiency and effectiveness of risk sharing a key principle shaping the package is that poverty prevention and redistribution objectives that is vertical redistribution should be pursued transparently with instruments financed from broad based taxes whereas statutory contributions should be reserved to finance consumption smoothing instruments with actuarially fair parameters that is horizontal redistribution interestingly for the guaranteed minimum package the world bank thinks of a possible version of a universal basic income though tapered that is limited to the lowest incomes and decreasing with the rise of incomes and consumption negative income taxes are also examined while another intermediate option is a smaller guaranteed minimum supplemented with age categorical transfers such as a child allowance or a cash transfer for the elderly or combined with an earned income tax credit for low income workers above the eligibility threshold the common essential feature of all these alternatives is that the minimum guarantee is financed from the largest available risk pool the national budget often supplemented with international sources of aid and development financing and is available when and where required by consolidating poverty prevention and any other redistributive objectives in the core of the policy package of protection governments can increase coherence and reduce perverse incentives and evasion a pervasive problem in prevailing social protection systems is the segmentation and lack of coherence between social assistance and the redistributive elements of employment based contributory social insurance programs as mentioned previously the pursuit of redistribution objectives vertical income redistribution as well as horizontal risk redistribution is implicitly combined in the design of most contributory social insurance arrangements however the mingling of policy objectives is often done with little reference to other income transfer programs this lack of coherence can distort individuals labour supply decisions increase the costs to employers of making formal employment offers and ultimately result in inequitable outcomes greater coherence can be achieved by tapering subsidies for insurance premiums as with the tapered guaranteed minimum income in the lexicon we have introduced in this chapter a ubi or tubi tapered universal basic income would be combined with a usi or tusi tapered social insurance given their demonstrated higher impact on poverty the combination of a tubi and a tusi is likely to be superior where governments administrative and implementation capacities allow them to observe people s means the tapered subsidy for risk pooling premiums could purchase contingent coverage for longevity health and long unemployment spells to be broadly applicable in a diverse set of countries our proposal gives greater weight to policy objectives than to specific instruments or programs for example to provide effective and affordable coverage the core of the package includes two indispensable components of public risk sharing policy transfers to prevent poverty and subsidies to cover the premiums for contingent coverage of catastrophic losses both components draw resources from the national general expenditure budget as for labour markets the world bank works with a similar four circle model labour policies are also risk sharing policies and thus according to the world bank labour market policies just like social assistance and insurance provide tools and protections that help workers and their families prevent save and pool to mitigate the risks of losses and to cope better in the wake of a shock the core of this package is aimed at preventing abusive exploitation it has to be financed from general revenues as it is for all people who work whatever their status it also should increase workers voices but it is mainly to enforce core labour standards provide safeguards on freedoms of association and collective action intermediation and employment assistance beyond this there needs to be mandated nudged and fully voluntary policies that point to the responsibilities of workers and employers new and positive prevention universalism and the state a first absolute new idea that has to be mentioned from the outset is poverty prevention in the past prevention was said to be impossible risks and shocks occurred and all that people households and governments could do was to cope with them or to mitigate their consequences it gives the impression that the new policy approach of the world bank is less about poverty than about preventing this poverty with a broad set of policies this certainly is a very positive step since social protection can indeed stop the impoverishment processes if intervention with income support and social services happen before people effectively are rendered poor a second idea that is clarified in this document is universalism and it even gets something like a definition as universality as with the public policy and provision of health care and education universality does not necessarily mean that every person will receive a payout in a given period or equally from each part of the package the essential inalienable meaning of universality in many policy arenas is that a benefit or service is available when and where it is needed to all citizens and in many cases even to all residents many benefits and services will not be needed by many people in a given period or even at all or people might choose to forgo receipt of goods or services to which they are entitled in a discussion of risk sharing policy what is vital is the universality of entitlement to coverage of impoverishing losses those who do not suffer such losses may be covered by the guarantee but never receive a payout many questions were raised when the world bank and the ilo signed a joint statement in 2015 on the universality of social protection since the 2000s universality has re entered the development agenda first it was education universal primary education became a millennium development goal in 2000 then it was health in december 2013 the world bank and who committed to universal health coverage now it is time for universal social protection for the world bank and the ilo universal social protection refers to the integrated set of policies designed to ensure income security and support to all people across the life cycle paying particular attention to the poor and the vulnerable anyone who needs social protection should be able to access it however the world bank did not develop a new practice yet and it looks as if it might not happen soon in the examples given in 2016 of 23 country cases the universalism was each time limited to just one sector child benefits pensions or maternity protection these are certainly positive steps but one can hardly call them universal social protection one could expect that at least the different elements of the ilo s social protection floors are all included but they are not universalism remains an aspirational objective in practice then nothing much is changing the imf the world bank s sister organisation continues till today to impose targeting in social spending in the independent evaluation report of the imf on social protection it is noted that the imf consistently favoured targeted means tested benefits over universal child money entitlement in a report on loan conditionality the ong eurodad also points to systematically targeting of social spending and the un special rapporteur on extreme poverty did the same the ilo itself refers to the case of mongolia which had introduced a universal child benefit whereas the imf insisted on strengthening and better targeting of social safety nets in fact what the world bank is promoting is a progressive universalism first simply striving for universality does not necessarily make the poorest better off as countries expand social protection those at the bottom of the distribution should benefit before or at least at the same time as others in society this concept is encapsulated in the notion of progressive universalism in other words target the poor later if possible you might or not expand the programmes a third important novelty in this document is the role of the state while in the past at the peak of the neoliberal wave states were said to be only responsible for help to the extremely poor people while all those above the poverty line were recommended to buy an insurance on the market now states are said to be responsible for managing this market given the various failures of product and factor markets and the markets for risk in particular it is no longer controversial for the state to intervene to augment people s options for managing shocks to their livelihoods indeed it has become widely accepted in policy circles that risk sharing interventions contribute to the fight against poverty and to greater equity second by helping to prevent vulnerable people from falling into poverty and prevent people in the poorest households from falling deeper into poverty risk sharing interventions can dramatically reduce the number of poor and the likelihood that poverty will carry forward from one generation to the next third risk sharing policies can make economic growth more equitable by safeguarding the population s human and physical capital and ensuring that all enterprising people are able to grasp economic opportunities for advancement but if the state intervenes with policy instruments designed for a different context and to cover forms of employment held by only a few people its interventions will lack relevance at best and become distortive and regressive at worst in other words and once again nothing much might have changed the state has to intervene to help the poor but should not go beyond these three apparently new ideas have to be welcomed though taking a closer look at them they may not bring about real change in world bank policies universalism has to be progressive attention should first go to the poor the state has to intervene but not too much poverty prevention is an excellent idea but it will only be effective if policies do also focus on non poor people in the first place which does not seem to be the case points of discussion the world bank did not change its position relative to traditional elements of labour market policies core labour standards are now accepted but one should avoid regulatory extremes this means the world bank is not in favour of minimum wages that risk to be distortionary and redistributive severance pays or unemployment benefits can be inefficient and unreliable and can be replaced by mandatory saving accounts flexible jobs are better than no jobs so labour contracts should not be regulated fixed working time with possible overtime to be paid is not recommended the world bank also questions tripartite institutions workers need to have a voice but when a majority of them work outside the formal sector this can be problematic therefore digital tools might help to file complaints and requests to convert demands in petitions etc trade unions have played an important role according to the world bank but again they are less important for non formal workers or the self employed tripartite institutions then cannot be sufficient anymore traditional labour unions have tried to exercise a monopoly in representing working people in dialogue with the government and employers associations and have failed to represent the views of many who do not work in dependent wage or salaried employment relationships an analogous concern can be raised about employers associations and their shortcomings in representing small businesses or the self employed more representative structures are essential to give working people a voice and to hold all market actors accountable in other words labour unions are not representative enough and the deals they may succeed to strike for their members often come at the expense of non organised labour the same is true of employer and professional associations this observation suggests a need for revitalized efforts to counter the concentration of market power and new institutions to give working people greater voice this volume argues for changes to the institutions of social dialogue that would make them more representative of a diverse and diversifying world of work but this agenda also includes mechanisms to increase the influence of workers especially those in the informal sector who are often not organized and whose voices are not always heard in policy debates the government s role in this context is to ensure that all working people including those in the informal economy are represented in the social dialogue that informs and shapes labour policy the world bank then is not against workers voice not against social dialogue not against trade unions and tripartite relationships but all these mechanisms seem to be insufficient and can better be replaced by totally new ones it suggests it might be better to look for formulas of shared ownership bringing shared ownership structures more boldly into the mainstream and broadening profit sharing practices beyond niches of high income economies would also help address concerns about income distribution and inequality however the new enthusiasm for shared ownership models has recently veered to the extremes of coercion and expropriation which raises the risk that these models will become yet another state mandate that firms will seek to avoid and in low and middle income countries an additional implicit tax on firms that would otherwise grow to more productive scale some proposals for true industrial democracy challenge bedrock principles of liberal democratic market capitalism and protections of property rights it seems as if there is another delicate balance to take care of but at any rate power relations being what they are within large companies without a true industrial democracy workers will always be on the losing end all these proposals are built on the argument that a country s public finance system is the largest most effective and efficient risk pool that the government can offer to households to redistribute risks manage uncertainty and pursue greater equity although larger risk pools with regional and even global breadth are increasingly available in most contexts a country s public finance system will remain the largest and most efficient mechanism for pooling risks and managing uncertainty in the approach proposed in chapter 3 statutory employer and worker contributions have an important role but this role is more limited than the role they are assigned in prevailing employment based contributory social insurance the so called bismarckian approach to risk sharing that prevails in many countries and which is still being considered in several countries is to use statutory employer and worker contributions and the benefits they nominally finance as an instrument for vertical and horizontal redistribution that is to prevent poverty and redistribute wealth within and between generations as well as to redistribute exposure to risks and uncertainty we argue that for the purposes of poverty prevention and other wealth redistribution objectives the traditional approach offers households a relatively inefficient and ineffective instrument where and when the superior alternative of a larger risk pool financed with a range of tax instruments with a much broader base is available this is a very clear statement and constitutes the heart of all world bank s proposals together with the focus on the poor now the not to be rendered poor people this is what the social contract is about the dividing line between social insurance and social assistance has to disappear one should avoid regulatory extremes there are questions to be raised on tripartism one should broaden the social dialogue and pay all risk sharing policies for those non rendered poor by taxes instead of workers and employers contributions some tentative conclusions at this point it is possible to draw some conclusions first of all the labour market regulations the world bank has in mind are not meant to create better labour markets with more security and protection for workers in order to cover all workers the world bank in fact proposes to cancel all existing regulations and start anew trade unions can continue to work and organize can continue with collective bargaining but in fact their power will be strongly eroded by the new world of work unless they succeed in organizing all non organized workers an option the world bank does not even consider it is true that in a highly competitive labour market where companies prefer zero hour contracts or self employed people with low wages or retributions it is highly improbable since too many people have to struggle to survive secondly the world bank does not propose to re regulate the labour market and try to formalize workers or fight the current precariousness induced by the gig economy the labour market is what it is decided by big and small corporations we should not try to change it but adapt to this changing world standard labour contracts are not coming back according to the world bank the time we thought people and societies could shape the world they live in is over robust social protection instruments with broad coverage would relieve much of the social and political upward pressures on the statutory minimum wage this means that social risk policies replace demands for higher wages and better working conditions it means governments have to come in where employers fall out markets decide on the reality of workers thirdly the contributory system that made workers and employers the owners of social protection systems is bound to disappear this will inevitably take away power from workers and make them entirely dependent on states governments and budgets the second layer of what the world bank proposes and which should in fact come down to current mandatory contributions system is reduced to its minimum and is only meant for consumption smoothing not for redistribution which is as in the past of bretton woods institutions largely forgotten as was noted already in a comment on the draft world development report of 2019 to separate social protection from work is a very dangerous road to go workers will not have to address their demands to their bosses but to their governments that in today s authoritarian and austeritarian regimes dispose of strong repressive mechanisms fourthly the guaranteed minimum package for people not rendered poor sounds very positive but again one can have doubts about how sufficient this will be to effectively prevent poverty the proposed tubi mechanism is not very generous it only covers 5 of average per capita income or consumption furthermore it is not meant as a substitute for income but to complement it in other words without high enough minimum wages companies may go far below the poverty lines and governments will complement workers incomes this is precisely the speenhamland system so adequately described by karl polanyi and responsible for hindering the emergence of labour markets with trade unions and workers demands this basic layer becomes in fact a comprehensive insurance assistance with minimal solidarity and redistribution fifthly while the role given to governments sounds positive in fact it does not de privatise insurance and other mechanisms on the contrary governments may give subsidies for insurance premiums and nudge people to buy private insurances labour market mechanisms such as for training or employment assistance can be totally private governments will pay governments should become purchasers rather than providers of services one can doubt on the efficiency of these new rules sixthly the world bank rightly denounces the limited tax contributions of corporations and welcomes the international initiatives against tax havens and other tax avoiding mechanisms however this is not within its mandate and it is wishful thinking that these solutions will be put into place tomorrow finally needless to say and contrary to the ilo the world bank does not speak about human rights it may be another reason for abandoning the concept of social protection which is mentioned in the universal declaration on human rights risk sharing policies are not about protecting people against the whims of the market it is about creating and promoting markets for insurance health and education it is about promoting growth and productivity it is about consumption smoothing it is about pushing all people on the labour market it is about risks and shocks that people may have to cope with without catastrophic consequences it is about subsidizing basic social security the objective of this whole exercise then is not social justice it is not social citizenship is not protection of people against the whims of the market once again what one sees is that many responsibilities of corporations are shifted towards governments who will use citizens tax money to pay for a guaranteed minimum even if the world bank and the ilo are together in an exercise for universalism the objectives of both organisations are very different there is no fundamental re thinking of its old ideas of the past thirty years there is only a re ordening using some of the more attractive concepts from the ilo poverty now becomes a state of high frequency losses a new social contract the idea of a new social contract is not elaborated in this document it is just confirmed and was fully explained in the world development report of 2019 it should be clear by now that what the world bank is talking about is not a real social contract the result of a public and democratic debate between citizens their organisations and governments it is not about the relationships between society markets and the state it is not about shaping and regulating markets labour relations and social protection with rights and duties for all what it is about is a set of rules for fragmented arrangements such as child care or pensions or basic literacy and numeracy it can also include elements of social protection in other words it is about specific objectives for specific policies this was certainly not how the social contracts in western europe after the second world war were understood in fact the world bank did not change its basic philosophy it has adapted its discourse it uses the concepts en vogue when they are without risk its changes its vocabulary when it is needed to avoid the traps of more solidarity and redistribution its basic ideas remain the same as in 1990 target the poor even if governments can help to allow corporations and workers to do more even nudge and make a small part of contributions mandatory do away with labour market regulations there is a more important role for governments but the major neoliberal achievement of taking the whole economy and the major objective of fiscal balance out of democratic debate remains untouched people just have to adapt markets reign this is indeed a discourse for human capitalists for those who consider people to be a capital that has to produce a return for the education they get that have to be active on the labour market that have to optimize their productivity that have to be available for all the changes occurring on markets and that for this special reason need a basic risk sharing insurance this philosophy is very different indeed from what then ilo is working with where then do we stand many of the ideas mentioned and suggested in this white paper are already applied in several countries including advanced economies but they are brought together in a coherent way in order to look like a new programme this is not only useful for the low and middle income countries this report is meant for but also for rich countries that want to reduce or get rid of their existing welfare states as claus offe rightly analysed some decades ago capitalism does not want welfare states but at the same time it knows very well that it cannot survive without them what the world bank is doing is making a synthesis of these elements the system needs to sustain itself abandoning all the rest its risk sharing does offer basic protection to people but is mainly aimed at good functioning markets this report is part of a global discourse it is not reality but it helps to shape the global thinking on social policies as the world bank and other international institutions and meetings have been doing these past decades there is then no reason to panic if only there was an alternative discourse with better ideas on what social protection could be or become but there is not today the debate on the future of social protection is entirely in the hands of till now neoliberal and right wing forces joseph stiglitz and josé antonio ocampo can be considered to be on the margins of the dominant system but they are economists with a long experience of work with the international organisations when the economist puts universal health care on its cover it does not mean to promote jeremy corbyn as for the oecd it also promotes a purely economic perspective on social policies progressive alternatives are missing for the moderate left the existing international alternatives of social protection floors and sustainable development goals are more than enough however without strong social struggles they may end up in the world bank net at a moment that all over the world people are claiming the streets demanding social justice and at twenty years after the battle of seattle or the emergence of the alter globalist movement comprehensive thinking on how social justice can be achieved is almost totally lacking within progressive political forces surely there is quiet some literature on different fragmented elements of social justice and social protection from health care to education to housing and obviously climate but very few authors have taken it upon themselves to try and make a concrete and comprehensive proposal on where developing countries should be heading to or how the western welfare states should be modified if a new social contract is what is now being offered should not progressive forces be their main author trying to achieve global convergence trying to help the millions of desperate young people on the streets of our cities climate justice rightly has become the top priority of all movements but all know that environmental justice has to go hand in hand with social justice how i propose to look at the potential of a concept like social commons and to make from social protection a tool for systemic change what neoliberalism is about and hence also these world bank proposals is the erosion of democracy it is about working and doing within the framework of a system that defines its own immutable rules it is not about shaping our own world should we not try to do just that francine mestrum phd global justice brussels mexico city notes for

the democratic party and its liberal supporters are perplexed they presented hours of evidence of an impeachable offense although they studiously avoided charging donald trump with impeachable offenses also carried out by democratic presidents including the continuation or expansion of presidential wars not declared by congress exercising line item veto power playing prosecutor judge jury and executioner to kill individuals including u s citizens anywhere on the planet violating due process and misusing executive orders because civics is no longer taught in most american schools they devoted a day to constitutional scholars who provided the civics 101 case for impeachment the liberal press cheerleading the impeachment process saturated the media landscape with live coverage interminable analysis constant character assassination of trump and giddy speculation and yet it has made no difference public opinion remains largely unaffected perhaps supporters of impeachment argue they failed to adopt the right technique perhaps journalists by giving voice to opponents of impeachment who do indeed live in a world not based in fact created a false equivalency between truth and lies maybe as bill grueskin a professor at the columbia university journalism school writes impeachment advocates should spend 1 million to produce a kind of movie trailer for all those who did not sit through the hours of hearings to boil down the essentials of the film and provide a quick but intense insight into the characters setting the scene with vivid imagery to entice people to come back to the theatre a month later for the full movie or perhaps they need to keep pounding away at trump until his walls of support crumble the liberal class and the democratic party leadership have failed even after their defeat in the 2016 presidential election to understand that they along with the traditional republican elites have squandered their credibility no one believes them and no one should they squandered their credibility by promising that the north american free trade agreement nafta would as claimed by president bill clinton create 200 000 new well paying jobs per year instead several million jobs were lost they squandered it by allowing corporations to move production overseas and hire foreign workers at daily wages that did not equal what a u s unionized worker made in an hour a situation that obliterated the bargaining power of the american working class they squandered it by allowing corporations to use the threat of offshoring production to destroy unions suppress wages extract draconian concessions and push millions of workers into the temp and gig economies where there are no benefits or job security and pay is 60 or less of what a full time employee in the regular economy receives they squandered it by forcing working men and women to take two or three jobs to support a family jacking up household debt to 13 95 trillion they squandered it by redirecting wealth upward so that during the clinton administration alone 45 percent of all income growth went to the wealthiest 1 they squandered it by wiping out small farmers in mexico driving some 3 million of them off their lands and forcing many to migrate in desperation to the united states a human tide that saw the u s right wing and president trump direct mounting rage toward immigrants they squandered it by turning our great cities into urban wastelands they squandered it by slashing welfare and social service programs they squandered it by supporting endless futile wars that have an overall price tag of between 5 trillion and 7 trillion they squandered it by setting up a surveillance system to spy on every american and then lying about it they squandered it by catering to the big banks and gutting financial regulations precipitating the 2008 economic meltdown they squandered it by looting the u s treasury to bail out banks and financial firms guilty of massive financial crimes ordering the federal reserve to hand over an estimated 29 trillion to the global financiers responsible for the crash they squandered it by not using this staggering sum instead to provide free college tuition to every student or universal health care repair our crumbling infrastructure transition to clean energy forgive student debt raise wages bail out underwater homeowners form public banks to foster investments in our communities at low interest rates provide a guaranteed minimum income and organize a massive jobs program for the unemployed and underemployed whose ranks are at least double official statistics they squandered it by cutting child assistance programs most drastically during the clinton administration resulting in 16 million children going to bed hungry every night they squandered it by leaving over half a million americans homeless and on the streets on any given day they squandered it by passing laws that keep students burdened by massive college loan debt that has climbed to 1 4 trillion debt they cannot free themselves from even if they declare bankruptcy they squandered it by militarizing police and building the world s largest system of mass incarceration one with 25 of the world s prison population they squandered it by revoking due process and habeas corpus they squandered it by passing massive tax cuts for the rich and for corporations many of which such as amazon pay no federal income tax ballooning the federal deficit now at 779 billion and climbing they squandered it by privatizing everything from intelligence gathering to public education to swell corporate bank accounts at taxpayer expense they squandered it by permitting corporate money an estimated 9 9 billion will be spent this presidential election cycle on political advertising to buy politicians in a form of legalized bribery that sees corporate lobbyists write legislation and create laws they squandered it by doing nothing to halt the looming ecocide the problem is not messaging the problem is the messenger the mortal wounds inflicted on our democratic institutions are bipartisan the traditional republican elites are as hated as the democratic elites trump is vile imbecilic corrupt and incompetent but for a largely white working class cast aside by austerity and neoliberalism he at least taunts the elites who destroyed their communities and their lives the shakedown that trump clumsily attempted to orchestrate against the president of ukraine in the hope of discrediting joe biden a potential rival in the 2020 presidential election pales beside the shakedown orchestrated by the elites who rule over america s working men and women this shakedown took from those workers their hope and more ominously their hope for their children it took from them security and a sense of place and dignity it took from them a voice in how they were governed it took from them their country and handed it to a cabal of global corporatists who intend to turn them into serfs this shakedown plunged millions into despair it led many to self destructive opioid alcohol drug and gambling addictions it led to increases in suicide mass shootings and hate crimes this shakedown led to bizarre conspiracy theories and fabrications peddled by a neofascist right wing deceptions bolstered by the lies told by those tasked with keeping the society rooted in truth and verifiable fact this shakedown led to the end of the rule of law and the destruction of democratic institutions that if they had continued to function could have prevented the rise to power of a demagogue such as trump there is zero chance trump will be removed from office in a trial in the senate the democratic party elites have admitted as much they carried out they argue their civic and constitutional duty but here again they lie they picked out what was convenient to impeach trump and left untouched the rotten system they helped create the divisions among americans will only widen the hatreds will only grow and tyranny will wrap its deadly tentacles around our throats

may seem we re already into the holiday season and attention is shifting to office parties and shopping there is no shortage of talking points next week even outside of the uk trade talks between the

economies and more are expected over the weekend uk election we ve entered the final week of the election campaign and traders are starting to feel a little overconfident whether that s the 10 point margin that the conservatives hold in the polls that would deliver a majority government or donald trump s visit ending without catastrophe confidence is creeping in if we hadn t been in this position before it may be understandable but this premature confidence has been punished before maybe this time they ve got it right there s obviously a risk that they ll be burned again the weekend is always a risky time for uk politics when we re this close to such an incredibly decisive day the prime ministerial debate on friday night is the first chance of the weekend for both to take aim at each other it could be fierce as the clock ticks down to election day with johnson s only aim to come out unscathed having already avoided numerous events including being questions by bbc s andrew neil he may face a number of uncomfortable questions us the biggest risk to the us stock market remains a progressive president currently polls are suggesting that seems to be very unlikely the current focus with us politics remains the impeachment process speaker nancy pelosi seems likely to get the ball going in the house but the senate firmly remains supportive of the president the risks of impeachment getting passed the senate are slim to none hong kong protests have subsided in hong kong this week with the government announcing more spending as the economy is now in a deep recession a march is planned for saturday though and although planned to be peaceful tensions could escalate major risks are limited with the us china interim trade agreement seemingly in the final strait protests turning violent could weigh on the hang seng to start the week china protests have subsided in hong kong this week with the government announcing more spending as the economy is now in a deep recession a march is planned for saturday though and although planned to be peaceful tensions could escalate india rbi did not cut rates as expected today its hand is stayed by an ugly stagflation mix growth revised lower from 6 to 5 and inflation revised higher for q4 2019 and q1 2020 the non performing loans issue across the non bank and official financial sectors appears to be deepening the inr is lower and indian bond yields are higher today the sensex has fallen the sell off could deepen next week especially if the us and china fail to agree a trade deal australia the rba held rates with a dovish outlook australia trade surplus fell more than expected led by mineral resource no visibility on fiscal stimulus by the federal government it appears that most sectors of the australian economy are now in a recession or slowing any change in the status of trade negotiations would be detrimental to local equities and the aussie dollar any discussion on qe at the rba meeting could hurt the local dollar latam politics protests in latin america have put pressure on most economies either for the presence of social movements within its borders or for the threat that one could break out soon risk appetite has been positive this week and for the most part has ignored protest movements in the second part of the week trade optimism could soon turn into pessimism and with it the investors could once again look at political instability as a big factor driving risk aversion in the region market usd the dollar will remain sensitive to trade updates this week but also see a strong focus on with key rate decisions the greenback has fallen against most of its trading partners and we could see further weakness if we see material weakness to the us economy the fed has done a very good job in signaling they are on hold until any material changes to the outlook the fed is still evaluating what to do regarding the repo market upheaval and we could get an incremental update on the standing repo facility while the fed meeting could be a non event on wednesday we could see the ecb decision see further momentum grow for calls to move away from negative interest rates we are one tweet away from a complete collapse in the us china trade war the latest uncertainty on how hong kong will impact trade negotiations and whether we will see a meaningful rollback with tariffs will determine how much risk appetite we have for global indexes the dollar will remain a key safe haven trade that could see it outperform to the euro and commodity currencies mexican peso the mexican peso has been on an upwards trajectory since trade hopes lifted risk appetite the peso has appreciated more than one percent against the dollar even as the nfp returned some of its strength to the greenback but it was too late to make a difference even if the fed does not cut for a fourth time in december and the mexican central bank does so in the middle of the month the rate differential still favours the peso contagion risk in mexico is low given political stability and a government that after a year in power is coming around to the idea of more private investment the usmca ratification is advancing at a slow rate but it keeps moving forward with the biggest risk not getting it done this year a usmca ratification on an election year would not be impossible but it would get tougher as it would be heavily politicized to further divide voters the currency pair is trading at 19 33 and could break under 19 30 although as the trading session approaches the end investors could try to hedge their dollar positions as much as possible before going into the weekend the liquidity of the peso makes it a vehicle for speculators that want to short the region as colombians took to the streets today to protest labor reforms the precedent set by ecuador bolivia and chile will not be lost in the market as political instability will keep downward pressure on latam markets oil oil prices are up more than 15 since early october buoyed in recent days by efforts by opec and its allies or opec as they ve become known to further rebalance the market after years of oversupply production cuts were increased to 1 7 million barrels per day from 1 5 million previously but concerns about its effectiveness and compliance with the cuts are stopping traders getting carried away still price is continuing to grind higher with brent and wti trading at near three month highs the trade war is the big risk for oil prices in the near term both the us and china want us to believe a phase one deal is close but this was meant to be signed in chile a month ago with 15 december tariff deadline approaching though a sense of urgency may materialize and a deal could well give oil another kick higher gold the us jobs report on friday took the wind out of the sails of gold bulls just as they were growing in confidence the yellow metal has struggled at 1 480 both when trading above this level and below and this time it was no different a few days of pressure was obliterated by a stellar us jobs report after which markets went into risk on mode and gold headed south gold remains in consolidation a little longer with 1 440 1 450 below now key two central bank meetings next week including the fed should be the key events for gold but recent easing by both mean policy makers are already in holiday mode the trade war remains the final thing that could really shake things up for gold bitcoin bitcoin has entered consolidation mode again between 7 000 and 8 000 this comes after a tough period for the cryptocurrency after chinese authorities appeared to once again turn their back on them while they re fond of the technology it s likely they re not too thrilled with the idea of ceding control that s hardly surprising cryptocurrencies and volatility go hand in hand we may be in a period of consolidation but that s unlikely to last the worst of the decline may be over for now but when it comes to bitcoin no one can really say so with any real confidence

per share in decreased by 1 5 underperforming the benchmark index which was flat over the same period frontier and emerging market volatility has been a feature during the twelve months under review with fears of slowing global growth and us china trade conflict negatively impacting both frontier and developed markets more recently the us china trade tensions appear to have abated somewhat with a deal to roll back the tit for tat trade tariffs implemented earlier in the year agreed in principle at least all performance figures are stated on a us dollars with dividends reinvested a significant sell off in frontier market assets occurred in q4 2018 however markets gained some ground back in q1 2019 country specific political uncertainty also negatively impacted the performance of some of the portfolio s larger exposures during the period most notably in argentina where the outcome of the presidential elections saw the local market fall substantially a more detailed commentary on the performance and positioning of the portfolio the key contributors and detractors to overall investment performance during the period and the portfolio managers view on the outlook for frontier markets are given in their report which follows over the longer term your company has generated a total return of 46 5 since launch in 2010 comparing favourably to an increase of 35 8 for the benchmark index over the same period returns are higher for sterling based investors given the depreciation of the pound with a sterling equivalent nav total return of 84 9 since launch compared with the return on the benchmark index in sterling terms of 71 8 over the same period revenue return and dividends the company s revenue return per share for the year amounted to 8 24 cents 2018 10 13 cents the directors are recommending the payment of a final dividend of 4 75 cents per ordinary share 2018 4 40 cents in respect of the year ended 30 september 2019 together with the interim dividend of 3 00 cents per share 2018 3 00 cents this represents a total of 7 75 cents per share 2018 8 40 cents an increase of 4 7 over total dividends excluding special dividends paid in the previous year subject to shareholder approval this dividend will be paid on 7 february 2020 to shareholders on the register of members at close of business on 3 january 2020 the ex dividend date will be 2 january 2020 the company does not have a policy of actively targeting income nevertheless this return represents an attractive yield of 4 8 the company has grown its dividend every year since launch and we believe this is an attractive element of the total return generated for shareholders particularly given the low returns being offered by traditional sources of income c share issue following shareholder approval in a general meeting the company issued 44 927 580 c shares with a nominal value of 10 cents each at a price of 1 00 per share on 27 november 2018 the majority of which were issued in

executive directors the board has a succession plan in place which ensures that a suitable balance of skills knowledge experience independence and diversity is achieved to enable the board to effectively discharge its duties having served on the board since july 2011 mr murray will be retiring at the forthcoming agm and will therefore cease to be a director of the company from its conclusion on behalf of the board i would like to take this opportunity to thank mr murray for his invaluable contribution to the long term success of the company during his tenure we wish him well for the future as part of its succession planning arrangements the board commenced a search during the year to identify a new director to join the board assisted by a third party recruitment firm following a detailed evaluation of each of the candidates the board selected mrs katrina hart who was subsequently appointed with effect from 1 october 2019 katrina brings a wealth of financial sector experience and expertise both complementing and enhancing the skills and experience of the existing board further information on katrina and all of the directors can be found in their biographies in

the financial reporting council frc as being appropriate for investment companies the aic code applies to accounting periods beginning on or after 1 january 2019 the board has determined that effective from the company s new financial year it will comply with the recommendations of the 2019 aic code this in most material respects is the same as the frc code save that there is greater flexibility regarding the tenure of office of the chairman outlook in a world where growth looks challenged and sources of yield are increasingly scarce our investment universe stands out frontier markets remain the fastest growing countries in the world as demonstrated by the dividends paid by the company our holdings generate an attractive yield the markets have de rated meaningfully over the last couple of years enabling the managers to find companies with strong earnings growth profiles trading on very attractive valuations as such the board believes that frontier markets remain an attractive proposition for the medium to long term investor the board believes that the company s broadened investable universe provides the investment managers with the flexibility to adjust the portfolio s geographic exposure to take advantage of opportunities across frontier markets annual general meeting the agm of the company will be held at blackrock s offices at 12 throgmorton avenue london ec2n 2dl on tuesday 4 february 2020 at 12 00 noon details of the business of the meeting are set out in the notice of meeting in the annual report the investment managers will make a presentation to shareholders on the company s progress and the outlook for frontier markets my fellow directors and i look forward to meeting shareholders at this year s agm and encourage you to attend audley twiston davies chairman 5 december 2019 investment managers report for the year ended 30 september 2019 portfolio market commentary during the twelve months to 30 september 2019 the company returned 1 5 on a us dollar basis with dividends reinvested versus its benchmark index which was flat and returned 0 0 the msci frontier market index returned 5 9 while the msci emerging markets index returned 2 0 over the same period since inception the company has returned 46 5 compared to 35 8 return of its benchmark index and 29 6 return of the msci frontier market index while msci emerging markets index has lagged returning 11 8 2019 was a somewhat frustrating year for the company as frontier markets went not just broadly but exactly nowhere returning exactly 0 0 over the 12 months to the end of september whilst there were highs greece vietnam and lows argentina malaysia within that the aggregate performance is still disappointing fundamentally investors expect that price performance will follow earnings growth and companies that are able to sustainably grow their earnings should see strong share price performance blackrock proprietary data shows how the earnings of the companies in our portfolio have grown over the past five years and how the overall value of our frontier markets portfolio has developed whilst the earnings have grown consistently at an average rate of around 10 p a this has not been the case for the portfolio s value there has been a substantial de rating of these frontier markets earnings we believe valuations are now at very attractive levels around the cheapest that we have seen since we launched the company source blackrock as at 30 september 2019 source msci with effect from 1 april 2018 the benchmark index changed to

first quarter of the year our holding in national bank of greece subsequently rose more than 150 to become the largest single stock contributor to performance the positive performance came as the bank showed substantial progress in reducing exposure to defaulted loans we made a particularly timely switch between alpha bank and national bank of greece during the year recognising the substantial differentiation in provision coverage between the two banks which was subsequently reflected in very differentiated share price performance our patience was also repaid in vietnam where holdings in mobile world 32 and fpt 37 both showed very strong performance after an unremarkable 2018 both 9 the company has held both of these names for nearly 5 years mobile world has been a phenomenal success story the company started life retailing mobile phones and has expanded from this into wider consumer electronics and for the last couple of years has entered the supermarket space whilst this remains a daunting challenge the extent of white goods space in a country as underpenetrated as vietnam is enviable fpt a digital technology company offers similar long term growth potential positions in indonesia rose following the re election of joko widodo as president he is expected to continue to follow market friendly policies and continue the reform path initiated during his first administration our position in semen indonesia a building materials manufacturer 23 rose as the company announced a takeover of rival holcim indonesia which is expected to have a substantial beneficial impact on future margins mitra adiperkasa a clothing and speciality retailer 29 rose as the company reported strong same store sales growth and improved margins through the year frontier markets is a volatile universe this means that opportunities are frequently presented to an active manager to trade mis priced stocks the last year was no different in this respect one such example included thai beverage 31 which we were able to buy at very attractive levels in q4 2018 having historically been able to take market share from multinational peers in thailand the company bought a majority stake in sabeco a previously state owned vietnamese brewer with the intention of repeating this strategy however the stock sold off substantially post acquisition on market fears that the company had overpaid for the acquisition as at september 2019 the stock was trading at almost exactly the same price as it had been two years previously in september 2017 airarabia 30 is another very similar example where again the stock was trading at a similar price to two years ago as at the end of september 2019 here the sell off was perhaps more justified as the company had to write off substantial portions of its investment book in connection with the downfall of abraaj group a middle eastern private equity group although raising some questions around management judgement the write off had no impact on company operations which have continued to show very strong growth as the company has taken market share across the middle east the example of argentina reinforces our belief in the importance of diversification our expectation was that mr macri had a good chance to win a second term in the argentine elections if he had been able to we believe that this would have given argentina the best hope of economic normalisation that we have seen in our lifetimes however this view proved icorrect mr macri performed surprisingly poorly in the primary elections which correctly foresaw the outcome of the october elections which were won by alberto fernandez returning the country to peronist rule the argentine market fell more than 50 on the day following this election this was the 2nd largest usd single day fall that any country index anywhere in the world has seen over the last 60 years hence our holdings in energy company ypf 39 and energy utility pampa energia 62 detracted from returns our position in telecommunications company telecom malaysia 26 contributed well to returns as the stock bounced from a very low valuation we have since exited the position overall performance in malaysia was disappointing during the year our holding in british american tobacco malaysia 49 hurt returns following disappointing earnings results which saw higher costs and a larger than expected decline in the legal tobacco market an expected government crackdown on the illegal market has failed to impact on illicit volumes as expected other disappointing stocks in the portfolio included alior bank in poland which fell 43 during the year as the company reported a substantial deterioration in its asset quality we have subsequently exited the position as we believe that the company still has insufficient provisions on its balance sheet portfolio activity in general individual stock turnover in the portfolio has been fairly low during the year as patient long term investors we have maintained positions in conviction positions where we think valuations are fundamentally cheap given the volatility we see across our markets we will add and reduce the size of positions with market moves and we have continued this practice through the year trimming winners and topping up losers we have substantially increased our holdings in the philippines moving from a net short position to a net long position over the year in an increasingly growth challenged world we think that the philippines will continue to grow faster than its peers and that this will be supportive for valuations every country that we invest in carries inherent risks we believe that investing in a diversified portfolio is the best approach to frontier markets we substantially reduced our holdings in argentina post the primary elections in august given our view that in order to roll over the dollar debt outstanding the country will require a level of fiscal adjustment that will be very challenging for the new administration to meet we exited most of our positions in kuwait the market rose substantially following the announcement in june that msci will upgrade kuwait to emerging market status subsequent to the exchange meeting certain conditions by november 2019 we believe that our holdings reached fair value and have exited national bank of kuwait and mobile telecommunications zain outlook whilst expectations for global growth look increasingly challenged frontier markets continue to offer exposure to countries that we believe have high structural growth we note that a lot of stocks in our universe are trading at extremely low valuations whilst offering very attractive dividend yields which we view as a rewarding opportunity for long term patient

the investment manager is not constrained by the geographical weightings of the benchmark index and the company s portfolio may frequently be overweight or underweight to any particular country relative to the benchmark index the company will exit any investment as soon as reasonably practicable following the relevant company ceasing to be domiciled or listed in or exercising the predominant part of its economic activity in the frontiers universe in order to achieve the company s investment objective the investment manager selects investments through a process of fundamental and geopolitical analysis seeking long term appreciation from mispriced value or growth the investment manager employs both a top down and bottom up approach to investing it is expected that the company will have exposure to between 35 to 65 holdings where possible investment will generally be made directly in the stock markets of the frontiers universe where the investment manager determines it appropriate investment may be made through collective investment schemes although such investments are not likely to be significant investment in other closed ended investment funds admitted to the official list will not exceed more than 10 per cent in aggregate of the value of the gross assets calculated at the time of any relevant investment it is intended that the company will generally be invested in equity investments however the investment manager may invest in equity related investments such as derivatives or convertibles and to a lesser extent in bonds or other fixed income securities including high risk debt securities these securities may be below investment grade due to national and or international regulation excessive operational risk prohibitive costs and or the time period involved in establishing trading and custody accounts in certain countries in the frontiers universe the company may be unable to invest whether directly or through nominees in companies in certain countries in the frontiers universe or in the opinion of the company and or the investment manager it may not be advisable to do so in such circumstances or in countries where acceptable custodial and other arrangements are not in place to safeguard the company s investments the company intends to gain economic exposure to companies in such countries by investing indirectly through derivatives derivatives are financial instruments linked to the performance of another asset or security such as promissory notes contracts for difference futures or traded options save as provided below there is no restriction on the company investing in derivatives in such circumstances or for efficient portfolio management purposes the company may be geared through borrowings and or by entering into derivative transactions taking both long and short positions that have the effect of gearing the company s portfolio to enhance performance the company may also use borrowings for the settlement of transactions to facilitate share repurchases where applicable and to meet on going expenses the respective limits on gearing whether through the use of derivatives borrowings or a combination of both are set out below maximum gearing through the use of derivatives or borrowings to gain exposure to long positions in securities 140 per cent of net assets maximum exposure to short positions for shorting purposes the company may use indices or individual stocks 10 per cent of net assets maximum gross exposure total long exposure plus total short exposure 150 per cent of net assets maximum net exposure total long exposure minus total short exposure 130 per cent of net assets in normal circumstances the company will typically have net exposure of between 95 per cent and 120 per cent of net assets when investing via derivatives the company will seek to mitigate and or spread its counterparty risk exposure by collateralisation and or contracting with a potential range of counterparty banks as appropriate each of which shall at the time of entering into such derivatives have a standard poor s credit rating of at least a on its long term senior unsecured debt the company may invest up to 5 per cent of its gross assets at the time of such investment in unquoted securities the company will invest so as not to hold more than 15 per cent of its gross assets in any one stock or derivative position at the time of investment excluding cash management activities no material change will be made to the investment policy without the approval of shareholders by ordinary resolution a detailed analysis of the company s portfolio has been provided above investment approach and process portfolio construction is a continuous process with the investment manager analysing constantly the impact of new ideas and information on the portfolio as a whole the approach is flexible varying through market and economic cycles to create a portfolio appropriate to the focused and unconstrained strategy of the company the macroeconomic environment is factored into all portfolio decisions in general macroeconomic analysis is a more dominant factor in investment decision making when the outlook is negative the macro process is comprised of three parts political assessment macroeconomic analysis and appraisal of the valuation of a country s market which can only take place with thorough analysis of stock specific opportunities the investment manager s research team generates ideas from a diverse range of sources these include frequent travel to the markets in which the company invests and regular conversations with contacts that allow the frontiers team to assess the entire eco system around a company namely competitors suppliers financiers customers and regulators the team leverages the internal research network sharing information between blackrock s investment teams using a proprietary research application and database and develops insights from macroeconomic analysis the board believes that blackrock s research platform is a significant competitive advantage both in terms of information specific to emerging and frontier market equities and through its global insights across asset classes access to companies is extremely good given blackrock s market presence which makes it possible to develop a detailed knowledge of a company and its management the research process focuses on cash flow and future earnings growth as the investment team believes that this is ultimately the driver of share prices over time the process is designed with the aim of identifying companies that can translate top line revenue growth to free cash flow and investing in these companies when the analysis suggests that the cash flow stream is undervalued financial models are developed focusing on company financials particularly cash flow statements rather than relying on third party research esg factors can be useful and relevant indicators for investment purposes and can help portfolio managers with their decision making through identifying potentially negative events or corporate behaviour this results in the expectation that there will be an outperformance bias towards better governed companies in the long run the portfolio managers work closely with blackrock s investment stewardship team bis to assess the governance quality of companies and investigate any potential issues risks or opportunities specific to corporate governance the portfolio management team leverages local expertise bis and investors in its proprietary risk based approach financial statement integrity is central to the analysis where bis applies a range of systematic measures to highlight companies accounting ratios in its assessment of balance sheet and earnings quality risks for other categories under the corporate governance umbrella e g audit quality board accountability executive pay and ownership and control bis flags risks based on internal research including regulatory filings announcements and public news feeds governance g data from msci esg research manager and other data sources may also be employed for supporting consideration environmental e and social s factors are primarily assessed using msci data examining whether specific e s exposure exists and if so to determine how well such exposure is being managed further information on the manager s approach to esg and socially responsible investing can be found in the corporate governance report in the annual report the investment managers research team monitors differing levels of risk throughout the process and believes that avoiding major downside events can generate significant outperformance over the long term inputs from blackrock

corruption adverse changes in legislation or other diplomatic developments such as the outbreak of war or imposition of sanctions could substantially and adversely affect the economies of such countries or the value of the company s investments in those countries the investment manager mitigates this risk by applying stringent controls over where investments are made and through close monitoring of political risks the investment manager s approach to filtering the investment universe takes account of the political background to regions and is backed up by rigorous stock specific research and risk analysis individually and collectively in constructing the portfolio the management team has a wide network of business and political contacts which provides economic insights with public and private bodies this enables the investment manager to assess potential investments in an informed and disciplined way as well as being able to conduct regular monitoring of investments once made however given the nature of political risk all investments will be exposed to a degree of risk and the investment manager will ensure that the portfolio remains diversified across countries to mitigate the risk financial risk the company s investment activities expose it to a variety of financial risks which include foreign currency risk liquidity risk currency risk and interest rate risk details of these risks are disclosed in note 18 to the financial statements together with a summary of the policies for managing these risks market risk market risk arises from volatility in the prices of the company s investments it represents the potential loss the company might suffer through realising investments in the face of negative market movements the securities markets of the frontiers universe are not as large as the more established securities markets and have substantially less trading volume which may result in a lack of liquidity and higher price volatility there are a limited number of attractive investment opportunities in frontier markets and this may lead to a delay in investment and may affect the price at which such investments may be made and reduce potential investment returns for the company there is also exposure to currency market and political risk due to the location of the operation of the businesses in which the company may invest as a consequence of this and other market factors the company may invest in a concentrated portfolio of shares and this focus may result in higher risk when compared to a portfolio that has spread or diversified investments more broadly corruption also remains a significant issue across the frontiers universe and the effects of corruption could have a material adverse effect on the company s performance accounting auditing and financial reporting standards and practices and disclosure requirements applicable to many companies in developing countries may be less rigorous than in developed markets as a result there may be less information available publicly to investors in these securities and such information as is available is often less reliable the company also gains exposure to the frontiers universe by investing indirectly through promissory notes p notes which presents additional risk to the company as p notes are uncollateralised resulting in the company being subject to full counterparty risk via the p note issuer p notes also present liquidity issues as the company being a captive client of a p note issuer may only be able to realise its investment through the p note issuer and this may have a negative impact on the liquidity of the p notes which does not correlate to the liquidity of the underlying security market risk represents the risks of investment in a particular market country or geographic region therefore this is largely outside of the scope of the board s control however the board carefully considers asset allocation stock selection and levels of gearing on a regular basis and has set investment restrictions and guidelines which are monitored and reported on by the investment manager market risk is also mitigated through portfolio diversification across countries and regions the board monitors the implementation and results of the investment process with the investment manager regularly the investment manager also regularly reports to the board on relative market risks associated with investment in such regions further information is provided under political risk viability statement in accordance with provision c 2 2 of the uk corporate governance code the directors have assessed the prospects of the company over a longer period than the 12 months referred to by the going concern guidelines the board conducted this review for the period up to the agm in 2024 in determining this period the board took into account the company s investment objective to achieve long term capital growth and the fact that on or around the agm in 2021 it will be necessary for the board to formulate and submit to shareholders proposals which may constitute a tender offer and or other method of distribution as was the case in 2016 to provide an opportunity to realise the value of their investment in the company at nav less applicable costs in making this assessment the board has considered the following factors the company s principal risks as set out above the ongoing relevance of the company s investment objective in the current environment and the level of ongoing demand for the company s ordinary shares the board has also considered a number of financial metrics including the level of current and historic ongoing charges incurred by the company the company s borrowings and its ability to meet its liabilities as they fall due the premium or discount to nav the level of income generated by the company future income forecasts and the liquidity of the company s portfolio the company is an investment company with a relatively liquid equity portfolio as at 30 september 2019 92 3 of the equity portfolio was capable of being realised in less than 20 days and largely fixed overheads excluding performance fees which comprise a very small percentage of net assets 1 39 in addition any performance fees are capped at 1 of gross assets in years where the nav per share has fallen or 2 5 of gross assets in years where the nav per share has increased therefore the board has concluded that even in exceptionally stressed operating conditions the company would comfortably be able to meet its ongoing operating costs as they fall due however investment companies may face other challenges such as regulatory changes and the tax treatment of investment trusts or a significant decrease in size due to substantial share buy back activity which may result in the company no longer being of sufficient market capitalisation to represent viable investment propositions or no longer being able to continue in operation the board has also considered the adverse impact of potential changes in law regulation and taxation and the matter of foreign exchange risk they have determined that although there are a number of potential risks associated with the brexit process any transition following any agreement and the legal fiscal and regulatory landscape thereafter they do not believe that this represents a material threat to the company s strategy and business model nor do they believe that the investment manager would be materially impeded in achieving the company s investment objective in addition the level of complexity uncertainty and general lack of information present a number of potential outcomes and scenarios which may or may not prove to be malign or benign and or supportive of the investment manager in achieving the company s investment objective the board has determined that the factors considered are applicable to the period up to the agm in 2024 and beyond based on the results of their analysis the directors have a reasonable expectation that the company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment future prospects the board s main focus is on the achievement of capital growth and the future of the company is dependent upon the success of the investment strategy the outlook for the company is discussed in both the chairman s statement and the investment manager s report in the annual report social community and human rights issues as an investment trust the company has no direct social or community responsibilities however the company believes that it is in shareholders interests to consider environmental social and governance factors and human rights issues when selecting and retaining investments details of the company s policy on socially responsible investment are set out in the annual report modern slavery as an investment vehicle the company does not provide goods or services in the normal course of business and does not have customers accordingly the directors consider that the company is not required to make any slavery or human trafficking statement under the modern slavery act 2015 in any event the board considers the company s supply chain dealing predominantly with professional advisers and service providers in the financial services industry to be low risk in relation to this matter directors gender representation and employees the directors of the company on 30 september 2019 all of whom with the exception of katrina hart who was appointed with effect

principal activity of the company is that of an investment trust company within the meaning of section 1158 of the corporation tax act 2010 the company was incorporated on 15 october 2010 and this is the ninth annual report 2 accounting policies the principal accounting policies adopted by the company are set out below a basis of preparation the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards ifrs as adopted by the european union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the companies act 2006 all of the company s operations are of a continuing nature insofar as the statement of recommended practice sorp for investment trust companies and venture capital trusts issued by the association of investment companies aic in november 2014 and updated in february 2018 is compatible with ifrs the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the guidance set out in the sorp substantially all of the assets of the company consist of securities that are readily realisable and accordingly the directors believe that the company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future consequently the directors have determined that it is appropriate for the financial statements to be prepared on a going concern basis the company s financial statements are presented in us dollars which is the functional currency of the company and the currency of the primary economic environment in which the company operates all values are rounded to the nearest thousand dollars us 000 except where otherwise indicated ifrs standards that have yet to be adopted a number of new standards amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for the annual periods beginning after 1 january 2019 and have not been applied in preparing these financial statements none of these are expected to have a significant effect on the measurement of the amounts recognised in the financial statements of the company ifrs 16 leases effective 1 january 2019 specifies accounting for leases and removes the distinction between operating and finance leases this standard is not applicable to the company as it has no leases ifric 23 uncertainty over income tax treatments seeks to provide clarity on how to account for uncertainty over income tax treatments and specifies that an entity must consider whether it is probable that the relevant tax authority will accept each tax treatment or group of tax treatments that it plans to use in its income tax filing the interpretation also requires companies to reassess the judgements and estimates applied if facts and circumstances change the interpretation is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 january 2019 the interpretation would require the company to recognise uncertain tax positions which are more than probable within its financial statements the interprepation is unlikely to have any impact on the financial statements of the company adoption of new and amended standards and interpretations ifrs 9 financial instruments the classification and measurement requirements of ifrs 9 have been adopted retrospectively as of the date of initial application on 1 october 2018 however the company has chosen to take advantage of the option not to restate comparatives therefore the 2018 comparative figures are presented and measured under ias 39 all financial assets previously held at fair value continue to be measured at fair value and accordingly there has been no impact as a result of the adoption of ifrs 9 all financial assets that were classified as loans and receivables and measured at amortised cost continue to be so and there was no significant impact of expected credit losses on financial assets measured at amortised cost ifrs 15 revenue from contracts with customers the company adopted ifrs 15 as of the date of initial application of 1 october 2018 ifrs 15 replaces ias 18 revenue and establishes a five step model to account for revenue arising from contracts with customers in

this article is more than 4 years old latincontent via getty images interestingly enough argentina appeared to be falling off a precipice that was more a self inflicted wound than a consequence of broader socio historic tendencies such was argentina s fate that in the early years of mauricio macri s presidency the country was seen as the frontrunner in overturning more than a decade of leftist populism in the region much to the acclaim of the hegemonic western powers as quickly as macri s and argentina s star lit up it fell to the lowest of the low and argentina once again became the laughing stock of the world on the verge of a new sovereign debt default at the hands of the international monetary fund alas as latin america unexpectedly went up in flames in a matter of weeks the nation that will soon be presided by the tandem alberto fernández cristina fernández de kirchner is glowing bright again one of the only countries in the region not in imminent risk of social eruption the us state department has made it clear that despite fernández s characterizations of the global superpower as an old school supporter of military coups in third world countries it considers argentina a strategic democratic ally in the region with which it very much wants to engage with the imf indicating it is willing to play ball some economists are even postulating that under certain conditions including an auspicious renegotiation of argentina s large sovereign debt pile with the imf and private creditors that mainly congregate in wall street the third largest economy in latin amercia could quickly thrive on the back of a social pact which seems to defy the laws of gravity or at least economics yet what argentina faces is much more profound than facing its own internal demons alberto one such minor demon and cristina a queen demon of sorts had already run the show during more auspicious times showing that it is possible to have a nation grow macro economically in this godforsaken land rich with natural resources and educated workers macri a different but equally dangerous type of demon did manage to generate hope and even economic growth through a plan that could have worked but ended up imploding catastrophically together and with the expectations that the renewed pan peronist front generates among pundits at least in argentina they demonstrate that it is not a matter of right or left macrista or peronista but that deeper forces are at work without looking to go into an ontological analysis of latin american political economy it is important to put the recent flare up into context the 2000s saw a consolidation of power in a group of democratically elected leftist populists across the continent leaders who espoused a distrust and even hatred of the united states which they blamed for the spread of a wicked form of capitalism dubbed neoliberalism that exacerbated income inequality these leaders many of whom participated in failed coups in the past others who had been jailed by vicious military dictatorships backed by the us during the cold war and some that simply sat on the sidelines of national politics until it was their time helped raise millions of latin americans out of poverty through the implementation of progressive economic policies including the distribution of social plans and subsidies particularly of transport costs the strong economic growth of several major south american countries in the 2000s such as argentina and brazil both of which had suffered tremendous economic crises and devaluations toward the end of the 20th century was fuelled by a commodities super cycle sparked by china and south east asia with ferocious appetite for raw materials the kirchners and lulas of the continent focused on instant gratification using the billions of dollars reaped from agricultural exports mining duties and other commodities based exploitation to further their own political agendas allowing for the generation of bloated bureaucracies mass corruption and large fiscal deficits eventually cracks in the populist economic model along with intolerance against dissidence and a hatred of the free press by these presidents who sought to perpetuate themselves in power pushed the population to the other side of the spectrum pro market candidates campaigning on deficit correction global integration and a respect for institutions took the continent yet the global dynamics had changed china s growth had already begun to slow down a process which continues as its middle and upper classes evolve while the global financial crisis of 2008 helped cement the financialization of the global economy with extreme easy money policies in the united states and the european union causing powerful capital flow disruptions across emerging market economies as investors chase yield the decadence of western capitalism has begun to express itself ever more clearly since the 2008 crisis with the thwarting of social mobility and the consolidation of powerful global elites consisting of ultra high net worth individuals and companies on the sidelines remain the majority of the world particularly in poor regions such as latin america today our continent faces the impossible task of becoming competitive on a global scale with an absolute lack of infrastructure limited credit cramped capital investment for decades and galloping inequality that has given birth to a generation of young people stuck in the poverty trap living on the outskirts of our major urban centres inept bureaucracies corruption and retrograde economic schemes incentivise the dollarization of portfolios before productive investment as jaime durán barba explained in a recent column for perfil smartphones and social networks have given the coup de grace to traditional political analysis based on 20th century categories today s social protests have no real leaders no concrete demands and no easy mechanisms for deactivation they are the expression of diverse groups of people united by the incapacity of their nations and region as a whole to truly improve their lot with chile and bolivia in flames ecuador already having exploded venezuela in a humanitarian crisis that competes with syria the rest of the region is scared colombia is beginning to shake and some question whether jair bolsonaro can conduct brazil through these turbulent seas it is in that context that alberto fernández is proposing a series of measures that sound completely antiquated to solve one of the world s biggest economic enigmas sustained growth in argentina a social pact aimed at stimulating demand printing pesos and raising pension payments and the minimum wage while taxing the rich and the agroexporting sector appears to be his magic sauce this in the context of capital controls and a massive pile of debt that needs to be renegotiated fortunately what matters in the immediate term is the sense of a plan not that plan itself as measured by its capacity to generate confidence if and only if he succeeds in this first step will he have the opportunity to tackle the structural issues this piece was originally published in the buenos

speech last week by bank of canada deputy governor timothy lane who described government spending as a mixed picture while it has been supporting growth recently this support is expected to wane in 2020 as consolidation in ontario and alberta takes hold and the recent strength in quebec and british columbia normalizes mr lane said indeed bank of montreal s latest look at the provinces noted that

reserve chairman who tamed u s inflation in the 1980s and decades later inspired tough wall street reforms in the wake of the global financial crisis died monday at the age of 92 according to the new york times which quoted his daughter mr volcker who media reports said had been suffering from prostate cancer was the first to bring celebrity status to the job of u s central banker serving as chairman of the federal reserve from 1979 to 1987 as with the man who succeeded him alan greenspan mr volcker could soothe or excite financial markets with just a vague murmur also key for this week central bankers and british voters take centre stage the federal reserve the european central bank and bank of canada governor stephen poloz are all in the spotlight the first two with rate decisions and the latter with a speech that will be widely watched it would be anyway but now there are friday s ugly jobs numbers to work into the monetary policy equation the fed isn t expected to unveil any rate changes having cut several times already this year but markets will also be watching for projections from individual central bank officials the incoming data week were on balance positive and certainly wouldn t prompt the sort of material reassessment of the outlook that fed officials have said would be necessary to cut interest rates again said paul ashworth chief u s economist at capital economics markets are still pricing in one final 25 basis point rate cut some time next year but our guess is that signs of a pick up in economic growth early next year will take that possibility off the table he added the bigger point however is that even if that pick up in gdp growth ends up being more pronounced than many expect we strongly doubt that the fed would hike rates even though they would never admit to it in public the chances of fed officials sanctioning a rate hike next year during a politically charged election campaign are close to zero mr poloz speaks thursday to a business audience in toronto followed by a news conference he will likely express a similar message to the policy statement week that rate cuts are not needed in canada although could sound more dovish after the weak november employment report said veronica clark associate u s economics at citigroup we will be most curious to see how dismissive of course if at all poloz will be of the soft jobs numbers cibc world markets deputy chief economist benjamin tal agreed so until 8 30 it was a slam dunk the bank was on hold mr tal said and then we got the 71 000 drop in employment with no amount of lipstick able to make that pig any prettier he added now we all know that the labour force numbers are extremely volatile but the last time the number of jobs fell by so much in one month was during the recession thus it s not an easy decision for the central bank so what do you do when you don t know what to do at the minimum you don t take chances the bank might open the door again to easing in upcoming communications possibly as early as week mr tal said of mr poloz s speech mr poloz will share the limelight with christine lagarde who oversees her first decision as the new chief of the

allegiances breaking down it wouldn t take much for the opinion pollsters to end up red faced and a rapid repricing in the wake of any surprise exit poll he added in a look ahead thursday s exit poll will be the first indication that we get as to which direction voters have decided to break we should also be mindful of the brexit referendum in 2016 which financial markets got completely wrong

paul volcker one of the most recognizable and consequential figures in american economics died sunday at 92 over several decades the central banker effectively remade the american economy as a treasury department official under president nixon he helped dismantle the bretton woods system finally ending the convertibility of the u s dollar into gold he was a lifelong skeptic of big finance and later in life provided advice to burgeoning presidential candidate barack obama that ended up enshrined into law but most of all he led the federal reserve from 1979 to 1987 through what was arguably the central bank s most important moment in modern history volcker leaves behind him a profoundly complicated legacy the implications of which u s economics is only beginning to grapple with

directly to your inbox sign up in its obit the new york times described volcker s reputation as one of austere integrity during his time as a washington d c official volcker was personally frugal preferring low cost suits cheap cigars and a small apartment his approach to economic policy was built around an almost puritan belief in the importance of sacrifice moderation and pain in the service of long term goals and this devotion did indeed cut across partisan lines taking aim at excess inflation wall street financial wizardry and national debt build ups under republicans and democrats alike came to represent independence ben bernanke another former fed chairman told the times he personified the idea of doing something politically unpopular but economically necessary bernanke s is the conventional wisdom but it belies thorny questions about the political economy for whom were volcker s decisions economically necessary and how does what is necessary relate to what is right for progressives and liberals volcker s most attractive trait was probably his lifelong skepticism bordering on contempt for business elites particularly in finance he remained convinced that the vast majority of innovation occurring on wall street was useless providing no real value to society volcker even reportedly mused that the automated teller machine was the last genuinely helpful breakthrough offered by the financial industry as fed chairman during the 1980s one of volcker s duties was to help with regulatory oversight of america s private banks the reagan administration was in favor of deregulating the industry but volcker wasn t keen and the white house undercut him by packing the rest of the fed s governing board with pro deregulation members during the clinton years when enthusiasm for unshackling finance was at its height volcker disappeared from the political scene banished to some degree as an unwelcome voice of doubt and restraint after the 2008 financial crisis proved volcker s prescience he re emerged as a supporter and advisor to democratic presidential candidate barack obama as obama s white house pushed through a new suite of financial regulations the former fed chairman proposed the volcker rule a limitation that hived the economy s biggest and most important banks off from speculative financial activity and which republicans and deregulation advocates have been fighting ever since obama even reportedly considered volcker as treasury secretary before picking tim geithner instead it s interesting to wonder how a volcker treasury might have dealt differently with the banks in the aftermath of 2008 s aftermath given how american families fared under geithner s effort to avoid forcing the banks into either nationalization or bankruptcy but as mentioned the pinnacle of volcker s career and of his import to american history was his previous chairmanship of the federal reserve nominated to the post by president carter and then continuing under reagan volcker set out to finally tame the ever rising inflation that had bedeviled the country for all of the 1970s as part of the government s apparatus for creating u s dollars the fed has two options in carrying out monetary policy it can target interest rates and pump however much money into or out of the economy as is needed to hit them or it can target the supply of money and let the market set interest rates in reaction to the supply time and again volcker leaned towards the latter option he viewed low interest rates as indulgent and imprudent he unsuccessfully opposed them as a lower fed official under a previous chairman arthur burns and he unsuccessfully opposed them again in the economic boom of the late 1980s the gold standard had been an earlier mechanism for limiting the creation of u s dollars and under nixon volcker was deeply apprehensive about undoing it so in 1979 and 1980 when inflation was brutally high volcker chose to squeeze the money supply to bring it down his policy briefly drove interest rates to an astonishing 20 percent setting off a massive recession that destroyed millions of jobs and sent unions into a freefall but in terms of its ostensible goals volcker s strategy worked and inflation fell back down over the next few years volcker s admirers point out that ever since america s economy has enjoyed longer and more stable runs of growth with perpetually low inflation unfortunately volcker s recession also marked a turning point in the evolution of the u s economy inequality has skyrocketed and real wages for the vast majority of americans effectively stopped growing our economic growth has been more stable but it has also been slower in particular volcker was explicit that taming inflation required breaking the organized power of workers to demand higher wages when reagan smashed the air traffic controllers union volcker praised it as the single most important action of the administration in helping the anti inflation fight the inflation crisis had many intersecting causes each pointing to different possible solutions that would ve required sacrifices from different groups but volcker s chosen strategy essentially loaded all the pain onto the working class this approach to monetary policy has shaped fed policy ever since and the country s workers are still living with the consequences ironically as much as volcker may look askance at the self congratulatory elites of wall street he also helped demolish the labor movement one of the few bases of bottom up power in u s politics that could ve restrained them recently some of these realizations seem to have seeped into the fed s consciousness even if its implications for volcker s legacy remain unacknowledged in response to the great recession the fed created and injected trillions of new dollars into the economy with almost no effect casting doubt on volcker s focus on the money supply as the key lever the central bank has also changed course on interest rates in a very un volcker ish manner keeping them low even as unemployment has fallen to its lowest rate in decades volcker was undoubtedly a stoic and principled champion of following the rules but he also crushed the american worker in the name of monetary discipline it seems clear that second half of his legacy left a deeper mark on american society

a geopolitical paradox has lain at the heart of germany s policy on the euro and its own fiscal policy for many years and berlin is now waking up to this tension take fiscal policy first contrary to the assumptions of many commentators especially at the height of the euro crisis germany s approach to european financial and fiscal policy always had a strategic rationale behind it the country s hard line in the early years of this decade sought to make europe economically competitive in the twenty first century by forcing consolidation of out of control spending and enabling quality growth rather than growth inflated by central bank money berlin s goal was to ensure the euro would not become a transfer union and thereby cause political division in europe between net contributors and net beneficiaries fiscal prudence or austerity depending on whether you like it or not also helped angela merkel s governments domestically by allowing them to display their toughness on countries such as greece but today it is clear that berlin s strategy did not succeed while the policies managed to rein in spending they increased intra eurozone divergence and divided the eu instead of making europe stronger and more competitive as a whole as had been intended importantly the german approach was purely economic and geopolitics played no major role in germany s thinking during this period this omission has become increasingly clear in recent years as the consequences of this approach have come to clearly overlap with important international trends it did so in ways not helpful for those who wish to see a stronger and more sovereign europe the fiscal prudence first approach stymied european investments and forced the sale of state owned assets for economic consolidation inviting in non european investments as replacements especially from china indeed as europe struggled with itself the world around it changed greatly today china is strategically buying up european companies like germany s kuka robotics company and it has launched an industrial strategy for technological and geo economic supremacy in the twenty first century but the us has also labelled the european union a competitor and is using its economic power to bully european companies the world is no longer one of protocol and multilateralism but is instead caught up in bipolar geo economic competition between great powers in this new era many in berlin are now starting to realise that they need to take geopolitics much more into account when it comes to their long standing financial policy preferences the china case is especially instructive because in beijing s geopolitical race with washington some of its greatest assets are economic dependencies which grew larger in europe this decade as fiscal consolidation increased many of these countries vied for outside money across europe and especially in southern eu member states china now owns majority shares in ports electricity grids transport and health systems and key companies like pirelli the geopolitical consequences have become ever more apparent from cases of hungary greece and slovenia blocking eu statements criticising china for human rights violations or its south china sea aggression to a group of 16 now 17 eastern european countries forming to foster closer economic ties with china outside eu structures the chinese are now in possession of valuable strategic assets along europe s periphery that they can use for political purposes increasingly at question are germany s infamous schwarze null black zero or no debt policies as the world descends into this new great power competition these sorts of geopolitical ramifications are now much more on the minds of decision makers and analysts in berlin increasingly at question are germany s infamous schwarze null black zero or no debt policies at a time when these policies are under slowly building but real domestic pressure merkel may only this month have called it absurd to even think about alternatives to this approach but her social democratic coalition partner just this weekend decided to renounce schwarze null policies in favour of boosting investments under a new political leadership immensely critical of the coalition with merkel and the social democrats are finding powerful allies in their fight leading economists from across the political spectrum are alarmed at germany s growing investment gap which a joint study of the conservative german economic institute and the left leaning macroeconomic policy institute estimates at 456 billion over the next ten years germany also barely avoided a technical recession in 2019 and its industrial production is in sharp decline in a very similar situation the dutch government an important reference point for german fiscal policy and the german debate has just announced an investment fund for annual budgets and a stimulus package for its stagnating economy and all this is happening against a rapidly evolving domestic political scene younger voters demanding greater investment in their country s future and the green party s popular call for debt for climate action pressure to become fiscally more active at home will not translate into a reversal of the eurozone s convergence criteria of course but it is becoming clear that germany will ultimately have to invest a lot more in building its economic base for strategic sovereignty and economic success in the digital twenty first century as a result even in ordo liberal germany the idea of boosting investment and reconsidering the state s role in assuring a strong economic base is starting to win new favour berlin might end up playing a much greater role in strengthening europe as a geo economic actor as part of this germans may also find themselves reconsidering their stance on the international role of the euro in the past germany s position on the single currency was clear and consistent the cost of depending on the us dollar for economic transactions was much lower than the cost of having to accept a stronger and therefore appreciating euro in the new world however this cost benefit calculation is starting to change washington is weaponising its currency dominance and trying to restrict german and european trade not just with iran but also with russia and other countries as the united states has shown it can shut down significant shares of its trade with other countries german companies are more and more worried about a significantly rising cost of dollar dependency while this cost has not become so large that the german government has yet considered altering course some german businesses are starting to shift their view there is certainly an acute sense of the danger of having to choose between american and chinese markets because of sanctions that have extraterritorial reach according to a recent poll by faz newspaper 80 percent of german business and political leaders are afraid of such a development and this is leading more of them to think about how to make the euro a stronger international currency in order to give them more independence in their trade the powerful association of german banks has now specifically called for the euro s internationalisation to achieve this the eurozone would need an asset that global investors consider to be basically risk free and many in berlin now acknowledge that even the difficult subject of eurobonds which would provide for such an asset might be back on the agenda soon these developments in germany could open up opportunities for building the economic sovereignty and resilience to sanctions that europeans badly need it may still be too early to announce the awakening of geopolitical financial policy in germany but in berlin its potential is growing
obadiah mailafia it is not easy stepping into the shoes of a highly accomplished colleague the late henry boyo economist intellectual gadfly and entrepreneur passed away on monday november 18 unlike my humble self boyo was born with a silver spoon and went to such prestigious schools as igbobi college and dulwich college a prestigious private school in london he later studied economics in britain before pursuing a successful career in the private sector we only met once and that was two years ago it was on the occasion of an independence day panel hosted by channels tv in ikeja another guest on the occasion was the businessman bukar kyari who at the time was the chairman of the nigerian economic summit group it did not take me long to form an impression of him i discovered boyo to be a man of strong opinions and something of an iconoclast i am by nature a rather reticent and sceptical development economist when i remarked that privatisation was not necessarily an unrequited good boyo went mercurial his friend bukar kyari swiftly came to his defence to their annoyance i calmly stood my ground boyo later softened up giving me copies of his printed essays he also gave us bottles of water proudly announcing that he was the manufacturer ever the crusader for both good as well as lost causes early this year he excavated the matter of the 7bn from our external reserves that the central bank of nigeria had distributed to some commercial banks to manage on its behalf more than a decade ago the banks took the position that the money was paid in forbearance boyo smelt a rat and set to work with his acerbic and rather excoriating pen in his column of monday february 11 he reproduced verbatim a piece i had written elsewhere defending my role in the said affair i had taken rather strong exception to my humiliating harassment by okoi okono obla and his presidential investigation panel okono obla himself was later to fall into the pit that he himself had dug he is still allegedly a renegade from justice i did not always agree with him but i am persuaded that sir henry olajimi boyo had his heart in the right place a patriot and a true original de profundis our distinguished predecessor was passionate about economic science as a vehicle for promoting the aristotelian good life for all the people he appreciated the fact that a wrong approach to monetary policy could bleed an economy dry he was a sworn enemy to grand corruption and to chicanery and cant he wanted nothing but the best for nigeria like him i believe in free markets i take the view defended by the economic historian karl polanyi long ago that the market is a human artefact that must be counterbalanced by smart states and strong institutions free market without effective regulation is like playing hamlet without the prince i believe in the gospel of the more abundant life as prescribed in the statecraft of obafemi awolowo i want to see our naira become an international convertible currency i want inflation to be brought down to single digits i want growth to average 10 per cent for the next decade i am a sworn enemy to hunger and poverty my vision is of nigeria as a first rate knowledge based diversified technological industrial economy a prosperous democracy at peace with itself and the world my gentle readers are aware that president muhammadu buhari recently submitted a request to the senate seeking approval to borrow the staggering sum of 29 96bn from abroad it is the second time that such a request would be presented the first being in 2016 when the senate of the time rejected it as a person who pursued a professional career in banking and finance it would be rather rich of me to sit here and say don t borrow good businesspeople will tell you that it is smart to use other people s money to get rich but you must know what you are doing in the first place we are all agreed that nigeria s infrastructural financing needs are humongous the african development bank recently estimated those needs to be 100bn annually as contrasted with our annual budget that never exceeds 25bn but i have my own ground rules first we must borrow strictly for infrastructure projects with a guaranteed return on investments and not for consumption i am also opposed to the idea of borrowing for the so called reconstruction and rehabilitation in the war torn north east during our bitter civil war under the great obafemi awolowo nigeria did not borrow a dollar to finance both the war effort and the post bellum reconstruction i do not know why we must engage in mindless external borrowing to finance what is in effect a mere police action in the north east i am not comfortable with the idea that parliament should approve a fungible lump sum of 30bn that government can then proceed to spend as it deems fit all such borrowings must directly be linked to specific projects the record of this administration in terms of expenditure controls and accountable spending is not a particularly impressive one more than a trillion have been recovered from corrupt politicians nobody knows what happened to that money the tsa exercise raked in trillions of hidden funds from the motley of the ministries departments and agencies they have apparently been sucked into the anti gravitational black hole of the administration also nigerians demand to know what all the other borrowings have been used for our national debt has ballooned from 10bn in 2015 to a staggering 84 4bn in 2019 you know money has been wisely spent when you see the president inaugurate a completed project the few projects that have been inaugurated so far are those that were begun by the goodluck jonathan administration so i would be very wary of taking on more debt without iron cast guardrails of financial discipline some of us were involved in the paris debt negotiations in 2005 2006 when our debt profile stood at 36bn we were spending 5bn annually on servicing the interests alone we paid back a total of 20bn while the rest was forgiven i recall signing the cheque for the first tranche of 7 5bn at the cbn i caught fever immediately and had to have on bed rest i could not fathom coughing up such a staggering amount to pay off greedy shylocks living out their gilded lives in new york tokyo paris and frankfurt i felt the pain to the very marrow of my bones economics is the science of scarcity and choice first we need a comprehensive programme of cost saving and control of waste in all aspects of public administration such cost savings including regular elimination of ghost workers are crucial to more prudent public financial management i also heard recently that statutory bodies such as the nigerian national petroleum corporation lng and federal inland revenue service have not been releasing all their funds about n1 5tn into the federation account as required by law we must reverse this ugly trend we must also deepen macroeconomic and institutional reforms while boosting public private partnerships in key infrastructure sectors this will lessen pressure on the treasury thereby obviating the need to incur hefty loans we must also improve the extractive capacity of the state our tax to gdp ratio of five per cent is among the lowest among our comparators south africa s is 25 9 per cent political theory establishes incontrovertibly that taxation is actually good for democracy if we must borrow at all let s borrow with wisdom and prudence we cannot afford to behave like the proverbial dog that returns to its own vomit on this henry boyo would have agreed with us copyright punch all rights reserved this material and other digital content on this website may not be reproduced published broadcast

the theme of a modern day robin hood has resonated with international audiences who are increasingly cynical and angry about banks and the entire economic order they represent since late november colombia has seen unprecedented mass protests the longest since 1977 and illustrates the awakening of a muffled civil society protests in colombia are part of a latin american spring demonstrations have since september swept across haiti mexico nicaragua venezuela panama uruguay peru ecuador bolivia and chile but colombia s protests are not merely following a regional trend nor can they be attributed to a single ideological leaning who is protesting and why colombians are protesting against inequality because the country has the most unequal society among the 36 organisation for economic co operation and development oecd countries in addition recent government measures such as cuts in taxes to wealthy investors and an increase in taxes for the middle classes have generated a significant backlash in a failed attempt to implement trickle down economics though the colombian economy has experienced resilient economic growth despite the fall in commodity prices there is little to no redistribution taking place the richest 1 of the population captures more than 20 of the total labour income because measures recently adopted by the government probably exacerbate inequalities peasants student urbanites labour unions and indigenous groups have taken to the streets their grievances might differ but the persistence of inequality has led to a reduction of their tolerance to measures that maintain the status quo protesters are demanding the implementation of the provisions signed in the 2016 revolutionary armed forces of colombia people s army colombian government peace agreement for some factions in the government demanding the fulfilment of the promises of a constitution and demanding peace is seen as a subversive act yet colombians are not demanding a revolution they are demanding the right to a dignifying life and the fulfilment of the promises made by the government in a country that in an armed conflict and is home to one of the highest shares of internally displaced populations in the world the dismissal of protesters grievances constitutes a threat to civil society and democracy the number of assassinated social and indigenous leaders and activists illustrate these risks the motivation for protests relates to the deepening of inequalities and levels of precarity in terms of access to education health and social protection and the weariness of armed conflict the strength of the protests can be explained as the result of the transition of the colombia society towards peace the peace accords with paramilitaries in 2006 and guerrillas in 2016 opened different venues for political participation and the strengthening of social movements government s response the response from the government of iván duque has been one of denials accusations and failed attempts to regain control over public discourse he took office thanks to the political backing of politicians and sectors in society who opposed the peace negotiations with guerrillas and the state reforms taking place since 2010 once in power duque found himself having to comply with state policies his support base did not agree with but these groups do not represent the majority of the population because of this duque faces a 70 disapproval rate and only 24 approval rate according to a recent gallup poll this also means he has no control over the congress posing a dilemma to his government either duque tries to clear his policies to receive the broader support of society and face the alienation of his core supporters or he loses the capacity to lead the country because of this media such as the economist have depicted duque as a president without direction given this limited political space the government attempted a propaganda campaign that tried to cast protesters as not contributing to the development of the country and drove duque to plan the first meeting after the national strike with the industrials and business people rather than with the protestors this illustrates that the government cannot see that the protests span across race location and class protests have brought together diverse actors that have found in the streets a space of encounter social groups are refusing government measures concerning social security pensions and labour reforms because they would have a pervasive effect on the livelihoods of the majority of the population as such these protests are an important signal about the demands of 74 of the population the disconnection between self interested elites and the rest of society is evident the proposal for a tax break such as allowing consumption without value added tax for three days a year and an extended black friday as a solution to the protests illustrate how little the government understands its citizens initiatives such as these reflect the aloofness of maria antoinette a let them eat cake response economists have opposed other proposals tabled by the government as lacking any technical basis populist economic measures aim to increase the acceptability of duque s government but can drive inequality and further grievances the elimination of a 2 tax for buying houses worth more than 260 000 shows that the government is not undertaking reforms to improve the livelihood of the majority of colombians neither are improving state revenues policy challenges the debate can be framed about the availability of public resources and how to spend these but data shows that the country is growing faster than any other oecd country nevertheless the gains of growth are not evenly distributed because the cost of living for the middle class is growing faster than their incomes the state is facing a long standing problem of export dependent economies as the global economy cools down the demand for colombian exports has declined in response to an imminent trade deficit the state must increase its revenues but is afraid of taxing the wealthy its remaining support base this scenario takes place in a country in which informal employment is rising and the size of industrial production is declining the country is also going through a demographic transition with an ageing population adding pressure to the pension system as the population grows older fewer contributors can sustain the social security system and the costs for public health and pension fees increase one of the government proposals was to reduce employment costs and make youth employment flexible driving the most significant segment of the population into precariousness cannot be sound politics or economics especially if the government is thinking about financing the pension system for future generations duque s government praises the discourse of innovation and entrepreneurship but it should consider that people in insecure employment are less likely to take risks and innovate policies need to tackle the sources of inequality in colombia and work to the benefit of the growing youth and middle class the policy dilemma the government has is either to increase taxes to the bulk of the population or reduce exemptions to wealthy citizens given the little political capital that the government has increasing taxes to the wealthy might mean the government could run out of support but failing to create the fiscal space that could sustain the economy and redistribute income might exacerbate inequalities in the future moving towards an equal society is not only an ethical response to the grievances of diverse social groups but also a necessary condition for accelerating economic growth structural changes should be considered the government should shift its attention towards innovation and industrial policies that can internalise and disseminate technological gains while driving domestic demand towards the local industry redistributive reforms are a prerequisite for progress because they help to close structural gaps and lead to higher levels of productivity full use of capacities and resources a fairer distribution of income and wealth and provide all citizens with the right to embark on the plans that they consider worthwhile transition from violence protests remain spaces of uncertainty and crisis but they also are spaces of representation democracy and opportunity protesters bypass the structures of representation and send signals to institutions when they do not work furthermore they allow governments to hear different voices and provide valuable feedback on the workings of the economy yet privileged actors invest energy and resources in preventing positive dissent and protecting the status quo inequality and precariousness hinder economic growth and social cohesion the mass protests in the colombian case not only demonstrate how public voice emerges when violence is declining but also how inequalities can be exposed once violence decreases because people demand basic rights for the losers of development processes as the country tries to leave violence behind the nature of the conversations changed from armed conflict to citizens rights nevertheless colombia is a country that remains in fear of violence the legacy of a 70 year war the leadership of the government or its lack thereof remains central in blocking the transition away from violence fabio andrés díaz pabón is a researcher at the

downloaddownload in december 2015 world leaders held hands on a stage in paris united in their commitment to limit global temperature rise to below 2oc 3 6 f and ideally to 1 5oc 2 7 f the paris agreement remains the world s best shot at avoiding runaway climate change implemented wisely it can also unlock the inclusive growth story of the 21st century improving lives around the world the economics of climate action have improved dramatically since then solar and wind power are now cheaper than coal and increasingly cheaper than natural gas electric vehicle technology has improved so quickly that some major automakers are planning to stop making internal combustion engines knowledge about how to sequester carbon in trees and soil as well as industrially is advancing rapidly climate solutions are cheaper and more available than ever before at the same time the urgency of the climate crisis is even more stark today more frequent and severe wildfires storms and record heatwaves are devastating communities in the first half of 2019 such events displaced a record 7 million people climate change is disrupting lives and livelihoods with the poorest hit hardest new studies show that even half a degree of warming can lead to millions more people being impacted and much greater economic damage inaction or inadequate action will mean more lives lost mass migration major economic disruptions and worsening inequality the growing urgency of the climate crisis and the more favorable economics of climate action together show the dire need and the incredible opportunity for bold climate action it is increasingly clear that low carbon and resilient economic growth can be an engine to help revitalize global growth contribute to poverty reduction generate jobs and income opportunities all while vigorously countering growing climate risks see box and the public is waking up to the urgency and the opportunity of action more than 7 million people in 185 countries took to the streets last september to demand that their governments step up climate action a mounting body of evidence shows the potential benefits of bold climate action global action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions could deliver 26 trillion in net global economic benefits between now and 2030 according to the global commission on the economy and climate it could generate over 65 million new low carbon jobs in 2030 equivalent to the total workforce of the uk and egypt today and avoid over 700 000 deaths from air pollution in cities investments in existing low carbon technologies and practices could cut 90 of greenhouse gas emissions these would require an investment of 1 8 trillion approximately 2 of global gdp a year but generate annual returns worth 2 8 trillion in 2030 from the energy and material cost savings alone transforming food and land use systems can unlock significant social and economic benefits including an estimated 4 5 trillion in new business opportunities each year by 2030 a doubling of rural income growth and over 120 million new jobs in poor rural communities improved global food security all while freeing up 1 5 billion hectares 3 7 billion acres of land by 2050 at the same time we need to adapt to the climate change that is already locked in as a result of past emissions the global commission on adaptation recently found that investing 1 8 trillion in five key areas to build resilience globally could generate 7 1 trillion in total net benefits between 2020 and 2030 the conditions to finance an ambitious program of climate action are better than ever given that real interest rates for long term government borrowing in parts of the world are at zero or even negative the international community must seize these oppportunities and step up finance and other support to the poorest and most vulnerable to ensure a rapid and just transition to a resilient low carbon and inclusive growth path but there is resistance from vested interests in the old economy that resistance is quick to latch on to the limitations of any climate policies that do not put people first where there are genuine concerns by citizens these can and must be addressed social unrest in france chile ecuador and elsewhere has shown that climate action is only politically viable if it delivers clear benefits to the vast majority of people now and it cannot leave vulnerable communities or workers behind to be politically viable corrective measures must accompany any policies that may place a higher burden on low and middle income households the process of developing and implementing these policies is just as important a transparent and deliberative process can help identify political and material risks improve communication between decision makers and the public and give agency to socially and economically marginalized groups fortunately there is ample evidence showing that policies that address climate change developed through inclusive processes can also deliver immediate benefits to people we call this people centered climate action people centered climate action does three things through an inclusive process it purposefully identifies and unlocks social and economic benefits it targets these benefits to further equity and it ensures a just and well managed transition away from a high carbon economy examples of people centered climate action include using the revenues from carbon pricing or savings from cuts in fossil fuel subsidies to support low income or vulnerable communities employing innovative financing to boost energy access through distributed solar power and restoring ecosystems in ways that also raise rural incomes the transition to a low carbon and climate resilient economy is starting the finance sector is waking up to the risks of high carbon and stranded fossil fuel assets and is rapidly shifting away from them toward green alternatives over 700 major businesses have committed to science based targets for emissions reductions with many now aiming for net zero emissions by 2050 over 100 cities have committed to net zero targets investors are considering how their actions can support rather than hamper inclusive development and a just transition these private sector and sub national leaders are now calling on national governments to follow their lead some governments have committed to mid century net zero emission goals and so far 68 countries have indicated that they will enhance their paris agreement targets in 2020 but these countries are mostly smaller economies often those most vulnerable to climate impacts and together are responsible for only 8 of global emissions leaders of some of the world s major emitter economies are hesitating at a time when they should instead be accelerating action amidst signs of a global economic slow down some leaders are falling back on outdated notions that there is a trade off between climate action on one hand and economic and social progress on the other those resisting the low carbon transition are quick to resurface these notions but as the global transition to a new climate economy progresses the political and policy grip of those with vested interests in the old economy such as the fossil fuel sector will wane they will increasingly be counter balanced by voices from the new climate economy solar companies consumer goods companies committed to deforestation free supply chains for example central to this rising chorus are the youth and voting public demanding climate action people around the world are also crying out for more equal access to decently paid jobs for health care and education and for a better future for their children the world now stands at a crossroads we can and must deliver both ambitious climate action and better lives for people and there is no viable alternative growth and development benefits will only be sustainable if we tackle climate change and ambitious climate action is only possible if it delivers benefits for people we must take the leap and with people firmly at the center accelerate the transition to the inclusive and sustainable growth story of the 21st century the need for bold and inclusive climate action is more apparent than ever globally we have made remarkable progress in tackling poverty in recent decades due in significant part to robust economic growth despite population growth nearly 1 1 billion fewer people live in extreme poverty today than in 1990 but continued progress is being compromised by growing economic inequality in some countries today the world s 26 wealthiest people own as much in financial assets as the entire poorer half of humanity while unemployment fell in 2018 most of the world s 3 3 billion employed people have jobs that do not offer a decent living economic security or workplace protections as a result people are taking to the streets to call for decent jobs health care and education and for a better future for their children at the same time communities are increasingly facing the devastating impacts of climate change from increasingly severe and frequent storms to hot and dry conditions that fuel wildfires droughts and crippling heatwaves it is the poorest who are most vulnerable to these impacts often lacking the resources to adapt or move they are also often those who have contributed the least greenhouse gas emissions climate change is unfair poor people tend to live in the areas most vulnerable to climate change about 14 of people in developing countries live in low lying coastal zones nearly 29 of the world s population lives in arid regions these communities are particularly susceptible to droughts and floods climate change disproportionately hurts the young and the old and it exacerbates gender inequity as women are usually responsible for fetching water and gathering firewood tasks that climate change makes much harder the more the world falls behind the temperature goals of the paris agreement the more we will see climate impacts hampering development and economic progress we have already witnessed about 1 degree celsius 1 8 f of global warming and by 2030 we are likely to have missed our last chance of meeting the 1 5oc goal for millions of people a half degree change in average global temperature rise makes a world of difference on a planet 1 5 oc warmer 14 of the population will be exposed to extreme heatwaves at least once every five years at 2 oc that rises to 37 of people those who have no choice but to face the heat people who labor outside people without air conditioning bear the brunt of this burden approximately 820 million people worldwide live in coastal areas less than 10 meters 33 feet above sea level more than 10 of the world s population sea level rise has recently accelerated as the warming ocean expands and polar ice sheets melt as a result it is expected that rising seas could impact three times more people by 2050 than previously estimated with 2oc of warming farmers fishing communities and food security will suffer further maize crop losses and fishery declines from climate change will be double those expected from 1 5oc of warming indonesia s low carbon development initiative a report by the indonesian government in 2019 assessed the benefits of various economic paths that could deliver low carbon development for the economy the analysis found that a development path that could cut greenhouse gas emissions nearly 43 by 2030 would have significant social and economic benefits as well compared with business as usual bau in 2045 the benefits of a low carbon development path would include over 15 million additional jobs which are greener and better paid cutting extreme poverty in half to 4 2 of the population relative to 2018 saving about 40 000 lives every year from reduced air and water pollution a smaller opportunity gap between women and men and between indonesia s different provinces average gdp growth rates of 6 per year stronger than under bau from the first year with an additional 5 4 trillion added to the country s gdp by 2045 the indonesian government is now incorporating the results of this analysis into its next 5 year economic development plan for 2020 24 and into provincial development plans climate action can deliver social and economic benefits with careful design and implementation inclusive climate policies can contribute to higher incomes and living standards more and better jobs and more resources for governments to provide public goods and services other benefits include improved services and infrastructure for deprived populations cleaner air and water better health and protection from the loss of life and livelihoods that accompanies extreme weather research by the new climate economy finds that bold climate action can deliver at least 26 trillion in net global economic benefits through 2030 compared to business as usual as well as a range of employment health and other benefits the social and economic benefits of climate mitigation policies include higher income and living standards clean infrastructure investment is a springboard for rapid gains in incomes poverty reduction and energy access especially in developing countries as well as gains in global equity rapid innovation and the growing cost competitiveness of clean energy make it possible to quickly expand infrastructure for energy access without increasing air pollution efficiency gains in energy and materials use drive productivity growth the most important long term driver of income growth adopting the most efficient technologies can lead to large cost savings and translate into lower prices for consumers employment gains cutting carbon emissions increases jobs in green industries while decreasing jobs in high carbon ones in 2018 the renewable energy sector employed at least 11 million people worldwide and is the fastest growing source of jobs in several countries transitioning to a low carbon economy could deliver up to 65 million new low carbon jobs by 2030 more than offsetting a decline of 28 million in high carbon sectors such a significant restructuring of labor markets requires strong labor protections to ensure these jobs are decent and pay appropriate wages countries will need to implement strong proactive policies to assist and help reskill workers in declining sectors and support economic diversification in highly affected communities massive gains in public health burning fossil fuels creates harmful indoor and outdoor air pollution the global welfare costs of air pollution were estimated to be about 3 trillion in 2015 doubling renewables in the global energy mix by 2030 could save up to 4 million lives since people with lower incomes are typically more exposed to local air pollution they may benefit more from its reduction a gain for social equity moving to plant based diets which are less carbon intensive could also yield large public health benefits particularly in developed and emerging economies where high levels of meat and dairy consumption contribute to poor health outcomes including high rates of heart disease more social equity with careful policy design the poor stand to benefit the most from gains from clean cheap public transport clean infrastructure investments like distributed solar power can also benefit the poor by increasing energy access lowering costs and reducing air pollution and health risks revenues from carbon pricing and savings from the reform of fossil fuel subsidies can be recycled to better target support to low income or other vulnerable populations ensuring they are at least as well off or ideally better off under the policy reforms a healthier natural environment many climate policies contribute to a healthier natural environment for example by reducing deforestation and pollution healthier natural environments can better provide ecosystem services which are the essential support systems for life on earth and the economy and most importantly avoiding environmental damage will benefit all people but particularly the poor and vulnerable a tailor in rural tanzania sews at night using a d light solar lantern photo by usaid people centered climate action is possible solving the climate crisis in an unequal world will require people centered climate action policies that unlock the potential social benefits of climate action policies that address the needs of low income and disadvantaged groups and enhance social equity policies that ensure a well managed and socially just transition with these attributes people centered climate action can gain the public support and political buy in required to make significant and lasting change climate action that exacerbates inequalities on the other hand will not succeed there are emerging examples of people centered climate action in a range of sectors and countries including in spain after intense social dialogue the government struck a deal with trade unions in 2018 to phase out the country s coal industry the plan includes a just transition for coal producing regions with the government pledging 250 million 278 million over the next decade toward professional training social protection and new economic

retirement of the estimated 5 6 million people who would be laid off as a result of eliminating coal or steel sector overcapacity the kenya based green belt movement has planted millions of trees on degraded land since the 1970s it was founded with explicit goals to improve rural women s lives and livelihoods responding to their need for water food firewood and increased incomes opportunities for people centered climate mitigation this section identifies opportunities for people centered climate action in the key sectors of energy cities and food and land use putting a price on carbon and recycling the revenues to enhance equity carbon pricing and fossil fuel subsidy reform are among the most effective ways to encourage households businesses and infrastructure providers to use efficient low carbon energy both policies can bolster government fiscal balances carbon pricing programs are already in place or scheduled to start soon in 76 countries and subnational regions globally argentina singapore and south africa are the latest to launch carbon price initiatives all in 2019 existing carbon pricing programs raised about 44 billion in government revenues in 2018 applied more broadly carbon pricing and fossil fuel subsidy reform could raise 2 8 trillion per year in government revenues in 2030 how these revenues are used can have important repercussions on the distributive effects of carbon pricing carbon pricing can have a regressive impact on income distribution unless designed with a redistributive approach that recycles revenues back to people through public programs tax credits or direct payments where it is not concerns about the distributional impacts of fuel prices or fossil fuel subsidy reforms can lead to major social unrest in ecuador a sudden end to fuel subsidies in 2019 lead to rioting in the streets while the latest rise in fuel taxes was the spark that set off the yellow vest protests in france in 2018 the underlying motivation is not the policies themselves but the fact that people simply cannot live on today s wage levels there are compelling examples of redistributing revenues from carbon taxes in ways that leave households better off in canada revenue from british columbia s carbon tax are recycled to residents through individual and corporate tax rate cuts and through a low income climate action tax credit low and middle income households are better off under the carbon tax than without it canada s federal carbon tax introduced in 2019 is similarly accompanied by a tax rebate scheme that creates a net economic benefit for a majority of households other countries also show that well designed reforms can benefit poor and vulnerable groups when indonesia reduced its fossil fuel subsidies in 2005 and 2008 it established a system of cash transfers to 19 million poor and near poor households to offset higher energy prices more than two thirds of the total benefits went to the poorest 40 of the population and cash transfer recipients showed improved education health and employment outcomes revenues from carbon pricing can also help to fund a just transition for fossil fuel workers the international monetary fund recently found that providing fair unemployment benefits retraining and relocation opportunities to coal workers could cost less than 2 of the revenues from a 50 ton carbon tax in china india the uk and the u s finally country experience is bolstering confidence that carbon pricing is compatible with economic growth sweden implemented a carbon tax in 1991 which has now reached 150 per ton of co2 while remaining a highly prosperous and still growing developed economy california has grown somewhat faster than the overall u s economy since launching its cap and trade program in 2012 british columbia has similarly outpaced growth in most of the rest of canada since adopting a carbon tax in 2008 1 energy progress in clean energy technologies is transforming our ability to expand access to electricity in ways that also limit air pollution and carbon dioxide co2 emissions this progress is also rapidly reducing costs since 2010 solar panel costs have fallen by 85 and wind power by 49 making clean energy cost competitive with coal and increasingly with natural gas in many regions it would now be cheaper to replace three quarters of existing u s coal plants with wind and solar power than to keep them operating with coal and with falling costs and new developments around battery storage technologies and integration into the grid solutions to the variable supply of renewables are emerging however even the more advanced g7 economies on average produce 19 of their electricity from coal and they provide at least 100 billion per year in subsidies to the coal oil and gas industries slowing the market driven transition it is time for policymakers and investors to focus on clean energy solutions and stop subsidizing coal despite policy barriers the deployment of renewables and the accompanying jobs is accelerating in many regions of the world in the u s alone clean energy employs nearly 3 3 million people outnumbering jobs in the fossil fuel industry 3 to 1 however these are not always good jobs with decent wages benefits and rights at work governments and employers need to do more to ensure job quality some already are the pledge for a just transition to decent jobs encourages renewable energy developers producers and buyers to commit to employment standards including social dialogue labor standards of the international labor organization ilo and social protection for their employees and those of their contractors enel ørsted autodesk safaricom and unilever are among the companies that have signed the pledge in the philippines the green jobs act of 2016 included provisions on workers rights and fair incomes to protect workers in green industries distributed renewable energy systems are quickly creating new opportunities for energy access in developing countries for instance in 2017 off grid solutions provided electricity access to 152 million people up from 20 million in 2011 off grid solar home systems are spreading quickly in some places offering affordable access to limited amounts of electricity for example in many african countries commercial companies are using a pay as you go model to rent solar home systems to consumers who use their mobile phones to make payments until they own the system m kopa one of the biggest companies estimates that each household saves 650 in avoided kerosene costs over the first four years some clean energy opportunities have spurred an increase in women s participation in the energy sector in nigeria tanzania and uganda the women led social enterprise solar sister has built a network of over 2 500 women entrepreneurs that provide clean energy services to more than 350 000 people 2 cities around 900 million people worldwide live in slums without adequate access to water sanitation power and other infrastructure services they are often located in far flung locations exposed to natural hazards compact connected and clean cities can support inclusive growth and broad based improvements in quality of life with major benefits for economic productivity and emissions reduction new analysis conducted for the coalition for urban transitions shows that implementing low carbon measures in cities could support 87 million jobs in 2030 in sectors such as clean energy and public transport furthermore low carbon measures in cities could deliver over half the emission reductions needed to keep global temperature rise below 2 c a family on ecobici public bicycles in mexico city during a car free day downtown photo by aaron minnick wri agglomeration economies mean that the productivity of workers and businesses is higher in larger more densely populated cities particularly those with good public transport networks that enable people to easily reach jobs and services greater compactness allows cities to provide infrastructure and services more cost effectively in sub saharan africa for example the capital costs of providing piped water flush toilets power and landline telephones average 325 per person in the highest density cities but 665 in medium density cities and up to 2 837 in remote rural areas it is estimated that the low carbon investments needed to reduce urban emissions by 90 could collectively pay for themselves and then generate a stream of savings worth 23 9 trillion by 2050 in today s terms higher urban density can also reduce greenhouse gas emissions by cutting transport and residential energy consumption a recent analysis of 120 cities finds that after controlling for per capita income a 10 increase in urban density correlates with a 2 decrease in per capita carbon emissions urban planning and infrastructure policies play a key role in promoting productive urbanization in their absence market failures and bad policies in particular failures to provide critical public goods often contribute to unmanaged sprawl lowered economic productivity growth of slums over reliance on private motor vehicles severe congestion local air pollution inefficient energy use high greenhouse gas emissions and other negative spillovers urban infrastructure policies that provide for efficient mass public transit systems play a major role in averting many of these dysfunctions as well as improving social equity by providing low cost travel for the poor in medellín colombia a cable car system installed in the mid 2000s provided new transport options for slum dwellers living in favelas surrounding the city the cable car was used by about 30 000 favela residents daily enabling access to job or education opportunities in the city while cutting travel times by an hour on average it contributed to massive declines in violent crime and murders in lagos nigeria a low cost bus rapid transit system carries 200 000 passengers a day who enjoy shorter travel times and reduced fares compared to travel on private minibuses road congestion and traffic accidents along the route are down and co2 emissions have fallen by 13 since 2008 similarly in bogotá colombia the construction of a bus rapid transit system benefited poor residents the most with poor commuters saving 18 minutes per trip and average 0 50 in daily savings 8 12 of the average daily income for bogotá s low income population to lift all boats national governments need to proactively plan for a just urban transition which requires far sighted collaboration with local governments for national leaders creating such cities would yield short term political dividends and secure long term national prosperity 3 food and land use improving agricultural practices and land use is a critical aspect of the interrelated challenges of feeding the world ensuring sustainable rural livelihoods and addressing climate change 820 million people are malnourished and regularly go hungry more than two thirds of the global poor more than 500 million people live in rural areas where they often experience inequitable access to land and resources and poor access to markets which can lead to heavy losses of produce before it s even sold by 2050 the world will need to feed nearly 10 billion people the difference between the amount of food produced in 2010 and the amount needed to feed nearly 10 billion people is estimated at 7 400 trillion calories that s a 56 increase from what we produced in in 2010 but we simply cannot use 56 more land instead we must sustainably increase productivity on current agricultural land to avoid further expansion into natural areas a recent report from the food and land use coalition suggests that key improvements in food and land use systems could indeed improve global food security while at the same time leading to doubled rural income growth and over 120 million new jobs in poor rural communities total economic gains from transforming food and land use systems could reach 5 7 trillion a year by 2030 linked to reduced greenhouse gas emissions preservation of natural capital improved human health and gains in agricultural productivity and food distribution systems so called climate smart agriculture covers a myriad of old and new production systems including holistic landscape farming and techniques ranging from intercropping and integrated crop livestock management to improved water soil and nutrient management done effectively climate smart agriculture can lead to higher productivity that creates better jobs and income for farmers mitigates greenhouse gas emissions and increases climate resilience farmers in niger for example have adopted improved landscape management approaches greatly increasing tree and shrub cover on cropland by interplanting nitrogen fixing trees and allowing roots and stumps to regenerate the strategy has substantially increased productivity on 5 million hectares 12 4 million acres of land restored at least 250 000 hectares 617 763 acres of severely degraded land and provided food for 2 5 million people villagers in the nilgiri mountains of india practice agroforestry a form of climate smart agriculture that mixes crops with the native trees photo by james anderson wri higher productivity on existing lands reduces the pressure to clear forests forests generate multiple social and economic benefits including improved soil quality habitat for biodiversity and regulation of local and global climates forests support a variety of industries from fiber production to ecotourism protecting forests can go hand in hand with protecting people in bolivia brazil and colombia areas managed by indigenous people with secure land rights had two to three times less annual deforestation from 2000 2012 than similar areas of those countries not managed by indigenous people a shift to healthy plant based diets can also have enormous benefits for people and also for the climate shifting the diets of populations who consume high amounts of animal based foods toward plant based foods could result in global health related cost savings of almost 1 trillion per year by 2050 as well as avoiding future emissions related to changing land use by 37 168 gigatons of equivalent co2 gtco2e now is the time to finance the low carbon and climate resilient transition climate action will require new and different investments in many cases these will yield significant returns for instance a recent report from the global commission on adaptation found that investments of 1 8 trillion globally in five areas from 2020 to 2030 could generate 7 1 trillion in total net benefits similarly renewable energy often requires higher up front investments compared with fossil fuel power but these costs can be offset by savings on fuel many governments are concerned however that large scale climate action should not unsustainably increase public debt or contribute to macroeconomic instability one underappreciated factor that finance ministers should consider is that real interest rates on long term government debt have been falling for decades and are now near zero or negative in many developed countries analysis of the structural reasons behind this suggest that low interest rates may persist as a result the fiscal and welfare costs of government borrowing may be significantly lower than previously thought governments may be able to invest public funds in climate action in ways that are fiscally sustainable and that stimulate private investment but many developing countries do not have access to these very low real interest rates multilateral development banks and other international agencies can help to mobilize and channel low cost finance to developing countries and ensure all governments have the means to implement urgently needed climate action as of november 2019 27 countries have made pledges to the green climate fund gcf replenishment totalling 9 78 billion for the next four years with nearly 50 having at least doubled their pledges from the previous round this is an important start but the challenge now is to ensure that all development finance is aligned with the paris agreement and the sustainable development goals as countries develop their own strong low carbon and climate resilient economic growth plans as indonesia is doing through its low carbon development initiative these should guide the investment plans for the country with multilateral bilateral and private finance channeled to support them opportunities for people centered climate adaptation reducing greenhouse gas emissions is essential to avert the threat of catastrophic climate change yet historic emissions have locked in some global warming and climate change is exacting large human and economic costs through heatwaves floods drought storms and other extreme weather events recent analysis by the global commission on adaptation indicates that an investment of 1 8 trillion between 2020 and 2030 could yield benefits of 7 1 trillion over this period these benefits include avoided losses to farmers livelihoods to workers jobs and wages avoided damage to homes businesses and infrastructure and avoided deaths trauma and illness climate adaptation can especially benefit the poor who tend to live in areas more exposed to natural hazards like landslides or flooding the social gains of adaptation will be greater and more equitable if poor and vulnerable populations participate in the planning and design of public policies contributing unique local knowledge and voicing their specific needs five areas of action should be prioritized to strengthen the resilience of our communities and systems to climate change and in some cases also contribute to reducing emissions 1 strengthen early warning systems flooding affects 250 million people each year with around 84 of floods occurring in developing countries floods cause an average of 5 000 6 000 deaths annually and overall economic costs from deaths and direct and indirect economic damages have been estimated to exceed 70 billion per year with over 80 of these costs in developing countries meteorological early warning systems alongside critical infrastructure e g roads and bridges used for evacuation and environmental buffers e g mangrove forests that protect coasts from storm surges can mitigate much of the damage from natural disasters early warning of an approaching flood gives people time to move to safer ground allows authorities to help the most vulnerable and enables businesses to protect property and infrastructure studies suggest that a 24 hour warning can reduce asset damage from floods by around 30 and a 48 hour warning by up to 50 investments to upgrade early warning systems especially in developing countries are expected to have a high benefit cost ratio a 10 billion investment would yield benefits of around 100 billion between 2020 to 2030 in bangladesh better early warning systems combined with civic awareness campaigns cyclone shelters strengthening buildings and improving post disaster recovery have dramatically reduced deaths from cyclones 300 000 people died from cyclone bhola in 1970 but only 5 in the entire country died from cyclone fani in 2019 2 protect mangrove forests mangrove forests extend along 700 000 kilometers roughly 435 000 miles of coastline in 123 countries forming a natural seawall that limits damage from flooding worldwide mangroves reduce the cost of damage to property from coastal flooding by over 80 billion per year while reducing the number of people affected by coastal floods by 18 million other services provided by mangroves include the provision of raw materials and food for coastal communities nurseries for offshore fisheries and recreation opportunities the benefits of mangrove preservation significantly outweigh the value of forgone opportunities such as aquaculture 3 improve dryland crop production dryland farming refers to farming that relies entirely on rainfall undertaken in relatively dry areas of the world drylands cover 41 of the earth s surface and are home to 30 of the human population including the majority of the world s poor dryland agriculture typically produces low and variable yields because of low and erratic rainfall high temperatures poor soil quality and land degradation especially in developing countries in sub saharan africa crop productivity per unit of water consumed is only 20 40 of the world average climate change will likely exacerbate the challenges of dryland farming in sub saharan africa with even higher temperatures more erratic rainfall and more extreme weather events reducing yields by 10 15 investments to increase the adoption of modern farming technologies and practices optimized for dryland conditions could significantly help poor smallholder farmers in developing areas better adapt to climate change increasing incomes and slashing poverty methods include greater uptake of new crop varieties that provide higher yields with limited water improved soil management and more efficient water management such interventions could boost cereal yields in sub saharan africa by 70 140 globally investing 150 billion in dryland agricultural productivity from 2020 to 2030 could generate net economic benefits of over 850 billion 4 manage water resources the impacts of climate change are channeled primarily through the water cycle improved water management can help countries better adapt to water scarcity and more variable supply water service providers have traditionally relied on gray or built infrastructure such as dams and water treatment plants today the water management sector draws increasingly on green infrastructure such as forests farms and floodplains that can increase the quantity and quality of water downstream the returns for investing in water resource management can be substantial especially for green infrastructure new york city s efforts to protect its watershed have cost 1 5 billion since the 1990s but have averted the need to build new water treatment facilities costing 8 billion yielding a benefit cost ratio of 5 1 green infrastructure is likely to have substantial co benefits including carbon sequestration reduced air pollution and improved health healthier ecosystems and recreation opportunities better planning and incentives could dramatically improve the efficiency of water use the world bank estimates that by 2050 policy reforms in water resource management could increase developing regions gdp by 8 20 relative to a business as usual scenario a participatory approach can ensure that individual people and families benefit in togo the government and civil society organizations engaged local women and youth in developing an ecosystem based project to revitalize water reservoirs and build climate resilience the project improved crop yields and created new livelihood opportunities like market gardening fisheries and brick construction all stemming from greater water availability and security 5 build resilient infrastructure any disruptions to power transport water and other infrastructure systems exact heavy costs on households and businesses the economic damages to households and businesses in low and middle income countries from disruptions of power transport and water systems are estimated at 391 647 billion annually in 2007 tropical storm sidr knocked out the entire power grid of bangladesh leaving the country s population without power for up to a week and causing 1 7 billion of economic losses in tanzania firms suffer losses equal to 1 8 of gdp annually due to power transport and water disruptions of which 40 are caused by rain and floods improving the resilience of infrastructure requires action at several levels physical assets such as roads power lines and bridges need strengthening to resist natural hazards recent studies estimate that improving the climate resilience of new infrastructure assets typically costs 2 5 of the total cost of the assets the cost of such investments would be about 1 1 trillion from 2020 to 2030 the benefits include both avoided damage to physical infrastructure and avoided costs of infrastructure disruptions for households and businesses the present value of such benefits over the lifetime of this resilient infrastructure is estimated at around 5 trillion giving a 5 1 ratio of benefits to costs a new decade demands a new approach policymaking can be painstaking and slow good policymaking can be even slower the trials of the process often cause ministers and decision makers to rely too heavily on input from interest groups with enough power and access to make their voices heard in many cases these vested interests have pushed back against climate action and in favor of the status quo as the transition progresses the political and policy grip of the fossil fuel industry and others blocking change will wane to succeed the global transition to a new climate economy needs to be people centered and offer the prospect of a fairer world if it does more and more people will see their future in it and will support change we have not seen the end of the social unrest that erupted in 2019 but 2020 provides leaders with a unique opportunity to train their gaze and focus on social benefits enhanced equity and a just transition as countries revise their climate plans and scale up implementation we know how to develop smart climate programs and policy reforms that improve people s lives and livelihoods immediately while safeguarding development gains and economic growth into the future we can and must get these programs and reforms right the people are watching

a weaker currency is a national tariff after we get a weaker currency we have to take advantage of that or else we will waste it once more in inflation and in the inability to raise competitiveness uday kota did it ever occur you that ghana will be having new cedi notes is having the 100 cedi and 200 cedi note a good idea unlike all other days 29th november was different waking up to the news of the bank of ghana issuing new cedi notes of 100 cedis and 200 hundred cedis this means that in addition to the existing notes we would have a 2 cedi coin 100cedis and 200 cedis notes as well in this article we will give a brief account and trajectory of how the ghana currency has fared post independence with emphasis on the major redenomination in that took place in 2007 we will further examine the performance of the currency after the redenomination from 2008 to date and finally consider if the introduction of the new notes is a bailout or doom to the current economic development down memory lane prior to independence ghana then gold coast was under the west african currency board wacb that issued the currency pound shillings and penny to its member states after independence ghana constituted its monetary authority that oversaw that affairs of currency in july 1965 the new currency cedi and pesewa were introduced marking ghana s departure from the colonial monetary system cedi derived from sedie meaning cowrie also an ancient currency used by the natives pesewa also the name chosen to replace the penny was the smallest denomination among the currencies since independence ghana has undertaken three redenomination exercises with 2007 being when the recent and major redenomination was carried out the exercise redenomination in 2007 sought to restore the value of the cedi which had declined tremendously over the years 2007 redenomination the redenomination of the cedi was part of governments efforts to combat the nearly hyperinflation that was faced by ghana the bank of ghana justified the transition stating the old note regime placed a significant deadweight burden on the economy which was a legacy of long periods of high inflation and currency devaluation the redenomination also was to boost the confidence in the ghanaian currency as against other foreign currencies the ghanaian cedi became equivalent to the united states dollar this in the long run was intended to discourage transactions in foreign currency the redenomination also made it easier to carry large sums of money in small quantities post redenomination 2008 to date the behaviour of economy is controlled by both internal and external indicators and much control cannot be exerted on the external indicators the redenomination caused currency illusion effect that influenced public behaviour and caused a significant increase in consumption afterwards with time inflation rate increased which caused prices of goods and services to rise and in effect a gradual decline in the value of the cedi sadly the economy seems to be validating high inflation instead of trying to reign it in gearing toward cashless economy the government of ghana recently announced the urge to drive towards a digital and cashless economy the vice president dr alhaji mahamoud bawumia on 10th may 2018 officially launched the cashless and interoperability system this means more transactions would be carried out electronically which will cause the hard or physical cash in circulation to reduce the vice president has added that the digital economy will not only draw people into the economy but also curb corruption government has spent lots of money to make mobile money transactions interoperable across networks this has enabled the flow of mobile money transactions without the barrier of different network providers again according to the governor of the bank of ghana the central bank is in discussion with key stakeholders to explore a pilot project on central bank digital currency with the possibility of issuing an e cedi in the future interestingly the bank of ghana introduces new 100 and 200 cedis note the reason is to ensure customer convenience reducing high transaction cost efficiency in high value transactions in cash and reduced cost of printing this however defeats the whole desire to drive towards a cashless system as prices of goods and services rapidly increase government is forced to pump more money into the economy this increase in the supply of money usually has no direct support from economic growth in the first few months it may seem to stabilize the economy but afterwards becomes a thorn in the flesh of the economy the eco dream in june 2019 authority of ecowas heads of state and government in nigeria s capital abuja adopted a single currency named the eco this currency is expected to take effect in january 2020 following the attainment of certain criteria ghana being at the helm of championing the eco to help the free trade agreement now introduces new cedi notes into its currency this begs the question is ghana really is committed to the implementation of the eco and the free trade agreement is the eco agreement by the nations of the sub region just a paper and handshake work with all these development discourse across policy and research it is fair to say that the eco has not gained enough relevance in ghana s plans and its realization might further be prolonged the bailout as far as macro and micro economics might be concerned this is a relief for the economy in most cases money is pumped into the economy and for a while ghanaians will feel the positive impact but all these tend to be short lived the peril what s going to happen when these higher denomination are in circulation with already existing note is that as supply of money increases prices of goods may also rise smaller denominations will soon lose their value and gradually fade out of the system and this may gradually contribute to increasing inflation local holders of currency begin to switch to stable things hence finding solace in foreign currencies banks will constantly avoid lending money for small business growth because of the collapse of the domestic economy which will eventually lead to a barter economy the gradual step towards becoming a hyperinflation state like zimbabwe may be ignited unless necessary step is taken to meet the situation halfway the necessary bailout ghana in the wake of its problems need to work on fixing the problem of fiscal imbalance and a strong monetary anchor taking clue from examples of the united states ghana can engage in a contractionary monetary policy reducing the money supply in the economy when there s a decline in money supply those with money tend to favor saving money more this in turn reduces spending slows down the economy and decreases the rate of inflation also to ensure a gradual shift towards a cashless and digital economy bigger transactions should be encouraged via electronic channels instead of the introduction of larger denominations ghana with the mindset of going cashless in the near future must chatter a focused path in doing so printing new currency notes will only serve as a renegade to that great motive by timothy dziedzom amaglo mensah jacqueline simpson
greg hinz according to a report last week from s p global ratings illinois as of the end of fiscal 2018 had 41 3 billion in unfunded other post employment benefits opebs in our case retiree health care a few other states owe more in unfunded opebs with texas at 99 billion and change new jersey at 90 5 billion and new york state at 65 billion but they at least are doing a better job at catching up and putting some money aside for the future pay as you go illinois currently is putting in just 11 1 percent of the total needed to meet annual costs and pay interest on deferred costs each year and relative to paying those two and actually reducing the debt it contributes just 7 5 percent of what would be needed to eventually reach full funding texas new jersey and new york at least are putting in 20 percent or more of what s needed twice what we do
pakistan has been hit with a serious financial crisis the underlying causes may range from poor decision making decreased exports low level of savings and investment low wages increasing unemployment

a massive revenue shortfall of rs220 4 billion in the first five months july nov period of the current fiscal year alone faced with this gloomy financial situation pakistan does not have any other option except to seek foreign direct investment fdi from overseas and loans from friendly countries and international financial institutions such as the international monetary fund imf world bank and

foreign debt stands at 106 3 billion pakistan might be the only country which is a recipient of an imf loan and loan and fdi from china this has put the country s fragile economy under the heavy burden of rising loans financial colonization of developing countries started in the 1980s when fdi replaced aid and imf loans were conditioned with monetary and fiscal reforms since then it has spawned more poverty and inequalities than healed the ailing economies of developing countries the very purpose of financialization was to control the economies of developing countries after the

offer them another vote on how they want brexit to proceed and if they still think it should go ahead opinion polls showing the conservative party with a big lead have fuelled a scintillating pound rally and short sterling positions have been cut to seven month lows the belief is the conservatives will quickly implement brexit and end the uncertainty that s weighed on the economy since 2016

currency volatility everywhere is at record lows sterling vol is approaching this year s highs what are the risks one that the polls have got it wrong and britain will get another hung parliament

paul volcker the metaphorical and literal giant he stood 6 7 tall of central banking who as chair of the federal reserve ended america s period of high inflation by inducing a recession in the early 1980s has died at age 92 a veteran bureaucrat in the treasury department and then vice chair at the fed volcker was appointed to lead the fed by president jimmy carter in 1979 as core inflation was nearing 10 percent unemployment was low but steadily rising even a long recession from 1973 to 1975 hadn t slowed inflation giving rise to the term stagflation to refer to the unusual combination of price increases and economic sluggishness for years the nixon ford and carter administrations had experimented with wage and price controls in which the federal government directly limited increases in wages and prices in order to tame inflation without requiring the fed to raise interest rates ford and carter favored voluntary measures after nixon s experiment with mandatory controls failed ford launched a public campaign to whip inflation now complete with buttons and suggestions for individual action to tame inflation he pinned a win button on ex beatle george harrison in a desperate bid for the effort to catch on with the public none of these efforts sufficed to return inflation to stable low levels volcker s stiff tightening and forced recessions however did they solidified him as the most influential and arguably most powerful fed chair in american history willing to use his appointed position to take politically unpopular actions that elected officials never would to his admirers he is the pinnacle of what the economics profession has to offer harvard s ken rogoff once called him arguably the greatest federal reserve chairman of the 20th century to his detractors he is emblematic of the fed s undemocratic seizure of power over the economy who actively worsened conditions for working people in service of technocratic goals how paul volcker tamed inflation before volcker came into office the fed had tried small increases in interest rates in hopes of taming inflation to little avail volcker as vice chair was among the hawks on the federal open markets committee pushing for major action after a couple of modest increases in the first month of his tenure he called a surprise meeting on october 6 1979 and set on a new dramatically tighter course of monetary policy the fed would allow a much wider band on interest rates effectively allowing them to go higher than before and announced it would recalibrate policy regularly in response to changes in the money supply if the money supply was growing too quickly the fed would crack down harder that month the fed s interest rate was set at 13 7 percent by april it had spiked a full four points to 17 6 percent it would near 20 percent at times in 1981 the approach took two tries to get its intended effect volcker s tightening slowed economic activity enough that by january 1980 the us was in recession but fed interest rates actually began falling sharply after april which limited the effectiveness of the fed s anti inflation efforts the fed tightened again after that and sparked another recession in july 1981 this one was far worse than the first while unemployment peaked at 7 8 percent during the 1980 recession it would peak at 10 8 percent in december 1982 in the middle of the 16 month long second volcker recession that s a higher level than at the peak of the great recession in 2009 when volcker left office in august 1987 inflation was down to 3 4 percent from its peak of 9 8 percent in 1981 after the first volcker recession failed to drive prices down persistent low inflation has been the norm ever since the us has never had inflation above 5 percent since september 1983 to his admirers he was the most successful fed chair in history who beat back the inflation problem even when his actions were greatly unpopular one of the people who denounced volcker s moves was then senate majority leader robert byrd who declared after volcker announced his new effort in october 1979 attempting to control inflation or protect the dollar by throwing legions of people out of work and shutting down shifts in our factories and mines is a hopeless policy building contractors and carpenters mailed volcker s office 2x4s that they weren t able to use to build homes as the mortgage market had dried up farmers protested by blockading the fed headquarters with tractors ben bernanke who served as fed chair from 2006 to 2014 kept one of those 2x4s in his office telling the new york times that volcker came to represent independence he personified the idea of doing something politically unpopular but economically necessary paul volcker was a giant he advanced our understanding of monetary policy and macroeconomics by taming inflation he made better the lives of millions of people rest in peace michael r strain michaelrstrain december 9 2019 but the program came at a huge human cost that has led critics to ask whether volcker could have broken the back of inflation in a more humane way without triggering the highest levels of unemployment since the great depression historian tim barker in a review of volcker s recent memoirs for n 1 notes that liberal economists of the time like nobel winners kenneth arrow paul samuelson and james tobin rejected the idea of an induced recession as unnecessarily harsh barker also blames the volcker shock for setting off a wave of financialization in the us high interest rates made it hard for brick and mortar businesses to borrow for productive investment and drew foreign money seeking higher returns into us banks offering high rates ironically volcker s last major effort in public life after a long career at the wall street investment bank wolfensohn was promoting what he called the volcker rule a strict limitation on commercial banks ability to gamble with their own money on stocks bonds and other commodities a version of the rule made it into the 2010 dodd frank financial reform act the volcker shock of the early 1980s also set off a debt crisis in latin america many latin american governments had borrowed from us banks who now charged far higher interest rates after volcker s hikes debt ballooned and in 1982 mexico defaulted on its debts with others to follow the international monetary fund stepped in partially at the urging of volcker and the fed as a lender of last resort bailing out latin american governments in exchange for promises to lower deficit spending and adopt structural economics reform many governments responded by cutting health and other social services with critics arguing they worsened the economic plight of recipients and perhaps even cost lives by weakening health systems volcker who studied at princeton harvard and the london school of economics is survived by his wife anke dening his son james his daughter janice zima and four grandchildren

care and repair left politics in the age of climate change care and repair left politics in the age of climate change the green new deal will need to be subject to constant vigilance and pressure from experts who understand exactly what it will take and from social movements that have decades of experience bearing the brunt of false climate solutions members of the sunrise movement rally on august 13 2019 outside of the dnc headquarters erik mcgregor pacific press lightrocket via getty images at the conservative political action conference cpac in 2019 right wing luminaries set their sights tightly focused on two targets the green new deal and democratic socialism for them one and the same it s a watermelon ousted trump white house adviser sebastian gorka summarized with his usual theatrics green on the outside deep deep communist red on the inside they want to take your pickup truck they want to rebuild your home they want to take away your hamburgers this is what stalin dreamt about but never achieved like climate change deniers claims that global warming is a marxist plot to steal american freedom the idea of a green new deal is nothing new and both are experiencing a revival in late 2018 the intergovernmental panel on climate change published a landmark report informing us that global emissions need to be slashed roughly in half in less than twelve years a target that simply cannot be met without the world s largest economy playing a game changing leadership role once democrats took back the house that year house speaker nancy pelosi let it be known that her plan for meeting this historic moment was to convene a toothless committee to further study the endlessly studied crisis shortly after the midterm election but before the swearing in young climate activists with the sunrise movement let it be known that they weren t having any of it demanding a green new deal sunrise invited 200 people to stage protests on capitol hill where they were supported by several incoming members of congress including ayanna pressley ilhan omar rashida tlaib who spoke at one of the sunrise rallies and alexandria ocasio cortez like tlaib a member of the democratic socialists of america who famously visited their sit in of pelosi s office riding the tide of momentum and working with sunrise ocasio cortez s office made pelosi a counteroffer for how to meet the climate challenge in 2019 rather than expending all their political energy on a carbon pricing scheme that was sure to be politically unpopular while failing to bring down emissions with anything like the speed required the new congress should have a select committee on the green new deal that would over the course of a year create a detailed plan to get off fossil fuels in the united states by 2030 taking full advantage of what the proposal called the historic opportunity to virtually eliminate poverty in the united states that select committee was not created yet within four months more than 100 members of congress and virtually every 2020 democratic presidential hopeful had joined the call for a green new deal an economy wide mobilization for decarbonization along a science based timeline after decades of either silence or cautious moderation on climate change from democrats young activists and lawmakers had rewritten the rules of the possible in a matter of days to those outside the climate justice movement the speed seemed dizzying yet the ground for this momentum has been prepared for decades with models for community owned and community controlled renewable energy with justice based labor market transitions that make sure no worker is left behind with a deepening analysis of the intersections between systemic racism armed conflict and climate disruption with improved green tech and breakthroughs in clean public transit with the thriving fossil fuel divestment movement with model legislation driven at the state and city level that shows how carbon pricing if progressively designed can fight racial and gender exclusion and much more what had been missing until 2019 was the top level political power to roll out the best of these models all at once with the focus and velocity that both science and justice demand that is the great promise of a comprehensive green new deal in the largest economy on earth which is why the cpac crowd is right to worry ocasio cortez wasn t actually coming for their hamburgers but the green new deal was a true threat to their half century long ideological project no wonder gorka s speech came with a full throated call to arms you are on the front lines of the war against communism coming back to america under the guise of democratic socialism the climate change denial movement that spawned these talking points is a creature of the ideological network that deserves the bulk of the credit for redrawing the global ideological map over the last four decades a 2013 study by riley dunlap and peter jacques found that a striking 72 percent of climate change denial books mostly published since the 1990s were linked to right wing think tanks like the heritage foundation and the cato institute a figure that rises to 87 percent if self published books are excluded many of these institutions were created in the late 1960s and early 1970s when u s business elites feared that public opinion was turning dangerously against capitalism and toward if not socialism then an aggressive keynesianism in response they launched a counterrevolution a richly funded intellectual movement that argued that greed and the limitless pursuit of profit were nothing to apologize for and offered the greatest hope for human emancipation that the world had ever known under this liberationist banner they fought for such policies as tax cuts and free trade deals and for the auctioning off of core state assets from phones to energy to water the package known in most of the world as neoliberalism at the end of the 1980s after a decade of margaret thatcher at the helm in the united kingdom and ronald reagan in the united states and with communism collapsing these ideological warriors were ready to declare victory history was officially over and there was in thatcher s often repeated words no alternative to their market fundamentalism filled with confidence the neoliberals next task was to systematically lock in the corporate liberation project in every country that had previously held out which was usually best accomplished in the midst of political turmoil and large scale economic crises further entrenched through free trade agreements and membership in the world trade organization it had all been going so well the project had even managed to survive more or less the 2008 financial collapse directly caused by a banking sector that had been liberated of so much burdensome regulation and oversight but to those gathered at cpac and similar confabs climate change is a threat of a different sort it isn t about the political preferences of republicans versus democrats it s about the physical boundaries of the atmosphere and the ocean if the dire projections coming out of the intergovernmental panel on climate change are left unchallenged and business as usual is indeed driving us straight toward civilization threatening tipping points then the implications are obvious the ideological crusade incubated in think tanks like cato and heritage will have to come to a screeching halt nor have the various attempts to soft pedal climate action as compatible with market logic carbon trading carbon offsets monetizing nature s services fooled these true believers one bit they know very well that ours is a global economy created by and fully reliant upon the burning of fossil fuels and that a dependency that foundational cannot be changed with a few gentle market mechanisms it requires heavy duty interventions sweeping bans on polluting activities deep subsidies for green alternatives pricey penalties for violations new taxes new public works programs reversals of privatizations the list of ideological outrages goes on and on everything in short that these think tanks which have always been public proxies for far more powerful corporate interests have been busily attacking for decades if the free market system really has set in motion physical and chemical processes that if allowed to continue even for one more decade threaten large parts of humanity at an existential level then their entire crusade to morally redeem capitalism has been for naught with stakes like these clearly greed is not so very good after all and that is what is behind the surge in climate change denial among hard core conservatives no they have not lost their minds they simply understand that as soon as they admit that climate change is real they will lose the central ideological battle of our time whether we need to plan and manage our societies to reflect our goals and values or whether that task can be left to the magic of markets here s my inconvenient truth i think these hard core ideologues understand the real significance of climate change better than most of the moderates in the so called center the ones who are still insisting that the response can be gradual and painless and that we don t need to go to war with anybody including the fossil fuel companies the deniers get plenty of the details wrong no it s not a communist plot authoritarian state socialism as we will see was terrible for the environment and brutally extractivist but when it comes to the scope and depth of change required to avert catastrophe they are right on the money fossil fuels and the deeper extractivist mindset that they represent built the modern world if we are part of industrial or postindustrial societies we are still living inside the story written in coal ever since the french revolution there have been pitched ideological battles within the confines of this story communists socialists and trade unions have fought for more equal distribution of the spoils of extraction winning major victories for the poor and working classes the human rights and emancipation movements of this period have also fought valiantly against industrial capitalism s treatment of whole categories of our species as human sacrifice zones no more deserving of rights than raw commodities are these struggles have also won major victories against the dominance based paradigm against slavery for universal suffrage for equality under the law and there have been voices in all of these movements that identified the parallels between the economic model s abuse of the natural world and its abuse of human beings deemed worthy of being sacrificed or at least uncounted karl marx for instance recognized capitalism s irreparable rift with the natural laws of life itself while feminist scholars have long recognized that patriarchy s dual war against women s bodies and against the body of the earth was connected to that essential corrosive separation between mind and body and between body and earth from which both the scientific revolution and industrial revolution sprang these challenges however were mainly in the intellectual realm francis bacon s original biblically inspired framework for the extractive economy remained largely intact the right of humans to place ourselves above the ecosystems that support us and to abuse the earth as if it were an inanimate machine the strongest challenges to this worldview have always come from outside its logic in those historical junctures when the extractive project clashes directly with a different older way of relating to the earth and that older way fights back this has been true from the earliest days of industrialization when english and irish peasants for instance revolted against the first attempts to enclose communal lands and it has continued in clashes between colonizers and indigenous peoples through the centuries right up to the indigenous led resistance to new fossil fuel projects pipelines coal mines export facilities that have delivered the climate movement s most significant victories in recent years but for those of us born and raised inside this system though we may well see the dead end flaw of its central logic it can remain intensely difficult to see a way out and how could it be otherwise post enlightenment western culture does not offer a road map for a way to live that is not based on an extractivist nonreciprocal relationship with nature this is where the right wing climate change deniers have overstated their conspiracy theories about what a cosmic gift global warming is to the left it is true that many climate responses reinforce progressive support for government intervention in the market for greater equality and for a more robust public sphere but the deeper message carried by the ecological crisis that humanity has to go a whole lot easier on the living systems that sustain us acting regeneratively rather than extractively is a profound challenge to large parts of the left as well as the right it s a challenge to some trade unions those trying to freeze in place the dirtiest jobs instead of fighting for the good clean jobs their members deserve and it s a challenge to the overwhelming majority of center left keynesians who still define economic success in terms of traditional measures of gdp growth regardless of whether that growth comes from low carbon sectors or rampant resource extraction it s a challenge too to those parts of the left that equated socialism with the authoritarian rule of the soviet union and its satellites though there was always a rich tradition particularly among anarchists that considered stalin s project an abomination of core social justice and collectivist principles because the fact is that those self described socialist states devoured resources with as much enthusiasm as did their capitalist counterparts and spewed waste just as recklessly before the fall of the berlin wall for instance czechs and russians had even higher carbon footprints per capita than canadians and australians which is why one of the only times the industrialized world has seen a precipitous emissions drop was after the economic collapse of the former soviet union in the early 1990s mao zedong for his part openly declared that man must conquer nature setting loose a devastating onslaught on the natural world that transitioned seamlessly from clear cuts under communism to mega dams under capitalism russia s oil and gas companies meanwhile were as reckless and accident prone under state socialist control as they are today in the hands of the oligarchs and russia s corporatist state and as i wrote in this changes everything too many recent left governments in latin america failed to diversify their economies away from fossil fuels and other raw commodity extraction when prices were high leaving them intensely vulnerable to right wing attacks when commodity prices collapsed putting their laudable poverty alleviation programs in dire jeopardy from brazil to venezuela to ecuador to argentina these left governments claimed they had no choice that they needed to pursue extractive policies in order to pay for programs that fought dire poverty and inequality and they have a point the transition to post carbon diversified economies should have been radically subsidized by wealthy economies in the global north as part of our collective climate debt forced to choose between poverty and pollution these governments chose pollution but those should never have been their only options let s acknowledge these difficult facts while also pointing out that countries with a strong democratic socialist tradition like denmark sweden costa rica and uruguay have some of the most visionary environmental policies in the world scandinavian style social democracy has undoubtedly produced some of the most significant green breakthroughs in the world from the visionary urban design of stockholm where roughly 74 percent of residents walk bike or take public transit to work to denmark s community controlled wind power revolution from all this we can conclude that socialism isn t necessarily ecological but that a new form of democratic ecosocialism with the humility to learn from indigenous teachings about the duties to future generations and the interconnection of all of life appears to be humanity s best shot at collective survival these are the stakes in the surge of movements and movement grounded political candidates who are advancing a democratic ecosocialist vision for the united states connecting the dots between the economic depredations caused by decades of neoliberal ascendency and the ravaged state of our natural world these movements and candidates whether or not they identify explicitly as democratic socialist are rejecting the neoliberal centrism of the establishment democratic party with its tepid market based solutions to the ecological crisis as well as the trumpian all out war on nature and they are also presenting a concrete alternative to the undemocratic extractivist socialists of both the past and present the sunrise movement and its supporters in congress chose to model the green new deal after president franklin d roosevelt s historic raft of programs understanding full well that a central task is to make sure that this mobilization does not repeat the ways in which its namesake excluded and further marginalized many vulnerable groups for instance new deal era programs and protections left out agricultural and domestic workers many of them black mexican immigrants some 1 million of whom faced deportation in the 1930s and indigenous people who won some gains in the new deal era but whose land rights were also violated by both massive infrastructure projects and some conservation efforts that is why frontline groups are mentioned repeatedly in the original green new deal resolution this mobilization has to right the wrongs of the last one or it has no chance of catching fire some deeper challenges about new deal logic remain to be tackled for instance so far much of the emphasis has rightly been on industrial transformation and job creation not nearly enough has been on the outsize role that consumption plays in what used to be called the american way of life or the way that a culture of overwork fuels cycles of disposable consumption stressed and overworked people need fast and easy everything our leading emission reduction experts tell us that if we are going to hit the targets demanded by science we in wealthy countries don t just need to consume green stuff we need to consume less stuff with a higher premium placed on activities like caregiving and the arts that are inherently low carbon despite these challenges i have written before about why the old new deal remains a useful touchstone for the kind of sweeping climate mobilization that is our only hope of lowering emissions in time in large part this is because there are so few historical precedents we can look to other than top down military mobilizations that show how every sector of life from forestry to education to the arts to housing to electrification can be transformed under the umbrella of a single society wide mission which is why it is so critical to remember that none of it would have happened without massive pressure from social movements fdr rolled out the new deal in the midst of a historic wave of labor unrest there was the teamsters rebellion and minneapolis general strike in 1934 the eighty three day shutdown of the west coast by longshore workers that same year and the flint sit down autoworkers strikes in 1936 and 1937 during this same period mass movements responding to the suffering of the great depression demanded sweeping social programs such as social security and unemployment insurance while socialists argued that abandoned factories should be handed over to their workers and turned into cooperatives upton sinclair the muckraking author of the jungle ran for governor of california in 1934 on a platform arguing that the key to ending poverty was full state funding of workers cooperatives he received nearly 900 000 votes but having been viciously attacked by the right and undercut by the democratic establishment he fell just short of winning the governor s office all of this is a reminder that the new deal was adopted by roosevelt at a time of such progressive and left militancy that its programs which seem radical by today s standards appeared at the time to be the only way to hold back a full scale revolution it s also a reminder that the new deal was a process as much as a project one that was constantly changing and expanding in response to social pressure from both the right and the left for example a program like the civilian conservation corps started with 200 000 workers but when it proved popular eventually grew to 2 million there is plenty of time to improve and correct a green new deal once it starts rolling out it needs to be more explicit about keeping carbon in the ground about nuclear and coal never being clean and about the connections between fossil fuels foreign wars and migration but we have only one chance to get this thing charged up and moving forward the more sobering lesson is that the kind of mass power that delivered the victories of the new deal era is far beyond anything possessed by current progressive movements even if they all combined their efforts that s why it is so urgent to use the green new deal framework as a potent tool to build that power a vision to both unite movements and dramatically expand them part of that involves turning what is being derided as a left wing laundry list or wish list into an irresistible story of the future connecting the dots between the many parts of daily life that stand to be transformed from healthcare to employment day care to jail cell clean air to leisure time the green new deal has been characterized as an unrelated grab bag because most of us have been trained to avoid a systemic and historical analysis of capitalism and to divide pretty much every crisis our system produces from economic inequality to violence against women to white supremacy to unending wars to ecological unraveling in walled off silos from within that rigid mindset it s easy to dismiss a sweeping and intersectional vision like the green new deal as a green tinted laundry list of everything the left has ever wanted now that the call for a green new deal is out there however the onus is on all of us who support it to help make the case for how our overlapping crises are indeed inextricably linked and can only be overcome with a holistic vision for social and economic transformation this is already beginning to happen for example rhiana gunn wright one of the leading architects of the green new deal has pointed out that just as thousands of people moved for jobs during the second world war era economic mobilization we should expect a great many to move again to be part of a renewables revolution and when they do unlinking employment from health care means people can move for better jobs to escape the worst effects of climate and re enter the labor market without losing investing big in public healthcare is also critical in light of the fact that no matter how fast we move to lower emissions it is going to get hotter and storms are going to get fiercer when those storms bash up against healthcare systems and electricity grids that have been starved by decades of austerity thousands pay the price with their lives as they so tragically did in post maria puerto rico and there are many more connections to be drawn those complaining about climate policy being weighed down by supposedly unrelated demands for access to healthcare and education would do well to remember that the caring professions most of them dominated by women are relatively low carbon and can be made even more so in other words they deserve to be seen as green jobs with the same protections the same investments and the same living wages as male dominated workforces in the renewables efficiency and public transit sectors meanwhile as gunn wright points out to make those sectors less male dominated family leave and pay equity are musts which is part of the reason both are included in the resolution drawing out these connections in ways that capture the public imagination will take a massive exercise in popular education and participatory democracy a first step is for every sector touched by the green new deal hospitals schools universities and more to make their own plans for how to rapidly decarbonize while furthering the green new deal s mission to eliminate poverty create good jobs and close the racial and gender wealth divides my favorite example of what this could look like comes from the canadian union of postal workers which has developed a bold plan to turn every post office in canada into a hub for a just green transition think solar panels on the roof charging stations out front a fleet of domestically manufactured electric vehicles from which union members not only deliver mail as well as local produce and medicine but also check in on seniors all supported by the proceeds of postal banking to make the case for a green new deal which explicitly calls for this kind of democratic decentralized leadership every sector in the united states should be developing similar visionary plans for their workplaces right now we have been trained to see our issues in silos they never belonged there in fact the impact of climate change on every part of our lives is far too expansive and extensive to begin to cover here but i do need to mention a few more glaring links that many are missing a job guarantee far from an opportunistic socialist addendum is a critical part of achieving a rapid and just transition it would immediately lower the intense pressure on workers to take the kinds of jobs that destabilize our planet because all would be free to take the time needed to retrain and find work in one of the many sectors that will be dramatically expanding this in turn will reduce the power of bad actors like the laborers international union of north america who are determined to split the labor movement and sabotage the prospects for this historic effort right out of the gate liuna came out swinging against the green new deal never mind that it contains stronger protections for trade unions and the right to organize than anything we have seen out of washington in three decades including the right of workers in high carbon sectors to democratically participate in their transition and to have jobs in clean sectors at the same salary and benefits levels as before there is absolutely no rational reason for a union representing construction workers to oppose what would be the biggest infrastructure project in a century unless liuna actually is what it appears to be a fossil fuel astroturf group disguised as a trade union or at best a company union these are the same labor leaders let us recall who sided with the tanks and attack dogs at standing rock who fought relentlessly for the construction of the planet destabilizing keystone xl pipeline and who along with several other building trade union heads aligned themselves with trump on his first day in office smiling for a white house photo op and declaring his inauguration a great moment for working men and women liuna s leaders have loudly demanded unquestioning solidarity from the rest of the trade union movement but again and again they have offered nothing but the narrowest self interest in return indifferent to the suffering of immigrant workers whose lives are being torn apart under trump and to the indigenous workers who saw their homeland turned into a war zone the time has come for the rest of the labor movement to confront and isolate them before they can do more damage that could take the form of liuna members confident that the green new deal will not leave them behind voting out their pro boss leaders or it could end with liuna being tossed out of the afl cio for planetary malpractice the more unionized sectors like teaching nursing and manufacturing make the green new deal their own by showing how it can transform their workplaces for the better and the more all union leaders embrace the growth in membership they would see under the green new deal the stronger they will be for this unavoidable confrontation one last connection i will mention has to do with the concept of repair ocasio cortez and senator ed markey s green new deal resolution introduced in the house and senate in february 2019 called for creating well paying jobs restoring and protecting threatened endangered and fragile ecosystems as well as cleaning up existing hazardous waste and abandoned sites ensuring economic development and sustainability on those sites there are many such sites across the united states entire landscapes that have been left to waste after they were no longer useful to frackers miners and drillers it s a lot like how this culture treats people it s what has been done to so many workers in the neoliberal period using them up and then abandoning them to addiction and despair it s what the entire carceral state is about locking up huge sectors of the population who are more economically useful as prison laborers and numbers on the spreadsheet of a private prison than they are as free workers and the old new deal did it too by choosing to exclude and discard so many black and brown and women workers there is a grand story to be told here about the duty to repair to repair our relationship with the earth and with one another to heal the deep wounds dating back to the founding of the country because while it is true that climate change is a crisis produced by an excess of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere it is also in a more profound sense a crisis produced by an extractive mindset a way of viewing both the natural world and the majority of its inhabitants as resources to use up and then discard i call it the gig and dig economy and firmly believe that we will not emerge from this crisis without a shift in worldview a transformation from gig and dig to an ethos of care and repair if these kinds of deeper connections between fractured people and a fast warming planet seem far beyond the scope of policy makers it s worth thinking back to the absolutely central role of artists during the new deal era playwrights photographers muralists and novelists were all part of a renaissance of both realist and utopian art some held up a mirror to the wrenching misery that the new deal sought to alleviate others opened up spaces for depression ravaged people to imagine a world beyond that misery both helped get the job done in ways that are impossible to quantify in a similar vein there is much to learn from indigenous led movements in bolivia and ecuador that have placed at the center of their calls for ecological transformation the concept of buen vivir a focus on the right to a good life as opposed to more and more and more life of endless consumption the green new deal will need to be subject to constant vigilance and pressure from experts who understand exactly what it will take to lower our emissions as rapidly as science demands and from social movements that have decades of experience bearing the brunt of false climate solutions whether nuclear power the chimera of carbon capture and storage or carbon offsets but in remaining vigilant we also have to be careful not to bury the overarching message that this is a potential lifeline that we all have a sacred and moral responsibility to reach for naomi klein is senior correspondent for the intercept a puffin writing fellow at type media center and the inaugural gloria steinem endowed chair in media culture and feminist studies at rutgers university she is the author most recently of on fire the burning case for a green new deal this essay is adapted from the author s chapter in we own the future democratic socialism american style a new anthology edited by kate aronoff michael kazin and peter dreier and published by the new press
for economic development it seems desirable to set forth in terms of generalization relationship that have historically characterized the developmental process industrialization is the key to economic development and in fact is virtually synonymous with it development requires an increase in the amount of accumulated capital per head of population in industries the distributive trades and in government in a number of countries economic development must begin by strengthening and improving the agricultural sector without initially an increased capital accumulation this may even take the form of strengthening subsistence agriculture is the nonmarket sector of the economy but at some point growth requires capital and this will inevitably mean industrialization in the sense of increased fabrication with a concomitant shift of economic activity and the labour force away from agriculture and into other activities in most countries this is what economic development has come to mean and commands widespread support industrialization to strengthen the non agricultural sector of the economy it is only through industrialization that an underdeveloped country producing raw materials can gain economic independence in relation to the more advanced countries on which it depends for markets it is only through industrialization that an economy can become both specialized and diversified for progress economic development can be operationally defined in terms of a an increase in real output per capita including the output of the nonmarket sector and consequent increase in real income per capita the emphasis on both output and income is necessary in establishing a usable criterion for judging the rate of development progress in the economy as a whole can generally be gauged solely on the basis of output per capita the consequences of almost all policies public and private can be examined and appraised in relation to the output criterion however economic development has come to mean more than this historically as western european countries and the united states have developed larger numbers of the population has enjoyed increases in income a permanent basis for higher living standards must be created within the society indeed this is the very meaning of economic development unless the chief nurture of growth is indigenous the society is constantly exposed to retrogression on the other hand the distribution of income is typically more concentrated in an underdeveloped economy this emphasis on the distribution of the fruits of development distinguishes modern programs from the programs of colonial development total output and even output per capita may well increase in the colonies but the income counterpart may be exported with no resulting improvement in the distribution of income through the whole population economic development should be judged not only by the increases in output but by the extent to which there is an increased participation in economic activity and in the income derived from it the pressure from an increased population need not prevent development instead it may intensify the need for development it may slow the rate of development it does not necessarily preclude it the histories of belgium netherlands and japan among others suggest that high ratios of population to the land area do not in themselves stifle economic growth there is little historical evidence to confirm the view that the malthusian spectre condemns countries to poverty until birth rates are reduced in fact the experience of developed industrialized countries would suggest quite the contrary as industrialization and urbanization proceed and as the proportion of families engaged in agriculture declines birth rates also decline until at some point the rate of population growth declines it is reasonable to expect that a successful development program will in itself over time contribute to a solution of the population problem what is now demanded is a widespread popular participation in the process of development this means that for many countries a new system of economic values must be internalized with new patterns of behaviour and expectation development must command the efforts and the moral support of increasing numbers of persons a permanent basis for higher living standards must be created within the society indeed this is the very meaning of economic development unless the chief nurture of growth is indigenous the society is constantly exposed to retrogression moreover economic growth must be viewed as a learning process new skills are acquired and old skills abandoned with a resulting increase in the specialization and interdependence of the total system economic growth not only increases the specialization and complexity of an economy it also increases certain kinds of internal mobility this mobility is geographic and social this will be accompanied by social mobility the upgrading of persons in the hierarchy of skills and prestige or the new creation of such hierarchies old occupations acquire new status challenging the established power positions which have hitherto inhibited and resisted the growth process in every society there are persons and interest groups resistant to change where these are in command of the power structure of a society there will be no evident impetus to economic development until new persons and organizations are in a position to challenge the existing order most of modern economic theory presupposes a specific organizational character for society this is an outgrowth of attempts to describe and understand the behaviour of advanced industrial market structures much less attention has been devoted to pre capitalist organization and to the factors that accompanied the transition from one kind of economic order to another insights that may be provided by economists must be supplemented by the studies of political scientists sociologists geographers and anthropologists these skills are particularly needed in the study of the organizational character of society and its relation to economic growth the interaction between resources and organization the ways in which groups are organized for the conduct of economic activity the leadership patterns that develop within groups with the current economic situation and the rise in inflation the

implement reforms and actions to improve the current account deficit strengthen the revenue base of the country and to help the poor against the impact of the economic crisis afflicting them

stock market crashes the dow jones has rallied more than 25 in the year to date easily recouping losses from last winter current conditions are eerily similar to that of the circumstances ahead of prior stock market crashes regardless of your view on the market it is important to be aware of the trading risk with current valuations stock market crashes current climate compared to prior conditions the dow jones has enjoyed a remarkable rally in the twilight of 2019 which has put it on pace to recoup losses from the year prior despite trade wars slowing global growth and recession concerns evidently the combined effort of the major central banks has paid off with various stock markets approaching or extending beyond record levels as the market enters a historically bullish time of year thanks to the santa claus rally and january effect many market participants have called for a continuation higher a brief history of major financial bubbles crises and flash crashes but others are hesitant to accept current valuations fearing the market has become complacent and the risks highlighted earlier in the year may still spark a crash with that in mind we can compare the current landscape to the conditions present immediately prior to three of the largest stock market crashes in the last 30 years united states invasion of kuwait and the 1990 stock market crash the stock market crash in 1990 followed the us invasion of kuwait which saw oil prices surge in the lead up economic measures were unremarkable but not to the degree that the subsequent market reaction would suggest upon the invasion in july 1990 the dow jones went on to plummet 18 before october of that same year as oil surged from 16 a barrel to over 40 a barrel source bloomberg asset performances at the time were largely within reason which gave market pundits little reason to suspect a looming disaster the us dollar and gold were lower for the year and stocks were establishing new all time highs crude oil was beginning to show signs of volatility but far from the level of volatility that would follow similarly simple technical analysis of the dow jones at the time reveals little cause for concern trading comfortably above its 50 and 200 day moving averages the dow jones delivered a bullish breakout above 2 800 in mid may 1990 only to fall beneath 2 400 just 5 months later from a technical standpoint one could argue the dow s drive above resistance at 2 800 mirrors the industrial average s recent breakout above 27 600 dow jones price chart daily timeframe january 1989 july 1990 chart 1 dot com crash in the mid 1990 s to 2000 equity markets would be engrossed with technology stocks only for them to come crashing down in early 2000 the result saw the dow jones trade gradually lower for more than two years until it eventually bottomed in october 2002 in the months prior data revealed manufacturing was roaring and job additions were incredibly robust source bloomberg looking to the technical backdrop at the time the dow jones appeared to be on the brink of a breakout higher trading confidently higher since september 1998 the industrial average enjoyed a bounty of support beneath and was able to pierce an overhead trendline just days before the market plummeted technical traders at the time would have warned of the potential for a false breakout or the beginning of a new leg higher depending which side their biases guided them to dow jones price chart daily timeframe july 1998 january 2000 chart 2 great financial crisis like the dot com crash years before the housing market crisis saw the dow jones derail in spectacular fashion as companies declared bankruptcy and the government turned to taxpayers in an effort to keep large commercial banks afloat nevertheless the burst bubble would wrack the financial world as few were able to predict its arrival to be sure some market pundits were becoming hesitant the gains could go on well in advance of the eventual turbulence in an npr piece posted on july 20 2007 the author highlights weak earnings from caterpillar a global growth bellwether as the reason for the dow jones slipping beneath 14 000 a level it surpassed for the first time ever just days before source npr but opinions were divided as always and some analysts were convinced the market was experiencing a bout of volatility like any other even after the cracks had begun to show in a cnn money article published on august 9 2007 analysts offered their view on the market following recent selloffs we re in a volatile place kiddoo said and there s an overreaction to the news and rumors here that s feeding into that volatility concerns about credit and the housing market aren t likely to disappear anytime soon goldman said yet going forward the equity market is probably in a better place to absorb the unrest than it was a month ago since many of the stock indexes are well off their 2007 highs additionally the financial underpinnings of the market remain positive in the long term kiddoo said the next month or so is bound to be choppy the analysts said as is typical in august but stocks could stabilize and recharge for the classic fourth quarter advance dow jones price chart daily timeframe july 2006 october 2007 chart 3 with the benefit of hindsight we know the dow jones would proceed to top in october 2007 before tumbling throughout the fourth quarter and the following year despite worsening credit conditions in the months immediately prior to the crash some analysts remained confident not willing to lose out on potential gains further still the technical foundation was extended at record highs but relatively reasonable considering some of the technical pictures the index has painted since although concern was warranted traders pressed on and a similar sentiment can be seen in the current market the stock market in 2019 and 2020 the year to date has been full of concerns ranging from brexit slowing global growth and the ongoing trade war with china in turn central banks have worked to combat the headwinds by loosening monetary policy effectively admitting their domestic economies need a helping hand nevertheless stock markets across the developed world have pressed to lofty levels and equities in the united states have established new highs comfortably source business insider while many are warning of inflated asset prices ballooning debt and an uncertain future others have doubled down arguing the advent of monetary easing has opened the door to an entirely new stock market rally that will reach well beyond current levels source cnbc whichever camp you fall into economic measures reveal a slowing us economy whether or not the floor for economic growth has been hit is yet to be seen but with data from the year to date it is hard to refute the economy is in a weaker position now than it was a year ago when the market was in the middle of a precipitous decline nevertheless it is hard for a profit seeking investor to argue against stocks while they trade at record highs source bloomberg with that in mind it is easy to spot similarities between current conditions and past instances of market instability but as is often the case time in the market beats timing the market consequently many traders have discarded warning signals and economic headwinds in favor of latching onto stock s incredible rally and extracting every available pip while it can be hard to sit idly by as stocks ascend traders should be cognizant of the incredibly lofty valuations at which the dow jones trades and hedge accordingly dow jones price chart daily timeframe february 2018 november 2019 chart 4 given the current climate short term targets with clear entry and exit points could prove to be a prudent investment strategy for those looking to capture the equity rally despite the uncertainty further still equity portfolios should also possess exposure to assets with negative correlations like gold or the us dollar for example therefore in the event of a sudden shock like the dot com bubble or great financial crisis the damage dealt could be lessened while the market barrels toward its next major move whether higher or lower check back at dailyfx com for updates and analysis and follow peterhanksfx on twitter for similar content

everything to know about the april 8 eclipse in atlantic canada saltwire eclipse saltwire by saqib iqbal ahmed new york reuters the dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies on monday as investors awaited fresh developments in the 17 month long u s china trade war while the pound crept higher on the latest polls ahead of this week s british election weak chinese export data dented risk appetite on monday while a lack of clarity on whether washington would impose increased u s tariffs on chinese goods on dec 15 if the two countries cannot agree a limited trade deal kept investors from placing large directional bets related stories the dollar index which measures the greenback against six other major currencies was down 0 04 on the day against the safe haven swiss franc which tends to draw investors during times of geopolitical or financial stress the dollar was 0 21 lower china s exports in november shrank for the fourth consecutive month underscoring persistent pressures on manufacturers from the sino u s trade war a dec 15 deadline for the next wave of u s tariffs on chinese goods fed caution in global markets supporting the u s dollar against currencies highly sensitive to the trade war such as the australian and new zealand dollars the aussie fell 0 1 while the kiwi slipped 0 14 against the offshore chinese yuan the dollar was up 0 17 top white house economic adviser larry kudlow said on friday that the dec 15 deadline is still in place to impose a new round of u s tariffs on chinese consumer goods but president donald trump likes where trade talks with china are going on monday china said that it hoped to make a trade deal with the united states as soon as possible investors will also be watching central banks ahead of u s federal reserve and european central bank policy meetings this week even though both are expected to leave policy unchanged unusually perhaps the main event risks are not the central bank meetings due this week or key speaking engagements shaun osborne chief fx strategist at scotiabank in toronto said in a note rather the uk general election and the potential ramping up of u s tariffs over next weekend are likely to influence market sentiment more significantly than anything else osborne said sterling hit a seven month high of 1 3180 against the dollar before paring gains to trade up 0 07 at 1 3146 after fresh polls showed british prime minister boris johnson s conservative party has extended its lead in opinion polls before thursday s election the ruling conservative party extended its lead over the opposition labour party to 14 percentage points up from 9 a week ago an opinion poll by survation showed on monday reporting by saqib iqbal ahmed editing by dan grebler and nick zieminski
the prospect is proud to exclusively release the book take back our party restoring the democratic legacy by james kwak we will release one chapter every other day over the next two weeks starting with today s introduction kwak the co author of 13 bankers and white house burning and the author of economism is a keen observer of policy and politics and his book offers powerful evidence of how the democratic party drifted from its traditional position as a party of the people he adds his prescription for how the party can get back on track as the battles for the soul of the democratic party continue take back our party is a field guide to that debate we re excited to bring it to you we live in troubled times ordinary americans are struggling despite decades of technological innovation and economic growth the typical family s net worth is no higher than in the 1980s health care costs including rising insurance premiums deductibles co payments prescription drug prices and often unexpected out of network charges bankrupt a growing number of once secure families young adults are burdened by student loan payments extending as far as they can see steeply rising rents make finding an affordable home virtually impossible in more and more cities state and local governments are failing to deliver even essential services like clean water to their residents a handful of companies controlled by billionaires have levels of control over our lives once imaginable only in science fiction increasingly precarious federal government finances threaten future reductions in the social security and medicare benefits that many elderly americans rely on and decades of unsustainable growth have already profoundly changed the climate of our planet in ways we are only now beginning to realize yet despite these disturbing developments many people particularly those who are well off and well educated insist that nothing could be better as of 2019 the united states is in the 11th year of an economic expansion that has seen the stock market rise and the unemployment rate fall to record levels we remain enthralled by every year s new marvels produced by the dream factories of the technology superpowers self driving cars drone deliveries to your doorstep virtual reality space travel and on and on the full realization of these wonders always seems just out of reach but no matter the explanation for this divergence is simple over the past 40 years the economic fortunes of the very rich and more or less everyone else have become completely uncoupled from 1980 to 2014 the total incomes of the top 1 percent more than tripled while those of the bottom 50 percent remained essentially unchanged the previous 34 years from 1946 to 1980 saw the opposite pattern income growth was substantially higher for the bottom 50 percent than for the top 1 percent if you have the money you live in one economy with the best health care in the world easy access to green space the finest restaurants that have ever existed elite educational institutions from preschool through the most opulent research universities anywhere and luxury goods and services that once were reserved for royalty if you don t have the money you live in another economy where your family s welfare is vulnerable to sudden changes in the demand for your skills generated by distant markets you breathe the dirty air produced by uncontrolled development or drink the toxic water delivered by a crumbling infrastructure your children go to underfunded public schools and you are rapidly being priced out of the health care your family needs obviously there is no border wall that cleanly divides the very rich from everyone else there is an intermediate zone roughly from the 75th to the 95th income percentile where people are more or less comfortable in a material sense but they can see the speed with which the truly wealthy have separated themselves from the rest of society and many of them are desperate not to be left behind if not for themselves then for their children anxiety about getting into a good college landing choice summer internships and securing a job at one of the handful of highly selective companies that promise entry into the economic elite goldman sachs mckinsey google facebook amazon and their few peers is at pathological levels the recent college admissions cheating scandal is not only more proof that the very rich live in a different world from everyone else but also shows that they too are desperate to place their children on the educational escalator to success and fortune the forward march of inequality is there for anyone to see and no one wants his or her family to be caught on the wrong side of history expand jeff roberson ap photo a homeless encampment near downtown st louis january 2015 this divide between the vast majority of americans who face the prospect of negligible improvements in their living standards at the cost of constant insecurity and a small minority who both literally and figuratively jet away into another world is the central economic challenge of our time it is a problem in clear view today only one in five americans think that today s youth will have a better life than their parents generation stark skepticism about what for centuries we have been calling the american dream inequality is a problem that on its own will only get worse technological advances will vastly increase the advantages of being rich and well educated and the costs of not being so fortunate increasingly capable machines will displace low skilled workers consider how apps and kiosks are doing the job of cashiers at casual restaurants and big box stores while enriching the people who design them and the shareholders of the companies that manufacture them artificial intelligence will replace many knowledge workers while rewarding a small elite of computer scientists and their employers it is true that people made the same doomsday predictions about earlier inventions and in past ages of capitalism the market found higher value occupations for many workers though not necessarily for those who lost their jobs to new technology it is possible that a society could adapt to these transformations in ways that help everyone not just an intellectual and economic elite but there is little reason to think that ours is such a society in trusting to markets to allocate all good things we have allowed the benefits of automation to be monopolized by people with the capital to invest in new technology and those with the skills to master it this is not merely an economic problem it is hard to see how a society can long endure when the precarious fortunes interests and life experiences of its people become foreign to a small ruling class let them eat cake a noblewoman in 18th century france is reputed to have said upon hearing that the peasants had no bread the rise and fall of nations depend on the extent to which their economic and political institutions remain open to a wide range of interest groups within society as documented by daron acemoglu and james robinson in decades of research fourteenth century venice was both a democracy of sorts and a thriving commercial center of the mediterranean once political power was seized by a closed hereditary aristocracy however the city state fell into irreversible economic decline eventually becoming the sinking museum that it is today in a modern democracy this should not happen at least in theory when everyone has an equal vote a tiny minority of the super rich should not be able to run away with the lion s share of society s economic gains in the classical model there should be a party of business and a party of labor generally representing the rich and working class respectively the united states has never had a true labor party but through the middle of the 20th century these roles were more or less approximated by republicans and democrats the republicans were the party of business generally favoring lower taxes smaller government and fiscal responsibility the democrats were the party of labor unions and immigrant minorities favoring higher taxes bigger government and more generous social programs in the 1930s it was democratic president franklin roosevelt who established the federal safety net with public jobs programs and social security in the 1960s it was another democratic president lyndon johnson who created medicare and medicaid the last major expansions of the welfare state and launched an optimistic war on poverty expand greg gibson ap photo bill clinton with supporters following a campaign rally in south carolina march 1992 during the past half century however the tectonic plates of the political landscape have completely shifted it is common knowledge that the republican party has been taken over by radical conservatives who want to dismantle government altogether or as grover norquist famously said reduce it to the size where i can drag it into the bathroom and drown it in the bathtub and hold a host of unsavory views on immigration racial and ethnic diversity and women s rights the parallel transformation of the democratic party has received relatively less attention today s democratic elite represented by bill clinton barack obama and hillary clinton has in deed if not in word repudiated the heritage of roosevelt and johnson fleeing what it sees as an embarrassing legacy peopled by unionized workers and welfare recipients instead today s establishment democrats style themselves as expert managers of a sophisticated market economy friends of big finance and big technology and architects of growth and opportunity instead of a party of capital and party of labor the united states today has two parties of capital one insular and white nationalist the other generally tolerant and multicultural or as the pathbreaking economist thomas piketty has argued two parties that represent different segments of the elite when it comes to economic policy one is absolutist and ideological the other technocratic and evidence based but both see growth as the overriding objective and markets as the optimal way to produce and distribute goods and services this is the political context that made it possible for the 1 percent to reach economic escape velocity and launch themselves away from the mundane stagnant anxiety ridden lives of everybody else the democratic party is dominated by people who fear nothing more than being called liberals let alone socialists or being seen as soft hearted soft headed believers in big government and the welfare state since the 1990s the party s economic platform has been that markets deliver prosperity and the role of government should be limited to correcting market failures such as externalities adverse selection or moral hazard in the academic jargon employed by the policy elite this is why bill clinton s lasting economic policy achievement was the introduction of work requirements for poverty assistance this is why the greatest financial crisis in 70 years did not lead to structural change in the banking sector this is why the health care program that bears barack obama s name is a warmed over version of the plan introduced by mitt romney in massachusetts which was originally the brainchild of the reflexively conservative heritage foundation as republicans have succumbed to tribalism and irrationality democrats have claimed the mantle of fiscal prudence and responsible stewardship of the capitalist market economy the consequence is that the democratic party of the past 25 years has done next to nothing about inequality and has little to say about it the party establishment has only taken up progressive policy ideas such as the 15 minimum wage when forced to by activists usually working at the state or local level the onetime defenders of the working class have stood idly by as the 1 percent has swept up an increasing share of the gains from economic growth including the benefits of the post recession recovery its response has been to lecture that a rising tide lifts all boats a maxim that differs little from the trickle down economics so dear to conservatives nominating barack obama for president at the 2012 democratic national convention bill clinton acknowledged that too many people did not yet feel the effects of economic growth but he promised if you will renew the president s contract you will feel it alternatively democrats will claim that some bundle of clever market friendly policies funding for infrastructure spending and incentives for clean technology investment are the current darlings will magically shift the distribution of income and wealth down toward the working and middle classes of course the rise of inequality and the stagnation of the middle class are more the fault of the conservatives who took over the republican party than of the moderates who responded by shifting the democratic party to the political center it is crucial to understand the conservative movement in order to appreciate how we got ourselves into our current mess i have written books that were largely about republicans about their campaign to deregulate the financial sector their willingness to sacrifice two centuries of fiscal responsibility on the altar of tax cuts and their use of simplistic economic theories to mask policies that favor the rich but i am not a republican and if you are reading this you probably aren t either more to the point we can be certain that today s republican party dominated as it is by ultra wealthy donors and a fundamentalist ideology of cutting taxes for the rich and eliminating programs for everyone else will do nothing to stem the rising tide of inequality or improve the economic fortunes of ordinary families if we are going to more fairly share the vast wealth that our society produces we first need a political party dedicated to improving the economic well being of all americans that means we have to restore the historical identity of the democratic party as the champion of the poor workers and the middle class and so because this is a book about how to make things better it s a book about democrats it s about how in the wake of the reagan revolution we latched onto the idea that a more modern more sophisticated more business friendly democratic party could successfully compete for the white house it s about how this transformation while paying off in victories in four of the past seven presidential elections six if you go by the popular vote has left us impotent in the face of growing inequality even when in power and incapable of making the case that we can help families struggling against economic insecurity and misfortune and it s about how a new democratic party dedicated to a progressive economic agenda can take up the challenge of ensuring a decent life for every american

a fortnight agopresident buhari submitted a request to the senate to approve an external loan of us 29 96 billion n10 7 trillion it s the second time such a request would be presented the first being in 2016 when the senate rejected it as a career banker it would be rather rich of me to sit here and be sanctimonious about borrowing i am experienced enough to know one of the axioms of finance which says it is smart to use other people s money to get rich but you must know what you are doing nigeria s infrastructural financing needs are humongous the african development bank estimates about us 100 billion as the amount needed annually to meet our financing gap in infrastructures but i have my own ground rules first we must borrow strictly for infrastructures or other projects with a guaranteed return on investments this obviously rules out borrowing for mere consumption i am also opposed to the idea of borrowing for social or rehabilitation and reconstruction programmes under the great sage chief obafemi awolowo nigeria did not borrow a dollar to finance both the war and the post bellum reconstruction either we are imbeciles or we are possessed of the spirit of unoka the lazy failure in chinua achebe s things fall apart who would always borrow to feed himself and his family i would insist that senate not give a blanket approval for us 30 billion to be spent just like that all such borrowings must in my considered opinion be directly linked to specific monitorable projects i am not comfortable with the idea of such a staggering loan that government can proceed to spend as it deems fit the record of this administration in terms of financial controls and accountable spending is not an impressive one also nigerians demand to know what all the other borrowings have been used for in a matter of five years our national debt has ballooned from us 10 billion to a whopping us 84 4 billion and we do not have much to show for it we know that money has been wisely spent when we see the president commissioning one infrastructure project or the other unfortunately the few projects that have been commissioned so far are those that were begun by the previous administration of goodluck jonathan so i would be very wary of taking on more debt without the iron cast guardrails of financial discipline the current administration seems to have an uncontrolled appetite for foreign loans but it is not particularly good at managing projects without fiscal discipline it is dangerous to borrow i am the first to know that there will always be a financing gap for the foreseeable years we need more highways speed trains harbours and housing we need more investments in urban development and attendant facilities some 50 percent of our people are condemned in the darkness of the middle ages with no access whatsoever to electricity and the other half have to contend with almost daily breakdowns of power supply our population doubles every 30 years today it has reached the 200 million mark it is forecast to be a staggering 410 million by 2050 the third most populous in the world ahead of the united states and only behind india and china we have never done enough planning for such quantum leaps in demographics and we have not modelled the demand for power and infrastructures to feed the needs of an exploding population we should only borrow if we can marshal the necessary fiscal discipline and if we have learned to keep our home in order whilst we do not yet have a debt crisis the imf and the world bank have warned that we are already reaching a dangerous threshold given that we spend 50 percent of our revenues just to service our debt while only a meagre 23 percent goes into capital spending incurring another us 30 billion will take our total debt outlay to about us 114 billion which under current path dependencies will mean we will be spending 70 percent of our revenues on debt servicing oil accounts for 50 percent of government revenues and 94 percent of its foreign earnings most oecd countries have already given orders to their automobile manufacturers to phase out oil consuming cars in preference for electric ones this will wipe out 70 percent of the market for oil in the coming decades our leaders have given no thought whatsoever to this impending doomsday scenario if we continue to borrow in the expectation that we will continue to earn enough from oil to repay our debts we would be living in unoka s paradise economics is of course the master science of alternatives of scarcity and choice we need a comprehensive programme of cost saving and control of waste and financial hemorrhage in all aspects of the public service some statutory bodies such as nnpc lng and firs have not been releasing funds estimated at trillions of naira into the federation account as required by law we must compel them to obey the law we need to deepen macroeconomic and institutional reforms including privatization through public private partnerships ppps we can get foreign investors to invest in key sectors for example in railways power ports and harbours such financing arrangements will lessen pressure on the treasury therefore obviating the need to incur further loans we must also boost the extractive capacity of the state nigeria is among the lowest in terms of tax to gdp ratio ours stands at 5 percent compared to south africa s 25 9 percent political theory also establishes that taxation is good for democracy only when civic public pay their taxes can they demand accountability from their leaders we could also declare an amnesty of 3 years for all the stolen wealth from nigeria it is estimated that nigerians have squirrelled abroad more than us 200 billion of looted funds most of these will be lost forever unless we declare a moratorium to encourage their repatriation if the culprits can bring back the funds and invest them in the country no questions will be asked however after the moratorium has expired we must pursue and hound them down until they cough out every dollar it worked for italy a few decades ago and i don t see why it wouldn t work for us as the israeli special forces sayeret matkal would say he who dares wins some of us were involved in the paris club debt negotiations during 2005 2006 at that time our external debt was about us 36 billion we were spending us 5 billion annually on servicing interest alone in the deal that we negotiated with the paris club we paid back us 20 billion in order for the rest to be written off i was acting for the central bank governor at the time and i recall signing the cheque for the first tranche of us 7 5 billion i caught fever immediately and had to have bed rest i could not fathom coughing out such a staggering amount to pay off some greedy shylocks in new york london frankfurt paris and tokyo i felt the pain to the marrow of my bones last week the international ratings agency moody s downgraded nigeria s status from stable to negative it did so on account of our sluggish economic growth in the context of dwindling government revenue increasing insecurity geopolitical uncertainty and a worsening debt to gdp ratio and other macroeconomic fundamentals the atmosphere looks truly bleak it seems evident that nigerians have little on which to anchor their rational expectations i know what debt peonage is the western powers regretted bitterly having let us off the hook more than a decade ago the debt settlement was a gust of fresh air which allowed our economy to bloom in subsequent years giving a blanket approval for a whopping 30 billion dollar fungible loan is the surest means of returning our country to economic serfdom those who love our country and cherish our economic freedom and sovereignty must not allow us to return to our vomitlike the proverbial dog it reminds me of unoka the quintessential failure and lay about in achebe s immortal novel in his day he unoka was lazy and improvident and was quite incapable of thinking about tomorrow if any money came his way and it seldom did he immediately bought gourds of palm wine called round his neighbors and made merry he always said that whenever he saw a dead man s mouth he saw the folly of not eating what one had in one s lifetime unoka was of course a debtor and he owed every neighbor some money from a few cowries to quite substantial amounts he was poor and his wife and children had barely enough to eat people laughed at him because he was a loafer and they swore never to lend him any more money because he never paid back but unoka was such a man that he always succeeded in borrowing more and piling up his debts

doug mataconis 7 comments paul volcker who was appointed chairman of the federal reserve board by president carter and went on to fight a war against the inflation that was choking the american economy in the 1970s until it was finally eradicated has died at the age of 92 paul a volcker a hard headed economic statesman who as chairman of the federal reserve from 1979 to 1987 shocked the u s economy out of a cycle of inflation and malaise and so set the stage for a generation of prosperity died dec 8 at his home in manhattan he was 92 the cause was complications from prostate cancer said his daughter janice zima with influence that spanned five decades and seven presidents mr volcker left as deep an imprint on the u s economy and financial system as has anyone of his generation as a senior treasury official in the 1960s and early 70s he advised president richard m nixon on taking the united states off the gold standard at the fed he was arguably the second most powerful person in the country as an adviser to presidential candidate barack obama he gave the young senator credibility he later counseled president obama on his response to the 2008 financial crisis and proposed a key restriction on speculative activity by banks that would become known as the volcker rule mr volcker was a giant of a man standing 6 foot 7 with a stature that came from his mastery of finance his doggedness in navigating bureaucracies and his sheer toughness his was an imposing moral authority acquired the hard way the reason in his later years that he was enlisted for such knotty tasks as unraveling the holdings of holocaust victims in swiss banks and investigating the united nations oil for food program in iraq mr volcker s greatest historical mark was in eight years as fed chairman when he took the reins of the central bank the nation was mired in a decade long period of rapidly rising prices and weak economic growth mr volcker overcoming the objections of many of his colleagues hiked interest rates to an unprecedented 20 percent drastically reducing the supply of money and credit at a shocking unscheduled saturday night news conference announcing those steps just two months after taking office in october 1979 mr volcker was coy about the likely economic impact of the move well you get varying opinions about that he told reporters that evening asked if tighter money could cause a recession the action indeed triggered what was then the deepest economic downturn since the depression of the 1930s and drove thousands of businesses and farms to bankruptcy and the unemployment rate to over 10 percent mr volcker was pilloried by industry labor unions and lawmakers of all ideological stripes he took the abuse convinced that this shock therapy would finally break americans expectations that prices would forever rise rapidly and that the result would be a stronger economy over the longer run on this biggest of questions he was right soon after mr volcker took his foot off the brake of the u s economy in 1981 and the fed began lowering interest rates the nation began a quarter century of low inflation steady growth and rare and mild recessions economists attribute that period one of the sunniest in economic history at least in part to the newfound credibility as an inflation fighter that mr volcker earned for the fed he restored credibility to the federal reserve at a time it had been greatly diminished said william l silber a new york university economist and author of the biography volcker the triumph of persistence in a 2012 interview he served as the template for future central bank chairmen who came after him in 1979 when president jimmy carter was looking for a new fed chairman prices were spiraling upward almost out of control a vicious cycle was underway because prices had been rising rapidly in the recent past workers demanded ever higher wages as the nation s central bank the federal reserve was the agency best positioned to try to end that demoralizing cycle but it would exact a cost to reduce inflation the fed would need to raise interest rates to choke off the flow of money into the economy probably prompting much higher unemployment for that reason the previous two men in the job arthur f burns and g william miller had moved only timidly in trying to combat inflation miller left the job after a single ineffective year as fed chair as carter and his aides spoke with people in financial circles about potential nominees mr volcker s name came up repeatedly the president appointed mr volcker a decision that had been judged well by history but may well have cost carter reelection in 1980 taking the job came at a personal cost for mr volcker he would have to take a 50 percent pay cut from his salary as new york fed president and his wife had to return to bookkeeping work to afford both their new york co op and the small foggy bottom apartment mr volcker commuted back to new york on the weekends just two months after taking office mr volcker was ready to make the boldest move of his tenure he called his fed colleagues from around the country to washington for a secret emergency policy meeting on a saturday after hours of argument and debate he steered the federal open market committee to change the entire framework the fed would use to control the nation s money supply the fed then and now set a target for short term interest rates and then bought and sold securities to ensure that interest rates actually settled at that level when the fed wants to slow the economy and choke off inflation it raises its interest rate target mr volcker concluded in october 1979 that the fed needed to change strategies and start targeting the actual amount of money floating around in the economy

the prospect is proud to exclusively release the book take back our party restoring the democratic legacy by james kwak we will release one chapter every other day over the next two weeks starting with today s introduction kwak the co author of 13 bankers and white house burning and the author of economism is a keen observer of policy and politics and his book offers powerful evidence of how the democratic party drifted from its traditional position as a party of the people he adds his prescription for how the party can get back on track as the battles for the soul of the democratic party continue take back our party is a field guide to that debate we re excited to bring it to you we live in troubled times ordinary americans are struggling despite decades of technological innovation and economic growth the typical family s net worth is no higher than in the 1980s health care costs including rising insurance premiums deductibles co payments prescription drug prices and often unexpected out of network charges bankrupt a growing number of once secure families young adults are burdened by student loan payments extending as far as they can see steeply rising rents make finding an affordable home virtually impossible in more and more cities state and local governments are failing to deliver even essential services like clean water to their residents a handful of companies controlled by billionaires have levels of control over our lives once imaginable only in science fiction increasingly precarious federal government finances threaten future reductions in the social security and medicare benefits that many elderly americans rely on and decades of unsustainable growth have already profoundly changed the climate of our planet in ways we are only now beginning to realize yet despite these disturbing developments many people particularly those who are well off and well educated insist that nothing could be better as of 2019 the united states is in the 11th year of an economic expansion that has seen the stock market rise and the unemployment rate fall to record levels we remain enthralled by every year s new marvels produced by the dream factories of the technology superpowers self driving cars drone deliveries to your doorstep virtual reality space travel and on and on the full realization of these wonders always seems just out of reach but no matter the explanation for this divergence is simple over the past 40 years the economic fortunes of the very rich and more or less everyone else have become completely uncoupled from 1980 to 2014 the total incomes of the top 1 percent more than tripled while those of the bottom 50 percent remained essentially unchanged the previous 34 years from 1946 to 1980 saw the opposite pattern income growth was substantially higher for the bottom 50 percent than for the top 1 percent if you have the money you live in one economy with the best health care in the world easy access to green space the finest restaurants that have ever existed elite educational institutions from preschool through the most opulent research universities anywhere and luxury goods and services that once were reserved for royalty if you don t have the money you live in another economy where your family s welfare is vulnerable to sudden changes in the demand for your skills generated by distant markets you breathe the dirty air produced by uncontrolled development or drink the toxic water delivered by a crumbling infrastructure your children go to underfunded public schools and you are rapidly being priced out of the health care your family needs obviously there is no border wall that cleanly divides the very rich from everyone else there is an intermediate zone roughly from the 75th to the 95th income percentile where people are more or less comfortable in a material sense but they can see the speed with which the truly wealthy have separated themselves from the rest of society and many of them are desperate not to be left behind if not for themselves then for their children anxiety about getting into a good college landing choice summer internships and securing a job at one of the handful of highly selective companies that promise entry into the economic elite goldman sachs mckinsey google facebook amazon and their few peers is at pathological levels the recent college admissions cheating scandal is not only more proof that the very rich live in a different world from everyone else but also shows that they too are desperate to place their children on the educational escalator to success and fortune the forward march of inequality is there for anyone to see and no one wants his or her family to be caught on the wrong side of history expand jeff roberson ap photo a homeless encampment near downtown st louis january 2015 this divide between the vast majority of americans who face the prospect of negligible improvements in their living standards at the cost of constant insecurity and a small minority who both literally and figuratively jet away into another world is the central economic challenge of our time it is a problem in clear view today only one in five americans think that today s youth will have a better life than their parents generation stark skepticism about what for centuries we have been calling the american dream inequality is a problem that on its own will only get worse technological advances will vastly increase the advantages of being rich and well educated and the costs of not being so fortunate increasingly capable machines will displace low skilled workers consider how apps and kiosks are doing the job of cashiers at casual restaurants and big box stores while enriching the people who design them and the shareholders of the companies that manufacture them artificial intelligence will replace many knowledge workers while rewarding a small elite of computer scientists and their employers it is true that people made the same doomsday predictions about earlier inventions and in past ages of capitalism the market found higher value occupations for many workers though not necessarily for those who lost their jobs to new technology it is possible that a society could adapt to these transformations in ways that help everyone not just an intellectual and economic elite but there is little reason to think that ours is such a society in trusting to markets to allocate all good things we have allowed the benefits of automation to be monopolized by people with the capital to invest in new technology and those with the skills to master it this is not merely an economic problem it is hard to see how a society can long endure when the precarious fortunes interests and life experiences of its people become foreign to a small ruling class let them eat cake a noblewoman in 18th century france is reputed to have said upon hearing that the peasants had no bread the rise and fall of nations depend on the extent to which their economic and political institutions remain open to a wide range of interest groups within society as documented by daron acemoglu and james robinson in decades of research fourteenth century venice was both a democracy of sorts and a thriving commercial center of the mediterranean once political power was seized by a closed hereditary aristocracy however the city state fell into irreversible economic decline eventually becoming the sinking museum that it is today in a modern democracy this should not happen at least in theory when everyone has an equal vote a tiny minority of the super rich should not be able to run away with the lion s share of society s economic gains in the classical model there should be a party of business and a party of labor generally representing the rich and working class respectively the united states has never had a true labor party but through the middle of the 20th century these roles were more or less approximated by republicans and democrats the republicans were the party of business generally favoring lower taxes smaller government and fiscal responsibility the democrats were the party of labor unions and immigrant minorities favoring higher taxes bigger government and more generous social programs in the 1930s it was democratic president franklin roosevelt who established the federal safety net with public jobs programs and social security in the 1960s it was another democratic president lyndon johnson who created medicare and medicaid the last major expansions of the welfare state and launched an optimistic war on poverty expand greg gibson ap photo bill clinton with supporters following a campaign rally in south carolina march 1992 during the past half century however the tectonic plates of the political landscape have completely shifted it is common knowledge that the republican party has been taken over by radical conservatives who want to dismantle government altogether or as grover norquist famously said reduce it to the size where i can drag it into the bathroom and drown it in the bathtub and hold a host of unsavory views on immigration racial and ethnic diversity and women s rights the parallel transformation of the democratic party has received relatively less attention today s democratic elite represented by bill clinton barack obama and hillary clinton has in deed if not in word repudiated the heritage of roosevelt and johnson fleeing what it sees as an embarrassing legacy peopled by unionized workers and welfare recipients instead today s establishment democrats style themselves as expert managers of a sophisticated market economy friends of big finance and big technology and architects of growth and opportunity instead of a party of capital and party of labor the united states today has two parties of capital one insular and white nationalist the other generally tolerant and multicultural or as the pathbreaking economist thomas piketty has argued two parties that represent different segments of the elite when it comes to economic policy one is absolutist and ideological the other technocratic and evidence based but both see growth as the overriding objective and markets as the optimal way to produce and distribute goods and services this is the political context that made it possible for the 1 percent to reach economic escape velocity and launch themselves away from the mundane stagnant anxiety ridden lives of everybody else the democratic party is dominated by people who fear nothing more than being called liberals let alone socialists or being seen as soft hearted soft headed believers in big government and the welfare state since the 1990s the party s economic platform has been that markets deliver prosperity and the role of government should be limited to correcting market failures such as externalities adverse selection or moral hazard in the academic jargon employed by the policy elite this is why bill clinton s lasting economic policy achievement was the introduction of work requirements for poverty assistance this is why the greatest financial crisis in 70 years did not lead to structural change in the banking sector this is why the health care program that bears barack obama s name is a warmed over version of the plan introduced by mitt romney in massachusetts which was originally the brainchild of the reflexively conservative heritage foundation as republicans have succumbed to tribalism and irrationality democrats have claimed the mantle of fiscal prudence and responsible stewardship of the capitalist market economy the consequence is that the democratic party of the past 25 years has done next to nothing about inequality and has little to say about it the party establishment has only taken up progressive policy ideas such as the 15 minimum wage when forced to by activists usually working at the state or local level the onetime defenders of the working class have stood idly by as the 1 percent has swept up an increasing share of the gains from economic growth including the benefits of the post recession recovery its response has been to lecture that a rising tide lifts all boats a maxim that differs little from the trickle down economics so dear to conservatives nominating barack obama for president at the 2012 democratic national convention bill clinton acknowledged that too many people did not yet feel the effects of economic growth but he promised if you will renew the president s contract you will feel it alternatively democrats will claim that some bundle of clever market friendly policies funding for infrastructure spending and incentives for clean technology investment are the current darlings will magically shift the distribution of income and wealth down toward the working and middle classes of course the rise of inequality and the stagnation of the middle class are more the fault of the conservatives who took over the republican party than of the moderates who responded by shifting the democratic party to the political center it is crucial to understand the conservative movement in order to appreciate how we got ourselves into our current mess i have written books that were largely about republicans about their campaign to deregulate the financial sector their willingness to sacrifice two centuries of fiscal responsibility on the altar of tax cuts and their use of simplistic economic theories to mask policies that favor the rich but i am not a republican and if you are reading this you probably aren t either more to the point we can be certain that today s republican party dominated as it is by ultra wealthy donors and a fundamentalist ideology of cutting taxes for the rich and eliminating programs for everyone else will do nothing to stem the rising tide of inequality or improve the economic fortunes of ordinary families if we are going to more fairly share the vast wealth that our society produces we first need a political party dedicated to improving the economic well being of all americans that means we have to restore the historical identity of the democratic party as the champion of the poor workers and the middle class and so because this is a book about how to make things better it s a book about democrats it s about how in the wake of the reagan revolution we latched onto the idea that a more modern more sophisticated more business friendly democratic party could successfully compete for the white house it s about how this transformation while paying off in victories in four of the past seven presidential elections six if you go by the popular vote has left us impotent in the face of growing inequality even when in power and incapable of making the case that we can help families struggling against economic insecurity and misfortune and it s about how a new democratic party dedicated to a progressive economic agenda can take up the challenge of ensuring a decent life for every american

london first it was japan then europe now investors are scanning the world for the next outbreak of stagnant inflation and tumbling yields the malaise of japanification burst into the mainstream this year leaving in its wake a record amount of negative yielding debt quantitative easing qe and a low interest rate regime in europe delivered banner returns on the region s bonds at the expense of bank profits and retirement savings many say it recalls japan s lost decade it is a scourge that threatens to spread further perhaps even to the united states the world s largest economy might need only a slide into a plain vanilla recession to succumb to zero yields said mr jan loeys a senior adviser of long term investment strategy at jpmorgan chase while strong labour market data last week eased concerns about an imminent us downturn the country s yield curve has already signalled a recession is brewing if that comes to pass the federal reserve could emulate its peers in japan and the euro zone by cutting rates to zero and re introducing qe according to mr loeys add the risk of us political gridlock and excess global savings and we stay near zero bond yields for years he said it is a scenario preying on the minds of central bankers fed governor lael brainard is even floating the idea of asset purchases to suppress short to medium term borrowing costs in a scenario of zero rate benchmarks that would be like japan style yield curve control however fed and european central bank ecb policymakers are not expected to take any action following meetings this week for the fed it will be an opportunity to defend the status quo after three rate cuts this year last month s us payroll report sent treasury yields higher but has not dislodged bets the fed will keep interest rates on hold through at least the first quarter of next year with inflation still tepid fed chairman jerome powell has as good as ruled out a rate increase central banks have no choice but to be supportive of risk assets and asset prices until such time as fiscal expansion is possible said nomura asset management s mr richard hodges japanification related bets on europe s peripheral bonds this year helped him outperform 98 per cent of peers in italy political risk has done little to deter investors predicting that yields may reach 0 per cent next year amid speculation that the ecb could take rates down another notch meanwhile greece which faced borrowing costs of 44 per cent seven years ago now commands rates of just 1 5 per cent negative yields and a deluge of ecb cash have helped relieve stress in the euro zone s shakiest members but also made it harder for the region s banks to squeeze out a profit pension savings are also at risk creating an increasingly vociferous backlash yet another two holdouts among developed markets britain and australia could also soon capitulate to zero or sub zero yields japanification is this one big thing that will take a really long time to untangle said money manager chris rands at nikko asset management in sydney which manages us 224 billion s 304 billion globally the real problem is sitting in europe they re sneezing and we re catching the cold australia s central bank may be set to join the ecb and bank of japan down the once unthinkable route of qe after cutting its benchmark to a record low of 0 75 per cent in britain the tipping point could be a no deal exit from the european union according to citigroup while a conservative majority at the dec 12 election would likely see a divorce deal passed next year there is still the chance of a cliff edge exit at the end of next year volatility gauges suggest options traders are hunkering down for a long period of low rates after a brief spike in august and september amid a multitude of trade headlines a merrill lynch gauge of price swings in the european sovereign debt market is heading back to the all time lows seen this year in the us too the move index is falling towards the nadir seen in march at least the us yield curve has started steepening again on prospects of a late cycle boost from a potential trade truce between china and the us if we do not get a big external event like a fully fledged trade war then obviously we are much more in our baseline muddle through scenario said deputy chief investment officer sonja laud at legal general investment management in london it might not be enough to save more economies from being sucked into the negative yield trap even with better job data 10 year us yields have been stuck below 2 per cent since august mr jack mcintyre who helps oversee us 75 billion at brandywine global investment management in philadelphia expects us yields to cling to the same low levels next year but he is not ruling out the possibility that the 10 year benchmark could break through the all time low of 1 318 per cent set in 2016 i m not in the camp that believes us exceptionalism is going to keep us away from secular disinflationary influences that are driving yields lower he said if i m wrong about a recession and the fed has limited firepower then yields are going to get pretty close to negative

by shawn donnan that this is another big week for donald trump trade the global economy and financial markets from wall street to shanghai is an understatement too often these days what is getting lost or shrugged off is how consequential developments in the trade arena are or that the reason for that is because everything is now framed by politics and perceived wins or losses for trump with an eye on the 2020 election rather than a more sober economics which may be what historians end up ruing when they look back at this period some day this is a big week for three reasons what once seemed like an easy interim phase one deal between the u s and china to de escalate their trade war faces a deadline in the form of new tariffs on smartphones laptops and toys imported from china due to take effect sunday dec 15 unless an agreement can be closed meanwhile trump s efforts to hobble the global rules based trading order will notch their most substantive win when the world trade organization s appellate body will see the terms of two of its final three judges expire on tuesday leaving the wto s place as a neutral arbiter for trade disputes in tatters and then there is the least of the three the final march towards a deal with democrats to get trump s re negotiated and rebranded north american free trade agreement through congress the deal with democrats could come together this week putting a ratification vote for what is now known as the usmca on the same possible pre christmas timeline as an impeachment vote what s so significant about those three let s address them in reverse order robert lighthizer trump s trade czar set out to remake america s trade politics with the new nafta he seems to have succeeded for some that is a good thing he s ending an era of trade agreements as instruments of liberalization and encoding a new protectionism that s why democrats and labor unions having spent decades campaigning against trade deals like nafta seem poised to support one negotiated by a president they loathe then there are those who fear the economic consequence of that peace is a precedent for a more economic nationalism the most important raison d etre of the wto when it was created in the 1990s was its role as an independent arbiter that could defuse trade tensions before they became trade wars the at least temporary death of its appellate body means that is gone for now which means we risk re entering an era of unrestrained tit for tat tariff battles that can grow before long into trade wars that s not good for the global economy trump s greatest skill as president may not be in closing deals but in shifting the goalposts there are chinese commitments on intellectual property and currency but the small deal his negotiators are working to close with china is one that candid former administration officials will tell you looks a lot like the agreement to purchase vast amounts of american farm and other products that beijing was offering in 2017 that ignores how the context has changed though or the economic damage done already the u s and china were not marching toward a technological cold war then this week even if that phase one deal emerges there seems to be little doubt they are a peace if it comes will be hailed by trump yet the economic conflict his administration and china are engaging in continues to quietly broaden and grow charting the trade war the unexpected drop in china s exports in november shows one reason why the nation wants to agree on a phase one trade deal u s tariffs are hurting it at a time

face it then fix it it always sounds like a plausible proposition but when it comes to the question of social mobility it is an approach that has failed nobody could accuse our politicians of being in denial about the entrenchment of privilege from major to cameron by way of blair brown and clegg british political leaders would trip over each other to highlight how loaded the dice of life were against children from humble homes their speeches would mix a few shocking statistics about professions that slam doors on the poor with stock slogans about how things should be it s not where you come from it s where you re going soon after the speech some sort of education initiative would inevitably follow which would supposedly create an opportunity age similar language passed seamlessly between presidencies in the us from clinton to bush and obama yet after a generation of facing it nobody on either side of the atlantic believes we ve fixed social mobility at all and one marker of how politics has been transformed is how suddenly the language of aspiration has fallen from fashion the memorable phrase at donald trump s inauguration was not the american dream but american carnage and his project is about stoking resentment at opportunity denied not promising he can do much about it some months before the election jeremy corbyn s labour party formally ditched its attachment to social mobility in favour of a supposedly more inclusive notion of social justice as for boris johnson s pitch to voters in downtrodden britain he scarcely bothered to pretend as conservative leaders going back to churchill had done that he would provide them with a ladder up instead of opportunity it was all about patriotism policemen and hospitals security in other words it is not hard to grasp why politicians judged mobility to be a winning theme for so long it is for the same reason that dick whittington has endured as a story for centuries the idea that anyone can make it gives everyone hope nor is it hard to see why the warm words about aspiration have come to ring hollow their plausibility always depended more than anything else on a vague general sense that most children could expect to do better than their parents but the financial crisis has done for that the longest squeeze on wages since the napoleonic wars has hit the young especially hard home ownership rates for young adults are half what they were a generation ago and the only thing guaranteed by extra years of studying is sometimes debt in poorer communities even the old promise of longer lives has swung into reverse there are tentative signs of an american epidemic of deaths of despair arriving in the poorer parts of britain in december the office for national statistics sharply reduced its future forecasts for life expectancy it is not only politicians who have been forced into a rethink over the last year or so a stack of books and essays in both the uk and the us has been interrogating anew what we know about mobility sometimes dramatically altering the picture they have exposed too the inadequacy of the policies that used to drop out of the discussion and are even assaulting the ideal the underlies the debate meritocracy face it the politicians were not wrong over all those years to highlight the linkages between plum institutions and professions that lock out the poor there are some staggering facts about the iron grip which in some cases is strengthening that the wealthy have on many top jobs for example the sutton trust reports the 93 per cent of the population who went to state school fill only one in every three senior judicial posts in prospect in 2018 lady margaret hall principal alan rusbridger highlighted how for all the talk of access oxford colleges such as magdalen and trinity still recruit an outright majority of their british undergraduates from private schools duncan exley s the end of aspiration a lively mix of personal stories and research that traces the roots of disadvantage right back to the wombs of stressed mothers has some findings closer to home two thirds of the directors of organisations shortlisted for prospect magazine s 2018 think tank awards went to oxford or cambridge as he might have added did two of the three editors this magazine has ever had one of them me the other went to eton none of this is exceptional for media commissioning posts which exley notes have been shown to be especially exclusive upward mobility has declined and downward mobility has risen the young are taking as many steps down as up all this is not only eye catching but also important because just as those judges get to interpret our laws commissioning journalists get to settle which voices are heard and senior bankers 60 per cent privately educated exley reports decide which businesses secure finance but the narrow focus on elites doesn t tell us much about most people s chances of getting on in life the right way to gauge getting on is controversial on the one hand economists tend to go for income because it can be measured clearly in pounds and pence against them sociologists insist that we need to deal in the vaguer currency of class which gives a firmer handle on not only status and security in the moment but also economic prospects over time new books have emerged from both sides of this divide economist stephen machin helped to produce the single most quoted piece of british social science over the last generation in the early 2000s a study that tracked two postwar cohorts as they grew up and found more income mobility in the older than the younger group it proved the cue for all those political speeches about britain s sclerotic society machin has now joined forces with lee elliot major who himself walked a path from troubled teenager and school dropout to the campaigning sutton trust and latterly a professorship to produce the pointedly titled social mobility and its enemies to the familiar evidence on declining income mobility it adds some cross national charts suggesting britain and the us are more immobile societies than those across much of the continent plus thought provoking new detail on the brexit vote in towns where circumstances are not conducive to aspiration including in knowsley merseyside where schools recently if briefly stopped teaching a levels meanwhile in the sociologists corner john goldthorpe who rose from a yorkshire mining family to become a doyen of class analysis has teamed up with his oxford colleague erzsébet bukodi to produce social mobility and education in britain goldthorpe has stood doggedly against the received wisdom about britain s social churn in his view the seeming decline in income mobility was likely down to differences in the way that income was measured between the two postwar cohorts measure family income better and it will appear to bear more heavily on children s futures just as a more accurate blood pressure monitor will be a better predictor of a stroke some of this and the argument for using occupational class over income is relitigated in the new book but bukodi s cross border crunching of class picks new holes in the cross national studies ranking britain as a mobility laggard depending on the measure the book has it either mid table or towards the top of the mobility league at this point it might be tempting to dismiss the panic about declining mobility as bunk but that s not right either in everyday speech we blur different ideas about people getting on while you d expect a level playing field to produce more mobility in both directions more working class kids finding room at the top and more privileged families settling for run of the mill careers a lot of the time the real concern is not the total volume of shuffling but much more specifically the number of steps up the class ladder and it is upward rather than total mobility which will pretty obviously be the more popular cause in theory at least streetfuls of machine workers could see their sons and daughters rise to become managers doctors or engineers there is no automatic need for every social ladder to be matched by a snake the big practical question is whether the economy is creating opportunity in this way so how are we are doing on this score not well report bukodi and goldthorpe before the 1970s the winnowing of britain s smoke bellowing factories was balanced by the burgeoning of its offices and there were more steps up than steps down moreover this positive gap was tending to increase over time in more recent decades by contrast the trend has been for upward mobility to decline and downward mobility to rise worse for millennials born after 1980 it has got to a point where there are just as many steps down as up despite the achievements of feminism this looks to be true for younger women as well as younger men and here i suspect we have the real roots of the last generation of anxiety about mobility people really do hear fewer stories than they used to about sons and daughters of toil working their way up the professions are far bigger than they were in the 1950s or 60s but they re no longer growing as they once did that means more people are starting out at the top from where the only movement is going to be down and at the same time the openings for working class kids to take the step up are not growing like they used to as well as the evolving nature of the occupational structure it strikes me that the proletarianisation of service jobs through devices such as zero hours contracts which allow employers to turn labour on and off like a tap could be playing a role here in sum even if we may have sometimes worried about the wrong mobility question it wasn t wrong to want to face up to a problem because something really had gone wrong so what to do about it fix it in the third way days there was a plan summed up in blair s tricolon education education education it was more than a political slogan economic mainstream thought really did hold that better schools and bigger universities could solve every social ill when i started out at the institute for fiscal studies 20 odd years ago i remember reading a working paper that set out the basic theory there was high skilled labour and low skilled labour if we could only qualify more people to join the high skilled side of things that would not only boost mobility and productivity but reduce inequality too why because with the unskilled becoming relatively rarer and the skilled more abundant the forces of supply and demand should reduce the wage gulf between the two for all the methodological arguments between them the new batch of books agree on one thing fixating on education in isolation hasn t worked economists have always known and should never have forgotten that schooling was never simply about raising productivity but also acquiring bits of paper to signal that you ve got the edge over other people just as the financial crisis exposed how the complex contracts that made bankers rich were more about disguising risk than spreading it efficiently so perhaps now that productivity and upward mobility have failed to rise in line with expanded universities we need to give more weight to the getting ahead in the rat race aspect of education there are zero sum scrambles to get into the best classrooms and get the top scores within them which machin and elliot major sum up as an educational arms race a race rigged in favour of the privileged these problems are not only british they strike in any unequal society where the privileged are gripped by anxiety about how far they could fall writing in the atlantic in october 2019 journalist george packer described the ludicrous heights he felt obliged to go to in order to navigate the new york public ie state school system on behalf of his child from queuing to make an application in the chilly pre dawn to sinking a huge chunk of his time getting involved in running the school meanwhile in the meritocracy trap daniel markovits of yale law school elucidates how america s elite universities follow admissions procedures which are at once remarkably rigorous and yet also extraordinarily slanted in favour of wealthy students who can with effort almost always elbow everyone else aside at harvard and yale for example the top 1 per cent of the income distribution alone grabs more places than the entire bottom half how do the rich exert such a grip essentially through unremitting training including private tuition and increasingly vast school fees too in america private schooling was traditionally as much to do with religion as class but since enrolments in non sectarian institutions have quadrupled since the 1960s the us aristocracy has become as entangled in old school ties as the british elite has always been there is no limit on how far the educational arms race can go markovits reports that in south korea private tutoring now accounts for a staggering 12 per cent of all household expenditure with expanded universities graduates now marry and socialise overwhelmingly with other graduates and so education draws a sharper line between different worlds and the qualifications stampede can bukodi and goldthorpe argue actually strengthen the link between social origins and career destination because children of the well to do who might otherwise face a rocky ride have ample opportunities to secure qualifications placing a glass floor under how far they can fall meanwhile at the other end of the range even when allowance is made for a child s initial ability hardship and cramped housing exert an almighty bearing on what they can achieve in school there is no limit on the educational arms race in korea private tutoring accounts for 12 per cent of all household spending george w bush entrenched inherited privilege by swinging an axe at estate duties while bleating about no child left behind we must turn our minds to jobs the sort of posts which can provide esteem and opportunity bukodi and goldthorpe hint that the way we look at those golden post war years might be upside down the burgeoning of the professional classes was not caused by the great expansion of education it began too early for that rather it was the postwar economy that created the openings for say bookkeepers to train up into accountants on the job it was perhaps only after they had got there that they voted for bigger universities to give their own children a less laborious start in life still more of the supposed magic of education is dispelled by sociologists sam friedman and daniel laurison in the class ceiling why it pays to be privileged whereas many studies of class look at somebody with a good degree declare a triumph and move on this book does not assume that you can dump the baggage of class at a graduation ceremony or the door of your employer instead it looks at what happens to graduates of different backgrounds when they go to interview and how working class young adults fare if and when they make it into elite firms even those who storm the citadel go on to earn 6 400 less a near 16 per cent class pay gap the head start that professional parents give their children does not stop with coughing up for private tutoring during internships they can feed them for as long as it takes pay the bills and often offer a roof over their heads in the metropolis too but the book s reportage also suggests the power of something more nebulous differences in people s expectations and sense of entitlement as well as their fit within the elite a few extra years of education cannot equalise this because the differences are simply too deeply rooted as john lennon put it in working class hero as soon as you re born they make you feel small aside from university expansion the other third way idea for mobility was to create new types of schools academies in the uk or charter schools in the us some individual institutions have without doubt transformed results including mossbourne academy in east london a favourite day trip for english education ministers since it was built on the bulldozed remains of the failed hackney downs school but even fans of academies struggle to come up with a cogent account of why the organisational upheaval should in itself be expected to make much difference the managerial rewiring tends to empower school leaders at the cost of the professional autonomy of individual teachers that might be a good or a bad thing depending on whom the leaders and other teachers are the overall effect on mobility is bound to depend on how far or not circumstances allow the new or rebooted institution to recruit excellent teachers without damaging the wider educational ecology or attract promising pupils without reducing neighbouring institutions into the sort of sink schools that have always drowned working class hopes all of these things will vary sharply from case to case including the resources which have sometimes turned on whether a wealthy philanthropist can be persuaded to chip in recently one of those philanthropists confessed to second thoughts alongside bill gates and other entrepreneurs the american venture capitalist nick hanauer had written million dollar cheques to a charter school campaign but he explained in the july 2019 issue of the atlantic that he had come to view the project of educationism as a cleansing diversion for the consciences of plutocrats and a distraction for an economic system and jobs market that was failing ordinary citizens the piece earned a tweet from obama albeit with the quintessentially moderate former president s hedging his endorsement with insistence that he remained a supporter of education reform that caveat sounded a little half hearted the third way faith that we could educate our way towards a mobile society of equal chances has fizzled out the next question arising is whether it is still worth targeting social mobility at all machin and elliot major are still flying the flag for harder edged schools policies that might bring about more mobility for example allocating school places by lottery rather than by address and by extension the property market the trouble is that when such things have been tried they have run into almighty objections on the part of the privileged these objections were voiced by the supposed social mobility warrior david cameron who being asked about such lotteries said that a child s future should never be settled by the roll of the dice machin and elliot major resent the way that our 19th etonian prime minister seemed more troubled by fates being sealed by dice than silver spoons fair enough but they also effectively concede that there are grave political difficulties in securing a more consistently principled approach when they write that all of us as parents with hopes for our children are sometimes part of the problem and implicitly ask any parent with power and resources to challenge themselves for the sake of social progress is appealing to somebody s duties as a citizen over those they feel as a parent ever going to work one historical analysis of the surnames of oxbridge students going back to 1230 cited by exley suggests that many of the very same families make up both the modern and the medieval educational elite and concludes that mobility in 21st century england is little greater than in pre industrial times if opportunity is as closely hoarded as ever and as stubbornly resistant to change then the fiercest response taken by the anthropologist hadas weiss in we have never been middle class how social mobility misleads us is to reject the ladder up as an illusory alternative to inevitable class conflict she sees it as a sort of privatisation of responsibility the potential to become middle class suggests that social mobility both rising and falling is our own doing drawing on the experiences of anxious german savers and stretched israeli renters she explains that the notion of middle classness is imbued with moralising ideas about industry and thrift it correspondingly discounts the vast impersonal forces that can make or break fortunes indeed it is often unrealistic to expect even an educated individual without private means to swim against the tides of technology demographics global trade or economic depressions weiss is one of those who cheered on labour s move away from social mobility and back towards the older socialist agenda of rising with your class rather than rising from it she has good reason to be cynical the mobility discourse seemed to rule nothing out george w bush a man whose personal path to the white house began with a father in well the white house entrenched inherited privilege by swinging an axe at estate duties and at the same time bleated about no child left behind cameron could spend six years squeezing children s services and cutting poor family s benefits but then in his final months declare that his purpose in politics was a level playing field with opportunity for everyone the rhetoric of mobility never restricts political action because it is something which can only be seen deep in the rear view mirror what that super influential research by machin and colleagues a few years ago compared was the secondary school pupils of the first thatcher terms and those of edward heath s early 1970s premiership amid the soul searching of the mid 2000s neither the fast fading thatcher nor the deceased heath needed to fear being held to account from a different more philosophical angle both kwame anthony appiah in the new york review of books and markovits in the meritocracy trap have argued that it is time to reset the values that underpin the frenzied learn to earn culture appiah reminds us that the coiner of the m word michael young was describing not a utopia but a dystopia where the rich would be intolerably smug and the rest unacceptably dishonoured because vastly unequal rewards could be rationalised with reference to industry and effort markovits is convinced this is a dystopia we are already in in a controversial mirror image of thomas piketty s celebrated argument about the return of patrimonial capitalism and inherited wealth he argues that the great driver of inequality is in fact the outsize wages that the rich earn through interminable hours of cerebral labour which he thinks is ruining their lives for my money the analytical truth is probably half way between the two theories yes a large and growing proportion of big incomes are labelled as earnings but i suspect more of this is about the power of the rich to set their own pay than the ivy league enhanced productivity which markovits imagines that however is another argument what markovits does succeed in establishing for example by looking at the rocketing hours that top lawyers bill and the dreariness that has descended on middle american towns such as st clair shores michigan is that the american elite is somehow managing to simultaneously punish itself its tiger parented children and its compatriots the better alternative for markovits appiah and before them both young is to think anew about the good life and build a different society in its image a world where we stop obsessing about converting excellent exam results into exorbitant earnings and where in appiah s words each of us takes our allotment of talents and pursues a distinctive set of achievements and the self respect they bring that sounds very civilised and when you consider the scale of resources that meritocrats pour into getting ahead and staying there it is not necessarily more inefficient than what we ve already got and yet despite markovits s wise counsel about learning to be satisfied with good enough standards patients needing surgery or companies needing legal advice are not likely to stop hankering for the best despite weiss s radical arguments it is not only bourgeois moralists but also working class families who yearn for their children to get ahead there must be doubts about the viability of a progressive politics that cannot somehow accommodate such aspiration so what to do observing decades of data in which overall social churn never much changes bukodi and goldthorpe strike a fatalistic note maybe they suggest in free societies and capitalist economies the rich will always prevent their children from falling down the ladder decades of meritocratic rhetoric and policies have not reduced the power of social origins in fixing economic fortunes which often remain extreme what can and has changed over time by contrast is the ability of the economy to produce the jobs that allow people to take the step up from the working class rather than forgetting mobility we should concentrate on counting and targeting those steps up we have tested to destruction the idea that bigger universities or tinkering with schools will be enough to give everyone a fair crack of the whip campuses and classrooms are one part of wider society they cannot be insulated from it or inoculate their students from its effects nor will words about parity of esteem for vocational courses add up to anything unless and until they become a reliable passport to an esteemed occupation and so it is time to turn our minds to jobs it won t be easy the trend after all has been towards commodified work but is it beyond our collective wit to foster the growth of posts that can provide esteem and opportunities for advancement perhaps the next round of research grants should be directed less on retrospective analysis of social mobility instructive as it is and more on pinpointing ideas to make a difference there are some obvious places to look just as we re now encouraged to keep the planet in mind when we go to the high street perhaps we could give some thought to the job opportunities that open up or shut down when we shop eat and employ as we do myriad decisions in industrial and economic policy as well as in public procurement could bear on the range of jobs that exist so too might curbing the long hours culture that sees certain professionals hoard an outsize share of interesting work for decades downward mobility has gathered pace and steps up have become

and triggered a recession as the price of quashing double digit inflation has died according to his office he was 92 volcker took charge of the fed in august 1979 when the u s economy was in the grip of runaway inflation consumer prices skyrocketed 13 in 1979 and then by the same pace again in 1980 working relentlessly to bring prices under control volcker raised the fed s benchmark interest rate from 11 to a record 20 by late 1980 to try to slow the economy s growth and thereby shrink inflation those high interest rates made it so expensive for people and companies to borrow that the economy weakened steadily by january 1980 a recession had begun it lasted six months a deeper and more painful downturn took hold in july 1981 it endured for 18 months and sent unemployment up to 10 8 in november and december 1982 the highest level since the great depression in a statement monday former president jimmy carter who had chosen volcker to be fed chairman called him a giant of public service paul was as stubborn as he was tall and although some of his policies as fed chairman were politically costly they were the right thing to do carter said in the early 1980s volcker was vilified by the public for having triggered a severe recession in order to curb runaway price increases home builders put postage stamps on bricks and on 2 by 4 wooden planks and mailed them to the fed to protest how super high interest rates had wrecked their businesses auto dealers stuck with lots full of unsold cars did the same with car keys angry farmers struggling with high debts drove their tractors to washington and blockaded the fed s headquarters one of the mailed 2 by 4s ended up with an enduring legacy at the fed david wilcox a young staffer under volcker who later rose to direct the fed s research and statistics division said he received one of the 2 by 4s from larry slifman a former senior economist in the division and kept it on his desk until his retirement last year wilcox said he held onto it as a constant reminder of how vitally important it is that no major central bank ever lose control of inflation again creating the need for someone like volcker to do the incredibly courageous things he did david jones an economist and author of several books on the fed ranks volcker above all other chairmen since world war ii volcker was transformative in terms of fed policy jones said we are still enjoying the benefits of his success by sticking with his policies in the face of ferocious opposition volcker implicitly asserted the fed s independence from political and public interference throughout its history the fed has been seen as needing to operate independently in order to properly carry out its key functions of of maximizing employment and stabilizing prices in the past three years president donald trump has challenged that independence with his frequent attacks on the fed and his demands that it cut rates more aggressively once inflation was subdued volcker himself was privately pressured by president ronald reagan to lower rates faster than he wanted james baker treasury secretary during reagan s second term in the late 1980s chose supporters of lower rates to the fed s governing board this led to volcker being outvoted on a rate decision in 1986 though his opponents backed down news reports at the time said volcker had threatened to resign i had no doubt in my mind that baker wanted to surround me with his appointees volcker said later in an oral history compiled by the fed the pain of the recession he helped cause eventually produced the desired results inflation receded once it did volcker s fed began lowering interest rates and the economy rebounded vigorously enough for president ronald reagan to declare the arrival of morning in america on his way to a landslide victory in the 1984 presidential election volcker left the fed in 1987 succeeded by alan greenspan the volcker led victory over inflation is widely credited with beginning what economists call the great moderation more than two decades of mostly steady economic growth relatively low unemployment and modest price increases the great moderation ended with the great recession of 2007 2009 volcker had spent most of his career in the public sector at the treasury department the federal reserve bank of new york and the fed board in washington a towering 6 foot 7 and perpetually rumpled volcker favored cheap cigars and bad suits john connally a slick texan who was volcker s boss at the treasury in the early 1970s once threatened to fire him if he didn t get a haircut and improve his wardrobe despite his personal austerity volcker served in lucrative positions on wall street in between his stints in public service including an early career at chase manhattan bank he was chair of wolfensohn co an investment firm from 1988 to 1996 after leaving the fed volcker took on assignments as a troubleshooter he ran a commission to investigate what swiss banks did with the assets of holocaust victims during and after world war ii the united nations assigned him to look into allegations of corruption in a un program to provide food aid to iraq volcker who was born in cape may new jersey on sept 5 1927 he received a bachelor s degree from princeton university and a master s from harvard in 1951 he spent a year at the london school of economics as a rotary foundation fellow his survivors include his second wife anke dening and two children after the financial crisis of 2008 president barack obama recruited volcker as an economic adviser in that role volcker pressed for restrictions on banks ability to trade in financial markets with their own money rather than their clients and to invest in private equity and hedge funds the regulations known as the volcker rule were included in a far reaching financial overhaul bill congress passed in 2010 volcker had little sympathy for big banks in the wake of the financial crisis which required a taxpayer bailout of big wall street firms he dismissed claims that deregulated financial institutions deserved credit for coming up with innovative products

paul volcker who as federal reserve chairman in the early 1980s elevated interest rates to historic highs and triggered a recession as the price of quashing double digit inflation has died according to his office he was 92 volcker took charge of the fed in august 1979 when the u s economy was in the grip of runaway inflation consumer prices skyrocketed 13 in 1979 and then by the same pace again in 1980 working relentlessly to bring prices under control volcker raised the fed s benchmark interest rate from 11 to a record 20 by late 1980 to try to slow the economy s growth and thereby shrink inflation those high interest rates made it so expensive for people and companies to borrow that the economy weakened steadily by january 1980 a recession had begun it lasted six months a deeper and more painful downturn took hold in july 1981 it endured for 18 months and sent unemployment up to 10 8 in november and december 1982 the highest level since the great depression in a statement today former president jimmy carter who had chosen volcker to be fed chairman called him a giant of public service paul was as stubborn as he was tall and although some of his policies as fed chairman were politically costly they were the right thing to do carter said in the early 1980s volcker was vilified by the public for having triggered a severe recession in order to curb runaway price increases home builders put postage stamps on bricks and on 2 by 4 wooden planks and mailed them to the fed to protest how super high interest rates had wrecked their businesses auto dealers stuck with lots full of unsold cars did the same with car keys angry farmers struggling with high debts drove their tractors to washington and blockaded the fed s headquarters one of the mailed 2 by 4s ended up with an enduring legacy at the fed david wilcox a young staffer under volcker who later rose to direct the fed s research and statistics division said he received one of the 2 by 4s from larry slifman a former senior economist in the division and kept it on his desk until his retirement last year wilcox said he held onto it as a constant reminder of how vitally important it is that no major central bank ever lose control of inflation again creating the need for someone like volcker to do the incredibly courageous things he did david jones an economist and author of several books on the fed ranks volcker above all other chairmen since world war ii volcker was transformative in terms of fed policy jones said we are still enjoying the benefits of his success by sticking with his policies in the face of ferocious opposition volcker implicitly asserted the fed s independence from political and public interference throughout its history the fed has been seen as needing to operate independently in order to properly carry out its key functions of of maximizing employment and stabilizing prices in the past three years president donald trump has challenged that independence with his frequent attacks on the fed and his demands that it cut rates more aggressively once inflation was subdued volcker himself was privately pressured by president ronald reagan to lower rates faster than he wanted james baker treasury secretary during reagan s second term in the late 1980s chose supporters of lower rates to the fed s governing board this led to volcker being outvoted on a rate decision in 1986 though his opponents backed down news reports at the time said volcker had threatened to resign i had no doubt in my mind that baker wanted to surround me with his appointees volcker said later in an oral history compiled by the fed the pain of the recession he helped cause eventually produced the desired results inflation receded once it did volcker s fed began lowering interest rates and the economy rebounded vigorously enough for president ronald reagan to declare the arrival of morning in america on his way to a landslide victory in the 1984 presidential election volcker left the fed in 1987 succeeded by alan greenspan the volcker led victory over inflation is widely credited with beginning what economists call the great moderation more than two decades of mostly steady economic growth relatively low unemployment and modest price increases the great moderation ended with the great recession of 2007 2009 volcker had spent most of his career in the public sector at the treasury department the federal reserve bank of new york and the fed board in washington a towering 6 foot 7 and perpetually rumpled volcker favored cheap cigars and bad suits john connally a slick texan who was volcker s boss at the treasury in the early 1970s once threatened to fire him if he didn t get a haircut and improve his wardrobe despite his personal austerity volcker served in lucrative positions on wall street in between his stints in public service including an early career at chase manhattan bank he was chair of wolfensohn co an investment firm from 1988 to 1996 after leaving the fed volcker took on assignments as a troubleshooter he ran a commission to investigate what swiss banks did with the assets of holocaust victims during and after world war ii the united nations assigned him to look into allegations of corruption in a un program to provide food aid to iraq volcker who was born in cape may new jersey on sept 5 1927 he received a bachelor s degree from princeton university and a master s from harvard in 1951 he spent a year at the london school of economics as a rotary foundation fellow his survivors include his second wife anke dening and two children after the financial crisis of 2008 president barack obama recruited volcker as an economic adviser in that role volcker pressed for restrictions on banks ability to trade in financial markets with their own money rather than their clients and to invest in private equity and hedge funds the regulations known as the volcker rule were included in a far reaching financial overhaul bill congress passed in 2010 volcker had little sympathy for big banks in the wake of the financial crisis which required a taxpayer bailout of big wall street firms he dismissed claims that deregulated financial institutions deserved credit for coming up with innovative products and services the only useful financial innovation he d seen in years he said was the atm

summary of investment thesis dolphin capital investors ltd is a stock market ugly duckling a swan made of beautiful assets luxury homes resorts and land located in striking spots of the eastern mediterranean sea this beauty contrasts with the enormous destruction of shareholder value that started in the global financial crisis since 2008 the company s net asset value or nav has fallen close to 90 and thus dolphin is ignored and distrusted by market participants the investment thesis here is a simple one dolphin is liquidating and returning capital to shareholders by the end of the year 2021 trading today at 26 of company nav the market is heavily discounting operational improvements and mainly a well incentivized plan of liquidation and return of capital to shareholders todayâ s price is so low that even with further nav writedowns and with an extension of the liquidation date equity buying investors would still likely see market beating returns finally market participants are ignoring among several things the fact that the company has reduced its non recourse debt significantly yearly nav decreases have become smaller their latest sales of properties have been above nav and that the economic situation of greece and cyprus where most of dolphin s properties are located has improved note to investors dci trades over the counter in the otc pink sheets and the london stock exchange the transactional volume for this stock is very low in both markets but particularly low in the otc patience and thoughtfulness buying selling shares in this company are warranted introduction dolphin capital investors ltd dolphin or the company lse dci otc dolhf was formed in 2005 as the listed investment vehicle of dolphin capital partners a real estate private equity firm dolphin capital partners still manages the company and its partners own a meaningful stake circa 10 of dciâ s shares via dolphin capital holdings dciâ s raison d etre consists of investing and developing luxury real estate particularly in the resort and holiday home sector marketed towards ultra and high net worth individuals dciâ s 10 largest shareholders taken from the companyâ s november 2019 factsheet â there are no bad assets only bad pricesâ a well known investment saying goes it s difficult painful even to call dolphin capital investors ltd a bad asset after all dci owns and develops high end real estate projects that with no hesitation i would describe as extraordinarily beautiful furthermore these developments located in the eastern mediterranean were built in sites that are by themselves breathtaking to withhold one of dciâ s 42 3 to 5 bedroom villas in their kã a island project video overview of dolphin s amanzoe villas in porto heli greece project sold in 2018 unfortunately the companyâ s financial returns contrast highly with the loveliness and luxuriousness of its underlying assets long term investors of dolphin have seen the companyâ s reported net asset value or nav fall from a high of 1 69 billion euros in 2007 to a nav of 171 million euros reported this september dciâ s share price has reacted accordingly down from a 2007 high of around 180 pence the british pound cent equivalent to near 4 pence today dolphin has been a historically poor or bad if you will financial asset however one that today presents itself with a good price for opportunistic and event driven investors as a close to debt free dci is in the process of liquidating all assets and distributing returns to shareholders before venturing into writing about dolphinâ s liquidation process potential return scenarios and investment risks letâ s quickly delve into the company s history and give readers more context the dolphin jumped and then went underwater a short history dolphin capital investors ltd was listed in december 2005 on the london stock exchange lse alternative investment market aim the listing was successful raising 104 million euros of equity during its first few years helped with a buoyant global economy and heavy tailwinds in real estate things worked very well the company managed to successfully attract more capital since inception till 2015 dci raised close to 1 billion euros in equity offerings 854 million euros before 2008 including from well known and reputable investment firms like blackrock fortress investment group and third point capital dolphin capital partners founded and lead by experienced real estate investors mr miltos kambourides former partner and founder of soros real estate partners and mr pierre charalambides former jpmorgan investment banker and their team wasted no time investing dciâ s capital into several projects furthermore to bring luxury to the forefront of its projects dolphin partnered with world wide leading architects golf course designers and hotel operators for the development and running of its homes and resorts from its genesis the companyâ s investments and focus were in the eastern mediterranean countries of greece cyprus croatia and turkey by 2008 however the company ventured outside europe with a 70 purchase of playa grande in the dominican republic at its height in 2008 the company had 15 large real estate projects and over 60 smaller ones through aristo developers aristo cyprus s largest private landowner and one of the islandâ s biggest property developers was once a company subsidiary and is now an affiliate dci today owns 47 9 of aristo from its founding dolphinâ s management was targeting internal rates of return irr of between 25 to 45 for each of its projects dolphin capital investorsâ real estate projects in 2008 taken from dciâ s 2008 annual report alas this bright future was not to be as we all know the 2007 2008 global financial crisis hit real estate investors particularly hard repercussions of which were still felt in the early years of this decade as can be seen in the chart below by 2008 more than 80 of dciâ s investments were in greece and cyprus from 2009 to 2012 greece suffered economic hardships only comparable to those experienced in the great depression of 1929 cyprus was not left unscathed and suffered its own economic and financial crisis investors scurried sales and values plummeted and dolphinâ s portfolio of high end properties was marked down accordingly dolphin capital investors property portfolio in 2008 taken from dci s 2008 annual report as was described above dciâ s nav has fallen close to 90 from its height in 2008 by year end 2008 at 294 pence the companyâ s nav per share was the highest it had been since its founding and it had grown steadily every year sadly this state of affairs would not last and 2008 would prove to be a year of negative inflection for the fortunes of dolphinâ s investors from this year onwards 2014 being the only exception dci would see its net asset value fall every year continuously a painful experience for anyone to witness dolphin capital investorsâ nav funds raised and funds invested from 2006 to 2010 taken from the companyâ s 2010 annual report dolphin capital investorsâ nav from 2010 to half year 2019 authorâ s table taken from company annual reports dolphin its board and management took many actions and went to great lengths to try to steer their ship back into safer waters joint ventures and partnerships were formed financial permutations and combinations of some of their assets took place further equity offerings and debt placements were made development of their real estate continued headwinds unfortunately prevailed and positive economic returns akin to those before 2008 never made a comeback to paraphrase warren buffett a bad horse is not changed by a jockey no matter how good the jockey in june 2015 in conjunction with the announcement of dolphinâ s last equity raise the newly replaced board announced a review of the companyâ s strategy from then on dolphinâ s properties would be divided into â core projectsâ and â non core assetsâ management would focus on the development of the former and the sale of the latter 5 of dciâ s properties would be considered â core assetsâ and 10 would be up for sale in addendum to the previous two announcements on that same circular for shareholders the board shared it would hold an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders before the end of 2016 to vote on â a resolution for the continuation of the companyâ on december 2 2016 the meeting was announced to be held on december 19 2016 in its december 2 circular dolphinâ s board recommended against the continuation of the company and for the â new asset strategyâ the new asset strategy contemplated the orderly sale of all of dciâ s assets a change to the structure of managementâ s fees and the return of net proceeds to shareholders by no later than 31 december 2019 shareholders overwhelmingly voted in favor of the boardâ s recommendations and thus the company s liquidation began liquidation process round 1 planning fallacy before shareholders agreed on an orderly sale of all assets as noted in 2015 dolphinâ s board commenced a new strategy one seeking to monetize some of the companyâ s assets in 2016 before the liquidation plan was given the green light dolphin managed to sell playa grande in the dominican republic one of their core assets and agreed to sell itâ s 49 75 stake in aristo developers playa grande was sold for an enterprise value of 140 million euros 10 below the projectâ s carrying gross asset value and below the companyâ s estimated project nav this last figure was not shared but the transaction reduced company group debt by 130 million euros dolphin agreed to sell its 49 75 stake of aristo developers to aristoâ s main shareholder mr theodoros aristodemou for 45 million euros a price 70 below the carrying value of its stake reflecting aristoâ s debt restructuring and poor performance the last couple of years in may 2017 the company terminated the sale of its aristo stake citing the buyerâ s failure to settle deferred payments and kept a 47 9 stake in aristo to date dci has not been able to sell assets at a rate that would meet its liquidation goal no doubt further souring market participants to its prospects and depressing its stock price in its 2019 interim report however the company stated â since the adoption of the initial disposal strategy in 2016 dci has been able to execute six significant asset disposals at an aggregate enterprise value of c â 344 million reduce the group debt by more than â 210 million and achieve important permitting and entitlements decisions for its remaining asset portfolioâ as last reported in september 2019 the company had sold 6 out of 15 assets described in their may 2019 press release out of these 9 assets remaining for sale the company considers 3 of these aristo kilada hills and kã a island as their main assets and of material import for substantial shareholder distribution the first of these two sales realized in 2016 was done at 77 of nav the second one done in 2017 at 50 of nav more recent disposals though smaller in monetary value were done last year at or above nav please refer to the table below summary of significant transactions since the liquidation strategy commenced taken from the companyâ s april 10 2019 circular to shareholders planning fallacy a well known human bias first proposed by famous behavioral psychologists daniel kahneman and amos tversky entails the idea that we humans tend to be overly optimistic when it comes to how long and how many resources a planned course of action will take whether or not dciâ s management and its board fell prey to this fallacy by early 2019 it was clear that all assets would not be sold before the proposed deadline of year end 2019 given the state of affairs described in the previous paragraph earlier this year the board convened another extraordinary meeting of shareholders and recommended to vote for the modification of the liquidation strategy a change to managementâ s agreement and the extension of the liquidation deadline by year end 2021 on may 2 of this year the extraordinary meeting was held and shareholders though with less enthusiasm once again approved the board s recommendations liquidation process round 2 market beating returns dci trades at a market capitalization of 38 million gpb a whopping low 26 of its last reported nav of 146 5 million gbp the market gives little merit to dolphinâ s stated net asset value and to the property valuations done by colliers international and american appraisals see valuation certificates at the end of every company annual report 2018 report certificates starts on page 78 both recognized real estate valuators on which the companyâ s nav is based given the historical context of the company and the enormous amount of shareholder equity destroyed this comes as no surprise why then is this time any different for investors well because the company is liquidating and has a board and a shareholder base that wants to see this done reassuringly as can be seen in the table below even with further nav writedowns and additional postponements of the stated liquidation deadline investors at todayâ s depressed price will likely realize outsized returns finally changes to management fees that are better aligned to shareholders vs the ones approved during dolphinâ s first liquidation strategy in 2016 should incentivize management to dispose of assets before the end of the year 2021 and to seek adequate prices for their properties liquidation scenarios of nav after ditl deferred income taxes and liabilities returns and cagrs from todayâ s price authorâ s table in its april 2019 circular the company shared that with its new liquidation strategy as is apparent by analyzing the table above by taking managementâ s low guidance for shareholder returns of 85 million euros or 72 8 million british pounds investors would earn a 91 72 return on their investment a 36 yearly compounded annual growth rate cagr by the companyâ s stated liquidation goal of year end 2021 and a 17 cagr if shareholders agree to extend this goal post by another 2 years a better incentivized manager show me the incentives and i ll show you the outcome charles t munger as mentioned important changes took place this year so that management is now better aligned with shareholders and better incentivized for an effective sale of all company assets whereas in the previous liquidation strategy the investment manager was entitled to a percentage of the enterprise value of assets sold it is now crucially entitled to a percentage of distributions to be made by the company to shareholders additionally managementâ s annual fee has been reduced to 3 6 million euros annually from the year 2020 from 4 million 5 million and 6 million euros in the last three years reducing operational costs variable management fees to be paid to management as a percentage of shareholder distributions taken from april 2019 company circular risk 1 an entrenched manager risk of management kicking the can down the road slowing dolphin s asset sales all while safely collecting a yearly 3 6 million euros management fee seems reasonable at first glance after all optics play a part here if there is anybody who has made apparent substantial gains from dci it is management itself dolphin capital partners i say apparent as we are oblivious to dcp s cost of doing business upon further thought however i would minimize this risk while it is true that management is well versed with the geography and nature of the company s assets as well as their development and a change of management could affect the timely liquidation of the company facts speak otherwise management with an active participant board of directors has and continues to make positive steps towards liquidation since its liquidation strategy commenced to date gross enterprise value sales of the company s assets amount to 344 million euros vs today s company nav of 171 million in other words they ve sold more than double in monetary terms than today s nav a nav that assumes very little debt for many years now management has agreed to a substantial reduction of fees in line with the dwindling prospects of the company management s agreement with dolphin expires at the end of 2021 or when all assets are sold whichever comes first this agreement can only be renewed by a new shareholder vote shareholders most of which are asset event driven and value funds owning close to 70 of the company voted overwhelmingly in favor of liquidating the company dolphin s board and its shareholders would not look favorably upon management if their actions can be interpreted as slowing down this process finally one must not forget that management owns close to 10 of the company at a 10 ownership dolphin capital partners is not and cannot become an entrenched manager alternatively company distributions to shareholders variable sale fees would likely amount to several years worth of management fees further incentivizing management to press forward with the shareholder approved liquidation strategy risk 2 further writedowns to stress this point one final time for many years market participants have had little faith in dciâ s prospects and in guidance given by management in hindsight this view has proven accurate in its december 2 2016 circular with nav more than twice the amount today the company shared a more rosy outlook for its liquidation strategy that given this depressive outlook by the marketplace dolphinâ s value today implies continued average nav writedowns of 40 annually to the end of 2021 its liquidation goal or almost 25 if the company were to extend this date for another 2 years average annual rate of nav reduction from june 30 2019 figures vs investment horizon in relation to nav liquidation after ditl at different percentages authors table in my opinion there are various reasons why the market holds a wrong and overly pessimistic view of the companyâ s liquidation prospects company assets sold between 2016 and 2017 were done at 71 and 50 of nav respectively a sale of all remaining company assets at 50 of nav would equate to a gross figure that is 81 5 above dolphinâ s current market cap assets sold in 2018 were done at nav or above it aristo developers in dolphinâ s books for 43 million euros has seen substantial sales growth and significant debt reduction that could potentially signify upside in the sale of dciâ s 47 9 stake in the company additionally this year dciâ s management was able to negotiate and sell its share of 37 hectares owned by aristo for 9 million euros while retaining the same percentage ownership in the company since 2011 dolphinâ s nav has decreased an average of 19 90 an annual reduction of 19 90 of the companyâ s nav by year end 2021 would still imply a liquidation above 50 of nav by year end 2023 an annual 19 90 reduction of nav would equate an upside of 32 from todayâ s price and a cagr of 7 nothing to write home about but not a money losing venture for investors nav reduction after ditl deferred income taxes and liabilities has slowed down these past two years in 2017 nav after ditl was reduced 17 09 and in 2018 the decrease was 14 95 along with lower management fees and a rationalization of the companyâ s cost structure reporting lower sg a and finance costs the company has been able to reduce non recourse debt to record low levels of gross assets the board also stated in its december 2016 company liquidation strategy circular that it is committed to financing property developments through joint ventures and debt avoiding new equity offerings nav gross assets group debt and shares outstanding from years 2010 to half year 2019 authors table as the company stated in its 2019 interim report significant shareholder distributions will come mainly from three assets aristo developers kã a island and kilada as can be read in the linked report dolphinâ s management has continued to make strides rationalizing their cost structure reducing debt monetizing developing forming joint ventures financing and zoning of these three assets and all remaining properties with the aim to complete and realize asset sales by year end 2021 greece and cyprus where 85 of the companyâ s real estate value remains have continued with their economic recovery distribution of dciâ s assets by landsize and real estate value taken from the companyâ s november 2019 factsheet risk 3 no bids given the enormous discount to nav the company currently trades at and the fact that the company extended its liquidation deadline to the end of 2021 market participants could also be expressing the risk that dolphin is not finding buyers for its assets there is possibly some truth to this view management themselves recently stated although the economies in greece cyprus croatia and turkey have continued to recover the market for undeveloped real estate in those countries has yet to make a significant recovery undoubtedly if markets and the world economy were to turn sour a risk i describe in a section below dolphin would likely find it very difficult to see bids for its assets it is possible that has already been the case and that dolphin needed this extension to further develop its main assets and thus make them more palatable for potential buyers the board in fact expressed this sentiment somewhat in its last report so that meaningful distributions for shareholders can be achieved predominantly from the sale of the companyâ s three major projects kilada and ooki require significant development to maximize sale proceeds to facilitate material distributions to shareholders whilst the companyâ s divestment from aristo requires the ability to structure and implement an exit transaction for a minority shareholding the board intends to make distributions on the receipt of the net proceeds of sale of each of these three major assets the development and sale of dolphin s core three assets are the company s main objectives happily for shareholders the company is making strides developing kilada and kã a islanda while aristo developers is seeing enormous growth in sales there are also some fundamental reasons countering the rationale that the company is not or has not found sufficient interest from buyers the company has already sold its most ambitious and debt laden projects mostly those that were advanced in their development stage it has also recently sold several assets above nav and it has found a way to monetize part of its aristo holding though perhaps not many there have been buyers and the company indeed has been willing to part with its properties with prices below their project navs risk 4 more and more extensions is not a liquidation as i showed above even further write downs of nav and further extensions of the liquidation deadline could still make dci a winning and market beating investment investors however will logically ask themselves if a further extension will happen for a third time in 2021 or a fourth in 2023 or even a fifth in 2025 though the company clearly states shareholder distributions will mainly come from its three core assets one cannot leave aside a scenario in which the board and management after successfully selling these three assets would want a further extension and another and another so as to develop the remaining undeveloped ones and allow for better selling prices this would mean that the company is being run as a going concern and is not truly liquidating investors can find it worrisome that as can be seen on page 16 of the company s latest financial results under permitting status update only 2 out of its 9 assets are currently under construction this idea would certainly go against the stated liquidation objectives of the board approved by shareholders and obviously investors would have to vote approvingly for this change of heart i find this idea to have little merit as dolphin has sold several underdeveloped assets in the past and given the amount of pain investors in dolphin have endured it is unlikely that shareholders would welcome this course of action though it is reasonable to expect shareholder approval of another extension in 2021 one that would require investors having already seen significant shareholder distributions i believe the board and the company s management clearly intend to sell all assets and close dci s doors as soon as possible interestingly as to want to express to shareholders that the board is serious in its intentions of liquidating on or before the end of year 2021 the board included the following statement in its 2019 liquidation extension circular continuation resolution the board believes that it is appropriate for shareholders to have an opportunity to review the effectiveness of the new asset strategy and the results achieved by the board and the investment manager and accordingly although the company will have no fixed life shortly before 31 december 2021 the board will convene and hold a shareholders meeting at which an ordinary resolution for the continuation of the company will be proposed if any such resolution is not passed proposals will be put by the board to the shareholders within six months after the date of the resolution to the effect that the company be wound up liquidated reconstructed or unitised risk 5 macro headwinds 2 0â in my opinion dolphinâ s market value at todayâ s price presents investors with an asymmetric risk reward opportunity in which its difficult to foresee losing much money and easier to see favorable returns however a return to difficulties in the global economy would in all likelihood forestall these returns much as it affected dolphinâ s value in 2009 and subsequent years a new global economic downturn and jitters in financial markets could potentially reduce or eliminate interested buyers in the companyâ s assets and negatively affect ongoing operations i normally pay little attention to forecasting macroeconomic developments or potential market downturns believing itâ s mostly a naive exercise and that time is better spent finding undervalued and asymmetric investment opportunities however this investment thesis hinges upon an effective liquidation of dciâ s assets if difficult times are soon to return and management has difficulties with their liquidation effort the company might be forced to either 1 wait for better times or 2 sell their assets at bargain prices both potential actions would reduce or eliminate positive investment returns and risk permanent capital impairment my number one consideration when investing there are reasons to be concerned and thus investors should take this possibility into account for what they consider an adequate position size given what they believe this risk to be to name but a few current macro dark clouds the us has not experienced a recession in 10 years and slower growth for q4 has been forecasted us equity markets are at all time highs market valuations are equally high and scarily comparable to the years 1929 and 2000 unresolved us china trade dispute lower global economic trade slower economic growth in europe slower economic growth and high debt levels in china having stated the above as is always the case with pretending to be oracles of the future reasonable minds will opine differently one can easily find many solid contrarian arguments to the macro concerns i raised such as the enormous amount of accommodative liquidity given by central banks the truth is we donâ t know or donâ t know for sure or when what will happen it is much easier to evaluate and foresee positive risk adjusted returns by investing today in dolphin capital investors ltd with its ongoing liquidation process and public company information available than it is to accurately account for the future direction and force of an enormously complex system like the global economy and its consequences to dci conclusion dolphin capital investors ltd is no melting ice cube it s assets do have value true dolphin s assets have been marked down extensively since the great financial crisis and the company has been a money losing proposition for shareholders since then however marketplace participants confounding uncertainty with risk are not properly analyzing nor appropriately pricing the company s change of direction since 2015 and the operational and financial improvements of recent years an over pessimistic marketplace is offering us shares in this liquidating company with an implied total markdown of 74 of the company s nav market cap of 38 million gbp vs nav before ditl of 146 5 mill gbp a change in the board of directors in 2015 the change in the company s strategic direction since that year a steep change to the way management was paid and incentivized and finally a change to the very conception of the company s continued existence coupled with an enormous discount to nav is essentially what makes investing in dolphin today an interesting and likely money winning proposition one that offers investors outsized returns even with further nav writedowns and further extensions to the liquidation deadline as has been shown
paul volcker who as federal reserve chairman in the early 1980s elevated interest rates to historic highs and triggered a recession as the price of quashing double digit inflation has died according to his office he was 92 volcker took charge of the fed in august 1979 when the u s economy was in the grip of runaway inflation consumer prices skyrocketed 13 in 1979 and then by the same pace again in 1980 working relentlessly to bring prices under control volcker raised the fed s benchmark interest rate from 11 to a record 20 by late 1980 to try to slow the economy s growth and thereby shrink inflation those high interest rates made it so expensive for people and companies to borrow that the economy weakened steadily by january 1980 a recession had begun it lasted six months a deeper and more painful downturn took hold in july 1981 it endured for 18 months and sent unemployment up to 10 8 in november and december 1982 the highest level since the great depression file former chairman of the federal reserve paul volcker visits fox business network s cavuto coast to coast at fox studios on june 17 2015 in new york city in a statement monday former president jimmy carter who had chosen volcker to be fed chairman called him a giant of public service paul was as stubborn as he was tall and although some of his policies as fed chairman were politically costly they were the right thing to do carter said in the early 1980s volcker was vilified by the public for having triggered a severe recession in order to curb runaway price increases home builders put postage stamps on bricks and on 2 by 4 wooden planks and mailed them to the fed to protest how super high interest rates had wrecked their businesses auto dealers stuck with lots full of unsold cars did the same with car keys angry farmers struggling with high debts drove their tractors to washington and blockaded the fed s headquarters one of the mailed 2 by 4s ended up with an enduring legacy at the fed david wilcox a young staffer under volcker who later rose to direct the fed s research and statistics division said he received one of the 2 by 4s from larry slifman a former senior economist in the division and kept it on his desk until his retirement last year wilcox said he held onto it as a constant reminder of how vitally important it is that no major central bank ever lose control of inflation again creating the need for someone like volcker to do the incredibly courageous things he did david jones an economist and author of several books on the fed ranks volcker above all other chairmen since world war ii volcker was transformative in terms of fed policy jones said we are still enjoying the benefits of his success by sticking with his policies in the face of ferocious opposition volcker implicitly asserted the fed s independence from political and public interference throughout its history the fed has been seen as needing to operate independently in order to properly carry out its key functions of of maximizing employment and stabilizing prices in the past three years president donald trump has challenged that independence with his frequent attacks on the fed and his demands that it cut rates more aggressively once inflation was subdued volcker himself was privately pressured by president ronald reagan to lower rates faster than he wanted james baker treasury secretary during reagan s second term in the late 1980s chose supporters of lower rates to the fed s governing board this led to volcker being outvoted on a rate decision in 1986 though his opponents backed down news reports at the time said volcker had threatened to resign i had no doubt in my mind that baker wanted to surround me with his appointees volcker said later in an oral history compiled by the fed the pain of the recession he helped cause eventually produced the desired results inflation receded once it did volcker s fed began lowering interest rates and the economy rebounded vigorously enough for president ronald reagan to declare the arrival of morning in america on his way to a landslide victory in the 1984 presidential election volcker left the fed in 1987 succeeded by alan greenspan the volcker led victory over inflation is widely credited with beginning what economists call the great moderation more than two decades of mostly steady economic growth relatively low unemployment and modest price increases the great moderation ended with the great recession of 2007 2009 volcker had spent most of his career in the public sector at the treasury department the federal reserve bank of new york and the fed board in washington a towering 6 foot 7 and perpetually rumpled volcker favored cheap cigars and bad suits john connally a slick texan who was volcker s boss at the treasury in the early 1970s once threatened to fire him if he didn t get a haircut and improve his wardrobe despite his personal austerity volcker served in lucrative positions on wall street in between his stints in public service including an early career at chase manhattan bank he was chair of wolfensohn co an investment firm from 1988 to 1996 after leaving the fed volcker took on assignments as a troubleshooter he ran a commission to investigate what swiss banks did with the assets of holocaust victims during and after world war ii the united nations assigned him to look into allegations of corruption in a un program to provide food aid to iraq volcker who was born in cape may new jersey on sept 5 1927 he received a bachelor s degree from princeton university and a master s from harvard in 1951 he spent a year at the london school of economics as a rotary foundation fellow his survivors include his second wife anke dening and two children after the financial crisis of 2008 president barack obama recruited volcker as an economic adviser in that role volcker pressed for restrictions on banks ability to trade in financial markets with their own money rather than their clients and to invest in private equity and hedge funds the regulations known as the volcker rule were included in a far reaching financial overhaul bill congress passed in 2010 volcker had little sympathy for big banks in the wake of the financial crisis which required a taxpayer bailout of big wall street firms he dismissed claims that deregulated financial institutions deserved credit for coming up with innovative products and services the only useful financial innovation he d seen in years he said was the atm

it s no secret that the lamont administration plans to reform the way state government doles out incentives to private companies looking to add jobs or make significant capital investments in connecticut now the strategy is finally taking shape in a recent interview with hartford business journal department of economic and community development decd commissioner david lehman bared the state s new economic incentives playbook which will focus on four key programs including two new concepts the overall goal is to move toward a performance based earn as you go system meaning employers won t reap state incentives until they create a certain number of jobs or make a certain level of investment image that will prevent the cash strapped state from having to clawback funds from companies that fail to live up to their deals it also reverses a policy direction set decades ago and put into overdrive by the malloy administration which aggressively ramped up corporate incentives to the tune of more than 650 million in loans and grants and hundreds of millions more in tax credits that companies benefited from up front before they created jobs the new strategy will not require the state to borrow money up front to incentivize job growth lehman said although the programs annual costs or what caps might be instituted haven t been fully fleshed out gov ned lamont has already significantly scaled back economic aid to private companies having reduced decd s bond funding by 60 percent this year compared 2018 lehman said the agency has done around 60 million in incentive deals so far this year compared to previous years when the average was around 200 million he said i don t think we need to have or should have the best or most aggressive job creation incentives lehman said i think we need to have a competitive strategy that works for taxpayers and grows the economy the four major programs the state will now focus on include a modified small business express program that will no longer offer state loans or grants but instead morph into a loan guarantee program run by private banks the grow ct rebate which is provided to companies in certain major industries that create at least 25 well paying jobs and a greater focus on two existing incentive programs the urban and industrial site reinvestment tax credit and the sales use tax relief program image lehman said the new incentive strategy will be as transparent and formulaic as possible and focus more on a specific subset of industries key to the state s future there will be some flexibility if a major deal comes around like if amazon is looking for a city or state to add 500 jobs but don t expect to see a bunch of one off incentive packages outside the state s new toolkit the goal is to also incentivize growth he added so companies that try to hold the state hostage by threatening to move elsewhere may have less of a chance of winning a tax deal or incentives my personal view on this is that we should not be incentivizing retention lehman said the incentives strategy overhaul comes as states across the country have ramped up economic assistance to businesses in recent years hoping to woo new jobs and investment however incentives are controversial as their overall value and costs to states remain a point of contention and debate tim bartik a senior economist for the w e upjohn institute for employment research in michigan said paying out incentives only after jobs are created or investments made is a strategy used by many other states especially those that want to avoid clawing back money if a deal goes sour image tim bartik senior economist w e upjohn institute for employment research it also allows governors or mayors to make out politically he said because they get the upfront benefit of announcing new jobs while the next administration typically has to pay out the incentive regardless of the form bartik says many state incentives are excessive and in 75 percent of cases most jobs would have been created even without government support he argues there are other things states can do to spur job creation that would be more cost effective like invest in customized job training or other workforce development programs a majority of voters really like it when governors and mayors aggressively go after jobs bartik said they don t understand all the complicated arguments over whether these incentives pay off here s a breakdown of the four incentive programs decd plans to focus on small business express the small business express program was created under the malloy administration toward the tail end of the great recession to make available additional capital at a time when banks had tightened their lending standards it provides grants loans and forgivable loans to small businesses with 100 or fewer employees ranging from high tech firms to mom and pop shops that promise to add jobs or make some kind of capital investment from fiscal 2012 to the end of fiscal 2018 the program doled out 295 million to 1 825 companies which promised to create 6 944 jobs and retain an existing 19 305 jobs the malloy administration hailed the program as a success and lawmakers renewed funding for it multiple times but it wasn t without controversy a number of deals went sour raising concerns the state was wasting taxpayer dollars bankers also criticized the program arguing state government shouldn t be in the lending business and that small business express was taking away some of their potential customers connecticut bankers association president and ceo tom mongellow said bankers urged the malloy administration to convert the program into a loan guarantee product akin to the u s small business administration but their pleas went nowhere lehman on the other hand is buying in he said he wants to move decd away from being a direct lender instead the agency would work with banks on a loan guarantee program where lenders handle the underwriting due diligence and actual loan while the state puts aside a pot of money to back bad bets banks would pay the state a fee for guaranteeing the loans the industry has always been in favor of that type of approach said mongellow who added that banks will be able to better leverage state dollars because 1 million set aside by taxpayers can support 10 million in private loans that is great use of limited state dollars lehman said the program s emphasis would also shift toward woman owned companies underserved communities and distressed municipalities we want to change the way we do small business lending lehman said we were doing a lot of direct lending and my fear is that we were doing loans that were competing with banks and offering a better rate so we were cannibalizing their business or we were making loans that banks wouldn t make and there was this adverse selection the grow ct rebate incentive another incentive the grow ct rebate will reward companies in specific industries finance and insurance advanced manufacturing health care bioscience technology and digital media that create at least 25 jobs paying above average wages the goal lehman said is to move away from providing incentives to any old company and strategically invest in well paying jobs that support important industry clusters to qualify a company will need to create at least 25 eligible jobs that pay above a certain threshold say 110 percent above the median income within a certain town city or county the exact pay threshold hasn t been determined the company would be reimbursed an amount equal to 25 percent of the state income tax paid by the new employees the benefit would increase to 50 percent of the state income tax paid if a company is located within an opportunity zone lehman said the payments would start at the beginning of year three and run through year seven but could be extended two years beyond that bartik the economist said that type of incentive is not huge compared to what other states are offering lehman said the program which will require legislative approval will be transparent allowing companies and others to understand who qualifies and how every economic developer in every town will know exactly the benefits that are available lehman said there will be transparency and simplicity sales use tax relief program the sales use tax relief program hasn t received a lot of public attention over the years even though it s been around for two decades and has issued 286 million worth of sales tax exemptions to 111 companies and projects most recently connecticut innovations the state s quasi public venture investor that oversees the program approved its largest deal ever a 55 2 million exemption on the purchase of computer servers to fill a proposed new britain data center that s slated for construction in the coming years lehman said it s a powerful program because some states don t charge a sales and use tax on certain equipment so it allows connecticut to potentially level the playing field just from a competitive standpoint there are times when you want to utilize that particularly for significant or transformative investments he said to qualify a project must be valued at more than 4 million so the program is only for initiatives that involve fairly significant investment the program has avoided the spotlight perhaps because it provides tax exemptions rather than loans or grants that typically add to the state s bonded debt or tax credits that can impact state revenue projections the statewide sales and use tax rate is 6 35 percent but state lawmakers over the years have carved out exemptions for an array of purchases including manufacturing machinery lehman said he would like to better define how companies qualify for the program urban and industrial site reinvestment tax credit wwe made a splash earlier this year when it announced plans to relocate its stamford global headquarters within the city leasing 410 000 square feet at 677 washington blvd the former north american home of ubs the state also helped facilitate that deal by offering the wrestling entertainment company 8 5 million in urban and industrial site reinvestment tax credits which is available to projects that add significant new economic activity and jobs at an old industrial site or urban center to be eligible projects have to invest at least 2 million to 50 million or more depending on the type of development wwe for example plans to invest 160 million and create 275 new full time jobs over time decd said the full tax credit is allowable over 10 years but companies don t see any benefit until three years after they made their investment it can be used to defray a number of taxes including those levied against corporations insurance companies and healthcare centers from fiscal years 2009 to 2018 the state awarded 506 5 million in urban and industrial site reinvestment tax

photo marcelo hernandez getty images anti government protests have roiled the globe in 2019 from hong kong and indonesia to lebanon and iraq but the mobilizations in south america took many by surprise over the past three months virtually every andean nation venezuela ecuador peru bolivia chile and colombia has erupted into mass protest the protests have some common threads but their different sparks also make for unique explanations and outcomes after teasing out some common themes in the protests here s what s useful to know about what is happening and why arranged by countries from south to north united in frustration the clear common denominator in all protests stems from economic woes according to the international monetary fund latin america and the caribbean economies will grow an anemic 0 2 this year the worst performance of any major region in the world compare that to the growth of emerging markets slated to rise globally by 3 9 in 2019 the region s slowdown is clashing with rising expectations the economic reforms undertaken by many countries in the early part of this century coincided with a commodities boom that lifted 10 million latin americans every year into the middle class from 2002 to 2012 as a result the percentage of latin americans living in poverty shrank from 45 to 25 in that same period but rising middle class status brings middle class expectations people don t only want more schools or wider access to health care but better schools and shorter waits for doctors the subsequent slowdown left citizens feeling like the rug was pulled out from under them just as circumstances were improving there is also a lack of confidence in the political system corruption scandals and inequality rates are harder than ever for latin americans to swallow according to the latin american public opinion project at vanderbilt university only 57 7 of latin americans support democracy the lowest level since the survey was started 15 years ago more than 80 of citizens across the region believe at least half of their politicians are corrupt chileans demand more the protests in chile long considered the region s economic and democratic model were the most surprising the chilean economy will expand by close to 3 in 2019 even though the economy s dependence on copper exports has proved painful amid trade wars and china s slowing growth inflation is low unemployment has been steady and poverty rates have declined to less than 10 over the last three decades but while the economy performed brilliantly over the past decades growth slowed in the past five years and the cost of living skyrocketed socioeconomic immobility remains pervasive chileans demand better pensions improved public services quality education and wider access to health care protestors have called for redistribution and better public services facing a popular movement the administration of chile s president sebastián piñera successfully negotiated with lawmakers a national accord to hold a referendum in april 2020 on whether to have a new constitution and what kind of body should write it this is now seen as the key to the structural change that many young chileans seek and a vote for a new constitution seems unstoppable most chileans support the idea and all parties except for some on the far left and the far right have signed the accord most likely chile will maintain a competitive market economy with stronger elements of european style welfare so if chile s new constitution can succeed both in defending capitalism and leveling the social playing field the protests go into the history books as having contributed to advancing not deterring president piñera s promise to turn chile into latin america s first developed country by 2025 the past months protests are less about ideology than about the honest demands by citizens for better and more transparent governments bolivia moves beyond former president evo morales the issue in bolivia was a highly contested national election result even after losing a referendum in 2016 to allow for a fourth presidential term former president evo morales steamrolled ahead packing the constitutional court that subsequently declared his right to be reelected a human right fast forward to the october 21 presidential elections this year with about 80 of the ballots counted bolivia s electoral tribunal mysteriously stopped counting ballots as it became evident that former president morales would face a second round of elections days later the counting resumed miraculously showing former president morales outright win organization of american states observers condemned the irregularities and demanded a new vote amid protests that led former president morales to flee to mexico after a terrible start by the interim government of right wing senator minority leader jeanine áñez bolivia now seems back on track for a return to democratic rule on november 24 interim president áñez signed into law a bill annulling the results of last month s elections and calling for a new vote within 120 days the legislation was even supported by movement for socialism mas former president morales political party new officials will be chosen to head a reformed electoral authority a key step for a more transparent electoral system in bolivia none of this means that mas is going away the party leadership seems ready to move beyond former president morales although there isn t a clear successor nevertheless a mas lite candidate who rejects unconstitutional behavior but supports former president morales social policies could have a winning message after all the former president left office still a relatively popular figure with a significant political base ecuador s president buys time president lenín moreno seems to have dodged a political bullet in ecuador following mass protests in october an official peace deal was negotiated and the government was successfully moved from quito to guayaquil the price of staying in power however was restoration of fuel subsidies the original scrapping of subsidies was part of the deficit cutting pledges agreed upon in return for 10 billion from the imf rather than increase taxes president moreno decided to cut fossil fuel subsidies which cost 1 4 billion a year albeit without a social safety net for the poor president moreno benefits from having organized opposition groups with whom to negotiate including the indigenous group conaie but his government now faces the task of passing tax reforms through the national assembly if they fail or prove unpopular ecuador could face longer term challenges to economic growth or a return to populism in 2021 colombia at a crossroads colombia is the latest latin american nation to join the wave of anti government mobilizations with a 250 000 person march and a nationwide strike on november 22nd while colombia has been a model of growth over the past decades the protests were hardly surprising president iván duque márquez s administration has been plagued by problems during his 16 months in office resulting in low approval ratings and unsuccessful legislative efforts demonstrators in colombia are rallying against an array of issues from plans to raise the pension age and cut minimum wage for young people which president duque márquez denies supporting anger over corruption scandals to a spike in the murder of human rights activists the parts of the peace deal with the farc the revolutionary armed forces of colombia people s army that president duque márquez wanted to overturn have proved constitutionally untouchable while the accord s social investments have been stalled as a reaction to the protests president duque márquez followed the playbook of french president emmanuel macron s response to france s yellow jacket protests of last winter he pledged to begin a complicated and multifaceted national dialogue not an easy task his political party was trounced in the october 2019 local elections with two and a half years before presidential elections that leaves a long stretch of time for either talk or more strife reform democracy isn t in danger in latin america yet at the end of the day it looks like the only president to not finish the term as a result of the protests will be in bolivia the past months protests while sometimes exploited by extremists are less about ideology than about the honest demands by citizens for better and more transparent governments that address pocketbook issues such goals will require a new and deep reform agenda across the americas pensions health care education security and infrastructure will all be in play unless some progress is made on these demands the legitimacy of democratic governments will become increasingly fragile in a region where citizens are already questioning the ability of democracy to improve their lives

a deeper and more painful downturn took hold in july 1981 it endured for 18 months and sent unemployment up to 10 8 in november and december 1982 the highest level since the great depression in a statement monday former president jimmy carter who had chosen volcker to be fed chairman called him a giant of public service paul was as stubborn as he was tall and although some of his policies as fed chairman were politically costly they were the right thing to do carter said in the early 1980s volcker was vilified by the public for having triggered a severe recession in order to curb runaway

4s ended up with an enduring legacy at the fed david wilcox a young staffer under volcker who later rose to direct the fed s research and statistics division said he received one of the 2 by 4s from larry slifman a former senior economist in the division and kept it on his desk until his retirement last year wilcox said he held onto it as a constant reminder of how vitally important it is that no major central bank ever lose control of inflation again creating the need for someone like volcker to do the incredibly courageous things he did david jones an economist and author of several books on the fed ranks volcker above all other chairmen since world war ii volcker was transformative in terms of fed policy jones said we are still enjoying the benefits of his success by sticking with his policies in the face of ferocious opposition volcker implicitly asserted the fed s independence from political and public interference throughout its history the fed has been seen as needing to operate independently in order to properly carry out its key functions of of maximizing employment and stabilizing prices in the past three years president donald trump has challenged that independence with his frequent attacks on the fed and his demands that it cut rates more aggressively once inflation was subdued volcker himself was privately pressured by president ronald reagan to lower rates faster than he wanted james baker treasury secretary during reagan s second term in the late 1980s chose supporters of lower rates to the fed s governing board this led to volcker being outvoted on a rate decision in 1986 though his opponents backed down news reports at the time said volcker had threatened to resign i had no doubt in my mind that baker wanted to surround me with his appointees volcker said later in an oral history compiled by the fed the pain of the recession he helped cause eventually produced the desired results inflation receded once it did volcker s fed began lowering interest rates and the economy rebounded vigorously enough for president ronald reagan to declare the arrival of morning in america on his way to a landslide victory in the 1984 presidential election volcker left the fed in 1987 succeeded by alan greenspan the volcker led victory over inflation is widely credited with beginning what economists call the great moderation more than two

cnn happy sunday a version of this story first appeared in cnn business before the bell newsletter not a subscriber you can sign up right here there s just one week to go before the united states is scheduled to impose a new round of tariffs on 156 billion of chinese imports meanwhile both sides are still working toward an elusive phase one trade deal that could bring some relief to battered global economies president donald trump said this week that it might be better to wait until after the 2020 us presidential election to strike a deal with china that assessment came just a week after he said negotiations were in their final throes investors should by now be wise to jawboning from the white house yet the consensus is that both countries are in fact moving toward a deal beijing offered a concession on friday that may prove pivotal pledging to reduce tariffs on us soybeans and pork the deal is close it s probably even closer than in mid november white house national economic council director larry kudlow told cnbc on friday it s worth stepping back to consider two important points it s still not clear what a phase one deal would cover and the details really matter even if an agreement is reached tariffs will still be higher than before the trade war started according to neil shearing group chief economist at capital economics the average us tariff on imports from china has risen from 3 at the start of 2018 to 21 even rolling back all the tariffs imposed in september would only take the average down to 18 here s shearing with the big picture the fact that both sides have had to resort to a phase one deal in the first place underlines just how difficult it is proving to address more fundamental issues such as industrial policy technology and intellectual property that will form part of phase two the trade war isn t ending it s merely shifting away from a narrow focus on tariffs and towards broader issues around technology investment industrial strategy and security a crucial election looms in britain my colleague hadas gold wrote a story last week on uk newspapers that are having trouble finding candidates to endorse for the general election on thursday investors may be feeling the same way on one side of the election is prime minister boris johnson who has promised to quickly take the united kingdom out of the european union if voters return him to downing street a majority for johnson s conservatives could break the political logjam that has caused more than three years of uncertainty over brexit but the agreement he s struck with the european union would erect significant trade barriers for companies operating in the united kingdom reduce growth and leave the country poorer johnson claims he can negotiate a free trade agreement with brussels before the end of 2020 but experts doubt a comprehensive deal can be done so quickly his main opponent is labour s jeremy corbyn on his wish list nationalize major utilities bring about a 32 hour work week give 10 of corporate shares to workers increase the power of unions and freeze the retirement age at 66 labour has pledged to finance higher spending with big tax hikes for corporations and britain s wealthiest 5 on brexit corbyn supports a second referendum that includes an option to remain in the european union we agree that a conservative majority is the best outcome for uk assets and the economy s near term prospects said analysts at capital economics but the economic upside is limited a fiscal stimulus some recovery in global growth and the risk of a no deal brexit being postponed to the end of the year will probably allow growth to pick up a bit but we now think the increase will be more limited they added up next monday german trade data japan gdp tuesday german zew survey china inflation wednesday us federal reserve decision us inflation data thursday ecb decision uk general election eurozone industrial output german ifo business climate index friday us retail sales
