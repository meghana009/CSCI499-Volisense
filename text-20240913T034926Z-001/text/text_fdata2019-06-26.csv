menafn investor ideas precious metals expert rick rule shares gold nuggets of wisdom source maurice jackson forstreetwise reports june 26 2019 investorideas com newswire maurice jackson of proven and probable and rick rule of sprott usa engage in a wide ranging discussion covering pareto s law the importance of courage and conviction in investment copper mentors and the upcoming sprott natural resource symposium maurice jackson joining us for conversation is legendary investor rick rule ofsprott usa mr rule welcome to the show in ourinterview last month we addressed a number of topics regarding where and what sprott usa is focusing their attention on in the natural resource space and at the conclusion of the interview rick you stated that we should discuss pareto s law which is known as the 80 20 law but you put an interesting perspective on the law that i had not considered mr rule expand the narrative on pareto s law and please introduce us to the concept of the 4 rick rule sure and actually i ll take a little further than that with your permission most people have heard of the 80 20 principle which suggests that in any sort of major field of human endeavor 20 of the people engaged in that activity generate 80 of the utility in other words 20 of the people do 80 of the work this turns out to be broadly speaking true and it was pointed out in social sciences by an italian social scientist at the turn of the last century named pareto hence it s called pareto s law it s appropriate to junior mining speculation because among other things the performance dispersion curves that is the performance of relative management teams aligns well meaning that 20 of the management teams in junior mining generate 80 of the money made what s important for readers to understand is that if you take that successful population the 20 and you run them through the same performance dispersion curve they conformably align meaning that 20 of the 20 do 80 of the 80 or 4 of the population base generates about 65 of the positive utility in the sector and i think it works for at least one more standard deviation which would suggest that 20 of the 20 of the 20 or eight tenths of 1 generate about 40 of the total utility generated in the sector which is to say that one of the most important things that you can do as a speculator is identify and align yourself very patiently with the serially successful operators in the sector and that is probably the most important work that you can do as a speculator that isn t to say that identifying a robert friedland or a ross beaty or a lukas lundin or a bob quartermain is the only work you need to do the truth is that when you buy stocks that are headed by those people you are still subjected to risk you re still subjected to volatility you re still subjected to the vagaries of exploration but your most important task is to identify the serially successful people particularly identify the serially successful people in bad markets where you don t have to pay a huge premium to be associated with them and then hang on for dear life and let them work their magic over time maurice jackson we brought you on today to share some of your golden nuggets of wisdom for those of us that ascribe to join you with the serially successful now you re famous for stating you must have courage and conviction which is a critical distinction you ve mastered expand for us the psychology of courage because this is a key attribute that you have rick rule well it turns out it does take courage maurice we were looking back over the exploration capital partnerships series which is a series of investments managed by myself going back to 1998 and we found interestingly that first of all the vast majority of the money that was made was made in a relatively small number of stocks ones that increased in price 1 000 or more particularly where of course those investments were accompanied by warrants what was interesting was that despite the fact that we all want immediate gratification the average holding period for a ten bagger or 1 000 gain was almost five years so one needs to be patient the courage comes in because almost every stock that we enjoyed 1 000 gain in we experienced a 50 share price decline in at some point in time or another during our holding period for the stock the most dramatic example was the most successful stock that we speculated in during that period which was paladin uranium that stock was a bellwether in my career we participated in a 0 10 financing and i think it was probably 1999 when nobody cared about uranium and we were rewarded for our contrarian genius by seeing the stock go from 0 10 to 0 01 that is we experienced a 90 loss in the stock when you experience a 90 loss maurice there s no such thing as a hold it s either a buy or a sell mercifully we had the courage to reexamine our precept and determined that we were right and the market was wrong we did buy some more stock and amazingly over the next five years that stock went from 0 01 to 10 two times after the initial 90 decline that stock fell by 50 or more so you had in the course of an almost fictionally good gain depending on how you count the start 0 01 or 0 10 to 10 the initial test of courage came with a 90 loss and there were two future losses in excess of 50 similarly lumina copper backed by the serially successful ross beaty we did the first financing if my memory serves me well at 0 50 and that stock ended up being liquidated in this series of seven transactions i forget what the total was but somewhere in the 140 range but either two or three times during the seven years that we held that stock the stock declined by 50 or more so it s important that you understand that while price is interesting price is only relevant to the extent that it varies appreciably from value which means that you have to have an opinion as to value and an opinion as to the ability of a management team to continue to add value following price alone if you experience a 50 decline and you assume as a consequence of that decline that there s something wrong with the company almost always you will be shaken out of circumstances that can give you a big gain and let me give you one further illustration maurice that i think will amuse readers we aren t just talking about speculation in this context warren buffett the legendary investor and ceo of berkshire hathaway points out that four times during his stewardship of berkshire hathaway arguably the most successful investment company in the history of american investing four times during his tenure the stock has fallen by 50 or more now interestingly if you examine a price chart of berkshire hathaway going back to 1968 from 1968 until present those 50 declines relative to the share price escalation can t even be seen on the stock chart they re invisible because the stock has moved so much over 40 years but if you experienced those 50 declines at the point in time when you experienced them they still caused you trouble so i think that s where the courage comes in maurice jackson and before we leave courage does the thesis or is the scenario very similar with uranium and copper today rick rule well i think it is if i m understanding the question correctly the courage associated with commodity markets is that the real money is made by buying industries that are in effect in liquidation and that does take special courage certainly if you looked at the uranium business today the industry suggests that the incentive price to produce uranium including prior year write downs which the industry never likes to talk about and cost of capital is about 60 a pound so you make the stuff for 60 bucks a pound and you sell it for 27 you lose 33 bucks a pound a 100 million times a year and that takes some courage buying companies that have no probability of making money at the current commodity price requires courage some would say it requires insanity the difference i think between courage and insanity is simple arithmetic uranium even in the united states a wealthy economy that allegedly can afford alternatives generates about 15 of our base load power so it seems to me that the equation around uranium is that in the next six or seven years either the price goes up to the point where the industry stays in business or the lights go out those are your two choices there is no way to replace 15 of base load electricity supply with any form of electricity in the next six or seven years so the courage comes into play and displaces allegations of insanity i think when you recognize that if you have the courage to speculate in an event that has to happen but where you re just not sure when it s going to happen it s still a rational activity maurice jackson and how about copper as well rick rule copper s more interesting there are plenty of companies that make cash at 2 75 per pound 2 75 lb copper but the incentive price for opening new copper mines is more like us 3 50 lb and us 3 50 lb because it s a capital intensive business assumes the artificially low interest rate environment that we re living in today if you had market interest rates that is if the prime interest rate was at 5 or 6 or 7 the incentive price to produce copper would be up in the four or four and a quarter range now if the world economy doesn t soften substantially and i don t know if it will or it won t the copper price will go higher because on a global basis we are living off of copper deposits that were discovered 30 and 40 years ago and put into production in most cases 20 to 30 years ago deposits are very long of tooth the great deposits in the world like bingham canyon have been operating for 100 years chuquicamata 100 years freeport mcmoran inc s fcx nyse grasberg deposit 40 years escondida 30 years these are very very very long of tooth and we aren t developing new copper deposits because we re not at incentive price so supply is going to be constrained in the copper business the fly in the ointment here maurice is if the economy does slow down and i m not saying it will i don t know it could be that demand for copper declines a little bit too i m willing to take that bet because my suspicion is that the ascent of man continues hat is the billion and a half people at the bottom of the demographic pyramid continue to get richer and continue to urbanize and the consequence of urbanization is intensive use of electrical power which requires lots of copper so my supposition is that even in an economic decline that demand for copper will be surprisingly resilient because of its utility and particularly its utility to the poorest 20 of the people on earth maurice jackson how does the application of conviction fit into this narrative rick rule well first of all one needs to become educated enough that one can have conviction the suggestion that i ve made on your show so often is that one must be a contrarian or one will be a victim that bear markets are the authors of bull markets my conviction with regards to that maurice was born simply of experience i ve been in this business almost 45 years and i ve been through depending on how you count five cycles and i understand the capital intention the cyclical nature of the mining business and i know very well by now that bear markets are the authors of bull markets one of the things that gives me conviction that this market will turn is that that is simply the nature of markets for things like commodities which are essential to mankind other examples of conviction have to do with the intelligent application of science if you have been around geologists and geology for a very long time you begin to understand first of all what a good geologist is relative just to a geologist and you understand what good geology is and good geology overcomes a lot of sins market sins management sins all types of sins so i think that conviction is the conjunction of experience and education which while they re related are not the same thing having the education to understand the value of various inputs and having the experience to have in your past seen outcomes associated previously with the same type of experiences that you re having today gives one conviction i guess in my case the third factor in conviction is having experience with people and teams i have a high degree of confidence that if i go into a business with a robert friedland or bob quartermain or ross beaty or lukas lundin as a consequence of their past performance i have a lot of conviction that if i support them and stick with them if i m patient that i ll have a happy outcome and that s really born of experience maurice jackson you touched on science but how about philosophy how does that factor into your decision making process rick rule well i try not to let it enter in too much to be honest with you i try to be mathematically and empirically based the truth is in terms of philosophy my own political philosophy is very much libertarian and free market oriented which means that i m always a sucker for the gold bug pitch the consequence of that is that i try not to listen to my philosophical side as often now related to a libertarian philosophy is an acceptance of the precepts of austrian economics and in particular the predictions with regards to the activities of markets and groups of people that was evidenced by ludwig von mises in human action i would say in that sense the understanding of economic cycles and the understanding of the impact of cycles on human action that that part of my investing philosophy has been absolutely instrumental to my success von mises points out that although all of us believe ourselves to be rational fact gatherers that s not what we are we have a view of ourselves as impartial observers that gather information hither and yon and process it in a rational fashion but that s not what we do in fact we gather information that is convenient to our prejudices and our paradigms and we use the information that we gather to support those same prejudices and paradigms von mises also points out that our expectation of the future is set by your experience in the immediate rather than the distant past which is why bull markets go on longer than they should and why bear markets go on longer than they should if you have done lots of work around an investment or speculation and you re attracted to it but your experience in the last five years has been that you get spanked for all your hard work you tend to be cautious and conservative in bear markets which is precisely when the markets are cheap because your most recent experiences have been bad rather than good conversely in bull markets where stocks are doubling and tripling for no reason you do two things you confuse a bull market with brains that is you assume that your good performance is in some way shape or form due to your own efforts and you also become less cautious your expectation for the future being set in the immediate past means that you re irrationally bullish even in a market that s up 400 or 500 which is as you know by now maurice something that s not an uncommon phenomenon in our sector yeah i ll leave it there maurice jackson well rick this is great information here s one that really i find attractive with your thought process here because most people shy away from this and it sticks with courage and conviction you re not afraid to put capital into companies that are in challenging jurisdictions either through civil unrest or through a silent partner known as our benevolent government wishing to do some profit sharing with your capital why is that rick rule i ll tell you why maurice it s not like i think congo or russia or sudan or bolivia are the greatest countries on the face of the earth i m certainly cognizant of political risk the truth is however that i ve experienced lots of political risk in places that are alleged to be good my worst personal experience with political risk was here in the people s republic of california but i ve also had money stolen from me by legislatures in places like british columbia the truth is that investors who look like me old and caucasian tend for some reason to believe that money that s stolen from us in english according to the rule of law is somehow less gone so i m not afraid of bad jurisdictions it s just i m also afraid of so called good jurisdictions and what i ve learned is that in jurisdictions where capital feels comfortable a lot more exploration has taken place which means that the probability that i m going to find a high quality deposit in a jurisdiction that i m also comfortable in is very low the probability is that i ll find the type of deposit that will give me the returns i m looking for 1 000 plus are much more likely to occur in jurisdictions that have not been looked at as thoroughly perhaps my most important mentor in the 1970s told me that in exploration money is made employing new ideas in old places that is new technology or old ideas in new places but if you re using old ideas and old places you re assuming that you re smarter than everyone that came before you which is usually an incorrect assumption so as an example investments around the application of new technologies like three dimensional seismic measurement while drilling and new fracturing and recovery techniques have revolutionized the old oil fields of west texas that s a new idea in an old place but old fashioned exploration technology that is projection of existing trends things like that work well in places like congo and kazakhstan places that haven t been explored thoroughly for 40 or 50 or 60 years as a consequence of challenging social economic and political circumstances so i would say that while i m certainly cognizant of political risk i define political risk much differently than many of my competitors maurice jackson may i ask was that mr lundin that you were referring to there rick rule although adolf lundin would have said exactly the same thing the guy i was referring to was a man named jack brown of a private oil and gas company called wagner brown maurice jackson before we leave speculation we have a subscriber that wanted me to ask you if you would share three junior exploration stocks in the gold sector that you like best rick rule i m not allowed to do that i m u s securities licensed and the consequence is that i can t make anything that smacks of a recommendation to people whom i don t know i can repeat the offer that i ve made on your show so many times which is to evaluate people s portfolio rank people s portfolio for them if they e mail it to me but a general set of things that can be construed as recommendations is something that i can t do is the person who s talking particularly about precious metals maurice jackson junior mining stocks junior explorations stocks for gold companies rick rule ok if they re for gold companies i can tell you that i have been buying two recently this doesn t suggest that your subscribers should buy them this isn t a recommendation this is simply a disclosure about two companies i ve been buying one ispan american silver corp paas tsx paas nasdaq run by ross beaty which is down really substantially in price as a consequence of i think the market misunderstanding the acquisition of tahoe resources and the other would besabina gold silver corp sbb tsx rxc fse sgsvf otcpk which is a very large project in northern canada which is access constrained meaning that access to it is by a winter ice road it s a very large deposit that people are afraid of because they don t understand when it s going to come in production but we see it as both a large and high grade deposit that is highly likely to come into production it s important that your listeners note that these are not recommendations these are not suggestions these are not tips these are merely two companies that i have been buying maurice jackson well rick thank you for sharing that and rick speaking of gold you re a strong advocate for owning physical precious metals but not in the context that we usually hear from those who advocate having physical precious metals why does rick rule own precious metals rick rule fear i regard precious metals as insurance and insurance in particular against political interference with living standards i believe the most important determinant certainly not the only determinant but the most important determinant of the gold price is faith or lack of faith in the u s dollar as expressed by the u s 10 year treasury which is the world s benchmark security the dollar is very very strong despite historically low interest rates i think that s partly about strong equities markets i also think it s about the relative weakness of competitors to the u s dollar while i consider the u s dollar to be a flawed instrument it is certainly a less flawed instrument than the japanese yen the chinese yuan the euro the canadian dollar all of those doug casey famously says that the u s dollar is the prettiest mayor at the slaughterhouse that might be a bit extreme but i need to say that i m less sanguine about the u s economy i m less sanguine about our balance sheet 22 trillion in on balance sheet liabilities and 100 trillion in off balance sheet liabilities and our ability to service those debts given the fact that we re running a federal deficit at a trillion and a half dollars a year i have less faith in the u s dollar than many of my global counterparts and my suspicion is if you saw a circumstance where faith in the u s dollar began to roll over as it did in 2001 the price response that you d see in gold would be one where even if you had a substantial holding of u s dollars in your portfolio the money that you would make on your insurance policy which is gold could offset the money that you would lose in your u s dollar based accounts i see gold myself as a medium of exchange that s simultaneously a store of value and the consequence of that is that i own gold for insurance purposes maurice jackson you re also famous for saying that it is payment in full can you elaborate on that for us rick rule i think that s very important the u s dollar is a promise to pay it supposes that people will continue to accept it almost every fiat currency in history has always retreated to its intrinsic value which is of course zero if as an example rather than having u s dollars in your jeans you had venezuelan bolivars you would understand the promise for what it was something that could be broken gold is very different it doesn t rely on faith gold isn t a promise to pay it is in and of itself payment it is an asset that isn t simultaneously somebody else s liability and i think that s very very important i don t think as an example that you re seeing the chinese government the chinese central bank buying gold because they like the chart i think that you re seeing them buy gold because they re afraid that the u s government will use u s financial markets and u s dollars as a weapon in foreign exchange transactions and so the chinese are looking and i just point out the chinese others are looking the same way to a medium of exchange that isn t under anybody s control and isn t a promise to pay but rather constitutes payment in and of itself it s interesting to note maurice that over the last couple of days in the news you will see that venezuela exported seven tons of gold to uganda and then apparently onto either dubai or turkey a pariah state that can t necessarily trade in u s 10 year treasuries can trade can buy and sell gold but even more interestingly apparently those gold bars date from the 1940s and they were payment from the united states to venezuela for oil that was sold in world war ii when the venezuelans had some doubt as to the outcome of the war and weren t willing to take u s dollars for their oil they were willing to take gold so even a creditor as strong as the united states has periods of time has circumstances where their promise which is what their currency is isn t acceptable but there hasn t been a time in recorded history when gold wasn t acceptable maurice jackson well i tell you what i m loving the insights that you re sharing with us what do the current metal prices suggest to you right now rick rule a mixed message really i think the very recent strength in the gold price by very recent i mean the last 10 days is a function of investors realization that the united states is unlikely to let the market dictate the interest rate that is society in the united states has decided that spenders should prevail over savers and that the interest yield on the u s 10 year treasury should be artificially lowered when the u s fed does it s called quantitative easing if you and i did it it would be called counterfeiting i think there s a realization in the market that the united states government is at the very least considering another round of counterfeiting now in terms of counterfeiting although the united states is a very competitive economy we don t lead in counterfeiting in the euro zone there are many countries that are already paying a negative interest rate yield euro zone counterfeiting is much more pronounced as is japanese counterfeiting then american counterfeiting but as you know maurice we re in an extremely competitive society and we want to finish first at everything even including the debasement of our currency and the consequence of that i think is the very recent strength that you ve seen in gold maurice jackson and may i ask you this as well we all have our favorites but right now what is your favorite gold silver platinum or palladium rick rule for me because i m buying out of cowardice it s gold i don t necessarily think that has the most price upside a speculator might look at silver gold s so called ugly stepchild the silver price moves after the gold price moves but if past is prologue moves further when it does move so a fear buyer would be in the gold trade a greed buyer might be in the silver trade the silver trade is something i probably would have done in my twenties the gold trade is something that i do in my sixties the contrarian of course would be in the platinum space about 60 of world platinum production is uneconomic at present most of it is coming out of south africa a place that has its very own social and political challenges which could disrupt supply note that i said could not will so i think as important as the attributes ascribed to each individual metal are what s more important is the investors needs and perceptions why he or she is doing what they re doing i have other ways to make money which is to say speculate in equities or participate in debt markets for me the principal utility in precious metals is for insurance in effect allowing me to sleep nights and stay calm maurice jackson rick thank you for sharing your golden nuggets of wisdom let s switch gears here on the 29th of july through the 2nd of august thesprott natural resource symposiumwill be held at the historic fairmont hotel in beautiful downtown vancouver british columbia rick introduce us to this world class event and who will be some of the featured speakers at the symposium rick rule well it s going to be in all humility a spectacular event nomi prins will be speaking you know she s a veteran financial commentator a veteran banker an investment banker danielle dimartino booth formally from the dallas fed will be speaking we re bringing back of course jim rickards doug casey steve sjuggerud alexander green many of the gurus that have traditionally been so well received in the mining space but the part of the conference that i actually like the most is we ll have a lot of speakers from the industry in particular speakers who have passed the pareto s law test speakers who have built multibillion dollar mining businesses from scratch people whose experience building businesses has allowed them to become successful speculators too and hearing from a business builder what he or she thinks are the important characteristics of success in the mining business is invaluable hearing robert friedland who is the most successful exploration speculator of my generation talk about the process of making money in exploration hearing ross beaty who has built 14 successful mining companies talk about how you build a successful mining company that s really where the rubber meets the road another thing we re doing this year since all the guys i ve talked about before are of my vintage approaching or past their sell by date is we re bringing in some people in their thirties and forties who have already exhibited success and who we suspect will be the mining titans of the future so that investors can get to know the people who will make them as successful over the next 20 or 30 years as i ve been in the past 20 or 30 years a lot of the success maurice to people ascribed to me is really a consequence of my having identified and hung onto the lundins the ross beatys the robert friedlands the bob quartermains the clive johnsons of the world it s important that speculators and investors your age and younger find that next generation of superstar entrepreneurs and we ve tried to do the dirty work for people by assembling as many of the high quality youngsters as we can in one place the other thing that s really useful i think maurice is that you re going to have 600 high net worth investors in one location the idea that all of the knowledge in the room emanates from the dias is ridiculous there are a lot of experienced investors there including many mining industry professionals and interacting with your peers listening to the questions that they ask in workshops watching the way that they react to presentations is useful finally an important difference between our conference and every other conference that we know of is that our attendees have told us that the exhibitors at our conference aren t advertisers which is how they re regarded at most conferences that they are in fact investment opportunities or content the consequence is that if you are a public company exhibitor at the sprott conference you need to be owned in a sprott managed account in other words they have been vetted by us that doesn t unfortunately guarantee that every stock goes up but it does say that we know enough about every exhibitor that we have our own capital at risk in them which i think is really important criterion and finally maurice if i can continue this commercial it is possible to have fun in vancouver you ve been there you can attest to this vancouver is a beautiful city the weather in late july early august is sublime any investor who comes up there and doesn t go on the attendee boat cruise with us needs his or her head examined the hotel itself is within walking distance of 200 restaurants and vancouver s an amazingly scenic city with mountains rising above 6 000 feet from sea level right in front of you and an embarcadero a walkway along the water where you will hear six or seven or 10 different languages spoken it s truly a spectacular place and i think it s going to be difficult this year not to make money as a consequence of attending the conference maurice jackson ladies and gentlemen this is truly a world class event as rick just shared to purchase admission to thesprott natural resource symposium visit our home page and simply click on the icon and you ll be forwarded directly to the registration tab we touched on philosophy earlier a day after the symposium you ll be speaking atcapitalism and morality founded by a mutual friend of ours jayant bhandari i love the timing of the events rick for someone new to capitalism and morality what would you like to share rick rule well it s more philosophically oriented capitalism and morality is a lot of fun the adrian days and the doug caseys and the maurice jacksons and the rick rules of the world talking about issues that are mostly unrelated to money i m going to be very amused this year to be involved in public debate with my friend jayant bhandari who is you know of indian descent and who is of course a viciously anti indian racist a white guy accusing a brown guy of racism at a public forum is only something that could occur in a libertarian or anarcho capitalist event i think it s going to be a lot of fun not merely for that but for people who have a philosophical or political interest capitalism and morality is wonderful value maurice jackson to register forcapitalism and morality simply visit our home page and right below the sprott symposium you ll be directed to the registration tab sir before we close you referenced earlier a free grading of one s natural resource fill us in on the details on that please rick rule sure that s pretty simple your listeners who are interested

视频播放位置 下载安装flash播放器 ahead of the group of 20 g20 summit in japan the international community is calling for joint efforts by major economies to help maintain global growth amid rising uncertainties threats to global growth the bloc of major economies will soon be in the japanese city of osaka as the global economy is increasingly threatened by protectionism in the name of protecting domestic industries washington has slapped steep tariffs on billions of u s dollars worth of products from its partners heightening trade tensions worldwide and rocking the foundation of the multilateral trading system today uncertainty is not so much about integration but about disintegration multilateralism and free trade have come under pressure for example with international trade conflicts said burkhard balz a member of the executive board of deutsche bundesbank moving towards isolationism and unilateralism damages the g20 spirit significantly said lee hee ok a professor of political science at sungkyunkwan university in seoul finance ministers from the g20 economies on june 9 issued a joint statement saying global growth remains low and risks remain tilted to the downside and listing trade tensions as the key factor the latest world trade outlook indicator reading of 96 3 remains at the weakest level since 2010 signalling continued falling trade growth in the first half of 2019 said the world trade organization wto according to a key un report released earlier in june global foreign direct investment fdi slid to 1 3 trillion dollars in 2018 in its third straight annual decline factors such as escalating trade tensions risk continuing to weigh on fdi in 2019 and beyond said mukhisa kituyi secretary general of the un conference on trade and development economic prospects are now weaker in nearly all g20 countries than previously anticipated said the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd in its recent interim economic outlook besides there are other major risks such as geopolitical tensions and climate crises kituyi said the main drag on fdi in europe is the negative pull of brexit in britain which has created considerable uncertainty in its latest monthly report the u s energy information administration cut its 2019 world oil demand growth forecast by 0 2 million barrels per day bpd to 1 2 million bpd amid escalating tensions in the middle east according to the world bank air pollution costs societies more than 5 trillion dollars every year said joyce msuya deputy executive director of un environment this meeting is coming at a time which is seeing perhaps the most significant shift in the global environment since the cold war said australian treasurer josh frydenberg need for consensus what concerns the international community the most is whether g20 economies can show solidarity at the upcoming summit in tackling the risks of global economic downturn although many g20 economies have repeatedly called for coordination of economic policies over the past few years the bloc is still divided on certain thorny issues such as rising protectionism and climate change for example the g20 ministerial meeting earlier in june failed to include the part of opposing trade protectionism in the joint statement due to objections from the u s side the united states lost interest in cooperating in a multilateral format and actually stalled the process of reforming the system of global governance said professor yana leksyutina of st petersburg state university besides the un climate change conference held last year in poland also witnessed some countries voicing opposition to including the draft text in the final outcome document participating countries of the g20 summit should act positively to reach some agreement which would be beneficial to people across the world qian meijun professor of the college of business and economics in the australian national university told xinhua oecd chief economist laurence boone suggested governments should coordinate policy actions to avoid a further downturn in an interview with xinhua atsushi sunami vice president at the national graduate institute for policy studies in tokyo called on all to understand the real impact of trade tensions and end the trade frictions as soon as possible there will not be any winner takakage fujita a political analyst told xinhua he said the economic and trade friction provoked by the united states hurts not only china but also u s farmers as well as u s industries which have already issued warnings against such reckless acts of the u s government economy has no borders tadashi yanai founder of the famous japanese clothing brand uniqlo told xinhua adding he hopes all could understand that the world is closely linked and people of all countries look forward to a peaceful and stable life call for immediate actions many hope that g20 economies can take concrete actions such as returning to the negotiating table to alleviate trade tensions fujita suggested major economies like the united states should from the perspective of being conducive to world peace and development return to talks and solve issues through rational negotiation and consultation talks are the only right choice he said in his telephone conversation with u s president donald trump on june 18 chinese president xi jinping said that both countries gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation adding that the two sides should in accordance with the consensus he has reached with trump push forward the china u s relationship featuring coordination cooperation and stability on the basis of mutual respect and mutual benefit as the world s two biggest economies china and the united states should jointly play a leading role in pushing for positive outcomes at the g20 osaka summit so as to inject confidence and vitality into the global market added xi meanwhile the international community also urged g20 economies to develop open and fair platforms like the china proposed belt and road initiative bri and promote the reforms of international organizations to better defend the multilateral trading order the bri really supports the growth of the global economy said sunami it is a more open and multilateral idea that goes against unilateralism and isolationism said lee developing countries should take part in the effort to strengthen the role of the un in world affairs and reform backbone institutions such as the international monetary fund the world bank and the wto said leksyutina during the g20 summit in argentina last year many leaders called for a wto reform and so did the joint statement issued after the foregoing g20 ministerial meeting it is important for g20 leaders to come up with more transparent rules especially concerning trade tensions and the digital economy said sunami they need to talk about the wto and other world organizations and whether the wto can play a more active role in creating a fair environment for everybody to agree on he said leaders must do something more than repeat the call it is imperative that we see action director general of the wto roberto azevedo said he particularly called on joint efforts to reform the wto s dispute settlement system to avert an acute appellate body crisis chen yulu deputy governor of the people s bank of china also suggested carrying out an imf quota reform to objectively reflect the relative positions of member countries in the global economy and strengthen the voice of emerging market economies how the major central banks should react to the most recent developments on the market and the world economy including interest rates quantitative easing as well as currencies is another issue said dawie roodt chief economist at african financial services company efficient group experts also expect the upcoming summit to help find solutions to climate change according to ottmar edenhofer director of the potsdam institute for climate impact research g20 leaders should consider carbon pricing and the development of new low carbon technologies to cut emissions and integrating their carbon markets to push forward ongoing international negotiations

the un recognises 180 currencies worldwide as legal tender all of them issued by nation states it does not recognise cryptocurrencies like bitcoin in this way even if communities of enthusiasts have been treating them as a means of exchange for over a decade now yet the latest addition to this group facebook s libra threatens to do something that no other cryptocurrencies have come close to achieving the state monopoly over the control and issuance of money is now under serious threat facebook boasts over half the world population as active monthly users 2 2 billion on facebook 0 8 billion on instagram and 0 7 billion on whatsapp combined with the fact that 1 7 billion adults worldwide have no bank accounts a project like this is the perfect petri dish in which to create a truly global currency the libra council the independent libra council that facebook proposes to oversee this new currency from geneva will become nothing short of a quasi central bank consisting of 27 giant corporates plus facebook it will vet aspiring applicants who wish to join their ranks for a fee of us 10m 7 9m as well as manage the reserve of state currencies and short term government bonds that will back the libra this model is very different to the likes of bitcoin whose exchange rate is driven purely by the supply and demand in contrast the libra council would be competing in global currency wars against other nation states imagine ten years from now if say 40 of all us dollars are held on deposit by facebook the council to back the issued libra coins which have by now become widely used across the world we can hypothesise that us dollars might constitute a 30 weight of libra s asset backing basket to have a steady exchange rate for libra the idea is to underpin it with a selection of stable and widely traded financial assets in the likely event that the us experiences a moderate or even severe economic crisis facebook the council would need to rebalance the basket of assets to defend the value of libra let s say they decided to revise down the us dollar weighting in their reserve to 25 of the basket this would involve selling huge sums of us dollars and replacing them with say euros and would significantly drive down the value of the dollar this would be a very negative market signal encouraging other holders of dollars to dump them as well thereby exacerbating the fall and even before this happened facebook could potentially use the mere threat as leverage in negotiating with nation states on matters of regulation taxation and so on based on facebook s current revenues it would already be 90th in the world by gdp if it was a nation state so its power to face off in negotiations with states and trading blocs is formidable even without libra read more libra four reasons to be extremely cautious about facebook s new currency how do nation states control a global company with unprecedented access to their citizens data its own currency and perhaps the ability to affect their domestic politics and the strength of their currency on the global markets it sounds tricky to put it mildly and by the way it s not only facebook that is entering this space jp morgan has just launched a cryptocurrency for institutional customers while 13 other global investment banks are planning to follow suit with currencies in 2020 samsung is rumoured to be looking at launching a currency for ordinary customers while it would not be surprising if other online giants like amazon and google were tempted too the greater threat mark carney governor of the bank of england and chairman of the financial stability board told the g20 in 2018 that cryptocurrencies didn t pose a systemic risk to the global financial system his assessment might have been based on their current footprint rather than their potential in fact the blockchain technology that underpins new currencies like libra has astonishing potential the ability to significantly move exchange rates is only part of it if people buy and sell with these currencies save with them trade with them demand for state currencies and bonds could plunge this would undermine the ability of central banks and governments to buy and sell these assets to set national interest rates it would emasculate this vital means of managing our economies leaving only fiscal levers like taxing and spending at the disposal of states what then of course such a seismic shift in our control of the use of money would first require these new currencies to be widely adopted yet the genie has been out of the bottle since the arrival of cryptocurrencies it will be very difficult to stop it now if this space comes to be dominated by big listed companies like facebook and jp morgan it is at least arguably preferable to alternatives like bitcoin which are almost unfettered in having no geographic or tax domicile and being pseudo anonymous in nature a currency like libra also has the potential to reduce consumer transaction speeds improve transparency and allow users to store their wealth digitally using a trusted consortium of founding institutions and when it comes to future geopolitical shocks like brexit consumers will be able to shield themselves more easily by reducing their exposure to say the british pound by holding their wealth in libra or whatever instead arguably we are talking about a superior type of money that is better aligned to a younger generation that is comfortable with such new forms of money notwithstanding we need to come to terms with the size of this potential change and its ramifications facebook s impact on our societies has been profound over the previous two decades and libra may well eclipse that accomplishment facebook s founding mantra of move fast and break things seems entirely consistent with the strategy for this currency the american futurist stewart brand famously said that once a technology rolls over you if you re not part of the steamroller you re part of the road well nation states appear not to have been invited to get on board this particular steamroller that leaves a lot of vulnerable road watch closely to see what they try and do about it in the months ahead

economies to help maintain global growth amid rising uncertainties threats to global growth the bloc of major economies will soon be in the japanese city of osaka as the global economy is increasingly threatened by protectionism in the name of protecting domestic industries washington has slapped steep tariffs on billions of u s dollars worth of products from its partners heightening trade tensions worldwide and rocking the foundation of the multilateral trading system today uncertainty is not so much about integration but about disintegration multilateralism and free trade have come under pressure for example with international trade conflicts said burkhard balz a member of the executive board of deutsche bundesbank moving towards isolationism and unilateralism damages the g20 spirit significantly said lee hee ok a professor of political science at sungkyunkwan university in seoul finance ministers from the g20 economies on june 9 issued a joint statement saying global growth remains low and risks remain tilted to the downside and listing trade tensions as the key factor the latest world trade outlook indicator reading of 96 3 remains at the weakest level since 2010 signalling continued falling trade growth in the first half of 2019 said the world trade organization wto according to a key un report released earlier in june global foreign direct investment fdi slid to 1 3 trillion dollars in 2018 in its third straight annual decline factors such as escalating trade tensions risk continuing to weigh on fdi in 2019 and beyond said mukhisa kituyi secretary general of the un conference on trade and development economic prospects are now weaker in nearly all g20 countries than previously anticipated said the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd in its recent interim economic outlook besides there are other major risks such as geopolitical tensions and climate crises kituyi said the main drag on fdi in europe is the negative pull of brexit in britain which has created considerable uncertainty in its latest monthly report the u s energy information administration cut its 2019 world oil demand growth forecast by 0 2 million barrels per day bpd to 1 2 million bpd amid escalating tensions in the middle east according to the world bank air pollution costs societies more than 5 trillion dollars every year said joyce msuya deputy executive director of un environment this meeting is coming at a time which is seeing perhaps the most significant shift in the global environment since the cold war said australian treasurer josh frydenberg need for consensus what concerns the international community the most is whether g20 economies can show solidarity at the upcoming summit in tackling the risks of global economic downturn although many g20 economies have repeatedly called for coordination of economic policies over the past few years the bloc is still divided on certain thorny issues such as rising protectionism and climate change for example the g20 ministerial meeting earlier in june failed to include the part of opposing trade protectionism in the joint statement due to objections from the u s side the united states lost interest in cooperating in a multilateral format and actually stalled the process of reforming the system of global governance said professor yana leksyutina of st petersburg state university besides the un climate change conference held last year in poland also witnessed some countries voicing opposition to including the draft text in the final outcome document participating countries of the g20 summit should act positively to reach some agreement which would be beneficial to people across the world qian meijun professor of the college of business and economics in the australian national university told xinhua oecd chief economist laurence boone suggested governments should coordinate policy actions to avoid a further downturn in an interview with xinhua atsushi sunami vice president at the national graduate institute for policy studies in tokyo called on all to understand the real impact of trade tensions and end the trade frictions as soon as possible there will not be any winner takakage fujita a political analyst told xinhua he said the economic and trade friction provoked by the united states hurts not only china but also u s farmers as well as u s industries which have already issued warnings against such reckless acts of the u s government economy has no borders tadashi yanai founder of the famous japanese clothing brand uniqlo told xinhua adding he hopes all could understand that the world is closely linked and people of all countries look forward to a peaceful and stable life call for immediate actions many hope that g20 economies can take concrete actions such as returning to the negotiating table to alleviate trade tensions fujita suggested major economies like the united states should from the perspective of being conducive to world peace and development return to talks and solve issues through rational negotiation and consultation talks are the only right choice he said in his telephone conversation with u s president donald trump on june 18 chinese president xi jinping said that both countries gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation adding that the two sides should in accordance with the consensus he has reached with trump push forward the china u s relationship featuring coordination cooperation and stability on the basis of mutual respect and mutual benefit as the world s two biggest economies china and the united states should jointly play a leading role in pushing for positive outcomes at the g20 osaka summit so as to inject confidence and vitality into the global market added xi meanwhile the international community also urged g20 economies to develop open and fair platforms like the china proposed belt and road initiative bri and promote the reforms of international organizations to better defend the multilateral trading order the bri really supports the growth of the global economy said sunami it is a more open and multilateral idea that goes against unilateralism and isolationism said lee developing countries should take part in the effort to strengthen the role of the un in world affairs and reform backbone institutions such as the international monetary fund the world bank and the wto said leksyutina during the g20 summit in argentina last year many leaders called for a wto reform and so did the joint statement issued after the foregoing g20 ministerial meeting it is important for g20 leaders to come up with more transparent rules especially concerning trade tensions and the digital economy said sunami they need to talk about the wto and other world organizations and whether the wto can play a more active role in creating a fair environment for everybody to agree on he said leaders must do something more than repeat the call it is imperative that we see action director general of the wto roberto azevedo said he particularly called on joint efforts to reform the wto s dispute settlement system to avert an acute appellate body crisis chen yulu deputy governor of the people s bank of china also suggested carrying out an imf quota reform to objectively reflect the relative positions of member countries in the global economy and strengthen the voice of emerging market economies how the major central banks should react to the most recent developments on the market and the world economy including interest rates quantitative easing as well as currencies is another issue said dawie roodt chief economist at african financial services company efficient group experts also expect the upcoming summit to help find solutions to climate change according to ottmar edenhofer director of the potsdam institute for climate impact research g20 leaders should consider carbon pricing and the development of new low carbon technologies to cut emissions and integrating their carbon markets to push forward ongoing international negotiations xinhua reporters yoo seungki in seoul ye shan guo wei liu chunyan ma caoran and peng chun in

csis briefs the issue trade policy is a signature issue for the trump administration with the 2020 election campaign shifting into high gear candidates are being forced to talk about trade whether they want to or not the president s frequent comments about trade along with his imposition of tariffs are driving the american public to think more deeply about trade and raise their level of understanding of trade policy for trade wonks this is a good thing more people talking and thinking about their favorite subject for presidential candidates however it creates a dilemma how to criticize the president without alienating the voters who seem to like his trade policy emerging trends so far most of the candidates stick to criticizing president trump s policies without being too specific about what they would do instead a few brave ones have laid out their views more comprehensively and that number will surely increase as debate amongst them sharpens criticism of the president s trade policy falls into two buckets criticism of the policy itself and criticism of how the policy is implemented relative trade skeptics who agree with much of the content of the president s trade policy knock the administration for poor implementation some democrats like senator elizabeth warren d ma senator bernie sanders i vt who is running as a democrat even though he identifies as an independent in the senate representative tim ryan d oh and representative tulsi gabbard d hi use this approach to distinguish themselves from the president while competing for the same policy ground and appeal to voters candidates with a more positive view toward free trade criticize both the content of the president s policies and his implementation of them this group includes democratic candidates such as senator kamala harris d ca senator michael bennet d co former representative beto o rourke and former vice president joe biden and republican bill weld former governor of massachusetts two main criticisms of the president s policy implementation are emerging from the field first candidates are dinging the president for alienating allies instead of building a coalition with them prior to confronting china second candidates are criticizing trump for making impulsive trade policy decisions via twitter sanders and others have indicated that imposing tariffs on allies like canada the european union and mexico are poor strategic moves there is also a growing consensus that to hold countries violating trade agreements accountable the united states will need to build partnerships with its allies rather than lash out at them when it comes to the substance of president trump s trade policy candidates have largely taken aim at his fondness for tariffs candidates that tilt into the pro trade camp argue tariffs are taxes levied on u s consumers and companies mayor pete buttigieg offered perhaps the most comprehensive take on trump s use of tariffs to confront china arguing that tariffs won t change china s behavior given the intertwined nature of their state and economy a final trend that is reemerging among democratic candidates is the call for more robust enforcement mechanisms in trade agreements and stronger rules on labor rights the environment and human rights these policy concerns are not new but are democratic mainstays and can serve to set candidates across the trade policy spectrum apart from the president whose policy record is far from pro union pro environment and pro human rights former massachusetts governor and the sole republican challenger to trump bill weld has staked out a strong free trade position on twitter weld called the president clueless on trade and criticized his phony war of tariffs which have done great harm to our farmers workers and businesses large and small in an interview he said that i m a free trader and that the united states always benefits from free trade in contrast to many democratic candidates and the president weld claims that free trade is good for u s workers while trade may cause low wage job losses it provides a net gain of high wage jobs weld does agree with the president that chinese state owned enterprises subsidies and intellectual property theft need to be addressed but that tariffs are a poor strategy to meet those challenges overall when it comes to trade he believes the united states is always going to be a winner who s got a plan so far three democratic candidates have laid out clear trade platforms of their own sanders warren and governor john hickenlooper of colorado elizabeth warren of the three warren s plan for economic patriotism would amount to the largest departure from status quo trade policy warren s positions on trade policy stem from a fundamental claim that decisionmakers in washington have chosen economic policies including trade policies that incentivize companies to offshore jobs maintain low wages and harm u s workers from warren s perspective there is a trade policy formula and approach to globalization that supports u s workers that formula includes significant government intervention and a change in of how economic policy is made in the executive branch warren s economic patriotism plan includes actively managing the u s dollar to promote exports and domestic manufacturing in other words weakening the dollar or at a minimum preventing it from growing stronger relative to other currencies strengthening the export import bank to better compete with similar agencies abroad new mandates for the government to purchase whenever possible products made in the united states this section of warren s proposal could create friction with u s trading partners due to government procurement market access concessions prior administrations have agreed to a substantial increase in government funds for basic research and development and a significant spending increase for worker training programs a massive overhaul of government bureaucracy that would centralize u s economic policy planning partially in response to competitors formulating industrial policies of their own this aspect of warren s proposal would consolidate federal agencies responsible for economic policy including trade policy into a new department of economic development the department s primary mission would be to defend u s jobs and create new ones the department would be responsible for authoring a national jobs strategy every four years to establish clear goals for american jobs and american industry bernie sanders sanders also blames past trade policy for allowing corporations to ship u s jobs overseas while racking up increasing profits he claims that the record u s goods trade deficit of 890 billion in 2018 proves that trump has failed to implement a trade policy that works for working class americans sanders has historically been a free trade skeptic and a proponent of fair trade compared to warren and hickenlooper sanders platform is less detailed although it shares some similar threads sanders trade platform includes enforceable labor environmental and human rights rules in the core text of all trade agreements enforceable rules against currency manipulation in every trade agreement elimination of incentives in trade and tax agreements to shift jobs overseas policies to support communities of color and family farmers that have been hurt by trade agreements elimination of provisions in trade agreements that increase the cost of medicine this proposal is likely an allusion to intellectual property protections for pharmaceuticals that the united states has traditionally sought in trade agreements john hickenlooper hickenlooper s plan for a new open and fair trade policy is less trade skeptical than the plans of warren and sanders he rejects the idea of demonizing the private sector to score political points but still overlaps with those proposals in a number of areas his platform squarely criticizes trump and many leaders in both parties for pursuing policies that would restrict trade central to hickenlooper s platform is the claim that growth from expanded exports can be a net positive for u s workers if trade agreements are crafted properly and adequate assistance is provided to workers displaced from trade his platform also includes relatively centrist positions on u s intellectual property ip and investor rights abroad issues that are hardly discussed or absent from warren s and sanders plans hickenlooper also sets himself apart from sanders and warren by making the diplomatic case for an open trade policy he argues that president trump s trade policy has not only set back the u s economy but damaged key relationships with allies necessary to tackle major global issues hickenlooper s platform includes strong and enforceable labor standards as a condition for new trade agreements a mechanism to improve labor standards in agreements over time protections for u s ip including penalties for theft of u s ip a prohibition on sale or import of counterfeit products and enforceable ip rules in trade agreements greenhouse gas emission goals set and enforced in trade agreements along with other enforceable environmental rules and provisions rules to ensure non discriminatory treatment of u s firms invested abroad the creation of individual security accounts which are accounts for individuals funded pre tax by government worker and employer contributions that can be used for skills improvements retraining or relocation in the case of job loss residents of geographic areas most negatively impacted by trade displacement will be able to add additional funds to their accounts policies to allow workers to more easily adapt to changing economic conditions including free community college for those in financial need what they re saying the need to build coalitions instead of slapping tariffs on our allies and perpetrating a trade war we need to do the hard work of building coalitions michael bennet the president has done nothing but increase the tariffs the debt and the trade deficit the way we have to proceed is we have to have our allies with us it s not just us we have to keep the world together joe biden the urgency of a fair and equitable trade deal for our farmers and producers has become even greater as unilateral actions taken by the current administration to erect tariffs on non agriculture imports have moved our trading partners to levy extensive and damaging retaliatory tariffs on us agricultural exports kirsten gillibrand i will build a broad coalition of u s allies and have a unified front against china this will involve working with multinational organizations but also doing a lot more john delaney when have we ever gone to war including a trade war without allies beto o rourke protecting american workers so i want to be known as a pro fair trade democrat not trade in a way that s going to put american workers in the cross hairs cory booker i do think that we ought to only strike trade agreements that are good for american workers and american companies i disagree with people who say we re going to close off trade i don t agree with that julian castro open and fair trade policies will broadly increase growth and prosperity for american workers employers and investors at the same time trade can inevitably result in disruptions and losses for specific workers john hickenlooper i think that we should have a consistent strong trade policy that works for everyone in america amy klobuchar america chose to pursue a trade policy that prioritized the interests of capital over the interests of american workers elizabeth warren china it s also highly unlikely that a tit for tat escalating tariff conflict is going to lead them to change the fundamentals of their economic model when you look at the way that the state is involved with their economy even with currency manipulation these aren t things they re going to give up on just because we slapped some tariffs on chinese goods pete buttigieg these policies from my perspective they re only looking backwards they re not really looking forward steve bullock for too long china has succeeded in hurting america s manufacturing industry by engaging in illegal steel and aluminum dumping that is why i support targeted tariffs against china s steel and aluminum tim ryan trump s negotiating tactics have and continue to undermine any long term deal that could be reach with china eric swalwell we must use all tools at our disposal to ensure china respects intellectual property law this will include working with and leveraging the power of the international community to make certain that china engages in fair trade marianne williamson nafta nafta took away almost a million jobs in this country tens of thousands of them bill de blasio agreements like the north american free trade agreement nafta have resulted in the loss of hundreds of thousands of american jobs tulsi gabbard use of tariffs there is no question that we need to make sure that our trading partners abide by their obligations under international trade agreements but ill considered tariffs will only hurt jay inslee before engaging trade wars that could have detrimental impacts to american businesses and our economy we must seek

gold switzerland s franc japan s yen top rated government bonds and even bitcoin investors have dashed for havens and alternative assets this week as anxiety grows about trade wars u s iran tensions and negative interest rates although world stocks and bonds remain near record highs thanks to promises of ever more central bank largesse the sudden dash for these financial bunkers shows all is not as calm as a cursory reading of headline indexes suggests fears of a global trade war have been simmering for over a year but the latest standoff between washington and beijing may come to a head at the g20 summit in japan this weekend new u s tariffs on chinese imports could kick in next month if there s no progress between the two sides military tensions between the united states and iran have also gone up several notches after tehran s downing of an unmanned american drone last week and claims that u s retaliation was stopped at the last minute a fresh wave sanctions on iran s leaders and a war of words between the two sides have followed the trade and geopolitical worries are compounding investor concern about a looming global economic downturn and whether central banks are easing policy again quickly enough to offset it even if they are the expanding universe of bonds with a negative yield effectively penalising investors for holding them is unnerving for many it comes at the worst possible moment because we are late cycle we are worried about global growth and the u s are fighting on many fronts said frederic ducrozet a strategist at pictet wealth management referring partly to the trade conflict between the u s and china he said that under normal circumstances the reaction to the dispute in the middle east would have been confined largely to oil prices but because of worries over global growth and the tail risk from trade negotiations flows are being directed instead into safe assets this iran conflict is the cherry on the cake said ducrozet nowhere has the move been more marked than in gold the precious metal struck a six year high of 1 438 63 on tuesday up a whopping 11 2 over the past month safe currencies the japanese yen and swiss franc are around 2 and 2 7 higher respectively over the same period ducrozet even pointed to bitcoin s resurgence up 40 over the last month as possibly partly driven by the search for alternative investments the promise of fresh stimulus from the world s top central banks has fuelled an all inclusive rally in public assets with equities and bonds rising in tandem that is unsettling for portfolio managers who use the more typical inverse relationship between stocks and bonds to balance and insulate their funds the fear is that if they correlate on the way up they will do so on the way down hence the search for more alternative assets to diversify portfolios it seems that the world is so awash with money that it is creating financial asset price inflation wherever you look ing economist robert carnell said in a note last week something is wrong here moreover the likelihood that if and when this is realised the positive correlation between all assets means that my portfolio diversification will all count for nothing is rather disturbing what s more there are growing worries that central banks under pressure from politicians and markets alike are finding it harder to read the signals on inflation and growth due to the lack of visibility on policy and trade federal reserve chief jerome powell speaks later on tuesday following stinging criticism from u s president donald trump on monday trump again criticised the fed for not cutting interest rates fast enough saying the world s most important central bank blew it and didn t know what it was doing source reuters reporting by abhinav ramnarayan graphic by ritvik carvalho editing by mike dolan and catherine evans

by claudio grass via news room interview with chris powell every seasoned gold investor and every student of monetary history has likely stumbled upon various theories about institutional manipulation of the gold market while it is true that rarely is there smoke without fire it is still important to approach this matter rationally and form opinions based on sound evidence and solid research this is why i have personally been following the work of the gold anti trust action committee inc gata for quite some time their findings essays and analyses have not only been enlightening but also allow for a deeper understanding of the gold market thus it was only natural that i jumped at the opportunity to interview chris powell gata s co founder and discuss with him the past and current state of the gold market as well as his expectations for the future chris powell is political columnist for the journal inquirer a daily newspaper in manchester connecticut usa where he has worked since graduating from high school in 1967 he was managing editor of the newspaper from 1974 until last year his column is published in newspapers throughout connecticut he is also secretary treasurer of the gold anti trust action committee inc gata which he co founded in 1999 to expose and oppose the rigging of the gold market by western central banks and their investment bank agents he edits the gata dispatch that organization s daily electronic newsletter he is a member of the board of directors of the connecticut council on freedom of information and was its state legislative chairman from 2004 2010 cg why did you decide to focus on the gold market what attracted you to the topic in the first place cp gata focused on the rigging of the gold market because it was the first comprehensive market rigging that the organization s founders stumbled upon and because after some research we determined that rigging the gold market was the prerequisite for rigging all other markets cg arguably one of the most blatant and overt examples of gold manipulation was that of the london gold pool could you summarise the case for us and explain its implications cp the london gold pool was a mechanism created in 1961 by the united states and seven of its european allies to enforce the valuation of the u s dollar at 35 per ounce of gold the pool members dishoarded gold from their reserves as necessary to maintain the dollar s value and its status as the world reserve currency this was done in the open and there was no disputing that the gold price was controlled by the gold pool s members this dishoarding prevented gold s return as the reserve currency the pool collapsed in 1968 under the pressure of extreme offtake from the pool as governments and investors realized that the u s dollar was being inflated too much and that as a result gold was substantially undervalued the gold rigging governments had to devise another mechanism for controlling the gold price after a few years they settled on futures markets which allowed the price to be rigged without a lot of dishoarding of national gold reserves cg more recently starting in 1999 gordon brown the then uk chancellor of the exchequer made a historic decision to sell almost half of the uk s gold reserves during at a 20 year low in gold prices attracting a lot of criticism in the process and especially after the fact what did you make of this move cp we have always believed that the uk s gold sales meant to rescue certain too big to fail investment houses that had engaged in the gold carry trade borrowing central bank gold selling it in anticipation of ever lower prices and investing the proceeds in government bonds paying secure interest had been caught short when the gold market turned upward and could not obtain and return the borrowed gold without exploding the market and risking their own insolvency cg around the same time the swiss the last nation to retain a kind of gold standard abolished the 40 backing of the chf in the constitution and announced the sale of 50 of the so called excess reserves of physical gold what do you think the reasoning behind this decision was cp the swiss decision likely was motivated by concerns similar to those of the uk government but this is just speculation cg we understand that the system is manipulated however we also see that the us is using political power to influence the global economy through the swift system by controlling who is allowed to participate in global trade and who doesn t they can freeze bank accounts or impose other financial sanctions if they want to this contributed to the fact that today china russia as well as europe are working on an alternative banking system which is going to operate outside of the us government s control which will lead to less demand for usd on a global scale as we know for a debt based system the crashing point is when debt is shrinking and not expanding do you think this will be a trigger in bringing down or at least devaluing the usd significantly against other currencies and in particular against the price of gold in the future we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us cp i think the crashing point is where the scottish economist peter millar puts it where interest on debt starts going exponential and consuming the real economy in a paper written in 2006 millar wrote that fiat money systems based on debt require periodic currency devaluations to reduce the burden of interest payments these devaluations require upward revaluation of the monetary metals and all real assets relative to debt and currency indeed the u s economists and fund managers paul brodsky and lee quaintance speculated in 2012 that such a devaluation of currencies and upward revaluation of gold was already the long term plan of central banks that they were redistributing world gold reserves to allow countries with excessive u s dollar surpluses to hedge themselves against a dollar devaluation the resulting upward revaluation of gold brodsky and quaintance wrote would reliquefy central banking around the world cg how would you interpret the fact that china has been established as a physical gold trading hub and offers trading oil for yuan backed by gold do you see a connection with the revelations gata has put together from wikileaks from key officials and other sources clearly showing that china s government is well aware of u s efforts to suppress the gold price in order to support the usd cp yes china certainly knows all about the west s policy of gold price suppression it often has been written about in the government controlled chinese press china seems to see gold as the escape from the dollar system the once and future world reserve currency the wikileaks cables show not only that china knows about gold price suppression but that the u s knows that china knows china s understanding of this policy is very incisive but only the chinese government knows its long term plans for gold and the yuan cg i recently read an interview with the legendary fofoa in the brand new in gold we trust report in which the gold oil ratio was discussed he opined that the price of gold vs oil has been suppressed for the past decades in 1946 the ratio stood at 21 and today it stands at 21 9 so it hasn t moved at all indeed the gold oil ratio was basically the same for 70 years from 1946 at the start of bretton woods following wwii until 2016 it stayed in a band ranging from about 9 to 29 and averaging about 15 that s the price of oil in gold and gold in oil an ounce of gold is 15 barrels of oil and a barrel of oil is 1 15th of an ounce of gold but that s not an equilibrium price in this context do you believe that gold will be revalued against the price of oil in the future resulting in gold gaining tremendously against oil in purchasing power and can china s moves linking oil and gold physically be interpreted as a step in that direction cp records discovered by bullion star researcher ronan manly at the bank of england show that in the 1980s central banks saw gold price suppression as necessary to keep oil flowing inexpensively from opec nations to the west that the understanding was that oil could stay cheap as long as gold could so the oil producers would get an inflation protected asset in exchange for their wasting asset i m not sure that china has firmly linked gold and oil prices yet there are influences on the gold price quite apart from oil indeed i suspect that debt and interest levels are more influential with gold now a worldwide recession or depression might collapse oil prices but cause gold prices to rise cg through your decades long experience and extensive research into the gold market how do you evaluate the role of the precious metal in the global economy and as an investment and how would you respond to those who describe it as a barbarous relic cp gold is the secret knowledge of the financial universe controlling the gold price is the first objective of central banking since a free market gold price would allow the monetary metal to compete with government currencies and diminish demand for government bonds actually keynes did not call gold a barbarous relic he used that term about the gold standard gold is just a form of money but a potentially superior form since it is money without counterparty risk if central banks ever stopped suppressing its price free markets would remonetize gold and make it the new world reserve currency in a matter of days cg over the last decade we have witnessed an unprecedented monetary experiment with qe and extremely low interest rates what do you expect the impact of this aggressive intervention to be for the economy and do you see it benefiting gold investors in the long run cp such extreme intervention by central banks has destroyed the world s market economy for years now there really have been no markets at all only interventions since these interventions are largely surreptitious requiring deception to work they have become essentially totalitarian if they are ever re established free markets are likely to benefit gold investors but governments may nullify any benefit to gold investors by confiscating or outlawing possession of monetary gold nationalizing gold mines sharply increasing royalty requirements on gold mining companies and imposing windfall profits taxes on gold related investments diversification of monetary metals storage seems crucial for investors claudio grass

reforms and counter terrorism operations among others prime minister narendra modi is also expected to have a meeting with trump on g20 sidelines and discuss several issues including trade new delhi this weekend on 28 29 june japanese prime minister shinzo abe will welcome world leaders for the annual summit of the group of twenty g20 in osaka while discussions are expected to centre around the deteriorating global economy the summit s most anticipated event is the likely meeting between us president donald trump and his chinese counterpart xi jinping on the sidelines of the meet what is g20 the g20 started in 1999 as a meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors in the aftermath of the asian financial crisis it acted as an international forum to facilitate global economic cooperation and discuss ways to improve economic governance in 2008 the first g20 leaders summit was held and it played a key role in responding to the global financial crisis that year one should also note how there was a gradual shift in power from g8 now g7 to g20 thereafter this change was a tacit acknowledgement of the rise of other powers including countries such as india brazil and turkey g20 is a club of 19 nations argentina australia brazil canada china france germany italy india indonesia japan mexico russia saudi arabia south africa south korea turkey uk us and the eu the forum collectively represents 85 per cent of global gdp 75 per cent of world trade and two third of the world s population along with several international institutions such as the financial stability board fsb international monetary fund imf and world trade organisation wto g20 forms the backbone of today s global economic governance although expectations are high commentators argue that the level of cooperation among major economies at this year s summit is nowhere near what it was a decade ago in the aftermath of the 2008 economic meltdown what we now witness is emergence of a g zero world a world order acutely lacking any form of leadership as put by political scientist ian bremmer here are some of the major issues on agenda in this summit also read us china trade war here s why the tariff tiff has stock markets in a fix trump xi to discuss trade war a focal point of this summit is the scheduled meeting between trump and xi trade talks between us and china have remained suspended since may affecting markets and slowing down global economic growth trump had earlier stated that he would impose an additional 25 per cent tariff on 300 billion worth of chinese goods if trade talks do not progress the us has been seeking verifiable measures to get intellectual property rights and greater access for american goods to enter chinese markets trump has also been demanding an end to forced technology transfer ftt ftt is the process by which companies must share technology either through regulations or as part of a joint venture agreement in exchange for access to chinese markets the us argues that this forces american companies to give up their trade secrets and remain in danger of losing its competitive edge this has been one of the most contentious issues of the us china trade war another sticking point has been us trade deficit with china which was 2 6 million in the last quarter china however disagrees and says that us has been trying to stop its growth in the global economy markets hoping for us china trade agreement deepening trade conflict between two of the world s largest economies has disrupted global value chains and led to increasing economic uncertainty a direct consequence has been concerted reduction in interest rates by central banks across the globe in an effort to tackle economic slowdown stakeholders across the globe have been desperately hoping that the two economic giants will reach a temporary trade agreement mike mackenzie writes in the financial times that no matter the soothing tones from the upcoming g20 meeting rising protectionism looks entrenched and that will only gnaw away at a globalised economy leaders of the 2008 g20 summit had also faced a similar scenario with respect to adopting protectionist trade policies the concluding g 20 statement that year had stated we underscore the critical importance of rejecting protectionism and not turning inward in times of financial uncertainty also read

have agreed to collaborate and bring stability in oil prices they have expressed concern over the recent attacks on oil tankers in the persian gulf and its impact on global oil supply the us has blamed iran for the attacks with trump even ordering a retaliatory attack last week before calling it off the us has pulled out of the 2015 iran deal and reimposed heavy sanctions on the latter as a result of this remaining countries in the agreement have struggled to counter american sanctions and alleviate the burden on iran s economy iran had earlier this month announced that it is accelerating its nuclear program and will soon breach the terms of the deal promoting debt transparency and sustainability on 9 june the finance ministers of g20 nations had agreed on a set of principles to undergo transparent and sustainable lending borrowing processes for infrastructure projects they are likely to seek endorsement of these principles at the summit these principles

one reason markets have lost momentum this week is the pending g20 leaders summit in japan for which expectations continue to be reset lower an early draft of the communiqué has already been reported in the media and it seems characteristically vague according to capital economics it acknowledges the benefits of free trade but fails to eschew protectionism as for the meeting between us president donald trump and china s president xi jinping a tariff ceasefire is seen as the best outcome capital economics said greg valliere chief us policy strategist at agf investments said an inflection point for markets may be days just away if the two leaders fail to agree to new talks the market reaction would be swift negative for stocks and both economies with a near certain rate cut from the fed in

on monday the government announced major changes in the monetary policy of zimbabwe highlighted by the ending of a 10 year multi currency system guest column respect gwenzi on monday the government announced major changes in the monetary policy of zimbabwe highlighted by the ending of a 10 year multi currency system further measures announced include the intended sterilisation of 1 2 billion in rtgs funds these are balances in rtgs dollars held by banks due to foreign creditors and investors among others these amounts have accumulated over a three year period from around 2017 and owing to hard currency challenges could not be remitted on introducing the rtgs and a partial float exchange rate in february the central bank promised to settle the dues at 1 1 this means banks will now have to transfer the amounts in rtgs whereas the reserve bank of zimbabwe rbz will settle them to external creditors at 1 1 implication the policy measures will have an immediate impact of lowering the quantum of rtgs balances in the banking system the amount of rtgs deposits will thus diminish grossly thereby strengthening the rtgs on the forex market all else being equal despite the rbz promise of 1 1 these deposits were competing for forex on the interbank and some investors were willing to take a shave the exact amount of transferable deposits is however not known in the market the treasury and the rbz have previously said the amount is below rtgs 2 billion on the downside it is evident that sterilisation will result in additional debt for the country and worse still in foreign currency the rtgs debt to gross domestic product ratio will thus go above 100 which means our capacity to service to debt will be significantly low given the high leverage the ability to attract lines of credit will equally be low this is the second time government has assumed private sector debt under 10 years payable interest on the due amounts will further burden the fiscus and if fundamentals do not improve at a quicker rate that may result in further fiscal misalignment adjustment of interest rates from an average of 15 to 50 implications interest rates relate to the cost of borrowing a revision of the interest rate is meant to realign the rates in line with inflation typically if banks are lending at below inflation levels it implies that their net return is negative there will therefore be no incentive to lend borrowers on the other hand will maximise their return if they borrow at lower rates in an inflationary environment an adjustment upwards thus reduces the propensity to borrow while re aligning lenders return on a more pertinent note zimbabwe s banking sector has struggled with npls in numerous instances in 2016 the npl ratio for the average banking sector reached as high as 24 a mop up exercise through zamco however helped bring down the ratio to a low of 8 as at december 2018 even before the new higher interest rates high npls had resurfaced and this will become a serious threat for the sector s viability going forward to government it equally means its cost of borrowing will go up given the extended monetary latitude it follows that treasury will be more active in attempting to stimulate the economy which is now in a recession government expects a trade deficit of about 2 8 billion by year end which is at the same level to last year this projected deficit means government expects to borrow an equivalent amount of circa 2 billion from the market and given the higher revised interest rates in the market the net impact is a quicker growth in money supply through higher interest payments removal of cap on margins on the interbank rate and administrative limits on the bureau de change implication this is one of the most important measures promulgated by the rbz the imposition of caps on margins which essentially means the limitation of daily interbank rates through imposition of a ceiling reduced the attractiveness of the interbank by imposing a rate cap rbz was discouraging market forces but at the same time was attempting to manage a runaway exchange in light of low confidence in the market the removal of a cap means the exchange rate can now freely move without interference sellers can now offer at any price and if bidders are willing trades will be recorded without hindrances circuit breakers gave rise to off market trades and inspired the black market which was now trading at 100 ahead of the official exchange exporters and importers were now matching off the market with the facilitation of banks liquidity on the interbank thus remained low averaging a measly 1 9 million compared to a demand of over 10 million per session there will however be a shock in the official market with rates initially running to as high as the parallel rate before coming off to levels below 8 with more downside pressure liquidity on the interbank will thus improve from present averages while the two exchange rates will largely come close to each other the rbz has put a vesting period of 90 days on disposal of dual listed shares purchased by investors on the zse implications there are particularly two key stocks traded on the zse which are dually listed and these are old mutual and ppc the shares of both counters are also traded on the jse in south africa where they have a primary listing due to their dual listing their shares can move between markets such that a share purchased in zimbabwe can be sold on the jse and vice versa given the forex shortages in zimbabwe investors were taking advantage of the fungibility to buy old mutual shares in zimbabwe and then sell them on the jse as a way of moving funds from zimbabwe to other countries the key challenge with this move is that it gave room to arbitrage and peculation it also gave rise to the share price due to increased demand and as the share price rose in zimbabwe given a stable jse price the implied rate omir kept going up as a proxy for the exchange rate the resultant rate would grossly inflate the united states dollar exchange to rtgs increasing the holding period over which one should hold before selling in another market reduces speculation and trading activity in those respective counters thus lowering the exchange rate all else being equal increasing the supply of forex on the interbank by ensuring that at least 50 of the surrender portion of foreign currency is sold to the interbank market supplemented by a letter of credit for essential imports implications a commitment to increase the supply of forex on the interbank through retained forex from exporters is welcome however there is no mechanism to measure the bank s sincerity in that respect it is evident that government has its own demand and as the purse shrinks priorities will highly compete for resources the second part which addresses the aspect of letters of credit has dual implications first supporting of key imports which essentially have a high weight on the import basket frees up interbank funds though reduced demand this therefore implies a firming rtgs or zimdollar to the us dollar the downside remains that most lcs lock a forex price and therefore if the exchange rate moves upwards government will lose as it has to pay the difference between the market rate and the locked price when such a result come it means government will be sustaining subsidies in some instances however given that low volatility will be expected the level of subsidy will be manageable overall prices inflation will take time to come down prices are generally sticky downwards and in a month and half s time prices will follow an emerging exchange rate respect gwenzi is the lead analyst and managing director or research form equity

gold switzerland s franc japan s yen top rated government bonds and even bitcoin investors have dashed for havens and alternative assets this week as anxiety grows about trade wars us iran tensions and negative interest rates although world stocks and bonds remain near record highs thanks to promises of ever more central bank largesse the sudden dash for these financial bunkers shows all is not as calm as a cursory reading of headline indexes suggests fears of a global trade war have been simmering for over a year but the latest standoff between washington and beijing may come to a head at the g 20 summit in japan this weekend new us tariffs on chinese imports could kick in next month if there s no progress between the two sides military tensions between the united states and iran have also gone up several notches after tehran s downing of an unmanned american drone last week and claims that us retaliation was stopped at the last minute a fresh wave sanctions on iran s leaders and a war of words between the two sides have followed the trade and geopolitical worries are compounding investor concern about a looming global economic downturn and whether central banks are easing policy again quickly enough to offset it even if they are the expanding universe of bonds with a negative yield effectively penalising investors for holding them is unnerving for many it comes at the worst possible moment because we are late cycle we are worried about global growth and the us are fighting on many fronts said frederic ducrozet a strategist at pictet wealth management referring partly to the trade conflict between the us and china he said that under normal circumstances the reaction to the dispute in the middle east would have been confined largely to oil prices but because of worries over global growth and the tail risk from trade negotiations flows are being directed instead into safe assets this iran conflict is the cherry on the cake said mr ducrozet nowhere has the move been more marked than in gold the precious metal struck a six year high of 1 438 63 on tuesday up a whopping 11 2 per cent over the past month safe currencies the japanese yen and swiss franc are around 2 per cent and 2 7 per cent higher respectively over the same period mr ducrozet even pointed to bitcoin s resurgence up 40 per cent over the last month as possibly partly driven by the search for alternative investments the promise of fresh stimulus from the world s top central banks has fuelled an all inclusive rally in public assets with equities and bonds rising in tandem that is unsettling for portfolio managers who use the more typical inverse relationship between stocks and bonds to balance and insulate their funds the fear is that if they correlate on the way up they will do so on the way down hence the search for more alternative assets to diversify portfolios it seems that the world is so awash with money that it is creating financial asset price inflation wherever you look ing economist robert carnell said in a note last week something is wrong here moreover the likelihood that if and when this is realised the positive correlation between all assets means that my portfolio diversification will all count for nothing is rather disturbing what s more there are growing worries that central banks under pressure from politicians and markets alike are finding it harder to read the signals on inflation and growth due to the lack of visibility on policy and trade on monday us president donald trump again criticised the fed for not cutting interest rates fast enough saying the world s most important central bank blew it and didn t know what it was doing on tuesday fed chief jerome powell defended the central bank s independence from mr trump and financial markets both of which seem to be pushing for aggressive rate cuts in remarks at the council on foreign relations in new york the fed is insulated from short term political pressures said mr powell asked later about the possibility of disappointing markets by not delivering a cut mr powell added we re not in the business really of trying to work through short term movements in financial conditions we have to look through that reuters

carere executive vice president chief marketing communications officer and now fred smith will share his views on the quarter frederick w smith chairman and chief executive officer thank you very much mickey welcome to all joining our quarterly call fiscal 2019 was a year of both challenge and change for fedex we faced weakening international revenue growth driven by the slowdown in global trade the less favorable service mix of tnt express business after the notpetya cyberattack and continued rapid growth of e commerce demand we re very proud of our team members who are responding with positive actions and innovative solutions that will make fedex even stronger and more successful in the future fedex enters fiscal 2020 with a sharp focus on extending our lead as the premier global transport and logistics company and on making the necessary investments today to capture the significant market opportunities we see for the future these steps include enhancing fedex ground capabilities speed and efficiency improving fedex express hub automation particularly in memphis and indianapolis finishing the integration of tnt modernizing our aircraft fleet and reducing unit cost and increasing productivity especially for e commerce deliveries while these investments are long term in nature and their success cannot always be measured immediately we are confident they will drive significant earnings growth and improved margins and cash flows and returns for our shareholders over the long haul let me emphasize however that based on our current forecast of us gdp growth for fy 20 we anticipate fedex freight will increase earnings and margin over the period we believe fedex ground will increase earnings for the fiscal year with modest if any margin compression from current levels despite the investments we ve announced such as six and seven day per week delivery large package capabilities and in sourcing of smartpost global trade disputes and low global growth rates create significant uncertainty for the express business leading us to be cautious and projecting fy 20 earnings for this segment the integration of tnt is now progressing at a good clip and we will see significant benefits by this time in summer 2021 major focus of our investment strategy i should note is also improved sustainability and efficiency we intend to substantially grow our e commerce business and are well aware improved profitability in this market requires greater efficiency and delivering residential packages and we have sound initiatives to steadily improve our cost to serve this market with these ends for example we ve recently announced in sourcing 2 million smartpost packages and an agreement with dollar general for over 8 000 pickup and delivery on site locations in sparsely populated in rural areas over fy 20 we will announce several additional initiatives in this regard let me also caution observers who follow fedex in this industry to be very careful extrapolating past assumptions and trends into the future for instance we ve noted repeatedly short haul package delivery will become increasingly important as retailers ship e commerce orders from store or local fulfillment hence average yields have to be matched with operational changes not visible to most to access to assure potential future profitability also future developments and speeding up e commerce deliveries and postal reform which by the way we have supported will likely be discontinuities in the next several years fedex is uniquely positioned for long term success and will continue to deliver a great future for our customers care owners team members and the communities we serve let me now turn to raj followed by brie and alan and then a brief comment by mark allen and then we ll take questions raj rajesh subramaniam president and chief operating officer thank you fred and good afternoon as mentioned on the last call our focus is long term profitable growth that drives increased shareholder value fiscal year 20 is in many ways a transition year for fedex as we continue to reinvigorate our business to capitalize on e commerce growth and execute significant initiatives to reduce our cost to serve in the us alone we expect the parcel market to double in size to more than 100 million packages per day by 2026 as the market grows so too our abilities and offering capabilities and offerings our global network serves as the invisible backbone for the fast easy and reliable e commerce experience that consumers demand today and we continuously build upon our offerings to customers one way we are doing so is by strategically working with retailers to enable market leading value propositions this includes working with target to leverage their stores as local fulfillment centers through our fedex extra hours offering and giving our customers access to a multitude of fedex drop off and pickup services such as last week s announcement with dollar general these are just a few examples of the ways we continue to flex our operations and network to respond to our customers brie will cover these capabilities among others in more detail it is clear that we are all in on e commerce this commitment is illustrated by a number of key strategic initiatives well under way in our operating units just last month we announced a number of innovative solutions for our fedex ground network this includes seven day a week residential delivery rapidly integrating fedex smartpost volume into standard ground operations and enhancing network around large package handling these changes directly address some of the key challenges inherent with e commerce namely increasing consumer expectations and managing the cost for residential delivery bringing the smartpost volume into the ground network allows us to improve density and efficiency in the last mile deliveries it is significant that we are engineering and enhancing the ground network in such a way that it will be more cost effective to deliver millions of residential packages a day directly by fedex ground in fact we expect fedex ground to become the low cost last mile provider in the industry the recent round announcement should be particularly exciting to online consumers who purchase large items like furniture tvs and kayaks with the click of a button we expect to have a large package operation in nearly 40 ground facilities prior to our peak season the vast majority of these are existing facilities and this approach minimizes capex and enable us to focus on placing large package handling in the more strategic locations such as near ports and railroads not one element of this transformation will be possible without the investments that fedex ground has been making and continues to make in technology advancements in loading sorting and scanning technologies will provide near real time data it will help optimize operations for maximizing the use of rail improving delivery density and increasing the efficiency of handling all packages no matter the size these types of technological enhancement and state of the art tools are true differentiators and are being implemented all across the fedex operations not just fedex ground fedex freight for example is in the midst of modernizing an industry that has been historically paper based technology advancements like advanced forklifts computers electronic shipping labels and advanced driver assist systems allow our team members to work smart safer and more efficiently this evolution of automation that s a step for continued long term success at fedex express we are implementing initiatives focused on lowering our cost to serve in the us this includes rightsizing the network as we prepare for future growth to accommodate this growth we have launched multi year hub modernization efforts at two of our largest express hubs memphis and indi these investments will enable express to handle more volume more efficiently internationally the global trade picture is less than ideal but we are confident in our long term position we are rapidly moving forward with the integration of tnt as expected we began fy 20 with a global sales force that s 98 integrated positioning us with a single face to our customers in nearly every market worldwide we have recently completed on schedule the rollout of our capabilities to inject legacy fedex express into our european shipments into the tnt european road network we expect to be substantially complete with the operational integration by the end of fiscal year 20 this will allow interoperability between the tnt and legacy express networks and in turn results in faster service for customers at a lower cost beyond fiscal year 20 or work will continue with key initiatives including customer migration air network integration and product rationalization the various areas i ve touched on today position fedex to be future ready we are focused on the long term and i am humbled by the ongoing commitment dedication and innovation by our more than 450 000 team members around the world now i will turn it over to brie to provide more details on our macro view revenue quality and additional growth initiatives brie brie carere executive vice president chief marketing and communications officer thank you raj good afternoon everyone i ll open with our economic update and outlook and provide some commentary on broader industry trends and our growth priorities overall us economic growth is holding up well with real gdp growing 3 1 in the first quarter of calendar year 19 however the industrial sector has suffered from an inventory build up and increased trade tensions through may manufacturing output was 1 5 off its december peak for calendar year 19 we expect global economic growth to moderate as the developed world sees slower growth in both domestic and external factors weigh on emerging markets we expect services to continue to underpin global gdp growth global trade has slowed as trade frictions have exerted a negative impact on sentiment and of course the manufacturing sector as the chinese economy has continued to decelerate this has also impacted other asian markets export performance china s exports which grew almost 10 in 2018 have barely grown this year amid heightened trade tensions with the united states outlook for the european economies remain slow due to a number of sector and country specific factors such as disruptions in the auto manufacturing sector social tensions policy uncertainty as well as uncertainty related to brexit in germany and italy which are two important markets for us manufacturing output which turned negative in november has continued to decline with april manufacturing output down 3 5 and 1 9 year over year in germany and italy respectively as we have stressed before tariffs are counterproductive to efforts that encourage business growth and expand global trade thankfully however we have a large and flexible global network that allows us to adjust and meet our customers needs when trade issues present challenges in certain markets as i mentioned on the last call we remain laser focused on three key areas international e commerce and small business despite macroeconomic headwinds that i just covered our international commercial team is poised for growth sales integration as raj has mentioned is essentially complete our european network is more reliable and faster than it has ever been we have simplified our pricing structure and open the valve for e commerce within europe we ve also created new pricing programs for our asian team to sell into europe as well as from europe into asia this is the largest trade lane in the new world e commerce continues to be a driving force of total us domestic market growth we are building our portfolio networking capacity to best serve thousands of retailers in this space and we continue to differentiate for example with the launch of the fedex seven day service in 2020 fedex ground will deliver seven days a week year round for 80 of us gdp this is truly a transformational move that builds upon the largest global commerce transportation network in the world to further serve the growing e commerce market we are already faster than the competition by at least one day in 25 of the lanes this move will further speed up our network and allow us to continue to gain market share with the growth of e commerce and consumer demand for flexible safe and convenient delivery options fedex sought to provide unmatched access and create cost saving opportunities for customers the recently announced alliance with dollar general will provide access to fedex services in places that customers have told us are very convenient in their daily lives the alliance will provide more than 8 000 additional locations for customers to hold packages for pick up and drop off pre labeled packages including of course pre labeled returns further it will bring fedex closer to the consumer than we have ever been before within five miles of over 90 of the united states population once the dollar general rollout is complete the number of retail locations providing staffed fedex shipping will grow to over 27 000 we are incredibly excited that the access to fedex service continues to improve especially for e commerce recipients in more rural less populated areas of the united states this is a tremendous achievement not just an increasing access but also in creating cost saving opportunities for our customers and for fedex for instance by choosing to ship packages directly to convenient fedex retail locations merchants can reduce cost of residential delivery surcharges delivery to our retail location eliminates weather related damage or ports that helping to reduce customer service and replacement cost for retailers and for returns drop off at our retail locations result in higher pickup density and drive greater operational efficiency making fedex even more competitive in the returns market we have a great returns growth opportunity that our competitive retail network now opens up for us across all our priorities we continue to be very focused on revenue management while we see irrational pricing market e commerce will continue to put pressure on yields with lighter packages moving shorter distances it is important to note that contrary to the erroneous and misinformed reporting in the wall street journal on june 23 fedex has made no recent pricing changes no pricing changes to our strategy and we have certainly made no changes related to any one customer in fact at express we have experienced strong growth from small and medium customers using our fedex express two day product following a strategic pricing change we made last year and we anticipate the growth of this successful product to continue in fy 20 we are confident that our strategies will allow us to grow global volumes and revenues profitably now let me turn the call over to alan for his remarks alan alan b graf executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you brie and good afternoon everyone fedex express fourth quarter operating income declined as weakness in global trade and industrial production drove a decline in our international priority revenue year over year comparisons were also impacted by an 85 million gain on the sale of a non core business of tnt express last year to mitigate the weakness we have undertaken several immediate cost containment actions including significant reductions of variable incentive compensation limiting hiring and discretionary spending and completing our us voluntary employee buyout program approximately 15 000 fedex employees have left or will be voluntarily leaving the company via the us employee buyout program by the end of fy 20 approximately 85 of those employees departed on may 31 2019 we incurred costs of 316 million during the fourth quarter associated with our business realignment activities these costs related primarily to severance for employees who accepted voluntary buyouts business realignment activities including the voluntary employee buyout are expected to benefit fy 20 by approximately 240 million by eliminating open positions we expect to achieve our savings goal using less severance than we originally forecasted tnt integration expenses were 84 million for the fourth quarter and 388 million for fy 19 as you heard from raj we are continuing to make good progress with our integration activities at fedex ground we continue to see strong e commerce volume growth in the fourth quarter however fedex ground income and margins were negatively impact by increased purchase transportation rates and the january launch of year round six day per week operations fedex freight closed the year with another strong quarter despite weakening industrial production revenue per shipment increased 4 operating income increased 15 and operating margin improved to 9 9 below the line our non cash mark to market retirement plan accounting adjustment of a net 3 9 billion loss was driven by a substantially lower discount rate which contributed 1 8 billion through the loss changes in actuarial assumptions which significantly increased the liability and lower than expected asset returns fy 19 capital expenditures totaled 5 5 billion for fiscal 2020 we are targeting a mid single digit percentage decrease in adjusted earnings per share our performance has been negatively affected by continued weakness in global trade and industrial production as well as the near term impact of certain strategic decisions we have made to sustain our leading position in a changing marketplace at fedex express we expect earnings to be down in fy 20 due to weakness in international priority revenue and ongoing shift to lower yielding services our strategic decision to not renew the fedex express us domestic contract with amazon will also be a near term headwind which we expect to reverse to a positive in fy 21 as we replace the lost volume and optimize the network additionally we do not expect a significant benefit from the fuel surcharge table changes in fy 19 to repeat in fy 20 fedex express will continue to implement actions to reduce cost to serve improving efficiencies and adjusted to global network to match anticipated demand while we expect to make significant progress on tnt integration activities in fy 20 integration work will continue in fy 21 we expect to incur approximately 350 million of integration expenses in fy 20 and 1 7 billion in total through fy 21 at fedex ground we expect volume and revenue growth to remain very strong in fy 20 however operating margins will face headwinds from higher operating costs associated with expanding fedex ground delivery schedule improving our capabilities for large packages and other investments to significantly improve efficiency and safety as raj mentioned at fedex freight we expect continued improved performance as we remain focused on improving revenue quality inaudible technology solutions that will drive efficiency and further differentiate us in the ltl market our fy 20 effective tax rate prior to year end mark to market retirement plan accounting adjustments is expected to increase to 23 to 25 and will likely vary from quarter to quarter in addition our tax rate is very sensitive to international income which may cause the rate to vary from that range fy 20 capital spending is expected to be 5 9 billion these expenditures will include fedex express investments in aircraft and hub modernization fedex ground investments that increase our efficiency in handling large packages and investments in technology across the enterprise that will further optimize our networks and improve our competitiveness all of these targets assume moderate us economic growth current fuel price expectations and no further weakening in international economic conditions a further ramping in any trade measures and or adverse changes in international trade policies and relations would likely drive additional weakness in our business as i mentioned earlier a substantial decline in discount rates changes in actuarial assumptions and lower than expected asset returns negatively impacted our fy 19 mark to market adjustments with that our us qualified pension plan funded status declined to approximately 90 while we are not required to make a pension contribution fy 20 we are expecting to contribute 1 billion also we have funded large increases in our dividend and significant share repurchase over the last several years our stock buyback level is expected to be significantly lower in fy 20 and our dividend remains at 0 65 per quarter in conclusion management is focused on improving our near term performance while also positioning fedex for long term success while we are adjusting cost to mitigate macro uncertainties and address the growth of e commerce we will continue to invest in areas that expand our capabilities and improve our long term efficiencies we are confident these investments will drive long term earnings growth and improve margins cash flows and returns now let me turn the call back over to fred to introduce the topic mark allen is going to discuss frederick w smith chairman and chief executive officer thank you alan first before i do that let me take a point of personal privilege and mention something in the wall street journal article yesterday which i am uniquely qualified to speak to and it s the statement that i started the express unit four decades ago to ferry shipments like legal documents and medical supplies over long distances facts to the matter are that when fedex began operations it was specifically prohibited for private carriers to move documents in any type that was only permitted a number of years later when they were relaxation of the private express statutes in order to facilitate the fast movements of legal and financial documents and rather than medical supplies the company was basically put together to pick up transport and deliver first overnight for many address in the us to any other address in the united states technology packages which was the basic market that we were serving of course we then added two day express we expanded internationally added pallets and of course today we pick up and transport millions of items in the express business on a far larger scale at a far far lower price biggest issue on a go forward basis and the article goes on to say that the express unit was built for e commerce reality is it perfectly built for e commerce with the exception that we have to address as we ve said on several of the remarks here including mine that we have to be very efficient in delivering to residential making residential deliveries which are an increasing part of the traffic moving through both the ground and the express network so with that clarification let me turn now to the subject of the lawsuit that we filed yesterday there has been a considerable amount of misreporting on this as well number one as that is related to the huawei issue where we misrouted and then apologized for two packages and returned to the shipper erroneously a third the huawei packages were only peripherally involved in this lawsuit that we filed and in fact it goes back many many years which in the lawsuit itself and it concerns not contraband which many people have confused the lawsuit as concerning it concerns import and export controls as administered by the department of commerce so we worked very hard with all kinds of law enforcement agency as does the postal service and ups keep certain types of items out of our networks illegal drugs unlicensed firearms you could go down the list you can go and look at the prohibited items on our website the postal service this is not about prohibited items and contraband it is about regulations that the department of commerce administers which prohibit entities meaning companies or individuals from exporting or importing and that s quite different and in many cases they re either prohibited completely or they are restricted to various destinations or to various commodities or certain contents in turn that requires a common carrier like fedex when one of these entities is put on the list to in essence certify and in fact get a certificate from the shipper that basically lists ph what s in the package or in the in the shipment and that s the issue that we are that we are dealing with here i note that that secretary ross who i have known for four decades and respect and like a lot i m pained by the fact that he issued a statement that disagrees with our position in the litigation but as we told the department of commerce yesterday we certainly understand their job and their implementation of the trade policy of the administration this lawsuit doesn t speak to that at all it speaks to the issues that our general counsel will tell you about and after his remarks we won t have any further comments on this as we ll let the process play out in the courts but mark allen our general counsel will make a statement mark r allen executive vice president general counsel and secretary the action that we filed yesterday in the federal district court in dc request of the government be permanently enjoining from enforcing the export administration regulations against fedex in circumstances where we have no actual knowledge that the contents of a shipment are subject to the ears the bis takes the position that a common carrier like fedex can be held liable for shipments that do not comply with the export administration regulations without requiring any evidence that the carrier had any actual knowledge of an apparent violation we believe very strongly that the imposition of this sort of strict liability is a clear violation of our constitutional due process rights under the fifth amendment we cannot know the contents of the 15 million packages we handle daily and whether those contents comply with the complex ears by requiring us to police the contents of packages moving through our global networks the government is placing an unreasonable burden on a common carrier we have reached out to commerce to let them know of our commitment to compliance however we hope to reach an agreement on a common sense way forward that would be creating a safe harbor that essentially means if we have no knowledge of an apparent violation the bis will not come after us frederick w smith chairman and chief executive officer so now we ll take your questions and inaudible questions and answers operator operator instructions and our first question today will come from allison landry with credit suisse allison landry credit suisse analyst thanks good afternoon so you mentioned 2020 is a transition year for earnings and considering the bump in capex clearly it s going to be difficult for you guys to generate cash this year so i guess do you expect any positive cash flow and could you help us think through the the longer term cash generation of the business as you think about 2021 and 2022 thank you alan b graf executive vice president and chief financial officer allison this is alan yes i do expect improved free cash flow in fy 20 and as far as it s been a transitional year we i think explained it about as well as we could so i look forward to pass that i can t predict what s going to happen with trade tariff china g20 and brexit so if you just set that aside that turns out well or decent we got a lot of good guys and in 21 will have a seven day ground operation running full speed we ll have the benefits from a full tnt interoperability we ll have lower us fedex express rural and residential cost we ll have unbelievable improvement in ground productivity and growth and we ll have continued freight growth and improved productivity so i think once we get through 20 we are going to be in fantastic shape with the global macro hanging over as to our 5 9 billion the company wanted to spend upwards of seven we worked very hard to push up projects that i think will have good strategic returns but a lot of really good things didn t make the cut we have a lot of opportunities here particularly on the cost side and we re going to attack them aggressively operator our next question will come from chris wetherbee with citi chris wetherbee citi analyst hey thanks good afternoon it looks based on the guidance that you re calling for express to be down from a profit perspective maybe double digits wanted to get a sense if you could maybe break out some of the cross currents from trade and the macro and sort of what that impact might be on the core business and try to separate that out from some of the things that you re doing strategically with delivery as well as some of the late night pickups and maybe some of the strategic decisions you ve made around the customers any you can kind of parse out some of the details in sort of that guided weakness in express would be helpful alan b graf executive vice president and chief financial officer chris alan again what we re looking at right now as i just talked about in our fourth quarter at expressed where we had international priority revenue is actually down that s hard to that s hard to recover from in a very short period of time again i don t know what s going to play out here on trade and tariffs so there could be some upside for that but at the moment i m not seeing that our load factors coming out of asia ph are not really bad but the yields are that good and it could be better so i think the biggest issue is the macro on the as far as what s going on with express in the us it s doing fine i mean we had a great growth rate in our deferred traffic which we went after intentionally and we re going to get our cost structure in shape to improve the profitability of express for that as well so really it s the macro that s the biggest hangover for what we re looking at for fy 20 operator and next we ll go to jack atkins with stephens jack atkins stephens analyst hey good afternoon thank you for the time could you provide some more details around the steps that you re taking to in your words right size your operations to better handle e commerce do you foresee perhaps further changes in the business model in an effort to gain these efficiencies such as more closely integrating your ground and express operations thank you frederick w smith chairman and chief executive officer i don t recall who said right size did you raj oh optimize well this is smith here i said in my remarks that we had made a number of announcements i don t think anybody on this phone call knew a month ago that fedex was going to announce seven day a week service 8 000 dollar general locations insourcing 2 million smartpost packages building a number of large package annexes to exploit that business in ground and then all the other things that raj and brie mentioned to you so please recall in my remarks i basically said stay tuned that there we ll be telling you some other things during this fiscal year so we understand the issues involved in e commerce and residential delivery and raj made the point specifically we will be the low cost producer in the e commerce space for residential deliveries we re quite confident of that from many perspectives but we re not prepared to tell you some of these other moves anymore than we were prepared to tell you a month ago about the things that i just pushed it off but there will be other things that we will announce during fy 20 in this regard you can count on it operator our next question will come from scott group with wolfe research scott group wolfe research analyst hi thanks afternoon so alan is there any way you can help us think about maybe the quarterly cadence of earnings just now obviously we ve got some weak trends right now but then really tough incentive comps in the second half of the year any help there and then maybe just fred just following up on that is big picture are you are there reasons why we could potentially consolidate ground and express networks from a delivery standpoint and then any update you can give us on the international buyout potential alan b graf executive vice president and chief financial officer that was three scott so look as to cadence the tax rate is going to be really spotty i mean we ve got some a lot of assumptions that we have to prove and get through we re still looking at all these pages of interpretations and regs that are coming out it s left and right we re dealing with inaudible us from everybody that you follow and international is extremely complex so tax rate is going to be a factor in our quarter to quarter numbers don t be surprised by that secondarily again i just can t tell you what s going to happen from the global economic standpoint so that piece of it the cadence is going to be the cadence it s a little bit out of our control we ll manage to it but we don t want to do anything stupid and then not have the capacity that we need in the right place so we re watching that extremely carefully you asked ground they re going to have a great year i mean they really are i mean they re going to grow fast and if we re going to hold margins are get close to hold margins on this growth with all the expansion and all the investment that they re doing and improving productivity they re going to be really inaudible in 21 they re going to have a great consistent year so that s about all i can i can tell the other thing is that people forget that there is a reason that express has a two day service it s called distance when we need an airplane we need an airplane the customer really decides which network makes the delivery i think we ve explained this over and over and over again on the margin yes there s always opportunities but for the most part we ve got to fly when we have to fly but the customer can make that decision operator amit mehrotra from deutsche bank has our next question amit mehrotra deutsche bank analyst hi thanks for taking my question alan you made the comment i think in response to allison s question the free cash flow would be better in fiscal 20 i am wondering if you could just help put a finer point in that based on the macro assumptions that the company has made and related to that the 1 billion pension contribution the voluntary pension contribution i would imagine that that would be funded with new debt given the offsetting cash savings from the pbgc insurance premiums and then just related to that if you can discuss the incremental costs in fiscal 20 associated with the seven day delivery thanks so much alan b graf executive vice president and chief financial officer well there ll be some incremental costs associated with some of the delivery of course we ve been incurring them and we will continue to incur them but that now that we ve gone to six day the seven day leap ph is not nearly as significant so those won t be material but they probably will likely be a headwind but i have to say what i m hearing from my team is that the customers are lining up to get the seven day get the sunday service and we re going to do it very efficiently and i think we ll be able to start it in a very good way so again i m excited about what s happening in that regard operator our next question will come from david ross with stifel david ross stifel analyst yes good afternoon just back on the tnt integration expenses the total cost of 1 7 billion about double what initially was can you remind us what that additional expenses for and is there a difference between network integration which you said is going to be completed in the next year and network improvement or upgrade that need to be made to the tnt system alan b graf executive vice president and chief financial officer hi david alan again not double i will tell you a couple of things one is that we originally gave you a 400 million number about notpetya that s an old number that s never been updated but it continues to be a problem for us in terms of integration as we have to basically rebuild a system that tnt had and then integrate it with the network that we ve got on the purple side and it s cost us a lot more money and slowed it down and it s made it more complex the good news on that side is that the interoperability will be done by the end of the fiscal year and that s when we can start really harvesting the benefits of that low cost road network and flow the express packages through it seamlessly without all kinds of double handling and double packaging and everything else i mean i will let raj add to this rajesh subramaniam president and chief operating officer yes i ll just say that there has been tremendous momentum in the last literally in the last few months on tnt integration we have the vision of interoperability by the end of fiscal year 20 and ultimately one network for air and one network for ground it s a lot of value to be had here but what i want to say here is that we are not waiting to create value for the customers because of the customer value has been created as we speak we are speeding up lanes and our service levels are very good and with the demand is strong so i think we ve made a lot of progress and the significant value in this investment it will come to bear fiscal 21 onwards operator and next we ll go to david vernon with bernstein david vernon bernstein analyst hi question for you fred or raj on the portfolio obviously the expansion into the virtual kind of retail footprint with the partnerships with dollar general things like that is there a point where you may be look at the portfolio and say why do we still have the services business do you need that retail footprint do you ever get to a point where you kind of rethink the composition of that part of the business rajesh subramaniam president and chief operating officer i guess you re quite asking about the fedex office i think it plays a very important role as part of our retail network especially as we move forward on e commerce some of the premium value added services on hold location plus return services and there are several things that we process through the fedex office as unique and differentiated and the value is going to get even better as the e commerce trends increase i don t know brie if you want to add anything more to that brie carere executive vice president chief marketing and communications officer yes the only thing that i will add is obviously we re very excited about the expansion of our on site retail partnerships with walgreens and with dollar general the fedex office retail locations bringing in some of our most profitable small and medium business because the experience they get when they are shipping internationally and when they were shipping and they want the peace of mind of proper packaging that is absolutely just a stellar experience and those employees just deliver a great experience so we re very committed to that element of the portfolio rajesh subramaniam president and chief operating officer yes and don t forget these fedex office location the size of this fedex offices are really substantial and it s a very it s an excellent place to conduct call e commerce and as brie pointed out the most profitable packages for the fedex system comes through the fedex office network frederick w smith chairman and chief executive officer and we re expanding inside walmart stores which is becoming a great partnership and brie thanks for mentioning profitability i loved it operator our next question will come from brandon oglenski with barclays brandon oglenski barclays analyst hi good afternoon everyone and thanks for taking my question mr smith i really submit this question humbly as an analyst has never run a business but i guess at what point do we question the scale of the express network because we ve seen decade after decade of low returns low margins in peak economic activity you guys can t put in a pretty good return but you will never really crossing that threshold of covering the cost of capital and on the call today just looking at that the strategy is the same put more capital and optimize but not rightsize i guess why not a more radical look at the business i think someone suggests a look at integrating portions of express or ground or maybe even going more aggressively just on the overall footprint of the business can you talk to that please frederick w smith chairman and chief executive officer didn t you ask me the same question in the last analyst call or somebody else asked me a similar question look i the only way i can respond to that is obviously the plans and the programs we put in place were designed to create superior returns we didn t just decided to do it for the hell of it and it reminds me a little bit about that all adage of mike tyson that you know everybody has got a plan until they get hit in the mouth so one of the things that always amuses me about watching a lot of things that are written about fedex and so forth you know the competition has a vote and the economy has a vote so clearly we ve been very disappointed over the last few years with the assumptions that we made on the growth in international trade particularly with the trump administration the united states policy since 1934 with roosevelt and secretary of state cordell hull was to expand international trade and now we have a huge dispute where the united states is basically become protectionist defined as i ll make everything i need in my own borders i don t need to import things and quite frankly don t particularly need to export them despite the fact that 95 of the world s population is outside the united states so we have become a protectionist country we don t agree with the chinese position on trade either i ve been very vocal about that which is merchant ph dealers i would like to sell to you but i won t buy from you on a reciprocal basis so your question implies that we have sat around and you said quote for decades we don t look at the business as a single segment we ve said that over and over again you all deconstruct it into some degree i sort of added in that today by making an exception saying we expected freight and ground to have earnings increases and margin increases in freight and hopefully any compression in ground due to the expansion will be very small so clearly as we go forward and things change of if we don t resume any kind of international growth we would change our approach to the business we don t have any sacred cows here but you also have to remember in the express business as alan said our domestic express business is doing fine it s not the issue it s the international business that s having a problem for the reasons that brie and now i am saying to you good news is that if traffic and yields materialize the conversion rate to profitability is probably in the neighborhood of 60 because it s a network where the incremental volume goes to the bottom line faster than any of our other activities in the case of tnt i have to say i ve been amazed not just with the people who follow fedex in this industry with the amazing dis interest and notpetya attack it was the largest single attack by a state sponsored entity in the history of the world it has put the ukraine on its knees the only reason that it was less of a factor to us than it was because of the fantastic work of our it team that went and remediated it had it not been that tnt had been subsidiary of fedex the company would have been bankrupt it would you just gone out of out of business so clearly we should have sat and waited knowing notpetya was coming we could have picked up the pieces it would have been a lot easier on us so i think i m going to ask rob carter our cio give you a bit of color what he was giving me the other day about the notpetya account to my knowledge the only in depth article that s ever been written by i think it was in wired magazine and when you read that it s like oh my god this is one of the most under reported stories in history so to get to your point of course we want to make money in these networks and we will engineer and modify them to the extent that we need to but you ve got to remember those two things the anticipation of continue to embrace a free trade which was our assumption on building a lot of this stuff and then not assuming the notpetya things are the two exogenous factors we ve been dealing with so rob you want to comment on this robert barber carter cif co ceo executive vice president well this attack was a weapons grade attacked by russia on ukraine that utilized cyber tools that were built by the nsa and the us government and a group called shadow broker stole those tools and they were turned back on the ukraine and the devastation in ukraine just hasn t properly been reported all the airports were down all the trains were down hospital systems were lost the monitoring systems in chernobyl that monitor what is the most infamous nuclear plant in the world were lost if you looked at pictures that are on the internet of the kiev airport every single screen showing the red screen of death every point of sale terminal in the big grocery store showing the same thing every atm machine down in the country this was an amazing attack and we are thankful that our teams were certainly able to stop at the borders of tnt it didn t impact the fedex enterprise but the devastation in the tnt technology state was considerable to say the least the good news for today is that the state is running significantly better than it ever has with high degrees of reliability that are positively impacting service levels for tnt and the integrated networks that are being put in place now but fred is right this was a devastating attack for a nation state that couldn t defend itself and businesses like ours and many others were impacted as well alan b graf executive vice president and chief financial officer brandon this is alan i just want since the questions is an important one i just feel like i need to weigh in as a cfo what you just the question you asked we talk about all the time we talk about it at the board level we talked it about at our smc s let me just add two things in the fourth quarter a year ago we were almost there i mean we express running on all cylinders and that was without tnt provide anything but a drag so i know we can do it i know we will do it i m disappointed that we haven t done it but i believe strongly that when we get the interoperability up and we get any kind of global trade environment that s reasonable that we will be successful with our international at express operator our next question will come from helane becker with cowen helane becker cowen company analyst thanks very much operator i appreciate the time fred what happens to the guangzhou hub in this whole china us trade situation if anything frederick w smith chairman and chief executive officer well there is a tremendous trade dispute going on between china and the united states as is reported almost hourly on the business tv stations but we ve been a good corporate citizen in china for decades and we are completely dedicated to compliance in china and we have expressed that to them and reinforced it so they ordered us in guangzhou and many other locations and probably there have been an increase in audits as a result of this to some degree but we ve cooperated fully with the china state post bureau and their investigation of the two misrouted packages and the erroneously returned package again we apologized to the customers they left our possessions we offered to make things right but that has nothing to do with china or huawei it has everything to do with the purple promise we would have done that for or any customer so our guangzhou hub is a huge part of the economy of the pearl river basin and so we hope there is not going to be any further deterioration in us china trade relations let me say again just because it s important for this audience to know about this request that we made of the d c circuit court on these export regulations what s really led us to do that at the end of the day wasn t huawei at all it was on last friday there were five new entities added with these extraordinarily opaque requirements and contrary to what you hear in the media we don t have to be complicit in this it s strict liability if you make a mistake if the department of commerce bis which stands for business and industrial bureau of industry and security they are empowered under their regulations not we think based on congressional law but on their own regulation who fine us or any other common carrier if what s been represented in that shipment even though we have a certificate saying that it comply 250 000 per package so i don t think that s what the intended and as mark said hopefully we re going to going to deal with them but that is separate and distinct from the huawei situation which was three packages out of a 15 million package per day so it s very difficult these days to keep this in perspective but we ve tried to do so and we ve got a great team in china karen reddington our president and eddy chan who runs china for us and our government affairs people so hopefully we don t have any issues there there certainly haven t been any operational issues to speak of operator our next question will come from bascome majors with susquehanna bascome majors susquehanna analyst yes hi thanks for taking my question here alan i was curious if you could tell us how much incentive comp helped the results in 2019 on absolute basis i know it was 350 million through the first three quarters of the year and how much would a target level be for that to fully come back and how much or how close to that target are you budgeting in the fiscal 2020 outlook thanks alan b graf executive vice president and chief financial officer hi bascome we re going to have an 8 k in july i don t think that s a too much of a strategic question the aic that we are forecasting for fy 20 is in the guidance i gave you and i would just leave it at that and follow up with ir later operator our next question will come from ken hoexter with bank of america merrill lynch ken hoexter bank of america merrill lynch analyst great hi good afternoon you noted the profit growth at ground incorporated to start up for sunday delivery and would still be up given the move of retailers for more next day delivery from walmart target amazon do you see a larger shift going from express i m sorry from ground to express packages and how does that change your dynamic and cost structure rajesh subramaniam president and chief operating officer so this is raj let me the reason we have now a full portfolio of services on transportation and other e commerce services is to cater to all the needs of retailers and e tailers as we go forward here so to your question when walmart talks about overnight for walmart where we are the service provider for that and we have lot of overnight volume for that if you need extra hours for target we provide that if you need local zone one ground delivery we have that service as well so my point here is that we have now a full portfolio of e commerce delivery services along with technology and returns and more to come as the chairman talked about that it is the most robust in the marketplace so it s really putting together the whole picture that we re trying to do here alan b graf executive vice president and chief financial officer hi ken alan what ground is working on and doing a great job of is lowering their cost structure dramatically we wouldn t be taking all the smartpost packages into our own network if it wasn t the fact that we can do it for a lower cost in the postage the postage is going to keep going up we re driving our cost down so that s an important phenomenon for you to understand secondarily again the customer decides time and distance is how we decide which network it goes into ground its asset it s double turning it s doing all kinds of things but it can t make a really late in the evening pickup for next day delivery or two day delivery of any kind of distance and that s where it goes to express so as raj was explaining to you we ve got networks to provide whatever the customer wants and that s important thing but i don t want to day to go by that people understanding ground is significantly lowering its unit cost and doing it a very rapidly operator and next we ll go to tom wadewitz from ubs tom wadewitz ubs analyst yes good evening and thank you for the question sticking on that topic i guess perhaps you could offer more color on what some of the actions are to significantly lower the cost structure in ground i guess my intuition is that in transportation density drives cost and it seems like the all in on e commerce you re doing a number of things that will help grow the business but could drive some dilution in your density just more b2c packages so i was just wondering if you could help us understand the offsets to some of the margin pressure and perhaps a little more on what you re saying alan in terms of really significantly lowering the cost structure in ground alan b graf executive vice president and chief financial officer i got it i got this one of course there is density and as fast as ground is growing as fast as packages are coming to them and the fact that we re sweating the assets more and with the technology and engineering expertise that we have which is world class we can handle a whole lot more traffic and a lot lower unit cost and that s a great place to be by the way as i want to iterate ground is faster on 25 on lanes net sometimes we get compared to over the peak season about how well we do versus the competition everybody forgets they re holding us to our own standards not what all the competition does that makes us one two or three days faster during peak season so i think we re in great place and that s why we re doing it operator and that does conclude our question and answer session today i would like to turn it back over to mickey foster for closing remarks mickey foster vice president of investor relations thank you for your participation in fedex corporation s fourth

vice president chief marketing communications officer and now fred smith will share his views on the quarter frederick w smith chairman and chief executive officer thank you very much mickey welcome to all joining our quarterly call fiscal 2019 was a year of both challenge and change for fedex we faced weakening international revenue growth driven by the slowdown in global trade the less favorable service mix of tnt express business after the notpetya cyberattack and continued rapid growth of e commerce demand we re very proud of our team members who are responding with positive actions and innovative solutions that will make fedex even stronger and more successful in the future fedex enters fiscal 2020 with a sharp focus on extending our lead as the premier global transport and logistics company and on making the necessary investments today to capture the significant market opportunities we see for the future these steps include enhancing fedex ground capabilities speed and efficiency improving fedex express hub automation particularly in memphis and indianapolis finishing the integration of tnt modernizing our aircraft fleet and reducing unit cost and increasing productivity especially for e commerce deliveries while these investments are long term in nature and their success cannot always be measured immediately we are confident they will drive significant earnings growth and improved margins and cash flows and returns for our shareholders over the long haul let me emphasize however that based on our current forecast of us gdp growth for fy 20 we anticipate fedex freight will increase earnings and margin over the period we believe fedex ground will increase earnings for the fiscal year with modest if any margin compression from current levels despite the investments we ve announced such as six and seven day per week delivery large package capabilities and in sourcing of smartpost global trade disputes and low global growth rates create significant uncertainty for the express business leading us to be cautious and projecting fy 20 earnings for this segment the integration of tnt is now progressing at a good clip and we will see significant benefits by this time in summer 2021 major focus of our investment strategy i should note is also improved sustainability and efficiency we intend to substantially grow our e commerce business and are well aware improved profitability in this market requires greater efficiency and delivering residential packages and we have sound initiatives to steadily improve our cost to serve this market with these ends for example we ve recently announced in sourcing 2 million smartpost packages and an agreement with dollar general for over 8 000 pickup and delivery on site locations in sparsely populated in rural areas over fy 20 we will announce several additional initiatives in this regard let me also caution observers who follow fedex in this industry to be very careful extrapolating past assumptions and trends into the future for instance we ve noted repeatedly short haul package delivery will become increasingly important as retailers ship e commerce orders from store or local fulfillment hence average yields have to be matched with operational changes not visible to most to access to assure potential future profitability also future developments and speeding up e commerce deliveries and postal reform which by the way we have supported will likely be discontinuities in the next several years fedex is uniquely positioned for long term success and will continue to deliver a great future for our customers care owners team members and the communities we serve let me now turn to raj followed by brie and alan and then a brief comment by mark allen and then we ll take questions raj rajesh subramaniam president and chief operating officer thank you fred and good afternoon as mentioned on the last call our focus is long term profitable growth that drives increased shareholder value fiscal year 20 is in many ways a transition year for fedex as we continue to reinvigorate our business to capitalize on e commerce growth and execute significant initiatives to reduce our cost to serve in the us alone we expect the parcel market to double in size to more than 100 million packages per day by 2026 as the market grows so too our abilities and offering capabilities and offerings our global network serves as the invisible backbone for the fast easy and reliable e commerce experience that consumers demand today and we continuously build upon our offerings to customers one way we are doing so is by strategically working with retailers to enable market leading value propositions this includes working with target to leverage their stores as local fulfillment centers through our fedex extra hours offering and giving our customers access to a multitude of fedex drop off and pickup services such as last week s announcement with dollar general these are just a few examples of the ways we continue to flex our operations and network to respond to our customers brie will cover these capabilities among others in more detail it is clear that we are all in on e commerce this commitment is illustrated by a number of key strategic initiatives well under way in our operating units just last month we announced a number of innovative solutions for our fedex ground network this includes seven day a week residential delivery rapidly integrating fedex smartpost volume into standard ground operations and enhancing network around large package handling these changes directly address some of the key challenges inherent with e commerce namely increasing consumer expectations and managing the cost for residential delivery bringing the smartpost volume into the ground network allows us to improve density and efficiency in the last mile deliveries it is significant that we are engineering and enhancing the ground network in such a way that it will be more cost effective to deliver millions of residential packages a day directly by fedex ground in fact we expect fedex ground to become the low cost last mile provider in the industry the recent round announcement should be particularly exciting to online consumers who purchase large items like furniture tvs and kayaks with the click of a button we expect to have a large package operation in nearly 40 ground facilities prior to our peak season the vast majority of these are existing facilities and this approach minimizes capex and enable us to focus on placing large package handling in the more strategic locations such as near ports and railroads not one element of this transformation will be possible without the investments that fedex ground has been making and continues to make in technology advancements in loading sorting and scanning technologies will provide near real time data it will help optimize operations for maximizing the use of rail improving delivery density and increasing the efficiency of handling all packages no matter the size these types of technological enhancement and state of the art tools are true differentiators and are being implemented all across the fedex operations not just fedex ground fedex freight for example is in the midst of modernizing an industry that has been historically paper based technology advancements like advanced forklifts computers electronic shipping labels and advanced driver assist systems allow our team members to work smart safer and more efficiently this evolution of automation that s a step for continued long term success at fedex express we are implementing initiatives focused on lowering our cost to serve in the us this includes rightsizing the network as we prepare for future growth to accommodate this growth we have launched multi year hub modernization efforts at two of our largest express hubs memphis and indi these investments will enable express to handle more volume more efficiently internationally the global trade picture is less than ideal but we are confident in our long term position we are rapidly moving forward with the integration of tnt as expected we began fy 20 with a global sales force that s 98 integrated positioning us with a single face to our customers in nearly every market worldwide we have recently completed on schedule the rollout of our capabilities to inject legacy fedex express into our european shipments into the tnt european road network we expect to be substantially complete with the operational integration by the end of fiscal year 20 this will allow interoperability between the tnt and legacy express networks and in turn results in faster service for customers at a lower cost beyond fiscal year 20 or work will continue with key initiatives including customer migration air network integration and product rationalization the various areas i ve touched on today position fedex to be future ready we are focused on the long term and i am humbled by the ongoing commitment dedication and innovation by our more than 450 000 team members around the world now i will turn it over to brie to provide more details on our macro view revenue quality and additional growth initiatives brie brie carere executive vice president chief marketing and communications officer thank you raj good afternoon everyone i ll open with our economic update and outlook and provide some commentary on broader industry trends and our growth priorities overall us economic growth is holding up well with real gdp growing 3 1 in the first quarter of calendar year 19 however the industrial sector has suffered from an inventory build up and increased trade tensions through may manufacturing output was 1 5 off its december peak for calendar year 19 we expect global economic growth to moderate as the developed world sees slower growth in both domestic and external factors weigh on emerging markets we expect services to continue to underpin global gdp growth global trade has slowed as trade frictions have exerted a negative impact on sentiment and of course the manufacturing sector as the chinese economy has continued to decelerate this has also impacted other asian markets export performance china s exports which grew almost 10 in 2018 have barely grown this year amid heightened trade tensions with the united states outlook for the european economies remain slow due to a number of sector and country specific factors such as disruptions in the auto manufacturing sector social tensions policy uncertainty as well as uncertainty related to brexit in germany and italy which are two important markets for us manufacturing output which turned negative in november has continued to decline with april manufacturing output down 3 5 and 1 9 year over year in germany and italy respectively as we have stressed before tariffs are counterproductive to efforts that encourage business growth and expand global trade thankfully however we have a large and flexible global network that allows us to adjust and meet our customers needs when trade issues present challenges in certain markets as i mentioned on the last call we remain laser focused on three key areas international e commerce and small business despite macroeconomic headwinds that i just covered our international commercial team is poised for growth sales integration as raj has mentioned is essentially complete our european network is more reliable and faster than it has ever been we have simplified our pricing structure and open the valve for e commerce within europe we ve also created new pricing programs for our asian team to sell into europe as well as from europe into asia this is the largest trade lane in the new world e commerce continues to be a driving force of total us domestic market growth we are building our portfolio networking capacity to best serve thousands of retailers in this space and we continue to differentiate for example with the launch of the fedex seven day service in 2020 fedex ground will deliver seven days a week year round for 80 of us gdp this is truly a transformational move that builds upon the largest global commerce transportation network in the world to further serve the growing e commerce market we are already faster than the competition by at least one day in 25 of the lanes this move will further speed up our network and allow us to continue to gain market share with the growth of e commerce and consumer demand for flexible safe and convenient delivery options fedex sought to provide unmatched access and create cost saving opportunities for customers the recently announced alliance with dollar general will provide access to fedex services in places that customers have told us are very convenient in their daily lives the alliance will provide more than 8 000 additional locations for customers to hold packages for pick up and drop off pre labeled packages including of course pre labeled returns further it will bring fedex closer to the consumer than we have ever been before within five miles of over 90 of the united states population once the dollar general rollout is complete the number of retail locations providing staffed fedex shipping will grow to over 27 000 we are incredibly excited that the access to fedex service continues to improve especially for e commerce recipients in more rural less populated areas of the united states this is a tremendous achievement not just an increasing access but also in creating cost saving opportunities for our customers and for fedex for instance by choosing to ship packages directly to convenient fedex retail locations merchants can reduce cost of residential delivery surcharges delivery to our retail location eliminates weather related damage or ports that helping to reduce customer service and replacement cost for retailers and for returns drop off at our retail locations result in higher pickup density and drive greater operational efficiency making fedex even more competitive in the returns market we have a great returns growth opportunity that our competitive retail network now opens up for us across all our priorities we continue to be very focused on revenue management while we see irrational pricing market e commerce will continue to put pressure on yields with lighter packages moving shorter distances it is important to note that contrary to the erroneous and misinformed reporting in the wall street journal on june 23 fedex has made no recent pricing changes no pricing changes to our strategy and we have certainly made no changes related to any one customer in fact at express we have experienced strong growth from small and medium customers using our fedex express two day product following a strategic pricing change we made last year and we anticipate the growth of this successful product to continue in fy 20 we are confident that our strategies will allow us to grow global volumes and revenues profitably now let me turn the call over to alan for his remarks alan alan b graf executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you brie and good afternoon everyone fedex express fourth quarter operating income declined as weakness in global trade and industrial production drove a decline in our international priority revenue year over year comparisons were also impacted by an 85 million gain on the sale of a non core business of tnt express last year to mitigate the weakness we have undertaken several immediate cost containment actions including significant reductions of variable incentive compensation limiting hiring and discretionary spending and completing our us voluntary employee buyout program approximately 15 000 fedex employees have left or will be voluntarily leaving the company via the us employee buyout program by the end of fy 20 approximately 85 of those employees departed on may 31 2019 we incurred costs of 316 million during the fourth quarter associated with our business realignment activities these costs related primarily to severance for employees who accepted voluntary buyouts business realignment activities including the voluntary employee buyout are expected to benefit fy 20 by approximately 240 million by eliminating open positions we expect to achieve our savings goal using less severance than we originally forecasted tnt integration expenses were 84 million for the fourth quarter and 388 million for fy 19 as you heard from raj we are continuing to make good progress with our integration activities at fedex ground we continue to see strong e commerce volume growth in the fourth quarter however fedex ground income and margins were negatively impact by increased purchase transportation rates and the january launch of year round six day per week operations fedex freight closed the year with another strong quarter despite weakening industrial production revenue per shipment increased 4 operating income increased 15 and operating margin improved to 9 9 below the line our non cash mark to market retirement plan accounting adjustment of a net 3 9 billion loss was driven by a substantially lower discount rate which contributed 1 8 billion through the loss changes in actuarial assumptions which significantly increased the liability and lower than expected asset returns fy 19 capital expenditures totaled 5 5 billion for fiscal 2020 we are targeting a mid single digit percentage decrease in adjusted earnings per share our performance has been negatively affected by continued weakness in global trade and industrial production as well as the near term impact of certain strategic decisions we have made to sustain our leading position in a changing marketplace at fedex express we expect earnings to be down in fy 20 due to weakness in international priority revenue and ongoing shift to lower yielding services our strategic decision to not renew the fedex express us domestic contract with amazon will also be a near term headwind which we expect to reverse to a positive in fy 21 as we replace the lost volume and optimize the network additionally we do not expect a significant benefit from the fuel surcharge table changes in fy 19 to repeat in fy 20 fedex express will continue to implement actions to reduce cost to serve improving efficiencies and adjusted to global network to match anticipated demand while we expect to make significant progress on tnt integration activities in fy 20 integration work will continue in fy 21 we expect to incur approximately 350 million of integration expenses in fy 20 and 1 7 billion in total through fy 21 at fedex ground we expect volume and revenue growth to remain very strong in fy 20 however operating margins will face headwinds from higher operating costs associated with expanding fedex ground delivery schedule improving our capabilities for large packages and other investments to significantly improve efficiency and safety as raj mentioned at fedex freight we expect continued improved performance as we remain focused on improving revenue quality inaudible technology solutions that will drive efficiency and further differentiate us in the ltl market our fy 20 effective tax rate prior to year end mark to market retirement plan accounting adjustments is expected to increase to 23 to 25 and will likely vary from quarter to quarter in addition our tax rate is very sensitive to international income which may cause the rate to vary from that range fy 20 capital spending is expected to be 5 9 billion these expenditures will include fedex express investments in aircraft and hub modernization fedex ground investments that increase our efficiency in handling large packages and investments in technology across the enterprise that will further optimize our networks and improve our competitiveness all of these targets assume moderate us economic growth current fuel price expectations and no further weakening in international economic conditions a further ramping in any trade measures and or adverse changes in international trade policies and relations would likely drive additional weakness in our business as i mentioned earlier a substantial decline in discount rates changes in actuarial assumptions and lower than expected asset returns negatively impacted our fy 19 mark to market adjustments with that our us qualified pension plan funded status declined to approximately 90 while we are not required to make a pension contribution fy 20 we are expecting to contribute 1 billion also we have funded large increases in our dividend and significant share repurchase over the last several years our stock buyback level is expected to be significantly lower in fy 20 and our dividend remains at 0 65 per quarter in conclusion management is focused on improving our near term performance while also positioning fedex for long term success while we are adjusting cost to mitigate macro uncertainties and address the growth of e commerce we will continue to invest in areas that expand our capabilities and improve our long term efficiencies we are confident these investments will drive long term earnings growth and improve margins cash flows and returns now let me turn the call back over to fred to introduce the topic mark allen is going to discuss frederick w smith chairman and chief executive officer thank you alan first before i do that let me take a point of personal privilege and mention something in the wall street journal article yesterday which i am uniquely qualified to speak to and it s the statement that i started the express unit four decades ago to ferry shipments like legal documents and medical supplies over long distances facts to the matter are that when fedex began operations it was specifically prohibited for private carriers to move documents in any type that was only permitted a number of years later when they were relaxation of the private express statutes in order to facilitate the fast movements of legal and financial documents and rather than medical supplies the company was basically put together to pick up transport and deliver first overnight for many address in the us to any other address in the united states technology packages which was the basic market that we were serving of course we then added two day express we expanded internationally added pallets and of course today we pick up and transport millions of items in the express business on a far larger scale at a far far lower price biggest issue on a go forward basis and the article goes on to say that the express unit was built for e commerce reality is it perfectly built for e commerce with the exception that we have to address as we ve said on several of the remarks here including mine that we have to be very efficient in delivering to residential making residential deliveries which are an increasing part of the traffic moving through both the ground and the express network so with that clarification let me turn now to the subject of the lawsuit that we filed yesterday there has been a considerable amount of misreporting on this as well number one as that is related to the huawei issue where we misrouted and then apologized for two packages and returned to the shipper erroneously a third the huawei packages were only peripherally involved in this lawsuit that we filed and in fact it goes back many many years which in the lawsuit itself and it concerns not contraband which many people have confused the lawsuit as concerning it concerns import and export controls as administered by the department of commerce so we worked very hard with all kinds of law enforcement agency as does the postal service and ups keep certain types of items out of our networks illegal drugs unlicensed firearms you could go down the list you can go and look at the prohibited items on our website the postal service this is not about prohibited items and contraband it is about regulations that the department of commerce administers which prohibit entities meaning companies or individuals from exporting or importing and that s quite different and in many cases they re either prohibited completely or they are restricted to various destinations or to various commodities or certain contents in turn that requires a common carrier like fedex when one of these entities is put on the list to in essence certify and in fact get a certificate from the shipper that basically lists ph what s in the package or in the in the shipment and that s the issue that we are that we are dealing with here i note that that secretary ross who i have known for four decades and respect and like a lot i m pained by the fact that he issued a statement that disagrees with our position in the litigation but as we told the department of commerce yesterday we certainly understand their job and their implementation of the trade policy of the administration this lawsuit doesn t speak to that at all it speaks to the issues that our general counsel will tell you about and after his remarks we won t have any further comments on this as we ll let the process play out in the courts but mark allen our general counsel will make a statement mark r allen executive vice president general counsel and secretary the action that we filed yesterday in the federal district court in dc request of the government be permanently enjoining from enforcing the export administration regulations against fedex in circumstances where we have no actual knowledge that the contents of a shipment are subject to the ears the bis takes the position that a common carrier like fedex can be held liable for shipments that do not comply with the export administration regulations without requiring any evidence that the carrier had any actual knowledge of an apparent violation we believe very strongly that the imposition of this sort of strict liability is a clear violation of our constitutional due process rights under the fifth amendment we cannot know the contents of the 15 million packages we handle daily and whether those contents comply with the complex ears by requiring us to police the contents of packages moving through our global networks the government is placing an unreasonable burden on a common carrier we have reached out to commerce to let them know of our commitment to compliance however we hope to reach an agreement on a common sense way forward that would be creating a safe harbor that essentially means if we have no knowledge of an apparent violation the bis will not come after us frederick w smith chairman and chief executive officer so now we ll take your questions and inaudible questions and answers operator operator instructions and our first question today will come from allison landry with credit suisse allison landry credit suisse analyst thanks good afternoon so you mentioned 2020 is a transition year for earnings and considering the bump in capex clearly it s going to be difficult for you guys to generate cash this year so i guess do you expect any positive cash flow and could you help us think through the the longer term cash generation of the business as you think about 2021 and 2022 thank you alan b graf executive vice president and chief financial officer allison this is alan yes i do expect improved free cash flow in fy 20 and as far as it s been a transitional year we i think explained it about as well as we could so i look forward to pass that i can t predict what s going to happen with trade tariff china g20 and brexit so if you just set that aside that turns out well or decent we got a lot of good guys and in 21 will have a seven day ground operation running full speed we ll have the benefits from a full tnt interoperability we ll have lower us fedex express rural and residential cost we ll have unbelievable improvement in ground productivity and growth and we ll have continued freight growth and improved productivity so i think once we get through 20 we are going to be in fantastic shape with the global macro hanging over as to our 5 9 billion the company wanted to spend upwards of seven we worked very hard to push up projects that i think will have good strategic returns but a lot of really good things didn t make the cut we have a lot of opportunities here particularly on the cost side and we re going to attack them aggressively operator our next question will come from chris wetherbee with citi chris wetherbee citi analyst hey thanks good afternoon it looks based on the guidance that you re calling for express to be down from a profit perspective maybe double digits wanted to get a sense if you could maybe break out some of the cross currents from trade and the macro and sort of what that impact might be on the core business and try to separate that out from some of the things that you re doing strategically with delivery as well as some of the late night pickups and maybe some of the strategic decisions you ve made around the customers any you can kind of parse out some of the details in sort of that guided weakness in express would be helpful alan b graf executive vice president and chief financial officer chris alan again what we re looking at right now as i just talked about in our fourth quarter at expressed where we had international priority revenue is actually down that s hard to that s hard to recover from in a very short period of time again i don t know what s going to play out here on trade and tariffs so there could be some upside for that but at the moment i m not seeing that our load factors coming out of asia ph are not really bad but the yields are that good and it could be better so i think the biggest issue is the macro on the as far as what s going on with express in the us it s doing fine i mean we had a great growth rate in our deferred traffic which we went after intentionally and we re going to get our cost structure in shape to improve the profitability of express for that as well so really it s the macro that s the biggest hangover for what we re looking at for fy 20 operator and next we ll go to jack atkins with stephens jack atkins stephens analyst hey good afternoon thank you for the time could you provide some more details around the steps that you re taking to in your words right size your operations to better handle e commerce do you foresee perhaps further changes in the business model in an effort to gain these efficiencies such as more closely integrating your ground and express operations thank you frederick w smith chairman and chief executive officer i don t recall who said right size did you raj oh optimize well this is smith here i said in my remarks that we had made a number of announcements i don t think anybody on this phone call knew a month ago that fedex was going to announce seven day a week service 8 000 dollar general locations insourcing 2 million smartpost packages building a number of large package annexes to exploit that business in ground and then all the other things that raj and brie mentioned to you so please recall in my remarks i basically said stay tuned that there we ll be telling you some other things during this fiscal year so we understand the issues involved in e commerce and residential delivery and raj made the point specifically we will be the low cost producer in the e commerce space for residential deliveries we re quite confident of that from many perspectives but we re not prepared to tell you some of these other moves anymore than we were prepared to tell you a month ago about the things that i just pushed it off but there will be other things that we will announce during fy 20 in this regard you can count on it operator our next question will come from scott group with wolfe research scott group wolfe research analyst hi thanks afternoon so alan is there any way you can help us think about maybe the quarterly cadence of earnings just now obviously we ve got some weak trends right now but then really tough incentive comps in the second half of the year any help there and then maybe just fred just following up on that is big picture are you are there reasons why we could potentially consolidate ground and express networks from a delivery standpoint and then any update you can give us on the international buyout potential alan b graf executive vice president and chief financial officer that was three scott so look as to cadence the tax rate is going to be really spotty i mean we ve got some a lot of assumptions that we have to prove and get through we re still looking at all these pages of interpretations and regs that are coming out it s left and right we re dealing with inaudible us from everybody that you follow and international is extremely complex so tax rate is going to be a factor in our quarter to quarter numbers don t be surprised by that secondarily again i just can t tell you what s going to happen from the global economic standpoint so that piece of it the cadence is going to be the cadence it s a little bit out of our control we ll manage to it but we don t want to do anything stupid and then not have the capacity that we need in the right place so we re watching that extremely carefully you asked ground they re going to have a great year i mean they really are i mean they re going to grow fast and if we re going to hold margins are get close to hold margins on this growth with all the expansion and all the investment that they re doing and improving productivity they re going to be really inaudible in 21 they re going to have a great consistent year so that s about all i can i can tell the other thing is that people forget that there is a reason that express has a two day service it s called distance when we need an airplane we need an airplane the customer really decides which network makes the delivery i think we ve explained this over and over and over again on the margin yes there s always opportunities but for the most part we ve got to fly when we have to fly but the customer can make that decision operator amit mehrotra from deutsche bank has our next question amit mehrotra deutsche bank analyst hi thanks for taking my question alan you made the comment i think in response to allison s question the free cash flow would be better in fiscal 20 i am wondering if you could just help put a finer point in that based on the macro assumptions that the company has made and related to that the 1 billion pension contribution the voluntary pension contribution i would imagine that that would be funded with new debt given the offsetting cash savings from the pbgc insurance premiums and then just related to that if you can discuss the incremental costs in fiscal 20 associated with the seven day delivery thanks so much alan b graf executive vice president and chief financial officer well there ll be some incremental costs associated with some of the delivery of course we ve been incurring them and we will continue to incur them but that now that we ve gone to six day the seven day leap ph is not nearly as significant so those won t be material but they probably will likely be a headwind but i have to say what i m hearing from my team is that the customers are lining up to get the seven day get the sunday service and we re going to do it very efficiently and i think we ll be able to start it in a very good way so again i m excited about what s happening in that regard operator our next question will come from david ross with stifel david ross stifel analyst yes good afternoon just back on the tnt integration expenses the total cost of 1 7 billion about double what initially was can you remind us what that additional expenses for and is there a difference between network integration which you said is going to be completed in the next year and network improvement or upgrade that need to be made to the tnt system alan b graf executive vice president and chief financial officer hi david alan again not double i will tell you a couple of things one is that we originally gave you a 400 million number about notpetya that s an old number that s never been updated but it continues to be a problem for us in terms of integration as we have to basically rebuild a system that tnt had and then integrate it with the network that we ve got on the purple side and it s cost us a lot more money and slowed it down and it s made it more complex the good news on that side is that the interoperability will be done by the end of the fiscal year and that s when we can start really harvesting the benefits of that low cost road network and flow the express packages through it seamlessly without all kinds of double handling and double packaging and everything else i mean i will let raj add to this rajesh subramaniam president and chief operating officer yes i ll just say that there has been tremendous momentum in the last literally in the last few months on tnt integration we have the vision of interoperability by the end of fiscal year 20 and ultimately one network for air and one network for ground it s a lot of value to be had here but what i want to say here is that we are not waiting to create value for the customers because of the customer value has been created as we speak we are speeding up lanes and our service levels are very good and with the demand is strong so i think we ve made a lot of progress and the significant value in this investment it will come to bear fiscal 21 onwards operator and next we ll go to david vernon with bernstein david vernon bernstein analyst hi question for you fred or raj on the portfolio obviously the expansion into the virtual kind of retail footprint with the partnerships with dollar general things like that is there a point where you may be look at the portfolio and say why do we still have the services business do you need that retail footprint do you ever get to a point where you kind of rethink the composition of that part of the business rajesh subramaniam president and chief operating officer i guess you re quite asking about the fedex office i think it plays a very important role as part of our retail network especially as we move forward on e commerce some of the premium value added services on hold location plus return services and there are several things that we process through the fedex office as unique and differentiated and the value is going to get even better as the e commerce trends increase i don t know brie if you want to add anything more to that brie carere executive vice president chief marketing and communications officer yes the only thing that i will add is obviously we re very excited about the expansion of our on site retail partnerships with walgreens and with dollar general the fedex office retail locations bringing in some of our most profitable small and medium business because the experience they get when they are shipping internationally and when they were shipping and they want the peace of mind of proper packaging that is absolutely just a stellar experience and those employees just deliver a great experience so we re very committed to that element of the portfolio rajesh subramaniam president and chief operating officer yes and don t forget these fedex office location the size of this fedex offices are really substantial and it s a very it s an excellent place to conduct call e commerce and as brie pointed out the most profitable packages for the fedex system comes through the fedex office network frederick w smith chairman and chief executive officer and we re expanding inside walmart stores which is becoming a great partnership and brie thanks for mentioning profitability i loved it operator our next question will come from brandon oglenski with barclays brandon oglenski barclays analyst hi good afternoon everyone and thanks for taking my question mr smith i really submit this question humbly as an analyst has never run a business but i guess at what point do we question the scale of the express network because we ve seen decade after decade of low returns low margins in peak economic activity you guys can t put in a pretty good return but you will never really crossing that threshold of covering the cost of capital and on the call today just looking at that the strategy is the same put more capital and optimize but not rightsize i guess why not a more radical look at the business i think someone suggests a look at integrating portions of express or ground or maybe even going more aggressively just on the overall footprint of the business can you talk to that please frederick w smith chairman and chief executive officer didn t you ask me the same question in the last analyst call or somebody else asked me a similar question look i the only way i can respond to that is obviously the plans and the programs we put in place were designed to create superior returns we didn t just decided to do it for the hell of it and it reminds me a little bit about that all adage of mike tyson that you know everybody has got a plan until they get hit in the mouth so one of the things that always amuses me about watching a lot of things that are written about fedex and so forth you know the competition has a vote and the economy has a vote so clearly we ve been very disappointed over the last few years with the assumptions that we made on the growth in international trade particularly with the trump administration the united states policy since 1934 with roosevelt and secretary of state cordell hull was to expand international trade and now we have a huge dispute where the united states is basically become protectionist defined as i ll make everything i need in my own borders i don t need to import things and quite frankly don t particularly need to export them despite the fact that 95 of the world s population is outside the united states so we have become a protectionist country we don t agree with the chinese position on trade either i ve been very vocal about that which is merchant ph dealers i would like to sell to you but i won t buy from you on a reciprocal basis so your question implies that we have sat around and you said quote for decades we don t look at the business as a single segment we ve said that over and over again you all deconstruct it into some degree i sort of added in that today by making an exception saying we expected freight and ground to have earnings increases and margin increases in freight and hopefully any compression in ground due to the expansion will be very small so clearly as we go forward and things change of if we don t resume any kind of international growth we would change our approach to the business we don t have any sacred cows here but you also have to remember in the express business as alan said our domestic express business is doing fine it s not the issue it s the international business that s having a problem for the reasons that brie and now i am saying to you good news is that if traffic and yields materialize the conversion rate to profitability is probably in the neighborhood of 60 because it s a network where the incremental volume goes to the bottom line faster than any of our other activities in the case of tnt i have to say i ve been amazed not just with the people who follow fedex in this industry with the amazing dis interest and notpetya attack it was the largest single attack by a state sponsored entity in the history of the world it has put the ukraine on its knees the only reason that it was less of a factor to us than it was because of the fantastic work of our it team that went and remediated it had it not been that tnt had been subsidiary of fedex the company would have been bankrupt it would you just gone out of out of business so clearly we should have sat and waited knowing notpetya was coming we could have picked up the pieces it would have been a lot easier on us so i think i m going to ask rob carter our cio give you a bit of color what he was giving me the other day about the notpetya account to my knowledge the only in depth article that s ever been written by i think it was in wired magazine and when you read that it s like oh my god this is one of the most under reported stories in history so to get to your point of course we want to make money in these networks and we will engineer and modify them to the extent that we need to but you ve got to remember those two things the anticipation of continue to embrace a free trade which was our assumption on building a lot of this stuff and then not assuming the notpetya things are the two exogenous factors we ve been dealing with so rob you want to comment on this robert barber carter cif co ceo executive vice president well this attack was a weapons grade attacked by russia on ukraine that utilized cyber tools that were built by the nsa and the us government and a group called shadow broker stole those tools and they were turned back on the ukraine and the devastation in ukraine just hasn t properly been reported all the airports were down all the trains were down hospital systems were lost the monitoring systems in chernobyl that monitor what is the most infamous nuclear plant in the world were lost if you looked at pictures that are on the internet of the kiev airport every single screen showing the red screen of death every point of sale terminal in the big grocery store showing the same thing every atm machine down in the country this was an amazing attack and we are thankful that our teams were certainly able to stop at the borders of tnt it didn t impact the fedex enterprise but the devastation in the tnt technology state was considerable to say the least the good news for today is that the state is running significantly better than it ever has with high degrees of reliability that are positively impacting service levels for tnt and the integrated networks that are being put in place now but fred is right this was a devastating attack for a nation state that couldn t defend itself and businesses like ours and many others were impacted as well alan b graf executive vice president and chief financial officer brandon this is alan i just want since the questions is an important one i just feel like i need to weigh in as a cfo what you just the question you asked we talk about all the time we talk about it at the board level we talked it about at our smc s let me just add two things in the fourth quarter a year ago we were almost there i mean we express running on all cylinders and that was without tnt provide anything but a drag so i know we can do it i know we will do it i m disappointed that we haven t done it but i believe strongly that when we get the interoperability up and we get any kind of global trade environment that s reasonable that we will be successful with our international at express operator our next question will come from helane becker with cowen helane becker cowen company analyst thanks very much operator i appreciate the time fred what happens to the guangzhou hub in this whole china us trade situation if anything frederick w smith chairman and chief executive officer well there is a tremendous trade dispute going on between china and the united states as is reported almost hourly on the business tv stations but we ve been a good corporate citizen in china for decades and we are completely dedicated to compliance in china and we have expressed that to them and reinforced it so they ordered us in guangzhou and many other locations and probably there have been an increase in audits as a result of this to some degree but we ve cooperated fully with the china state post bureau and their investigation of the two misrouted packages and the erroneously returned package again we apologized to the customers they left our possessions we offered to make things right but that has nothing to do with china or huawei it has everything to do with the purple promise we would have done that for or any customer so our guangzhou hub is a huge part of the economy of the pearl river basin and so we hope there is not going to be any further deterioration in us china trade relations let me say again just because it s important for this audience to know about this request that we made of the d c circuit court on these export regulations what s really led us to do that at the end of the day wasn t huawei at all it was on last friday there were five new entities added with these extraordinarily opaque requirements and contrary to what you hear in the media we don t have to be complicit in this it s strict liability if you make a mistake if the department of commerce bis which stands for business and industrial bureau of industry and security they are empowered under their regulations not we think based on congressional law but on their own regulation who fine us or any other common carrier if what s been represented in that shipment even though we have a certificate saying that it comply 250 000 per package so i don t think that s what the intended and as mark said hopefully we re going to going to deal with them but that is separate and distinct from the huawei situation which was three packages out of a 15 million package per day so it s very difficult these days to keep this in perspective but we ve tried to do so and we ve got a great team in china karen reddington our president and eddy chan who runs china for us and our government affairs people so hopefully we don t have any issues there there certainly haven t been any operational issues to speak of operator our next question will come from bascome majors with susquehanna bascome majors susquehanna analyst yes hi thanks for taking my question here alan i was curious if you could tell us how much incentive comp helped the results in 2019 on absolute basis i know it was 350 million through the first three quarters of the year and how much would a target level be for that to fully come back and how much or how close to that target are you budgeting in the fiscal 2020 outlook thanks alan b graf executive vice president and chief financial officer hi bascome we re going to have an 8 k in july i don t think that s a too much of a strategic question the aic that we are forecasting for fy 20 is in the guidance i gave you and i would just leave it at that and follow up with ir later operator our next question will come from ken hoexter with bank of america merrill lynch ken hoexter bank of america merrill lynch analyst great hi good afternoon you noted the profit growth at ground incorporated to start up for sunday delivery and would still be up given the move of retailers for more next day delivery from walmart target amazon do you see a larger shift going from express i m sorry from ground to express packages and how does that change your dynamic and cost structure rajesh subramaniam president and chief operating officer so this is raj let me the reason we have now a full portfolio of services on transportation and other e commerce services is to cater to all the needs of retailers and e tailers as we go forward here so to your question when walmart talks about overnight for walmart where we are the service provider for that and we have lot of overnight volume for that if you need extra hours for target we provide that if you need local zone one ground delivery we have that service as well so my point here is that we have now a full portfolio of e commerce delivery services along with technology and returns and more to come as the chairman talked about that it is the most robust in the marketplace so it s really putting together the whole picture that we re trying to do here alan b graf executive vice president and chief financial officer hi ken alan what ground is working on and doing a great job of is lowering their cost structure dramatically we wouldn t be taking all the smartpost packages into our own network if it wasn t the fact that we can do it for a lower cost in the postage the postage is going to keep going up we re driving our cost down so that s an important phenomenon for you to understand secondarily again the customer decides time and distance is how we decide which network it goes into ground its asset it s double turning it s doing all kinds of things but it can t make a really late in the evening pickup for next day delivery or two day delivery of any kind of distance and that s where it goes to express so as raj was explaining to you we ve got networks to provide whatever the customer wants and that s important thing but i don t want to day to go by that people understanding ground is significantly lowering its unit cost and doing it a very rapidly operator and next we ll go to tom wadewitz from ubs tom wadewitz ubs analyst yes good evening and thank you for the question sticking on that topic i guess perhaps you could offer more color on what some of the actions are to significantly lower the cost structure in ground i guess my intuition is that in transportation density drives cost and it seems like the all in on e commerce you re doing a number of things that will help grow the business but could drive some dilution in your density just more b2c packages so i was just wondering if you could help us understand the offsets to some of the margin pressure and perhaps a little more on what you re saying alan in terms of really significantly lowering the cost structure in ground alan b graf executive vice president and chief financial officer i got it i got this one of course there is density and as fast as ground is growing as fast as packages are coming to them and the fact that we re sweating the assets more and with the technology and engineering expertise that we have which is world class we can handle a whole lot more traffic and a lot lower unit cost and that s a great place to be by the way as i want to iterate ground is faster on 25 on lanes net sometimes we get compared to over the peak season about how well we do versus the competition everybody forgets they re holding us to our own standards not what all the competition does that makes us one two or three days faster during peak season so i think we re in great place and that s why we re doing it operator and that does conclude our question and answer session today i would like to turn it back over to mickey foster for closing remarks mickey foster vice president of investor relations thank you for your participation in fedex corporation s fourth

the communication to the market was plain and simple the official cash rate ocr remains at 1 5 percent given the weaker global economic outlook and the risk of ongoing subdued domestic growth a lower ocr may be needed over time to continue to meet our objectives 5 rbnz to play it by ear despite the tone struck by the rbnz the kiwi dollar lifted somewhat and rate cut expectations were slightly unwound following yesterday s rates decision it would seem the market read what was stated by the bank as being a trifle ambiguous yes interest rate cuts are likely needed to support the new zealand economy in the near enough future but when that happens precisely remains uncertain an august rate cut from the rbnz is still considered likely it must be said but the probabilities have been diminished with future employment and inflation figures the indicators the rbnz flagged as facing downside risks now taking on greater significance 6 us gdp data the economic calendar today will be highlighted by the final us gdp print for the quarter it s the last revision to the us growth data for the quarter so already in the market there is a fairly good feel for what the numbers may reveal it s expected to come in at what is quite a robust 3 1 per cent above trend in line with the preliminary estimate and only down 0 1 per cent from last quarter naturally the minutiae is what market participants will be perusing to get a feel on the trends evolving in the us economy especially given its assumed slow down 7 the fed is treading carefully the implications for markets from tonight s us growth figures will of course begin with what it says about the us federal reserve s monetary policy considerations right now interest rate markets are implying a relatively high chance that the fed will pull out a big 50 point rate cut at that central banks july 31st meeting the consequences of that have been huge it s pushed financial capital into stock markets tighten credit spreads and whacked the us dollar down and that s seemingly captured the fed s attention too with several fed speakers this week moving to deftly temper these expectations given their impact on financial markets 8 market watch asx futures down 12 points or 0 2 to 6557 near 7am aest aud 0 3 to 69 85 us cents on wall st dow flat s p 500 0 1 nasdaq 0 3 in new york bhp 1 4 rio 1 2 atlassian 2 1 in europe stoxx 50 flat ftse 0 1 cac 0 3 dax 0 1 spot gold 0 9 to us1410 01 an ounce at 2 58pm new york time brent crude 1 8 to us66 24 a barrel us oil 2 3 to us59 18 a barrel iron ore 2 8 to us117 63 a tonne dalian iron ore 2 7 to 817 yuan lme aluminium 0 3 to us1820 a tonne lme copper 0 9 to us5988 a tonne 2 year yield us 1 77 australia 0 94 5 year yield us 1 80 australia 0 97 10 year yield us 2 05 australia 1 28 germany 0 30 10 year us australia yield gap near 6 40am aest 77 basis points this column was produced in commercial partnership between the sydney morning herald the age and ig
by stephen s roach new haven blinded by a surging stock market and a 50 year low in the unemployment rate few dare to challenge the wisdom of us economic policy instant gratification has compromised the rigour of objective and disciplined analysis big mistake the toxic combination of ill timed fiscal stimulus aggressive imposition of tariffs and unprecedented attacks on the federal reserve demands a far more critical assessment of trumponomics politicians and pundits can always be counted on to spin the policy debate for us president donald trump and his supporters the art of the spin has been taken to a new level apparently it does not matter that federal deficits have been enlarged by an estimated 1 5 trillion over the next decade or that government debt will reach a post world war ii record of 92 per cent of gdp by 2029 the tax cuts driving these worrying trends are rationalised as what it takes to make america great again nor are tariffs viewed as taxes on consumers or impediments to global supply chain efficiencies instead they are portrayed as weaponised negotiating levers to force trading partners to change their treatment of the united states and attacks on the fed s independence are seen not as threats to the central bank s dual mandate to maximise employment and ensure price stability but rather as the president s exercise of his prerogative to use the bully pulpit as he and he alone sees fit there are three basic flaws with trump s approach to economic policy first there is the disconnect between intent and impact the political spin maintains that large corporate tax cuts boost us competitiveness but that does not mean deficits and debt do not matter notwithstanding the hollow promises of supply side economics revenue neutral fiscal initiatives that shifted the tax burden from one segment of the economy to another would have come much closer to real reform than the reduction of the overall revenue trajectory has moreover the enactment of fiscal stimulus in late 2017 when the unemployment rate was then at a cyclical low of 4 1 per cent headed towards the current 3 6 per cent added froth to markets and the economy when it was least needed and foreclosed the option of additional stimulus should growth falter similarly trump s tariffs fly in the face of one of the 20th century s greatest policy blunders the smoot hawley tariff of 1930 which sparked a 60 per cent plunge in global trade by 1932 with foreign trade currently accounting for 28 per cent of gdp versus 11 per cent in 1929 the us as a debtor country today is far more vulnerable to trade related disruptions than it was as a net creditor back then ignoring the cascading stream of direct and retaliatory taxes on consumers and businesses that stem from a tariff war trump extols the virtues of tariffs as a beautiful thing that is painfully reminiscent of the 1928 republican party platform which couched tariffs as a fundamental and essential principle of the economic life of this nation and essential for the continued prosperity of the country trump ignores the lessons of the 1930s at great peril the same can be said of trump s recent fed bashing the political independence of central banking is widely regarded as the singular breakthrough needed to achieve price stability following the great inflation of the 1970s in the us passage of the so called humphrey hawkins act of 1978 gave then fed chairman paul volcker the political cover to squeeze double digit inflation out of the system through a wrenching monetary tightening had volcker lacked the freedom to act he would have been constrained by elected leaders political calculus precisely what trump is doing in trying to dictate policy to current fed chair jerome powell the second critical flaw in trump s economic policy package is its failure to appreciate the links between budget deficits tariffs and monetary policy as the late martin feldstein long stressed to the extent that budget deficits put downward pressure on already depressed domestic saving larger trade deficits become the means to fill the void with surplus foreign saving denial of these linkages conveniently allows the us to blame china for self inflicted trade deficits but with tariffs likely to divert trade and supply chains from low cost chinese producers to higher cost alternatives us consumers will be hit with the functional equivalent of tax hikes raising the risk of higher inflation the latter possibility though seemingly remote today could have important consequences for us monetary policy provided of course the fed has the political independence to act finally there are always the lags to keep in mind in assessing the impact of policy while low interest rates temper short term pressures on debt service costs as budget deficits rise there is no guarantee that such a trend will persist over the longer term especially with the already elevated federal debt overhang projected to increase by about 14 percentage points of gdp over the next 10 years similarly the disruptive effects of tariffs and shifts in monetary policy take about 12 18 months to be fully evident so rather than bask in today s financial market euphoria politicians and investors should be thinking more about the state of the economy in late 2020 a timeframe that happens to coincide with the upcoming presidential election cycle in assessing how current policies are likely to play out there is nothing remarkable about a us president s penchant for political spin what is glaringly different this time is the lack of any pushback from those who know better the national economic council nec established in the early 1990s as an honest broker in the executive branch to convene and coordinate debate on key policy issues is now basically dysfunctional the nec s current head larry kudlow a long standing advocate of free trade is squirming to defend trump s tariffs and fed bashing the republican party long a champion of trade liberalisation is equally complicit trump s vindictive bluster has steamrolled economic policy deliberations ignoring the lessons of history rejecting the analytics of modern economics and undermining the institutional integrity of the policymaking process policy blunders of epic proportion have become the rule not the exception it will not be nearly as

call over to randy randy baker president and chief executive officer thanks bolens good morning everybody today we re going to start on slide 3 our third quarter was one of the best results in many years and i m very pleased with the performance of the businesses but before i review the results i d like to provide an update on our strategy progress our initiatives to improve organic growth are paying off the industrial tools services segment grew by 8 in the quarter this was a direct result of the efforts to improve our sales effectiveness and bring new products to the market our service sales grew at an impressive rate in the quarter which was benefiting from extended projects in the middle east and north sea as we recall we announced a restructuring program in our second quarter earnings call to improve efficiency reduce our cost base and prepare for the next phase of our strategy the combination of enerpac hydratight and the corporate structure are the area of focus which are well under way we expect to see the benefits of our efforts as we enter our new fiscal year from a capital deployment perspective we are maintaining strict discipline relative to our strategy our top priority remains investing in organic growth efforts while maintaining a clear perspective on strategic acquisitions we have built a good pipeline of perspective tool companies which will extend our existing product lines and provide new technology to enerpac from a portfolio perspective the enerpac i m sorry the sale of the engineered components systems segment is continuing and we will provide more updates as become available secondly we have made decisions to retain the cortland industrial rope and medical component business we believe we can further improve and grow the company to maximize shareholder value the industrial rope segment has the potential to serve a wider variety of customers through the utilization of the enerpac channel and the medical component business is growing fast with a very attractive profit margin now turning over to slide 4 as i mentioned earlier we had a we are very pleased with results in the third quarter core sales grew by 3 comprised of an outstanding result from enerpac of 8 while moderate decline from ecs segment of 2 adjusted operating profit grew by 18 driven by 280 basis points of margin expansion as i stated in the past our target industrial tools services operating leverage is between 35 and 45 which was exceeded in the quarter while ecs sales declined in the quarter the team was able to expand margins through cost reduction and price realization as a real result eps grew by 15 in the quarter to 0 45 a share which was the top of our guidance range and the best earnings since 2015 from a financial leverage standpoint we improved to 1 8 which is a substantial progress over prior year and places actuant in a very healthy position overall the third quarter was a great result and i m proud of our global team for the effort to deliver on the commitments conditions and improve the company now turning over to slide 5 the third quarter was very active for new product launches and new platform wins enerpac tool launched nine new product families in the quarter and is now making great progress toward the 10 product development sales goal the new e pulse hydraulic pump is a revolutionary design for all applications from lifting to bolting with a completely new drive system the new e pulse pump provides a true competitive advantage and sets a new standard in the marketplace secondly our lifting group has released a highly creative cube jack system capable of 50 tons in a very compact design this new system provides greater flexibility in a highly transportable package on the engineered components systems side our team won 10 new product platforms in the quarter and has reached a new level of product vitality of greater than 15 the new platform includes display systems hydraulic tools and new drive line applications our push to have a higher degree of product vitality has lessened the impact of market cyclicality overall we re very pleased with the progress of becoming a truly innovative company so moving on to slide 6 our capital allocations priorities have not changed we believe investment in ourselves to maximize organic growth is the highest priority secondly as you noted from our improved financial leverage we will continue to maintain a strong balance sheet and reduce debt as i mentioned strategic acquisitions which support our tool company strategy are our priority however our ability to acquire and operate to improve the value of the company must be maintained we have built an active list of potential acquisitions which must meet our financial and operational hurdles including comparison with share repurchase additionally all acquisitions must support the extension of our tool product line and provide technology which gives enerpac a competitive advantage i m going to turn the call over to rick now to go through the details on the quarter and i ll come back with a market update and guidance rick dillon executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks randy and good morning everyone so before we get into our third quarter report let s quickly look at the one time items on slide 7 we recorded a net 9 million benefit from the impairment divestiture and other charges 11 million of the benefit is related to the decision to retain the quarterly us business including an accounting adjustment for certain translation losses and depreciation and amortization this benefit is partially offset by divestiture costs related to the ecs process tax reform and other charges relates to the acceleration of debt issuance costs and 3 million of additional tax expense related to the reevaluation of certain tax credits as a result of law changes given tax reform so let s get into our third quarter results we turn to slide 8 core sales increased 3 this was offset by the 6 impact of divestitures in the quarter and a 4 headwind from the stronger dollar adjusted operating profit showed continued year over year improvement of 280 basis points with incremental profitability in both its and ecs our adjusted effective income tax rate was approximately 15 for the quarter in line with our expectations our full year effective tax rate is still expected to be approximately 20 and our fourth quarter rate is expected to be in the mid to upper 20 s similar to our second quarter adjusted eps for the second quarter was 0 45 compared to 0 39 last year and at the top end of our guidance range we turn into slide 9 total core sales at 3 was in line with our guidance in the mid single digits range as continued strong growth of its was partially offset by a sales decline of ecs its segment sales continue to be strong with core sales up 8 product sales continue to be solid and service growth in the middle east and north sea was much stronger than our expectations in ecs the modest decline in core sales resulted from reduced demand in off highway truck north america frac and china while european truck is stable i ll provide more color on core sales in a minute when we discuss the individual segment results turning to slide 10 for a summary of our top line performance our 3 consolidated core sales growth was driven by a 9 million improvement from volume and price its volume grew by 9 million and it was partially offset by reduced ecs volume currency headwinds reduced sales by approximately 11 million or 4 as did the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures which was 20 million or 6 now let s look at both adjusted operating profit and adjusted ebitda on slide 11 our trend of improving year over year operating profit margin has continued this quarter improvement from pricing actions and its core volume increases provided the greatest positive impact in the quarter an unfavorable product mix and under absorption in both segments was partially offset by the benefit of the elimination of the losses from the heavy lifts products in the prior year as with the case last quarter tariffs in the quarter were approximately 2 million and in line with our expectations we continue to believe that our pricing actions were sufficient to cover commodity and other inflationary increases including tariffs but we are watching closely how the current trade and tariff discussions advance any further tariff impacts would likely need to be covered in the form of surcharges our objective remains to prevent margin erosion due to inflationary cost pressures and as expected sae expenses also improved year over year primarily driven by reduced incentive compensation expense now move on to the segment details starting with the its segment on slide 12 core its sales increased by 8 year over year which is the fifth consecutive quarter of consolidated core growth and the seventh consecutive quarter of core product sales growth in the segment core product sales were up mid single digits with substantially all regions experiencing growth and led by north america this reflects the continued benefits of our investments in npd and commercial effectiveness the biggest driver of our growth in the quarter was the 23 core sales improvement in our service business specifically in the middle east and north sea third quarter is our seasonally strongest service quarter due to planned maintenance shutdowns however the upside we experienced in the quarter was attributable to scope additions to a number of large plant shutdowns emergency repairs and higher work level has been normal during ramadan incremental profit flow through on the solid product growth in north america and the significant service growth drove the 24 ebitda margin and is a testament to the strength of our its business and our opportunities to drive growth and profitability as we execute our strategy of becoming a pure play premier industrial tool company if we look at slide 13 before we move on to ecs i want to spend a few minutes on the its restructuring program as well as the drivers of the its fourth quarter projections which randy will cover shortly as you mentioned earlier its has begun to implement the restructuring program we announced earlier this quarter the key areas of focus include repositioning our north american service business to align with our future growth strategy specifically our service structure and resources will be focused on high value and added services high value added services such as joint integrity specialty machining and high margin bolting we had built a service organization that s not only focused on specialty service but also commodity type service which comprised historical profit margins while we expect to see reduced service sales in north america in the near term we spent to see an immediate improvement in profitability our new operating structure will also allow us to put more focus on growing our products and rental products to both our service and distribution networks as we invest in and grow our rental and specialty service business we will see incremental core sales and even greater profitability in the region in addition as we finalize the integration enerpac of enerpac and hydratight our general its structure will be a focus and may include de emphasis of certain product offerings that while small have negative impacts to our overall profitability we continue to expect to achieve 12 million to 15 million annual savings with one time restructuring costs of 15 million to 20 million we already discussed the 1 million of cost that came during the q3 and the rest of the costs coming in q4 and early 2020 with that as we look ahead to expectations for its as we finish the year i thought it would be helpful to frame the impact on the quarter from normal seasonality as well as restructuring in the fourth quarter from a product perspective our core tool sales growth is expected to continue to be steady in the mid single digits supported by new product introductions that will offset will be offset by roughly 3 million of heavy lift product sales that came during q4 2018 which will not repeat this year due to our focus on standard product offerings additionally as just discussed our restructuring activities focused on de emphasizing lower profit and unprofitable service product line service and product lines will result in some incremental near term top line reductions q4 is our seasonally slowest service period due to our customers maintenance schedules this combined with the completion of the large projects we saw scope expansions on earlier in the year will result in the decline in sales from the quarterly sequential trend this year what this means for its in the fourth quarter is the top line growth projection of 1 to 4 again while down from our run rate this year our expectation for quality growth in our core products and service business have not changed however we will see some puts and takes as we execute our strategy on service and product going forward turning now to ecs on slide 14 core sales declined by 2 in the quarter the divestiture of cortland fibron and precision hayes reduced year over year sales by 21 million or 14 and the stronger dollar reduced sales by 3 resulting in an overall reduction of 19 the core sales decline of 2 was the result of the challenges in the ag market due to exceptionally cool and wet spring and its impact on the planting season as well as reductions in north american north america frac and china truck and as stated earlier european truck is stabilizing cortland us sales were flat to prior year as ropes and cable sales were down year over year but that was offset by very solid growth in our medical business profit margins in the segment increased year over year primarily as a result of pricing spin control and a reduction in incentive compensation expense given the expected market softness we ll be taking actions in q4 within the ecs business to reduce costs and drive efficiencies we expect these restructuring actions to generate approximately 3 million in annual savings with a cost of approximately 2 million if we turn now to liquidity on slide 15 we generated 44 million of cash during the quarter in line with our seasonal patterns and our projected growth in cash in the third quarter working capital was a positive year over year as the accounts receivable built at the end of q2 was collected as expected and reduced inventory as well in q3 of 2018 we received a large tax refund of 17 million that did not repeat this year and resulted in one of the larger year over year impacts to cash flow we now have or expect full year cash flow to be in the range of 62 million to 70 million down from the previous guidance of 80 million to 85 million the decrease is attributable to the anticipated cash restructuring costs in the fourth quarter an effort to normalize inventories in our ecs segment ahead of new platform launches aggravated by the anticipated decline in sales in the fourth quarter and a delay of one platform launch until fiscal 2020 we re also seeing incremental capex including the acceleration of certain ecs projects in anticipation of a divestiture we ended the quarter with 200 million of cash on hand during the quarter we renegotiated our term loan and revolving credit facilities to provide greater flexibility in anticipation of an ecs transaction and to support the execution of our strategic plan going forward as we close the credit facility our term loan balance was 200 million and we have since paid down an incremental 10 million with excess cash leverage measured by net debt to pro forma ebitda took another step down and now sits at 1 8 times versus 2 6 times in q3 of 2018 the combination of the reduction in leverage and the new credit facilities provides us with significant flexibility to execute on our strategic plan with that i will turn the call back over to you randy randy baker president and chief executive officer thanks rick let s move over to slide 16 the general economic drivers remain largely unchanged from our second quarter us economic growth is flattening while euro area has experienced sequential decline our recent dealer visits have revealed a consistent message of continued growth in industrial tools segment driven by good retail activity our enerpac deals are reporting stable inventory conditions but are feeling the impact of pricing resulting from the ongoing tariff almost all of our 14 vertical markets are experiencing moderate growth which is projected to continue through the fourth quarter service activity continues to be strong in the middle east and other energy markets in the off highway mobile equipment marketable both ag and construction equipment producers are balancing their wholesale to retail activity as a result the new equipment production orders will decline through the fourth quarter but is expected to rebound quickly on highway sales in china have declined while the european truck market is more stable now turning over to slide 17 our core sales growth expectations for the full year have changed we are increasing our outlook for industrial tools service segment the fourth quarter sales is projected to be in the 1 to 4 range and the full year projection is to be in the 6 to 7 range this is a direct result of the stronger than expected service and the continued growth in the tools engineered components systems is projected to decline in the fourth quarter by 7 to 11 and the full year is we ll see a decline of between 2 and 3 the combination of increasing tools and service sales with the declining engineered components system resulted in a full year core sales outlook of between 2 and 3 and moving on to slide 18 in the guidance full year guidance will be adjusted to 1 125 billion to 1 135 billion which reflects divestitures currency impact in the lower ecs sales conversely we are increasing our full year eps range of between 1 15 and 1 21 with an effective tax rate of approximately 20 free cash flow will decrease to 62 million to 70 million and for the fourth quarter we expect a range of 265 million to 275 million with an eps of 0 25 to 0 31 per share and before i turn it over to the operator i just want to reiterate that we are in the cusp ph of building one of the finest tool companies in the world the company has proven it can grow its sales coverage it can increase its product development and the result is creating a truly innovative and growing company and we are very very proud to be part of that so with that operator i m going to turn it over to you for questions questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from the line of mig dobre with r w baird please proceed joe grabowski robert w baird analyst good morning guys it s joe grabowski on for mig this morning rick dillon executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning randy baker president and chief executive officer good morning joe grabowski robert w baird analyst good morning could maybe expand a little bit more on the decision to retain the remaining cortland businesses and kind of what changed from maybe last quarter when those businesses were part of the businesses could be divested randy baker president and chief executive officer so as you know we have been preparing for the divestment process for a long time where we ve created a component business comprised of the ecs company and separated from that we sold phi and the cortland fibron which was the offshore oil and gas division which was focused heavily on upstream which we know was has been stressed and then that was placed last year so the question is what about cortland which is comprised of a industrial rope manufacturer and a very very high quality medical component manufacturers as we look through that and its ability to grow margins to an accretion level greater than or equal to enerpac we found that value and that creation possibility was there so what we wanted to do is to really bring that business back into the full and then really proactively market the lifting assembling equipment back to enerpac which we ve already branded a significant number of our ropes and assemblies as an enerpac product and many of our distributors specialize in heavy lifting apparatus whether it s cranes spreading equipment or shackles or other components so it fits quite well with that so we believe we can create more shareholder value by growing that and then secondly by focusing on our med business which has an extraordinary margin profile the combination of those two things we think we can build a very very nice business joe grabowski robert w baird analyst got it okay makes sense thanks for the color my follow up i guess the ec s core sales guidance around 7 to 11 in the fourth quarter can you maybe break it down give a little more thought on which end markets are driving that and maybe specifically within that wondering if you re seeing any strength in ag related businesses or maybe improvement in ag related businesses with the elevated corn prices we ve seen recently thank you randy baker president and chief executive officer okay so covering the components of ecs fourth quarter one of the primary drivers is one of our new platform wins which is a truck manufacturer in europe has a one quarter delay on the launch of a sizable piece of business so it s not a structural change to the business it s the delay of the start of a major project which has a multi year impact to the company so that s painful but it s part of being component manufacturers you could see differences in when the production changeovers for either model years or new product will launch and that s a big chunk of that secondly we ve seen softness in china and so as we push harder to get more customers in china to offset that we re going to see it in the short term on the ag industry as you know i spent a lot of time in the ag industry and have a fairly good understanding of the dynamics when you see major manufacturers constraining their wholesale plan and taking down their dealer stock it creates a very very nice environment in a very short period of time because the availability of product is won t be there as we enter into the new fiscal year so on the corn price if you look at the stock to use ratio and then you also think about what the lower planted acres and the lower yields do to the late start it s going to drive the corn price up so certain farmers and certain parts of the united states are going to see a very high windfall on their corn price which should create some nice sales activity so that s why we believe in the off highway ag market the reset should be short lived because i can see great discipline from the three primary producers on constraining their inventory joe grabowski robert w baird analyst got it okay thanks for taking my questions operator thank you our next question comes from the line of jeff hammond with keybanc please proceed patricia gorman keybanc capital markets analyst hey this is trish on for jeff so looking at your fourth quarter guidance for it s up against tough tools comp and with the early completion of service projects last quarter can you talk more about where you re seeing strength in kind of what s driving the upgraded outlook for the segment randy baker president and chief executive officer for tools specifically patricia gorman keybanc capital markets analyst yeah for it s randy baker president and chief executive officer yeah so as rick mentioned he walked through that in a lot of detail on one of the slides but where the real strength continues is in our tool platforms new product launches very healthy 14 vertical markets that are still seeing nice growth dynamics so on the standard tool products we still see really good things going forward as you know a year ago we made a conscious decision to stop doing highly specialized and in many cases highly risky and low margin construction projects many of them were large and many of them from a margin standpoint either lost money or had very low margin we ve consciously stopped that so in our fourth quarter we anniversary some of those projects and so as rick said that s about a 3 million takeout on a year over year basis which mutes the overall product component of our its outlook but you still see nice growth rates from the composite number and then on the service side as rick also mentioned our service it has lumpy aspects to it as we do larger projects the customer may time to time ask us to extend those projects and keep people on job sites and that creates a nice windfall force which we saw in q3 and in q2 and which bump that growth rate up significantly so what we re guiding for our fourth quarter we think is a very very stable number it reflects the benefit of a great tool company and as we raise the full year guidance for the tool business it reflects the full run rates from the full year so we re extraordinarily pleased with the 6 to 7 to 8 growth rate for the business it s it far exceeded our expectations and when you see the ebitda margin in the quarter of more than 24 there are very few companies in the world that have that kind of type of margin profile which again is why we are so thankful to have this quality of the business and why we re focusing on that for the future patricia gorman keybanc capital markets analyst okay great and then just on ec s given what you re seeing out of your end markets does that change the way you re thinking about that about the sale process at all randy baker president and chief executive officer could you repeat the question i m not sure i don t want to answer the wrong thing for you patricia gorman keybanc capital markets analyst yeah so just looking at ec s given some of the softening end markets is that impacting how you re thinking about the sale at all randy baker president and chief executive officer well no we always have looked at this as a strategic move for the company and as we said we haven t given a lot of information about the process and that s by design but we re very very committed to it we know what s the right thing for our long term improvement in the value of the company from the ecs standpoint the key elements of that business is we ve done a great job of developing a new platform win rate that is far exceeding the past and i think that s a tremendous element of the business because when you we ve got a product vitality north of 15 you re bringing in brand new customers every single quarter it will lessen the impact of cyclicality and that s an important piece if you re going to be in the component industry so we re still very committed to the process and we think it s the best long term decision for the company patricia gorman keybanc capital markets analyst okay great thanks guys operator thank you our next question comes from the line of ann duignan with jp morgan please proceed ann duignan jp morgan analyst hi good morning ann duignan here randy baker president and chief executive officer good morning ann ann duignan jp morgan analyst good morning lot of my questions have been answered but maybe you can talk a little bit about i think you mentioned that mix was a negative in both the segments could you just expand on that rick dillon executive vice president and chief financial officer i think from a its perspective it s just the overweighted service in the quarter and really for the year versus our original guy from the ecs perspective it s just specific products including some of the new products until we get to the appropriate run rate so both of them experience a little bit of a mixed drag versus the original guy ann duignan jp morgan analyst okay and then you talked about how services had surprised due to the upside is there any risk that we ve now just created more of a deep hole going into fiscal 20 that these services some of the work was pulled forward and that you have tougher comps and no visibility if you just like talk about the say outlook for services in it s randy baker president and chief executive officer yeah i think that you re always going to have lumpy spots within any fiscal year and service particularly when you have large project build that you re on they always do sort of reoccur i mean in 2016 we saw some very big ones that were in the 20 million plus those are tough to reoccur but the ones that are of the medium size they can create a nice windfall in a quarter but it s something that our teams are constantly pushing as part of once you get on a job site you want to try to sell your services going forward because the mobilization fees the customers paid are have already been paid so there s a there are benefit to any petro chem site or transfer terminal wherever we re doing the work so i don t see it as a big problem going into next year you may have some tough comps from quarter to quarter but we still see the focus on high quality and high margin service the primary objective and as you know our the element of service in the tool group in the enerpac tool company is actually a relatively small piece of the overall picture if you think about our product sales that is a very very high percentage which is also includes the rental business that we have that s more than 80 of all the sales we do and that s why the margins are so spectacular is when you have that type of a business so i don t see it as a major problem for us ann rick dillon executive vice president and chief financial officer so you will see as we talked about as we start to be de emphasize some of this commodity type services the restructuring is around north america but the de emphasis is global you will see some top line pressure but to randy s point these weren t the kinds of projects we saw in 2016 these were larger longer tenured products that gave us some opportunities for upside then we will have projects like that and we normally do have projects like that just unplanned maintenance and we expect that going forward but our product and rental product growth will certainly outpace service and result in higher profitability going forward ann duignan jp morgan analyst and just as a point of clarification could you just services at some point do you expect them to be margin neutral to the segment i mean is there can you ever get the service margins to the famous product in i ll leave it there thank you randy baker president and chief executive officer yeah the service margins are always going to be a lower component of the things we do but one of the elements of having a great service team in the field is they re your eyes and ears on job sites that help you market your tools these are rental or new equipment and so when we go to a job site we go with enerpac tool and that is a great way to market the products that we intend to sell there are certain types of service especially in joint integrity is highly technical and it s a differentiator as a business so we like that sort of thing it will have higher margins because we provide more than just labor but when it s pure labor for hire it ll never be equal to the product sales ann duignan jp morgan analyst okay perfect thank you i appreciate the color randy baker president and chief executive officer thanks ann operator thank you our next question comes from the line of justin bergner with g research please proceed justin bergner g research analyst good morning randy randy baker president and chief executive officer good morning justin bergner g research analyst good morning rick rick dillon executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning justin bergner g research analyst my first my first question relates to free cash flow would you be able to bridge the old free cash flow guidance to the new free cash flow guidance across some of the major buckets you highlighted earlier in the call rick dillon executive vice president and chief financial officer i wouldn t be able to quantify those major buckets because we generally don t but in terms of what s driving it as i said it s restructuring costs which we ve actually given what we anticipate in the fourth quarter by way of cash restructuring there s a little bit of overall guidance there s a little bit of capex that is in anticipation of a divestiture and maybe that weren t planned to be complete entirely in 20 and then we had the inventory levels and so ecs inventory levels particularly are up and with the delayed project they are up and the capex is primarily flat justin bergner g research analyst thank you that s helpful my second question relates to the restructuring detail you provided today i m just trying to clarify is that restructuring associated with the restructuring with it s becoming its own sort of independent business after the sale of ec s sort of what you referred to on the last call or is that actually not so much corporate restructuring but it s specific restructuring operations with a further plan to follow on removing overhead if and when you sell ec s rick dillon executive vice president and chief financial officer so as we said on the last call it s a combination first of all its as a stand alone company you got to see the lines between what s corporate and what its business are and so we talked about earlier some of the north america service things that we re doing including infrastructure which would be in that corporate vein and then we talked about some of these enerpac hydratight merger structural changes that we are doing and again those in a stand alone which fall in that corporate cost bucket in addition to that like we talked about last quarter we re going we re in the process of continuing to evaluate our corporate organization in order to make sure we are efficient post transaction and that we have an overall cost that will allow us to sustain a 20 ebitda margin or consolidate business of course that will require some of those costs will transform or reduce naturally with a transaction others will require actions and as we get closer to a transaction and better clarity we will be announced and potentially future actions to achieve that goal justin bergner g research analyst thank you i ll hop back in the queue operator thank you our next question comes from the line of deane dray with rbc capital markets please proceed jeff rbc capital markets analyst good morning this is jeff ph on for deane my question is given the recent volatility in oil prices could you comment on the tool segment s sensitivity to oil and additionally could you just remind us the breakdown of upstream versus midstream and downstream exposure of the tool segments specifically randy baker president and chief executive officer sure the main thing with oil is it seeing multiple years of structural change and so for the north american onshore you can tell by the rig counts have come down and so the north american sales into onshore has definitely tempered a bit and you can see that in our torque tension sales in north america and i think a lot of our distributors would speak to that fact that they ve seen slower sales activity or slowing sales activity it s been quite good but it s just not as booming as it was a year and a half ago offshore is primarily focused on maintenance of existing assets either in the gulf or in the north sea and has continued to be strong because they have to maintain those assets now if you re doing offshore drilling that s a totally different thing and we don t participate a lot in offshore drilling anymore by design and then as i mentioned and mid east has been quite active we ve seen double digit growth in service as well as some of our product sales categories in the mid east have done quite well so the volatility in the pricing does create some short term change in how people think about investment and capex but the beauty of where we play is mid to down and so we stay away from upstream particularly as i mentioned a couple of years ago we consciously exited the upstream oil gas which includes well development exploration because that s where that volatility in pricing becomes very dramatic to a company so today we feel that the price where it s been setting is conducive to good maintenance activity and it s good to investment in new tools many of those tool activities come as a general maintenance manager purchase decisions so it doesn t go in front of a capex committee so things have been quite good and i think that s going to stay that way for a while jeff rbc capital markets analyst okay great that s very helpful and then just to follow up is there any intention to kind of focus your m a activities outside of energy or is it kind of just it s next in the group kind of at the same percentage as your end markets randy baker president and chief executive officer yeah so just to clarify we won t focus any attention in the energy area for m a are a 100 of our activity for m a is directed toward tool companies as i ve mentioned before to a lot of our investors we look at several distinct categories of tools and ones that bring either a technology that we need for enerpac or opens up a brand new market or a region that helps us grow as a tool company so you can rest assured that our capital investment relative to m a will be focused of developing a world class tool company and we will not deviate out of that and as i mentioned in my commentary it will follow very strict guidelines on the quality of the company the returns how well can we own and operate it and we will always compare it with the value of a share buyback rather than an investment in m a all of those hurdles meeting the criteria then we proceed jeff rbc capital markets analyst fantastic thank you operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from line of stanley elliott with stifel please proceed brian brophy stifel analyst hi good morning this is brian brophy on for stanley i had a question on its can you give us some more color on what s driving the strength in the middle east randy baker president and chief executive officer well there s a lot of assets in the middle east there s there are so many large refineries there that need to be maintained and the mid east for us is broken into a couple of large markets obviously it s our traditional markets in saudi uae and areas where there s a lot of assets that are being maintained but also we re in the caspian and north africa and other places that typically as we characterize middle east people don t think about caspian has been quite good for us and as you remember we made an acquisition that extended what we do in service from not just joint integrity and pipeline services but also pipe perhaps in cleaning systems and services which added quite a bit of revenue to the region and also added what we do so it s been quite good double digit growth i think some of that may slow down because some of those things were project extensions from sites we were already on but we re still projecting some pretty good activity going forward out there brian brophy stifel analyst excellent thanks and then on the incremental margins in that segment still pretty strong this quarter in spite of that service mix headwind so if you could give us little more color on what s driving that and given that you guys see service moderating a bit in the fourth quarter should we expect some improvement in incrementals in the fourth quarter and then help us remind us what a long term normalized incremental margin for that business is thank you randy baker president and chief executive officer i ll do the reminder on the incremental margins and i ll turn it over to rick to give you some detail on the composition but 35 to 45 is always been our target for incremental margins or operating leverage for our tool company which we have been able to operate in their effect of them in fact this quarter we blew through that number it had to do with mix it had to do with performance of the business but rick maybe you can give some more detail on composition rick dillon executive vice president and chief financial officer sure so for the quarter it s primarily a result of even though the mix is heavy weighted to service the regions for which that service occurred are definitely some of the more profitable service margins that we have overall so that works for us not having some of the project losses from last year also work for us and we also have a good mix of products versus you remember last year we had strong product sales but a heavier weighting to bolting and some of our other products which were quite the same incremental margins brian brophy stifel analyst excellent thank you i will pass it on operator thank you our next question is a follow up from the line of justin bergner with g research please proceed justin bergner g research analyst thank you for the follow up are you currently seeing more proposals for tools deals that could reach fruition that are low enough in sort of an expensive market to be superior to buying back your stock or are you sort of in a wait and see mode as it relates to valuations you would want to pay for the deals that you re contemplating randy baker president and chief executive officer multiples is never something we really want to talk about in a public environment because it s deal by deal specific quality companies are going to drive a little higher multiple and it s important to remember that as we evaluate our stock based on the based intrinsic value of the company we always evaluate that accretion rate of that stock versus what we re paying for it and high quality companies are always going to have a nice accretion rate so i always think that if you re in the market and looking at a company try to stay away from the proverbial fixer upper that there s either some sort of crazy hockey stick of sales growth that somehow is going to improve it or that the margin profile just doesn t match what we re trying to do so those hurdles are pretty strict for us but we will always come back to how it performed versus just investing in ourselves justin bergner g research analyst thank you randy baker president and chief executive officer you re welcome operator thank you i am showing no further questions at this time i will now turn the call back to yourself for any closing remarks barb bolens vice president of corporate strategy investor relations and communications thank you everybody we appreciate your participation today and your support of actuant if you have follow up clause please give us please reach out and we will set one up for you thank you very much operator thank you that does conclude

1 introduction perhaps i could start with a question of these government departments which has the biggest budget justice defence the home office international trade answers on a postcard well last year defence came out top with 28 4 billion the home office was second at 10 8 billion third was justice at 6 3 billion the department for international trade was way down the list but what might surprise you is the size of the gap between international trade and the other departments in fact dit s budget was less than a tenth of the ministry of justice s at around 400 million now this is in no way to suggest other departments are over funded or that justice the police or the defence of the realm are not vital spending priorities i could hardly say otherwise as the former defence secretary 2 dit in context but i wanted to put my remarks here in context because there is an untold story here which i m going to set out today i am proud to lead a department which has a direct impact on our prosperity in 2017 18 alone we helped uk businesses export goods and services worth around 30 5 billion against our total exports of around 645 billion and based on analysis by the institute for economic affairs dit estimate that this could potentially generate around 10 billion for the exchequer over 2016 17 and 2017 2018 we supported more than 3 500 inward investment projects creating and safeguarding over 190 000 jobs so my point is that we have some amazing bang for your buck given the resources and for the taxpayer s investment yet for all this success there is an implicit warning global britain cannot be built on a shoestring as the uk leaves the eu it is vital that government aggressively promotes and finances international trade and investment and champions free trade promoting the private sector companies that are the wellspring of our national prosperity economies in south asia east asia and africa are becoming more and more prosperous driving demand in precisely those sectors in which the uk excels ensuring britain succeeds in this new era means having the right tools to ensure we can unlock the global economy which will in turn support the uk economy and to sell britain abroad we need to understand two things first the markets we are selling into and the opportunities that they have to offer and second our overseas network also has to understand what britain has to sell in goods and services constantly updated by our sector teams here in the uk if the united kingdom is under armed if we fail to rise to the opportunities and challenges of a rapidly changing global economy there are plenty of competitor countries who may be better resourced or equipped we must ensure that britain is not left behind in the global trade race 3 the case for dit now according to the international trade centre the uk has an untapped potential of 124 billion in the export of goods alone that s companies that could be exporting because their peers do but are not choosing to do so and fulfilling this potential means being serious about the scale of the challenge posed as we prepare for life after brexit we must embrace the opportunity to connect into the markets of the future the global economy is changing as you all know at a staggering pace the population is projected to increase to 9 8 billion by 2050 and will become better educated wealthier and more urbanised it is predicted that the share of global gdp of the seven largest emerging economies including china india and turkey could increase from around 35 to nearly 50 of global gdp by 2050 which would mean that they overtake the g7 last year africa had five of the world s fastest growing economies africa s gdp has been predicted to double between 2015 and 2030 and the african development bank has estimated that by 2060 there could be 1 1 billion middle class africans quite a big consumer market this is a golden opportunity for high value uk goods and services to find new consumers and business markets and we are working at the moment to deliver the prime minister s ambition for the uk to be the largest g7 investor in africa by 2022 yet notwithstanding that the department for international development has more staff in kenya than the department for international trade has in the whole of the continent from egypt to south africa this is not to say that our international development efforts are too large or that they are in competition with our international trade and investment promotion efforts however if we want to have greater influence if we want to sell more goods and services abroad if we want to encourage more british businesses to invest and operate overseas and overseas firms to locate and invest in the uk then we must invest in the capabilities required and this means striking a new balance between our spending priorities not just focusing on how we divide our national income but how we grow that income too within whatever spending envelope comes out of the next spending review we must ensure that we prioritise those areas that will generate economic growth and wealth creation for our country in the future 4 free fair trade over the past three years i have spent a great deal of time talking about the benefits of free trade open free and fair trade rooted in a sound and relevant international rules based trading system has repeatedly shown itself to be of huge benefit to both individuals and states producers and consumers and in both developed developing countries alike and i say consumers because all too often we focus on producers without setting out the benefits of free trade to household incomes keeping prices down and ensuring competition and diversity of supply in fact i sat through an international trade ministers meeting where i had my watch out to see how long it would take anyone to say the c word 52 minutes before anyone mentioned consumers as the world s emerging and developing economies have liberalised trade practices prosperity has spread bringing industry jobs and wealth where once there was only deprivation according to the world bank the three decades between 1981 and 2011 witnessed the single greatest decrease in material deprivation in human history or as francis fukuyama put it in his recent book identity the percentage of children dying before their fifth birthday declined from 22 in 1960 to less than 5 by 2016 a billion people taken out of abject poverty in one generation that is why it is morally unthinkable to reject free and open trade now as with many freedoms free and open trade can seem like an inherent fact of life but the reality is that these freedoms and the benefits that they bestow have been hard won they must be continually defended from the siren call of protectionism which would tip the global balance in favour of the rich against the poor the strong against the weak and the developed against the developing and it is worth reminding ourselves of the positive narrative around free trade and the improvement of the human condition because in the world around us there is a rising chorus of protectionism which threatens to drown out the case for a free and open global trading system new barriers which were touched upon in the last session many of them invisible are emerging around the global economy creating new impediments to the open commerce that is the lifeblood of global prosperity what is worse many of these impediments are being introduced by g7 and g20 countries the very nations who have prospered most from the open liberal trading system of recent decades research by the oecd has shown that protectionist instincts have grown since the financial crisis of 2008 by 2010 g7 and g20 countries were estimated to be operating some 300 non tariff barriers to trade 300 by 2015 this had mushroomed to over 1200 non tariff barriers to trade now protectionism can be seductive but is a dangerous affair i have described it as the class a drug of the trading world it can make you feel good at first but it can prove disastrous in the long term it is economically destructive preventing us from reallocating global resources effectively it is also socially regressive because those on lower incomes spend a higher proportion of their money on goods than services so tariffs and barriers will hurt the poor more and we will all pay the price if those denied the opportunity of global prosperity turn their backs on the partnerships and cooperation that underpin global security we all have to ensure that those who have most benefited from open and free trade do not pull up the drawbridge behind them and deny the same benefits to others why because i have never believed that trade is an end in itself but a means to an end trade is a means to an end trade is a way in which we spread prosperity more widely that prosperity underpins social cohesion that social cohesion in turns underpins political stability and that political stability is the building block of our collective security if you interrupt that continuum of trade and investment do not be surprised if you get unwanted consequences politically economically or in terms of security 5 dit s role in ensuring a thriving economy now the department for international trade has been key in ensuring we are in a better position to achieve our aims we have been working as never before to help businesses take full advantage of global opportunities ensuring the uk remains a leading destination for international investment assisting outward direct investment for uk companies into overseas markets and negotiating market access for uk exporters last year we launched a new export strategy to encourage inform connect and finance businesses of all sizes with the goal of increasing our exports from 30 to 35 of our gdp moving us to the top of the g7 we have convened the board of trade for the first time in 150 years to champion trade and investment promotion across whole of the united kingdom we have created an overseas network of her majesty s trade commissioners selected for their expertise in particular markets building our regional trade plans and securing market access across the globe we have our world leading export credit agency uk export finance celebrating its 100th birthday this year with a 50 billion capacity available in 65 international currencies to ensure that no uk export fails for lack of finance or insurance and at no net cost to the taxpayer 77 of the businesses that ukef supported in 2017 18 were small and medium sized enterprises a step change from the situation previously in terms of that business relationship and recognising that it takes more than one business to deliver an export contract i was very proud to announce earlier this month that ukef has extended eligibility for its support to companies in exporters supply chains not just end stage exporters themselves and this will enable these firms from car parts suppliers to food packagers who play a crucial role in supply chains but do not directly sell goods or services themselves overseas to access the support they need to thrive including in vital areas such as cashflow we have also launched the uk s first ever public consultations on new trade agreements with the united states australia and new zealand as well potential accession to the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership or cptpp easier said in the morning than after a drink in the evening 6 dit s global competitors and there is pressing reason for these efforts it is no secret that countries across the world are ramping up their trade and investment promotion efforts president macron s choose france initiative is openly seeking to attract businesses who may be looking to relocate from the uk and the dutch government has hired more personnel to optimize support for british companies to move from the uk and yet despite this the united kingdom continues to be the top destination in europe for attracting foreign direct investment reaching a record high on the latest figures to the end of 2018 for the first time in more than four decades britain has the opportunity to reach out to the wider world as an independent trading nation and a global champion of free fair rules based international trade and in the shape of the department for international trade the uk has an ideal and indeed unique tool to realise that opportunity to drive growth in a post brexit economy and unlike many of our strategic partners such as australia or canada the united states or the european union the united kingdom is unique and i wonder how many people understand this unique in carrying responsibility for export promotion trade finance trade remedies exporting licensing and international negotiations in a single government department it is one of the most important and farsighted legacies of theresa may s time as prime minister of this country and dit unites all the uk s trade capabilities bringing together the government s international economic levers to give us a truly competitive trade advantage it puts trade front and centre of the national agenda a focal point to create the conditions for uk businesses to be competitive on the world stage and as the only department with a network both in the uk and overseas dit is uniquely positioned to engage directly with business with the high levels of expertise and global reach that those businesses need to exploit new opportunities 7 aligning trade and development policy now it is not just about structures as you will know it is also about priorities it means ensuring that trade is at the forefront of the foreign policy agenda as well as our development agenda so that we can use the new policy freedoms which will be realised after we leave the european union to better align our international policy goals this means recognising the key role of trade in boosting global prosperity and security and giving developing nations a chance a real chance to trade their way out of poverty on a sustainable basis the government is working hard to ensure development and global prosperity are at the heart of uk trade and investment policy enhancing market access for poorer countries and ensuring that they can take advantage of this access through trade related assistance that we give we are committed to bringing trade and development policy closer together investing to build a safer healthier more prosperous world and helping countries in the developing world leave aid dependency to become our trading partners of the future this includes our 1 2 billion cross whitehall prosperity fund to promote economic reform and development in countries eligible for oda and this will help tackle poverty and unlock new opportunities for uk businesses in strategically important markets such as india china brazil mexico and south east asia 8 global economic headwinds and i believe the need for all this this is now stronger than ever it will be no secret to those of you in this room this morning that significant headwinds are growing across the global economy last month the oecd forecast of world gdp growth in 2019 and 2020 were revised down to 3 2 and 3 4 respectively at the same time global trade growth forecasts have been revised down significantly by 1 6 percentage points to 2 1 for 2019 the weakest rate since the height of the financial crisis and for the first time in decades the system of free fair rules based multilateral trade which underpins our prosperity has itself come into question the world bank has identified that mounting protectionism and a broad based increase in global tariffs could translate into a possible annual decline in global trade of 9 or over us 2 6 trillion relative to the baseline in 2020 of course the strength of the uk economy has so far bucked the trend the employment rate is at a record high while the unemployment rate is at a 45 year low wages are growing faster than inflation british exports stand at a record high of 645 8 billion a year on year increase of 4 at a time when global trade growth has been slowing and as i have already pointed out latest figures from unctad found that the uk has once again been confirmed as the number one destination for fdi in europe hitting a record high of almost 1 5 trillion in stock more than germany and france combined nevertheless for all its successes we must acknowledge those headwinds in the global economic outlook in which we operate and the risks which we therefore face we need to take the measures in cooperation with our international economic partners to ensure those risks are mitigated standing up for our belief in free trade and the free trading system otherwise there can be no guarantee that our economy will not be affected by adverse trends 9 conclusion so we must be ready for whatever the future holds the uk can only meet its global ambitions and drive prosperity at home during a time of fierce international competition and global economic challenges if it puts trade at the top of our agenda that is why at this critical juncture in our national history it is essential we are appropriately equipped so the uk can boost its competitiveness forge new and enhanced trade relationships around the world and thus achieve our full economic potential we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to realise our country s potential as an outward looking global britain a country that promotes prosperity worldwide by helping developing countries to trade their way out of poverty a country that champions free fair rules based trade abiding by and shaping world class standards and the international rules based trading system but we cannot do this on a shoestring and we must be willing to prioritise our spending to where it will lead to greater wealth creation and growth providing us with the future funding of public services such as health education and defence failure to take the scale of the challenge seriously will mean we may lose out on the potential of a new golden era of british trade the opportunity is out there for the taking and we must embrace it with confidence with optimism and above all with courage thank you

components now i will turn the call over to randy randy baker president and chief executive officer thanks bolens good morning everybody today we re going to start on slide 3 our third quarter was one of the best results in many years and i m very pleased with the performance of the businesses but before i review the results i d like to provide an update on our strategy progress our initiatives to improve organic growth are paying off the industrial tools services segment grew by 8 in the quarter this was a direct result of the efforts to improve our sales effectiveness and bring new products to the market our service sales grew at an impressive rate in the quarter which was benefiting from extended projects in the middle east and north sea advertisement advertisement as we recall we announced a restructuring program in our second quarter earnings call to improve efficiency reduce our cost base and prepare for the next phase of our strategy the combination of enerpac hydratight and the corporate structure are the area of focus which are well under way we expect to see the benefits of our efforts as we enter our new fiscal year from a capital deployment perspective we are maintaining strict discipline relative to our strategy our top priority remains investing in organic growth efforts while maintaining a clear perspective on strategic acquisitions we have built a good pipeline of perspective tool companies which will extend our existing product lines and provide new technology to enerpac from a portfolio perspective the enerpac i m sorry the sale of the engineered components systems segment is continuing and we will provide more updates as become available secondly we have made decisions to retain the cortland industrial rope and medical component business we believe we can further improve and grow the company to maximize shareholder value the industrial rope segment has the potential to serve a wider variety of customers through the utilization of the enerpac channel and the medical component business is growing fast with a very attractive profit margin now turning over to slide 4 as i mentioned earlier we had a we are very pleased with results in the third quarter core sales grew by 3 comprised of an outstanding result from enerpac of 8 while moderate decline from ecs segment of 2 adjusted operating profit grew by 18 driven by 280 basis points of margin expansion advertisement advertisement as i stated in the past our target industrial tools services operating leverage is between 35 and 45 which was exceeded in the quarter while ecs sales declined in the quarter the team was able to expand margins through cost reduction and price realization as a real result eps grew by 15 in the quarter to 0 45 a share which was the top of our guidance range and the best earnings since 2015 from a financial leverage standpoint we improved to 1 8 which is a substantial progress over prior year and places actuant in a very healthy position overall the third quarter was a great result and i m proud of our global team for the effort to deliver on the commitments conditions and improve the company now turning over to slide 5 the third quarter was very active for new product launches and new platform wins enerpac tool launched nine new product families in the quarter and is now making great progress toward the 10 product development sales goal the new e pulse hydraulic pump is a revolutionary design for all applications from lifting to bolting with a completely new drive system the new e pulse pump provides a true competitive advantage and sets a new standard in the marketplace secondly our lifting group has released a highly creative cube jack system capable of 50 tons in a very compact design this new system provides greater flexibility in a highly transportable package on the engineered components systems side our team won 10 new product platforms in the quarter and has reached a new level of product vitality of greater than 15 the new platform includes display systems hydraulic tools and new drive line applications our push to have a higher degree of product vitality has lessened the impact of market cyclicality overall we re very pleased with the progress of becoming a truly innovative company advertisement advertisement so moving on to slide 6 our capital allocations priorities have not changed we believe investment in ourselves to maximize organic growth is the highest priority secondly as you noted from our improved financial leverage we will continue to maintain a strong balance sheet and reduce debt as i mentioned strategic acquisitions which support our tool company strategy are our priority however our ability to acquire and operate to improve the value of the company must be maintained we have built an active list of potential acquisitions which must meet our financial and operational hurdles including comparison with share repurchase additionally all acquisitions must support the extension of our tool product line and provide technology which gives enerpac a competitive advantage i m going to turn the call over to rick now to go through the details on the quarter and i ll come back with a market update and guidance rick dillon executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks randy and good morning everyone so before we get into our third quarter report let s quickly look at the one time items on slide 7 we recorded a net 9 million benefit from the impairment divestiture and other charges 11 million of the benefit is related to the decision to retain the quarterly us business including an accounting adjustment for certain translation losses and depreciation and amortization advertisement advertisement this benefit is partially offset by divestiture costs related to the ecs process tax reform and other charges relates to the acceleration of debt issuance costs and 3 million of additional tax expense related to the reevaluation of certain tax credits as a result of law changes given tax reform so let s get into our third quarter results we turn to slide 8 core sales increased 3 this was offset by the 6 impact of divestitures in the quarter and a 4 headwind from the stronger dollar adjusted operating profit showed continued year over year improvement of 280 basis points with incremental profitability in both its and ecs our adjusted effective income tax rate was approximately 15 for the quarter in line with our expectations our full year effective tax rate is still expected to be approximately 20 and our fourth quarter rate is expected to be in the mid to upper 20 s similar to our second quarter adjusted eps for the second quarter was 0 45 compared to 0 39 last year and at the top end of our guidance range we turn into slide 9 total core sales at 3 was in line with our guidance in the mid single digits range as continued strong growth of its was partially offset by a sales decline of ecs its segment sales continue to be strong with core sales up 8 product sales continue to be solid and service growth in the middle east and north sea was much stronger than our expectations in ecs the modest decline in core sales resulted from reduced demand in off highway truck north america frac and china while european truck is stable i ll provide more color on core sales in a minute when we discuss the individual segment results advertisement advertisement turning to slide 10 for a summary of our top line performance our 3 consolidated core sales growth was driven by a 9 million improvement from volume and price its volume grew by 9 million and it was partially offset by reduced ecs volume currency headwinds reduced sales by approximately 11 million or 4 as did the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures which was 20 million or 6 now let s look at both adjusted operating profit and adjusted ebitda on slide 11 our trend of improving year over year operating profit margin has continued this quarter improvement from pricing actions and its core volume increases provided the greatest positive impact in the quarter an unfavorable product mix and under absorption in both segments was partially offset by the benefit of the elimination of the losses from the heavy lifts products in the prior year as with the case last quarter tariffs in the quarter were approximately 2 million and in line with our expectations we continue to believe that our pricing actions were sufficient to cover commodity and other inflationary increases including tariffs but we are watching closely how the current trade and tariff discussions advance any further tariff impacts would likely need to be covered in the form of surcharges our objective remains to prevent margin erosion due to inflationary cost pressures and as expected sae expenses also improved year over year primarily driven by reduced incentive compensation expense now move on to the segment details starting with the its segment on slide 12 core its sales increased by 8 year over year which is the fifth consecutive quarter of consolidated core growth and the seventh consecutive quarter of core product sales growth in the segment core product sales were up mid single digits with substantially all regions experiencing growth and led by north america this reflects the continued benefits of our investments in npd and commercial effectiveness advertisement advertisement the biggest driver of our growth in the quarter was the 23 core sales improvement in our service business specifically in the middle east and north sea third quarter is our seasonally strongest service quarter due to planned maintenance shutdowns however the upside we experienced in the quarter was attributable to scope additions to a number of large plant shutdowns emergency repairs and higher work level has been normal during ramadan incremental profit flow through on the solid product growth in north america and the significant service growth drove the 24 ebitda margin and is a testament to the strength of our its business and our opportunities to drive growth and profitability as we execute our strategy of becoming a pure play premier industrial tool company if we look at slide 13 before we move on to ecs i want to spend a few minutes on the its restructuring program as well as the drivers of the its fourth quarter projections which randy will cover shortly as you mentioned earlier its has begun to implement the restructuring program we announced earlier this quarter the key areas of focus include repositioning our north american service business to align with our future growth strategy specifically our service structure and resources will be focused on high value and added services high value added services such as joint integrity specialty machining and high margin bolting we had built a service organization that s not only focused on specialty service but also commodity type service which comprised historical profit margins while we expect to see reduced service sales in north america in the near term we spent to see an immediate improvement in profitability our new operating structure will also allow us to put more focus on growing our products and rental products to both our service and distribution networks as we invest in and grow our rental and specialty service business we will see incremental core sales and even greater profitability in the region in addition as we finalize the integration enerpac of enerpac and hydratight our general its structure will be a focus and may include de emphasis of certain product offerings that while small have negative impacts to our overall profitability we continue to expect to achieve 12 million to 15 million annual savings with one time restructuring costs of 15 million to 20 million we already discussed the 1 million of cost that came during the q3 and the rest of the costs coming in q4 and early 2020 advertisement advertisement with that as we look ahead to expectations for its as we finish the year i thought it would be helpful to frame the impact on the quarter from normal seasonality as well as restructuring in the fourth quarter from a product perspective our core tool sales growth is expected to continue to be steady in the mid single digits supported by new product introductions that will offset will be offset by roughly 3 million of heavy lift product sales that came during q4 2018 which will not repeat this year due to our focus on standard product offerings additionally as just discussed our restructuring activities focused on de emphasizing lower profit and unprofitable service product line service and product lines will result in some incremental near term top line reductions q4 is our seasonally slowest service period due to our customers maintenance schedules this combined with the completion of the large projects we saw scope expansions on earlier in the year will result in the decline in sales from the quarterly sequential trend this year what this means for its in the fourth quarter is the top line growth projection of 1 to 4 again while down from our run rate this year our expectation for quality growth in our core products and service business have not changed however we will see some puts and takes as we execute our strategy on service and product going forward turning now to ecs on slide 14 core sales declined by 2 in the quarter the divestiture of cortland fibron and precision hayes reduced year over year sales by 21 million or 14 and the stronger dollar reduced sales by 3 resulting in an overall reduction of 19 the core sales decline of 2 was the result of the challenges in the ag market due to exceptionally cool and wet spring and its impact on the planting season as well as reductions in north american north america frac and china truck and as stated earlier european truck is stabilizing cortland us sales were flat to prior year as ropes and cable sales were down year over year but that was offset by very solid growth in our medical business profit margins in the segment increased year over year primarily as a result of pricing spin control and a reduction in incentive compensation expense given the expected market softness we ll be taking actions in q4 within the ecs business to reduce costs and drive efficiencies we expect these restructuring actions to generate approximately 3 million in annual savings with a cost of approximately 2 million if we turn now to liquidity on slide 15 we generated 44 million of cash during the quarter in line with our seasonal patterns and our projected growth in cash in the third quarter working capital was a positive year over year as the accounts receivable built at the end of q2 was collected as expected and reduced inventory as well in q3 of 2018 we received a large tax refund of 17 million that did not repeat this year and resulted in one of the larger year over year impacts to cash flow we now have or expect full year cash flow to be in the range of 62 million to 70 million down from the previous guidance of 80 million to 85 million the decrease is attributable to the anticipated cash restructuring costs in the fourth quarter an effort to normalize inventories in our ecs segment ahead of new platform launches aggravated by the anticipated decline in sales in the fourth quarter and a delay of one platform launch until fiscal 2020 we re also seeing incremental capex including the acceleration of certain ecs projects in anticipation of a divestiture we ended the quarter with 200 million of cash on hand during the quarter we renegotiated our term loan and revolving credit facilities to provide greater flexibility in anticipation of an ecs transaction and to support the execution of our strategic plan going forward as we close the credit facility our term loan balance was 200 million and we have since paid down an incremental 10 million with excess cash leverage measured by net debt to pro forma ebitda took another step down and now sits at 1 8 times versus 2 6 times in q3 of 2018 the combination of the reduction in leverage and the new credit facilities provides us with significant flexibility to execute on our strategic plan with that i will turn the call back over to you randy randy baker president and chief executive officer thanks rick let s move over to slide 16 the general economic drivers remain largely unchanged from our second quarter us economic growth is flattening while euro area has experienced sequential decline our recent dealer visits have revealed a consistent message of continued growth in industrial tools segment driven by good retail activity our enerpac deals are reporting stable inventory conditions but are feeling the impact of pricing resulting from the ongoing tariff almost all of our 14 vertical markets are experiencing moderate growth which is projected to continue through the fourth quarter service activity continues to be strong in the middle east and other energy markets in the off highway mobile equipment marketable both ag and construction equipment producers are balancing their wholesale to retail activity as a result the new equipment production orders will decline through the fourth quarter but is expected to rebound quickly on highway sales in china have declined while the european truck market is more stable now turning over to slide 17 our core sales growth expectations for the full year have changed we are increasing our outlook for industrial tools service segment the fourth quarter sales is projected to be in the 1 to 4 range and the full year projection is to be in the 6 to 7 range this is a direct result of the stronger than expected service and the continued growth in the tools engineered components systems is projected to decline in the fourth quarter by 7 to 11 and the full year is we ll see a decline of between 2 and 3 the combination of increasing tools and service sales with the declining engineered components system resulted in a full year core sales outlook of between 2 and 3 and moving on to slide 18 in the guidance full year guidance will be adjusted to 1 125 billion to 1 135 billion which reflects divestitures currency impact in the lower ecs sales conversely we are increasing our full year eps range of between 1 15 and 1 21 with an effective tax rate of approximately 20 free cash flow will decrease to 62 million to 70 million and for the fourth quarter we expect a range of 265 million to 275 million with an eps of 0 25 to 0 31 per share and before i turn it over to the operator i just want to reiterate that we are in the cusp ph of building one of the finest tool companies in the world the company has proven it can grow its sales coverage it can increase its product development and the result is creating a truly innovative and growing company and we are very very proud to be part of that so with that operator i m going to turn it over to you for questions questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from the line of mig dobre with r w baird please proceed joe grabowski robert w baird analyst good morning guys it s joe grabowski on for mig this morning rick dillon executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning randy baker president and chief executive officer good morning joe grabowski robert w baird analyst good morning could maybe expand a little bit more on the decision to retain the remaining cortland businesses and kind of what changed from maybe last quarter when those businesses were part of the businesses could be divested randy baker president and chief executive officer so as you know we have been preparing for the divestment process for a long time where we ve created a component business comprised of the ecs company and separated from that we sold phi and the cortland fibron which was the offshore oil and gas division which was focused heavily on upstream which we know was has been stressed and then that was placed last year so the question is what about cortland which is comprised of a industrial rope manufacturer and a very very high quality medical component manufacturers as we look through that and its ability to grow margins to an accretion level greater than or equal to enerpac we found that value and that creation possibility was there so what we wanted to do is to really bring that business back into the full and then really proactively market the lifting assembling equipment back to enerpac which we ve already branded a significant number of our ropes and assemblies as an enerpac product and many of our distributors specialize in heavy lifting apparatus whether it s cranes spreading equipment or shackles or other components so it fits quite well with that so we believe we can create more shareholder value by growing that and then secondly by focusing on our med business which has an extraordinary margin profile the combination of those two things we think we can build a very very nice business joe grabowski robert w baird analyst got it okay makes sense thanks for the color my follow up i guess the ec s core sales guidance around 7 to 11 in the fourth quarter can you maybe break it down give a little more thought on which end markets are driving that and maybe specifically within that wondering if you re seeing any strength in ag related businesses or maybe improvement in ag related businesses with the elevated corn prices we ve seen recently thank you randy baker president and chief executive officer okay so covering the components of ecs fourth quarter one of the primary drivers is one of our new platform wins which is a truck manufacturer in europe has a one quarter delay on the launch of a sizable piece of business so it s not a structural change to the business it s the delay of the start of a major project which has a multi year impact to the company so that s painful but it s part of being component manufacturers you could see differences in when the production changeovers for either model years or new product will launch and that s a big chunk of that secondly we ve seen softness in china and so as we push harder to get more customers in china to offset that we re going to see it in the short term on the ag industry as you know i spent a lot of time in the ag industry and have a fairly good understanding of the dynamics when you see major manufacturers constraining their wholesale plan and taking down their dealer stock it creates a very very nice environment in a very short period of time because the availability of product is won t be there as we enter into the new fiscal year so on the corn price if you look at the stock to use ratio and then you also think about what the lower planted acres and the lower yields do to the late start it s going to drive the corn price up so certain farmers and certain parts of the united states are going to see a very high windfall on their corn price which should create some nice sales activity so that s why we believe in the off highway ag market the reset should be short lived because i can see great discipline from the three primary producers on constraining their inventory joe grabowski robert w baird analyst got it okay thanks for taking my questions operator thank you our next question comes from the line of jeff hammond with keybanc please proceed patricia gorman keybanc capital markets analyst hey this is trish on for jeff so looking at your fourth quarter guidance for it s up against tough tools comp and with the early completion of service projects last quarter can you talk more about where you re seeing strength in kind of what s driving the upgraded outlook for the segment randy baker president and chief executive officer for tools specifically patricia gorman keybanc capital markets analyst yeah for it s randy baker president and chief executive officer yeah so as rick mentioned he walked through that in a lot of detail on one of the slides but where the real strength continues is in our tool platforms new product launches very healthy 14 vertical markets that are still seeing nice growth dynamics so on the standard tool products we still see really good things going forward as you know a year ago we made a conscious decision to stop doing highly specialized and in many cases highly risky and low margin construction projects many of them were large and many of them from a margin standpoint either lost money or had very low margin we ve consciously stopped that so in our fourth quarter we anniversary some of those projects and so as rick said that s about a 3 million takeout on a year over year basis which mutes the overall product component of our its outlook but you still see nice growth rates from the composite number and then on the service side as rick also mentioned our service it has lumpy aspects to it as we do larger projects the customer may time to time ask us to extend those projects and keep people on job sites and that creates a nice windfall force which we saw in q3 and in q2 and which bump that growth rate up significantly so what we re guiding for our fourth quarter we think is a very very stable number it reflects the benefit of a great tool company and as we raise the full year guidance for the tool business it reflects the full run rates from the full year so we re extraordinarily pleased with the 6 to 7 to 8 growth rate for the business it s it far exceeded our expectations and when you see the ebitda margin in the quarter of more than 24 there are very few companies in the world that have that kind of type of margin profile which again is why we are so thankful to have this quality of the business and why we re focusing on that for the future patricia gorman keybanc capital markets analyst okay great and then just on ec s given what you re seeing out of your end markets does that change the way you re thinking about that about the sale process at all randy baker president and chief executive officer could you repeat the question i m not sure i don t want to answer the wrong thing for you patricia gorman keybanc capital markets analyst yeah so just looking at ec s given some of the softening end markets is that impacting how you re thinking about the sale at all randy baker president and chief executive officer well no we always have looked at this as a strategic move for the company and as we said we haven t given a lot of information about the process and that s by design but we re very very committed to it we know what s the right thing for our long term improvement in the value of the company from the ecs standpoint the key elements of that business is we ve done a great job of developing a new platform win rate that is far exceeding the past and i think that s a tremendous element of the business because when you we ve got a product vitality north of 15 you re bringing in brand new customers every single quarter it will lessen the impact of cyclicality and that s an important piece if you re going to be in the component industry so we re still very committed to the process and we think it s the best long term decision for the company patricia gorman keybanc capital markets analyst okay great thanks guys operator thank you our next question comes from the line of ann duignan with jp morgan please proceed ann duignan jp morgan analyst hi good morning ann duignan here randy baker president and chief executive officer good morning ann ann duignan jp morgan analyst good morning lot of my questions have been answered but maybe you can talk a little bit about i think you mentioned that mix was a negative in both the segments could you just expand on that rick dillon executive vice president and chief financial officer i think from a its perspective it s just the overweighted service in the quarter and really for the year versus our original guy from the ecs perspective it s just specific products including some of the new products until we get to the appropriate run rate so both of them experience a little bit of a mixed drag versus the original guy ann duignan jp morgan analyst okay and then you talked about how services had surprised due to the upside is there any risk that we ve now just created more of a deep hole going into fiscal 20 that these services some of the work was pulled forward and that you have tougher comps and no visibility if you just like talk about the say outlook for services in it s randy baker president and chief executive officer yeah i think that you re always going to have lumpy spots within any fiscal year and service particularly when you have large project build that you re on they always do sort of reoccur i mean in 2016 we saw some very big ones that were in the 20 million plus those are tough to reoccur but the ones that are of the medium size they can create a nice windfall in a quarter but it s something that our teams are constantly pushing as part of once you get on a job site you want to try to sell your services going forward because the mobilization fees the customers paid are have already been paid so there s a there are benefit to any petro chem site or transfer terminal wherever we re doing the work so i don t see it as a big problem going into next year you may have some tough comps from quarter to quarter but we still see the focus on high quality and high margin service the primary objective and as you know our the element of service in the tool group in the enerpac tool company is actually a relatively small piece of the overall picture if you think about our product sales that is a very very high percentage which is also includes the rental business that we have that s more than 80 of all the sales we do and that s why the margins are so spectacular is when you have that type of a business so i don t see it as a major problem for us ann rick dillon executive vice president and chief financial officer so you will see as we talked about as we start to be de emphasize some of this commodity type services the restructuring is around north america but the de emphasis is global you will see some top line pressure but to randy s point these weren t the kinds of projects we saw in 2016 these were larger longer tenured products that gave us some opportunities for upside then we will have projects like that and we normally do have projects like that just unplanned maintenance and we expect that going forward but our product and rental product growth will certainly outpace service and result in higher profitability going forward ann duignan jp morgan analyst and just as a point of clarification could you just services at some point do you expect them to be margin neutral to the segment i mean is there can you ever get the service margins to the famous product in i ll leave it there thank you randy baker president and chief executive officer yeah the service margins are always going to be a lower component of the things we do but one of the elements of having a great service team in the field is they re your eyes and ears on job sites that help you market your tools these are rental or new equipment and so when we go to a job site we go with enerpac tool and that is a great way to market the products that we intend to sell there are certain types of service especially in joint integrity is highly technical and it s a differentiator as a business so we like that sort of thing it will have higher margins because we provide more than just labor but when it s pure labor for hire it ll never be equal to the product sales ann duignan jp morgan analyst okay perfect thank you i appreciate the color randy baker president and chief executive officer thanks ann operator thank you our next question comes from the line of justin bergner with g research please proceed justin bergner g research analyst good morning randy randy baker president and chief executive officer good morning justin bergner g research analyst good morning rick rick dillon executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning justin bergner g research analyst my first my first question relates to free cash flow would you be able to bridge the old free cash flow guidance to the new free cash flow guidance across some of the major buckets you highlighted earlier in the call rick dillon executive vice president and chief financial officer i wouldn t be able to quantify those major buckets because we generally don t but in terms of what s driving it as i said it s restructuring costs which we ve actually given what we anticipate in the fourth quarter by way of cash restructuring there s a little bit of overall guidance there s a little bit of capex that is in anticipation of a divestiture and maybe that weren t planned to be complete entirely in 20 and then we had the inventory levels and so ecs inventory levels particularly are up and with the delayed project they are up and the capex is primarily flat justin bergner g research analyst thank you that s helpful my second question relates to the restructuring detail you provided today i m just trying to clarify is that restructuring associated with the restructuring with it s becoming its own sort of independent business after the sale of ec s sort of what you referred to on the last call or is that actually not so much corporate restructuring but it s specific restructuring operations with a further plan to follow on removing overhead if and when you sell ec s rick dillon executive vice president and chief financial officer so as we said on the last call it s a combination first of all its as a stand alone company you got to see the lines between what s corporate and what its business are and so we talked about earlier some of the north america service things that we re doing including infrastructure which would be in that corporate vein and then we talked about some of these enerpac hydratight merger structural changes that we are doing and again those in a stand alone which fall in that corporate cost bucket in addition to that like we talked about last quarter we re going we re in the process of continuing to evaluate our corporate organization in order to make sure we are efficient post transaction and that we have an overall cost that will allow us to sustain a 20 ebitda margin or consolidate business of course that will require some of those costs will transform or reduce naturally with a transaction others will require actions and as we get closer to a transaction and better clarity we will be announced and potentially future actions to achieve that goal justin bergner g research analyst thank you i ll hop back in the queue operator thank you our next question comes from the line of deane dray with rbc capital markets please proceed jeff rbc capital markets analyst good morning this is jeff ph on for deane my question is given the recent volatility in oil prices could you comment on the tool segment s sensitivity to oil and additionally could you just remind us the breakdown of upstream versus midstream and downstream exposure of the tool segments specifically randy baker president and chief executive officer sure the main thing with oil is it seeing multiple years of structural change and so for the north american onshore you can tell by the rig counts have come down and so the north american sales into onshore has definitely tempered a bit and you can see that in our torque tension sales in north america and i think a lot of our distributors would speak to that fact that they ve seen slower sales activity or slowing sales activity it s been quite good but it s just not as booming as it was a year and a half ago offshore is primarily focused on maintenance of existing assets either in the gulf or in the north sea and has continued to be strong because they have to maintain those assets now if you re doing offshore drilling that s a totally different thing and we don t participate a lot in offshore drilling anymore by design and then as i mentioned and mid east has been quite active we ve seen double digit growth in service as well as some of our product sales categories in the mid east have done quite well so the volatility in the pricing does create some short term change in how people think about investment and capex but the beauty of where we play is mid to down and so we stay away from upstream particularly as i mentioned a couple of years ago we consciously exited the upstream oil gas which includes well development exploration because that s where that volatility in pricing becomes very dramatic to a company so today we feel that the price where it s been setting is conducive to good maintenance activity and it s good to investment in new tools many of those tool activities come as a general maintenance manager purchase decisions so it doesn t go in front of a capex committee so things have been quite good and i think that s going to stay that way for a while jeff rbc capital markets analyst okay great that s very helpful and then just to follow up is there any intention to kind of focus your m a activities outside of energy or is it kind of just it s next in the group kind of at the same percentage as your end markets randy baker president and chief executive officer yeah so just to clarify we won t focus any attention in the energy area for m a are a 100 of our activity for m a is directed toward tool companies as i ve mentioned before to a lot of our investors we look at several distinct categories of tools and ones that bring either a technology that we need for enerpac or opens up a brand new market or a region that helps us grow as a tool company so you can rest assured that our capital investment relative to m a will be focused of developing a world class tool company and we will not deviate out of that and as i mentioned in my commentary it will follow very strict guidelines on the quality of the company the returns how well can we own and operate it and we will always compare it with the value of a share buyback rather than an investment in m a all of those hurdles meeting the criteria then we proceed jeff rbc capital markets analyst fantastic thank you operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from line of stanley elliott with stifel please proceed brian brophy stifel analyst hi good morning this is brian brophy on for stanley i had a question on its can you give us some more color on what s driving the strength in the middle east randy baker president and chief executive officer well there s a lot of assets in the middle east there s there are so many large refineries there that need to be maintained and the mid east for us is broken into a couple of large markets obviously it s our traditional markets in saudi uae and areas where there s a lot of assets that are being maintained but also we re in the caspian and north africa and other places that typically as we characterize middle east people don t think about caspian has been quite good for us and as you remember we made an acquisition that extended what we do in service from not just joint integrity and pipeline services but also pipe perhaps in cleaning systems and services which added quite a bit of revenue to the region and also added what we do so it s been quite good double digit growth i think some of that may slow down because some of those things were project extensions from sites we were already on but we re still projecting some pretty good activity going forward out there brian brophy stifel analyst excellent thanks and then on the incremental margins in that segment still pretty strong this quarter in spite of that service mix headwind so if you could give us little more color on what s driving that and given that you guys see service moderating a bit in the fourth quarter should we expect some improvement in incrementals in the fourth quarter and then help us remind us what a long term normalized incremental margin for that business is thank you randy baker president and chief executive officer i ll do the reminder on the incremental margins and i ll turn it over to rick to give you some detail on the composition but 35 to 45 is always been our target for incremental margins or operating leverage for our tool company which we have been able to operate in their effect of them in fact this quarter we blew through that number it had to do with mix it had to do with performance of the business but rick maybe you can give some more detail on composition rick dillon executive vice president and chief financial officer sure so for the quarter it s primarily a result of even though the mix is heavy weighted to service the regions for which that service occurred are definitely some of the more profitable service margins that we have overall so that works for us not having some of the project losses from last year also work for us and we also have a good mix of products versus you remember last year we had strong product sales but a heavier weighting to bolting and some of our other products which were quite the same incremental margins brian brophy stifel analyst excellent thank you i will pass it on operator thank you our next question is a follow up from the line of justin bergner with g research please proceed justin bergner g research analyst thank you for the follow up are you currently seeing more proposals for tools deals that could reach fruition that are low enough in sort of an expensive market to be superior to buying back your stock or are you sort of in a wait and see mode as it relates to valuations you would want to pay for the deals that you re contemplating randy baker president and chief executive officer multiples is never something we really want to talk about in a public environment because it s deal by deal specific quality companies are going to drive a little higher multiple and it s important to remember that as we evaluate our stock based on the based intrinsic value of the company we always evaluate that accretion rate of that stock versus what we re paying for it and high quality companies are always going to have a nice accretion rate so i always think that if you re in the market and looking at a company try to stay away from the proverbial fixer upper that there s either some sort of crazy hockey stick of sales growth that somehow is going to improve it or that the margin profile just doesn t match what we re trying to do so those hurdles are pretty strict for us but we will always come back to how it performed versus just investing in ourselves justin bergner g research analyst thank you randy baker president and chief executive officer you re welcome operator thank you i am showing no further questions at this time i will now turn the call back to yourself for any closing remarks barb bolens vice president of corporate strategy investor relations and communications thank you everybody we

rttnews the major u s index futures are currently pointing to a higher opening on wednesday following the steep drop seen over the course of the previous session the upward momentum on wall street comes as comments from treasury secretary steven mnuchin have generated optimism about a potential u s china trade deal ahead of the highly anticipated g20 meeting between president donald trump and chinese president xi jinping mnuchin told cnbc the u s and china had nearly completed a deal before talks broke down last month we were about 90 percent of the way there and i think there s a path to complete this mnuchin said in an interview with cnbc s hadley gamble but did not shed any light on the sticking points to achieving the final 10 percent mnuchin refused to speculate on whether a deal would be completed but said he was hopeful noting president trump and president xi have a very close working relationship stocks futures remained positive after a report from the commerce department unexpectedly showed another steep drop in durable goods orders in the month of may after moving modestly lower early in the session stocks saw further downside over the course of the trading day on tuesday the s p 500 closed lower for the third straight session after ending last thursday s trading at a record closing high the major averages finished the session just off their worst levels of the day the dow slid 179 32 points or 0 7 percent to 26 548 22 the nasdaq plunged 120 98 points or 1 5 percent to 7 884 72 and the s p 500 tumbled 27 97 points or 1 percent to 2 917 38 the weakness on wall street partly reflected a negative reaction to a conference board report showing a substantial deterioration in u s consumer confidence in the month of june the conference board said its consumer confidence index tumbled to 121 5 in june from a downwardly revised 131 3 in may economists had expected the index to dip to 132 0 from the 134 1 originally reported for the previous month with the much steeper than expected drop the consumer confidence index slumped to its lowest level since hitting 120 6 in september of 2017 the escalation in trade and tariff tensions earlier this month appears to have shaken consumers confidence said lynn franco senior director of economic indicators at the conference board she added although the index remains at a high level continued uncertainty could result in further volatility in the index and at some point could even begin to diminish consumers confidence in the expansion a separate report from the commerce department also unexpectedly showed a steep drop in new home sales in the u s in the month of may the commerce department said new home sales plunged by 7 8 percent to an annual rate of 626 000 in may after tumbling by 3 7 percent to a revised rate of 679 000 in april economists had expected new home sales to climb by 1 percent to a rate of 680 000 from the 673 000 originally reported for the previous month additional selling pressure was generated in reaction to comments from federal reserve chairman jerome powell who reiterated the fed will act as appropriate to sustain the economic expansion but did not appear to signal the imminent interest rate cut currently being priced in by the markets many fomc participants judge that the case for somewhat more accommodative policy has strengthened powell said during a speech before the council on foreign relations in new york he added but we are also mindful that monetary policy should not overreact to any individual data point or short term swing in sentiment software stocks moved sharply lower over the course of the trading session dragging the dow jones u s software index down by 2 7 percent the index continued to give back ground after reaching a record high last thursday industry giant microsoft msft helped to lead the software sector lower tumbling by 3 2 percent after ending the previous session at a record closing high the disappointing new home

one reason markets have lost momentum this week is the pending g20 leaders summit in japan for which expectations continue to be reset lower an early draft of the communiqué has already been reported in the media and it seems characteristically vague according to capital economics it acknowledges the benefits of free trade but fails to eschew protectionism as for the meeting between us president donald trump and china s president xi jinping a tariff ceasefire is seen as the best outcome capital economics said greg valliere chief us policy strategist at agf investments said an inflection point

to go with a feature story australia property by madeleine coorey a sign advertises a multi million dollar house which sold prior to auction in sydney on may 8 2010 in australia s largest cities of sydney and melbourne the growth in property prices has been enough to ensure many prospective home owners are priced out of the market before they make their first tentative bid afp photo torsten blackwood photo credit should read torsten blackwood afp getty images when i arrived in australia and turned on the tv in my hotel room i was bombarded with adverts for mortgage refinancing equity withdrawal and cheap credit cards one ad depicted a woman talking elatedly about how she d managed to pay off 90 000 worth of credit card debt over just three years in st kilda a trendy district in the south of melbourne entire streets were covered in boarded up shops plastered with the logos of various real estate companies on one street someone had taken a sharpie and written lower your rent over every sign and homeless men and women could be found sheltering in the unused doorways a few days later i recounted my experience to one of the organisers of the political conference i attended telling him that all the signs pointed to a property boom that was running out of steam he nodded in agreement my house is worth no more today than it was when i bought it two years ago after 2008 policymakers across the world claimed to have learned the lessons of the financial crisis they recognised that the pre crisis approach to regulation hadn t worked rather than predictable risks in individual institutions they realised they should have been focusing on unpredictable systemic risks but the financial crisis didn t result simply from a failure of regulatory oversight 2008 was a crisis caused by financialisation and this means much more than simply bigger under regulated banks a financialised economy will have a thriving banking system but it will also be characterised by rising household and corporate debt soaring asset prices huge capital inflows deindustrialisation and growing income wealth and regional inequality in the us and the uk the deregulation of commercial banking and the removal of restrictions on capital mobility led to a lending boom in the 1980s banks faced far fewer restrictions on their ability to create money by extending credit and mortgage lending in particular soared as the money directed into property markets increased faster than the housing stock property prices boomed rising house prices allowed consumers to borrow even more by releasing the equity from their homes capital from all over the world flowed into british and american property and financial markets pushing up the value of the currency and harming exporters as tax revenues from the sector flowed into treasury coffers the state s willingness to regulate it waned economists failed to pay attention to any of these indicators before the crash instead dubbing the period between 1989 and 2007 the great moderation a time of high growth low inflation and generalised economic and financial stability only when the boom finally ended did they realise the veneer of moderation had concealed a wellspring of excess but the financial crisis did not spell the end of financialisation instead it heralded another phase of its expansion since the financial crisis property prices in sydney and melbourne have risen 105 per cent and 94 per cent respectively private debt to gdp which includes all household and corporate debt has increased from 184 per cent of gdp in 2010 to 205 per cent today household debt is more than 200 per cent of average incomes making australian households some of the most indebted in the world as major cities have boomed those areas less reliant on the finance insurance and real estate fire economy have stagnated sydney alone produces nearly a quarter of the nation s gdp with melbourne responsible for another 20 per cent wealth inequality has risen significantly and stagnant wages and rising profits have led the australian council of trade unions actu to conclude that australia is facing us levels of inequality wandering around the conference i was attending there was a palpable sense of disappointment in the air in allowing the boom to continue as long as they have australia s political and economic elites have clearly prioritised short term profits over the nation s long term economic health yet at last month s general election which many expected to bring the opposition labor party to power voters handed victory to the free market liberal national coalition i was surprised by the shock over the election result radical governments don t come to power when the finance sector is booming property prices are rising and billions of pounds worth of new money is being created out of thin air every day it is only when the boom gives way to a bust and peoples expectations of constantly rising living

in late 2016 the government introduced bond notes a kind of bearer cheque designed to address a chronic shortage of physical united states dollars in the country in late 2016 the government introduced bond notes a kind of bearer cheque designed to address a chronic shortage of physical united states dollars in the country it was hard to fault the logic of zimbabwe s finance minister mthuli ncube during the shock introduction of the new zimbabwean dollar on monday when he said it means anyone who wants to buy goods or shop or pay for services within the borders of zimbabwe ought to go to a bank or a bureau de change or some other institution to change their foreign currency into domestic currency and to spend that whichever way they wish to spend that s what normal countries do the much maligned minister is right this is exactly what ought to happen that is what normal countries do but there is nothing normal about the economic crisis in zimbabwe where thanks to decades of woeful and probably criminal mismanagement of the economy the normal rules now simply do not apply the original zimbabwean dollar was abandoned just over a decade ago when annual inflation had reached 89 700 000 000 000 000 000 000 that s 89 7 sextillion percent this hyperinflation the second worst in recorded human history was caused when president robert mugabe s government began to print money to get itself out of political trouble once they started printing money they could not stop until eventually the currency was completely worthless the old zimbabwean dollar was replaced eventually by a basket of currencies including the us dollar and the south african rand this stabilised the economy and crucially it greatly limited the government s power to meddle in monetary policy after all there was no way that zimbabwe s hapless administrators could print more us dollars or could they in 2016 the government introduced bond notes a kind of bearer cheque designed to address a chronic shortage of physical us dollars in the country because zimbabwe imports far more than it exports foreign currency has an unfortunate habit of leaving the country and never coming back this was not a new currency the central bank insisted and it was supposedly backed by a us 200 million loan from the african export import bank but the public was not buying it although bond notes officially traded at 1 1 with the us dollar unofficially they began to lose value almost as soon as they were introduced in 2019 the central bank tried again this time the pseudo currency was called the real time gross settlement rtgs dollar effectively a digital currency and the bank abandoned the pretence that it would be equivalent to the us dollar instead suggesting that 2 5 rtgs dollars to us 1 would be an acceptable exchange rate again the rtgs dollar began to lose value immediately this week it was trading at between 11 and 12 against the dollar there is a pattern here each attempt to introduce a new currency by the backdoor has failed with consumers overwhelmingly rejecting it they are nervous that any form of currency introduced by the current administration will lose its value and quickly and they have every reason to be although the president may be new with emmerson mnangagwa replacing robert mugabe in late 2017 the current administration is not that far removed from that which presided over the collapse of the original zimbabwe dollar wiping out the savings of most citizens in the process that s why the new zimbabwe dollar which combines both bond notes and rtgs dollars and makes it illegal to use foreign currency including us dollars and rands is unlikely to work the new currency was introduced on monday without prior consultation and without implementing any of the hard reforms necessary to overhaul zimbabwe s economy this is chaotic said a spokesperson for the opposition movement for democratic change it s nuts said a prominent human rights lawyer if you have us dollars on your person in your bank account your foreign currency or nostro account it s your money you can keep it there or do whatever you like except that if you want to go into a shop in zimbabwe you should change it into domestic currency mthulincube the foundation of any successful currency is trust on their own bank notes are worthless pieces of paper bank balances are little more than an encrypted string of electronic information people have to trust that those pieces of paper are worth something when that trust evaporates so does the value of the pieces of paper as anyone who has ever handled a 100 trillion zimbabwe dollar bill can attest so the government can introduce as many new zimbabwean dollars as it likes but until zimbabweans trust that this currency will retain its value they are unlikely to embrace it in a nation that is currently experiencing shortages of everything from bread to petrol to power trust is still the commodity in shortest supply and with its long dismal track record of economic mismanagement this government is in no position to regain it simon allison writes in his personal capacity this article was first published in the mail guardian
ever been stuck in an elevator i have with five other people near the 40th floor in an office building in midtown manhattan it was 1987 and i was working in the building as an editor on venture magazine a financial publication i rang the bell for help and a voice told us to stay calm the wait was nerve wracking about 20 minutes later after a violent lurch the elevator started working again and we all laughed nervously in relief later that same year the markets took the elevator right through the floor the black monday crash of october 19 1987 eventually bankrupted the magazine the entire staff was thrown out of work i found a new job in washington dc as a press secretary in congress but that s another story for another day there s an old wall street adage the market takes the stairs up and the elevator down that s just a colorful way of saying that the market tends to drop faster than it rises we ve seen this dynamic play out in recent months and it s likely to become more pronounced as the second half of 2019 unfolds even a hint of bad news has the power to suddenly crush stocks the markets rise when it appears that the u s and china are making progress on trade they plunge when trade peace doesn t come one day federal reserve chair jerome powell says something that the market construes as positive and the markets rise the next day powell makes a vaguely negative statement and stocks tank as of this writing on wednesday morning the three main u s stock indices were trading higher after u s treasury secretary steven mnuchin told cnbc that there s a path to complete a u s china trade deal we re witnessing yet another pavlovian response from wall street my advice ignore the spin and posturing of government bureaucrats on television official assurances are cheap and easily abandoned during my days as a press secretary for a member of the house i was always amazed at how willingly the media carried water for public officials white noise in the media has been triggering wild market swings that should trouble you it s a sign that the bull market is unhealthy the market battles ahead as i peer ahead to the second half of this year i see simultaneous battles waged on many fronts the u s vs china donald trump vs powell economic expansion vs recession earnings growth vs earnings slowdown president trump and xi jinping are scheduled to meet at the g20 summit which starts friday investors are hoping that a trade truce will be achieved but i m skeptical trump probably wants to continue bashing china all the way up to the 2020 election it plays well with his base if the g20 meeting proves to be empty theatrics as i think it will investors will be disappointed and stocks could sell off economists at ubs group nyse ubs said monday that failure at the g20 to stem the trade war would greatly increase the likelihood of a global recession and bear market in the second half of 2019 federal reserve policy also is whipsawing investor emotions last week s federal open market committee fomc meeting gave markets what they anticipated the status quo on rates but the removal of the word patient in the statement which investors interpreted as setting the table for a rate cut as early as july in the immediate wake of the fomc meeting markets rose but consider yesterday s stock market decline triggered by powell s on the one hand on the other hand remarks as powell said in a prepared statement against the backdrop of heightened uncertainties the baseline outlook of my fomc colleagues like that of many other forecasters remains favorable with unemployment remaining near historic lows inflation is expected to return to 2 over time but at a somewhat slower pace than we foresaw earlier in the year however the risks to this favorable baseline outlook appear to have grown powell cited the trade war and slowing global economic growth as risks he reiterated that the fed would act as appropriate to sustain the expansion which is fed speak for leaving the door open to a rate cut this year but it wasn t enough for donald trump who has broken precedent by attacking his own fed chair trump likened fed officials to a stubborn child and again called for an accelerated timetable of rate cuts the trump powell battle has prompted investors to embrace safe haven investments long term treasuries are getting bid up as traders expect a near term cut to interest rates other safe haven assets such as utility and real estate stocks as well as gold are enjoying a tailwind soft or hard landing then there s the rising risk of recession damage from tariffs and the concomitant slowdown in global growth have stoked recession fears exacerbating the pressure is the inverted yield curve the yield spread between the 10 year treasury note and the 3 month treasury bill has been in inverted territory for about a month that s a time proven warning of a looming recession read this story the name of the game is bond treasury bond economic cycles typically last between five and eight years the current expansion is more than 10 years old we re overdue for a downturn the big question is will the economy execute a soft or hard landing it s foolish to try and time these things but the pronounced slowdown in corporate earnings growth seems to indicate that the landing could be hard according to the latest projections from research firm factset the estimated earnings decline for the second quarter for the s p 500 stands at 2 6 if 2 6 turns out to be the actual earnings decline for the quarter it will represent the first time the s p 500 index has posted two consecutive quarters of year over year declines in earnings since q1 2016 and q2 2016 what about corporate earnings growth in the third quarter are analysts pessimistic yep consensus estimates for earnings growth for q3 have been falling over the past few months as of this writing the expected earnings decline stands at 0 3 see chart what s hurting corporate earnings the stimulus from the 2017 tax cut is wearing off just as the deleterious effects of tariffs kick in the trade war is dampening global growth and undermining business confidence the international monetary fund recently cut its outlook for global growth to 3 3 the lowest since the 2008 2009 financial crisis wall street is pricing in a rate cut which is a dangerous assumption powell has pointedly defended his autonomy against the president s attacks unless there is a pronounced deterioration in economic data between now and the end of july the fed will probably stand pat that would leave many investors disappointed and weigh on stocks but over the long run it would be a prudent move for the central bank the fed will need some tools at its disposal when the economic downturn actually hits indeed goldman sachs nyse gs recently predicted that the fed won t cut rates this year and dismissed such hopes as misguided problem is further easing is now baked into the markets betting on government policy or trying to time the economic cycle is like gambling in vegas don t make decisions based on your hopes follow the actual data and stick to your long range investment goals when

has gold price broken out or not technicals and fundamentals a casual glance at the latest short term chart for gld would tend to support the notion that yes gold has decidedly broken out of its trading range and is headed higher below is a two year chart of gld bigcharts marketwatch com now that we are all on the same page let s step back a moment and ask a couple of questions what happens next and if this is the big one how high might gold go some analysts are pretty quick to point out that this move was expected and is only the beginning of much higher prices for gold they and others also point to expected huge increases in inflation and the signs of a recession as fundamentals that support higher gold prices some think that a collapse in stock prices is imminent and will confirm what they already know or worse that another credit collapse is coming and when you throw in political turmoil social unrest trade wars and world wars well you get the picture everything seems to lend support to the expectation of higher gold prices there seem to be a plethora of fundamentals that support higher gold prices but do they before we answer that let s look at another chart this one is a ten year chart of gld prices in looking at this chart it seems clear that gld has been contained within a reasonably narrow range bounded by 105 on the downside and 135 on the upside over the past six years so let s ask again has gold broken out or not i don t think anyone can say yes decisively some further sustained price action on the upside is necessary before a conclusive call can be made if you are a super bull when it comes to gold you might be wondering why the short term charts look so bullish there are two reasons the first is that the short term charts use daily prices for plotting purposes whereas the long term charts use weekly prices the second reason is that the combination of using weekly prices and plotting the changes on a longer term basis tends to smooth out some of the more extreme short term price action looking at the second chart above again it would take a price for gld solidly above 135 along with sustained price action above that level to signal a clear break for gold out of its current six year trading range we are not there yet and until we are talking about new highs in gold prices is premature this is confirmed when we look at charts of actual gold prices themselves below is a ten year chart macrotrends net of prices for physical gold in this chart the price action for gold over the past six years is also contained in a trading range the range is between 1100 00 per ounce on the downside and 1400 00 per ounce on the upside if the price of gold were to move decisively higher from here say to 1500 00 or even 1600 00 per ounce then it would be more reasonable to claim a breakout had occurred then there will be more to talk about now lets talk about fundamentals for gold here is where the arguments for higher gold prices seem to break down that is because what everyone refers to as fundamentals for gold are not fundamentals at all they are events or situations that have nothing to do with gold prices and some of them are contradictory for example a recession is a period marked by a decline in economic activity a decline in economic activity can worsen and develop into a full scale depression during a depression the prices of goods and services would decline as well as investment prices for stocks commodities and real estate these are conditions that are symptomatic of deflation deflation is an increase in the value of a currency deflation is just the opposite of inflation and not a condition that would bring about higher gold prices as contrasted with deflation there are expectations for the effects of inflation to be much worse ahead and sooner and that is certainly possible but it is not a foregone conclusion some are saying that because the fed has changed their stance on interest rates and are now apparently pursuing a more accommodative easing of money and credit that gold has been given a green light on the road to much higher prices that is not necessarily so if the overwhelming inflationary impact of the fed s efforts a decade ago were barely able to keep us from falling into a bottomless pit of depression and deflation how is it that anyone thinks that things would be that much different this time around the fed continues to react to the same news and headline statistics that we all see and hear and whatever actions they take have less and less impact see fed inflation is losing its intended effect as bad as trade war can be for the economy trade wars usually result in declines in economic activity and can be triggers for recessions and depressions as we said these conditions highlight the forces of deflation not inflation there is only one thing that affects the price of gold that one thing is the us dollar nothing else matters gold s price is a reflection of what is happening to the us dollar any conditions you can possibly imagine that could take gold prices higher no matter how severe will not have any lasting impact on gold prices it is all about the us dollar see what s next for gold it s all about the us dollar below is a ten year chart of dxy the us dollar index it is not my preferred choice for analysis for many reasons see gold us dollar vs us dollar index but since most are familiar with it we ll use it as you can see the us dollar index has been contained in a trading range of its own for the past five years the range between 90 on the downside and 100 on the upside is consistent with price action of gold for the past several years and similar to gold the us dollar has not broken out of its trading range even though short term charts may indicate otherwise in the us dollar s case any breakout must be to the downside in order to confirm any breakout to the upside for gold looking at all of this it seems quite possible that breaks to the downside for gold and upside for the us dollar are just as likely this would be directly the opposite of what many are expecting but here are a couple of long term charts that show how much downside potential exists for gold prices both charts are of the same one hundred year history of gold prices the difference is that the second chart is inflation adjusted both charts show a fifty year uptrend in the gold price dating back to 1970 looking at the first chart gold s price could move basically sideways over the next several years and even fall as low as 1000 00 per ounce without violating the significantly steep uptrend that is in place looking at the second chart we can see that there is a lot more room on the downside for gold prices in today s dollars gold could possibly fall as low as 575 00 per ounce before you discount that possibility entirely please remember that we are at a juncture in time and space that bears some similarity to that which occurred several years after the 1980 peak in prices after its peak price of 850 00 per ounce in january 1980 gold s price fell over the next five years to near 300 00 per ounce by january 1985 three years later it was almost sixty percent higher at 500 00 per ounce after that gold went sideways for nearly ten years and eventually fell back to sub 300 00 per ounce prices something similar today could take gold back to 600 800 00 per ounce even if gold prices currently are headed for 1500 1600 00 per ounce it doesn t mean that everything has changed we are still in a long term decline in gold prices and there is possibly more to come the only thing that will change that is if the us dollar renews its long term descent into oblivion right now that is not happening kelsey williams is the author of two

menafn venezuelanalysis com the blockade in context the u s has been pursuing a strategy of regime change through destabilising venezuela dating back to the early years of hugo chávez s presidency this led george w bush s administration to support the failed coup d état against chávez in 2002 and also the right wing management lock out in the oil industry the lock out while ultimately unsuccessful cost billions of dollars in lost revenues and had a catastrophic impact on the government s social projects declassified us government documents and wikileaks material have shown that the us has subsequently used covert financial political media and diplomatic activities in pursuit of its goal including channelling millions of us dollars to right wing opposition groups to support their bid to destabilise and topple the elected governments of both presidents chávez and maduro but with the repeated failure of us financed efforts by venezuela s right wing opposition to overthrow the government even after two major campaigns of street violence and sabotage in 2014 and 2017 the us government decided to take a central role in the strategy of regime change as part of this shift the us under president obama s administration adopted the use of unilateral illegal sanctions against venezuela under president trump sanctions which can take various forms have become focused towards creating an extensive economic blockade of the type employed against cuba since the early 1960s the us with the complicity of canada and the eu has adopted a strategy of financial strangulation against venezuela this involves amongst other aggressive measures an oil embargo the international blocking of bank accounts and obstruction of financial transactions outside venezuela severely affecting the state s capacity to import food medicine or anything else the intention is to attack and dislocate the bolivarian social model seeking its collapse in order to dismantle it to pursue this full scale economic war against venezuela the us state department has applied 150 coercive measures against the country the us sanctions have been intensified since the failure of the us backed attempted coup of juan guaidό launched in january 2019 at the same time comments from trump himself vice president pence and secretary of state pompeo have included threats of military action against venezuela having created the conditions or the perception of economic and political collapse in venezuela through the blockade this could take the guise of an international i e us humanitarian intervention in military form or support for a coup d état by sections of the military the pressure campaign is working the financial sanctions we have placed on the venezuelan government have forced it to begin becoming in default both on sovereign and pdvsa its oil company s debt and what we are seeing is a total economic collapse in venezuela so our policy is working our strategy is working and we re going to keep it u s department of state january 9 2018 are us sanctions legal us sanctions date from april 2015 following president obama s executive order a month earlier permitting them on the grounds that venezuela is an unusual and extraordinary threat to us national security and foreign policy each executive order since then declares that because of the situation in venezuela the united states is suffering from a national emergency this designation is required by us law in order to impose such sanctions and is invoked under the 1976 national emergencies act however there is no genuine basis for declaring venezuela an unusual and extraordinary threat to us national security nor in saying that the us is facing a national emergency for president trump the definition of a national emergency is so flexible that he invoked the act in february 2019 when declaring a national emergency to sidestep the need for congressional approval for funds to build a border wall with mexico the unilateral sanctions imposed by the trump administration are illegal under the charter of the organization of american states oas especially articles 19 and 20 of chapter iv they are also illegal under international human rights law as well as treaties signed by the united states they have no mandate from the united nations the sanctions fit the definition of collective punishment of the civilian population as described by the geneva article 33 and hague conventions to which the usa is a signatory alfred de zayas a former secretary of the un human rights council hrc and an expert in international law who toured venezuela in 2018 and produced a report for the hrc has recommended among other actions that the international criminal court investigate economic sanctions against venezuela as possible crimes against humanity under article 7 of the rome statute idriss jazairy the un s special rapporteur on coercive measures impact on human rights has also voiced his major concerns about us sanctions against venezuela in january 2019 he said coercion whether military or economic must never be used to seek a change in government in a sovereign state the use of sanctions by outside powers to overthrow an elected government is in violation of all norms of international law 1 what are the key sanctions that make up the blockade the set of us financial sanctions to which new sanctions are continually being added to make them as comprehensive as possible aims at financially strangling venezuela s economy the measures include the prohibition to make dividend payments or

person or within the united states any digital currency digital coin or digital token that was issued by for or on behalf of the government of venezuela us executive order 13827 of march 19 2018 the absolute prohibition for individuals companies or entities to purchase venezuelan bonds of any kind any debt owed by the venezuelan government the sale transfer assignment or pledging as collateral by the government or government agency including the central bank and the state oil company pdvsa of venezuela of any equity interest us executive order 13835 of may 21 2018 sweeping new sanctions on venezuela s gold exports affecting anyone trading or having anything to do with trading venezuelan gold in the world market executive order 13850 of november 2018 further sanctions in january 2019 against pdvsa which included freezing us 7 billion in assets owned by its us based subsidiary citgo which has three oil refineries and oversees a nationwide network of pipeline and oil and gas stations in the us all these prohibitions apply to us persons entities or companies and those resident or operating within us territory or any jurisdiction within the us i e foreign individuals entities or companies but also apply everywhere else extraterritorially where the us can exert pressure and or enjoys support for the blockade how seriously has venezuela been affected by the sanctions a recent report 2 by the respected economists mark weisbrot and jeffrey sachs has found that most of the impact of these sanctions has not been on the government but on the civilian population among the impacts which have disproportionately harmed the poorest and most vulnerable venezuelans are an increase in disease and mortality for children and adults the report estimates that more than 40 000 deaths have since 2017 18 making the u s sanctions fit the definition of collective punishment as described in both the geneva and hague international conventions to which the u s is a signatory how specifically have the sanctions impacted on venezuela s economy venezuela as a predominantly oil based economy is inherently vulnerable to effects of a blockade it is the export of oil that provides the venezuelan government with the revenue in foreign exchange that is needed to import essential goods food medical equipment spare parts and equipment needed for electricity generation water systems or transportation by blocking payments to venezuela the sanctions cut deeply into these export earnings and therefore the government s revenue and reduce the government s ability to import these essential goods at the same time sanctions that constrain the venezuelan government s ability to operate freely in the global market further restrict its essential financial dealings specifically the sanctions levied in august 2017 prohibited the venezuelan government from borrowing in us financial markets and this prevented the government from restructuring its foreign debt through issuing new bonds executive order no 13808 prohibited the direct or indirect purchase of securities of all types from the venezuelan government thus drawing a wide range of banks and financial institutions into the net of sanctions sanctions have also had an indirect but severe impact on the oil industry s output the loss of credit and therefore the resources to maintain production levels through maintenance and new investment have led to production plummeting weisbrot and sachs have suggested that the loss of so many billions of dollars of foreign exchange and government revenues was very likely the main shock that pushed the economy from its high inflation when the august 2017 sanctions were implemented into the hyperinflation that followed additionally the financial sanctions carry heavy extra costs in higher interest payments more expensive transport costs and concrete losses from the illegally confiscated assets whose total thus far experts calculate to be in the region of us 30 billion how have the sanctions impacted on venezuela s people the immediate impact of the sanctions levied in 2017 was that a series of banks across latin america europe asia and the united states were all unable in the remaining months of the year to process standard commercial transactions with venezuela including payments for imports of food and medicines these included for example a tranche of purchases of food basic supplies and medicines worth 39 million a delay of four months in the acquisition of vaccines requiring the rescheduling of vaccination schemes in the country as the sanctions have continued to bite the effects have also included the withholding by euroclear a belgium based financial services company of at least us 1 2bn that the venezuelan government would use to purchase food and medicines us based citibank financial institution refused to accept money venezuela was depositing to pay for importing a huge cargo of insulin for diabetic patients holding up the shipment for many days in port the blocking of a shipment of primaquine an anti malaria medicine from a colombian laboratory on the orders of its government forcing venezuela to buy it and other medicines for chronic illnesses in india international banks suspended payments to foreign suppliers for three months holding up the arrival of 29 container ships carrying supplies needed to process and produce food products in venezuela in september 2017 18 million food packages provided by the government could not be distributed because payments for food imports were blocked requiring complex payment transactions with various allied countries to secure the imports banks illegally retaining venezuelan financial resources at 30 april 2019 bank country us novo banco portugal 1 547 322 175 bank of england uk 1 323 228 162 clearstream london uk 517 088 580 sumitomo us 507 506 853 citibank us 458 415 178 euroclear belgium 140 519 752 banque eni belgium 53 084 499 delubac france 38 698 931 41 other banks and financial institutions 17 various countries 654 142 049 total 5 470 030 641 a clear example of how sanctions have directly impacted on vulnerable venezuelan citizens is that 24 venezuelan patients in italy awaiting bone marrow transplants can no longer have their treatments and expenses paid for as a result of the us s seizure of citgo which had previously covered the costs funds from citgo worth 5 million euros 5 57 million allocated as payments for bone marrow transplants for venezuelan patients and held at portugal s novo banco are frozen as a result to date three children have died how has trump tightened the blockade in 2019 in tandem with the trump administration s recognition of juan guaidό s unconstitutional declaration of himself as interim president of venezuela a series of executive orders approved swingeing new sanctions on venezuela as well as additional sanctions tied in with the us s recognition of guaidό s attempted coup and his concept of a parallel government the net effect of these actions has been to drastically reduce venezuela s ability to produce and sell oil or to sell any foreign assets of the government since its most important foreign assets have been frozen and or confiscated this has reduced still further foreign exchange earnings that would be used to buy essential imports such that imports of goods are projected to fall by 39 4 from 10 billion to 6 1 billion this will undoubtedly have an even more severe impact on the lives and health of ordinary venezuelans especially the poorest and most vulnerable in particular venezuela has been cut off significantly from its largest oil market the united states which in 2018 had bought 35 6 of its oil exports at the same time the trump administration has tried to pressure other countries such as india not to take up the slack as well as telling oil trading houses and refiners across the world to restrict further their trading with venezuela or face sanctions themselves even where such dealings are not prohibited by published us sanctions these moves were denounced as unilateral sanctions not against officials but against the general population of venezuela by venezuelan foreign minister jorge arreaza at a united nations meeting on april 25 2019 he went on to say we are campaigning for ourselves so that the world understands the consequences of the unilateral blockade of the us government on venezuela consequences that have taken the lives of thousands of venezuelans an immediate response by the trump administration was to add the foreign minister to the list of sanctioned venezuelan officials is britain involved in any way with sanctions on venezuela through its involvement in the european union the british government is a supporter of the sanctions regime unanimously agreed by the eu in november 2017 which consisted of sanctions targeted at 18 senior individuals coupled with demands for venezuela to ensure what it called free and fair elections in a speech at chatham house in october 2018 minister of state for the americas sir alan duncan warned that should the venezuelan government not accede to the demands fresh sanctions would be considered with britain s international partners in january 2019 foreign secretary jeremy hunt urged eu member states to impose new sanctions on venezuela in response jeremy corbyn criticised this call for further sanctions saying the future of venezuela is a matter for venezuelans jeremy hunt s call for more sanctions on venezuela is wrong we oppose outside interference in venezuela whether from the us or anywhere else there needs to be dialogue and a negotiated settlement to overcome the crisis in addition to the sanctions the bank of england although nominally independent of the government has taken its lead from the government by stopping 31 tonnes of venezuelan gold deposited in its vaults worth almost 1 billion from being repatriated to its rightful owners the venezuelan government what is the way forward the blockade will not help venezuela s people at all but simply exacerbate the country s problems and divisions sanctions will not help to facilitate a national dialogue to resolve venezuela s issues venezuela solidarity campaign will continue to work to support venezuela s right to national sovereignty and reject external intervention demand respect for international law obtain the immediate and unconditional lifting of all economic and financial sanctions which are illegal under international law and have criminal consequences support a process of dialogue to resolve differences

other s clients one company and its executive pleaded guilty while the other company and its executive proceeded to trial prior to trial the district court made two important holdings first the rule of reason would apply to the heir location agreement not the per se the court reasoned that per se treatment was inappropriate for an agreement structured in an unusual way that affected only a small number of estates in a relatively obscure industry the court added that the agreement may have contained efficiency enhancing potential second the court held that the statute of limitations barred prosecution and mere ministerial tasks like distributing payments did not extend the conspiracy beyond the agreement s stated termination date in july 2008 united states v kemp assocs inc no 16 cr

second ruling that the statute of limitations barred prosecution but found that it lacked jurisdiction to review the district court s rule of reason decision however the appeals court suggested that the district court might want to revisit its rule of reason order on remand since additional briefing at the appellate stage might be helpful in determining whether the rule of reason should apply united states v kemp assocs inc 907 f 3d 1264 10th cir 2018 in february 2019 the district court reversed its earlier rule of reason decision and determined that the agreement in the present case is a

the ftc and doj released joint guidance arguing that anti poaching agreements are per se such no poach or no hire clauses in employment contracts prohibit companies from soliciting one another s employees the guidance also stated that certain no poach agreements that are ancillary to otherwise pro competitive conduct will be subject to a quick look or rule of reason level of scrutiny while the recent activity has been confined to the franchise setting there is no reason to believe it will remain so confined in early 2018 doj assistant attorney general makan delrahim stated that the doj will criminally investigate and prosecute so called no poach agreements the doj brought its first case since the policy was announced reaching a civil settlement with two firms knorr bremse ag and westinghouse air brake technologies corp for allegedly agreeing not to recruit and hire each other s employees in announcing the settlement doj specified that it was handled civilly rather than criminally only because the conduct ceased when the guidance was announced in 2016 since then numerous state attorneys general have initiated antitrust investigations into the use of no poach agreements by franchise based fast food operations the washington attorney general has led the charge the washington ag has obtained agreements from 30 nationwide chains to eliminate the use of no poach clauses in their franchise contracts while the washington ag s investigation has expanded from fast food chains to other industries including hotels car repair gyms home health care convenience stores cleaning tax preparation parcel electronics repair child care custom window covering travel and insurance adjuster services several follow on civil class actions have since been filed by employees of certain franchise based companies mid year update the doj filed statements of interest in three civil suits in the eastern district of washington to inform the court of the doj s view as to what standard the court should apply to individual no poach agreements per se or rule of reason the doj maintains that strictly horizontal no poach agreements between competitors should be governed by the per se rule whereas vertical no poach agreements that are reasonably related to a legitimate business goal should be governed by the rule of reason in may 2019 the doj intervened in a class action alleging that duke university and the university of north carolina agreed not to permit the hiring of each other s medical faculty in 2018 the court certified a class consisting of faculty members with an academic appointment at either facility and in april 2019 the parties entered a proposed settlement the doj intervened to join the proposed settlement and to obtain the right to

indirect subsidiary s participation in the power cables cartel in its decision of april 2 2014 the commission applied its case law according to which a parent company that exercises decisive influence over a subsidiary can be found liable for the competition law infringements of that subsidiary more specifically the commission applied its parental liability presumption according to which a parent company is presumed to exercise such decisive influence when it wholly owns its subsidiary or holds almost all of the shares of its subsidiary the investment bank appealed the commission s decision arguing that it held less than 91 of the shares of the subsidiary that had participated in the cartel the general court rejected this argument and held that the parental liability presumption can be applied even if the parent company holds less than 100 of the shares of its subsidiary but is able to exercise all the voting rights in the subsidiary the investment bank has appealed the general

the canadian dollar is higher against the us dollar on wednesday the loonie rose slightly 0 38 percent versus the greenback with the price of oil also rising more than 2 percent the gold rally hit a speed bump with the yellow metal losing 0 41 percent as investors take profit on the current run and appetite for safe havens subsides the canadian currency traded h higher as treasury secretary stoked trade optimism by saying the deal is 90 percent done there is still little details on what that actually means and last time the market heard similar claims it was before a falling out that lead to tariff escalation from the us and china even if there is no major deal announcement the worst case scenarios are benign with a new round of talks the most likely outcome of the meeting as a sidebar of both leaders attending the g20 in japan the fed walked back market expectations of a 50 basis points cut with major dove fed president bullard suggesting a 25 basis points reduction would be more appropriate the fact remains that the fed could cut in the short term and that is boosting the loonie versus the greenback as economic data in canada validate the bank of canada boc staying on the sidelines by holding the benchmark rate at 1 75 percent and not follow other major central banks down the easing path just now oil crude higher after monster drawdown oil prices rose on wednesday after the release of the energy information administration eia weekly inventories report the higher than expected drawdown boosted crude prices with west texas intermediate rose 2 4 percent and brent 1 89 percent stronger demand in the us cause a 12 8 million drop in inventories destroying the 2 5 million forecast us production has been rising but at the moment the opec cut agreement us philadelphia energy solutions shutdown and geopolitical situations leading to sanctions against iran and venezuela are keeping supply levels low supply disruptions have added price stability in particular the production cut agreement by the opec but as doubts rise on what the fate of the g20 meetings will have on global growth and energy demand the deal could not get an extension it makes sense for major producers russia being the most vocal to delay their decision until they get a sense which way the us china trade war will unfold supply disruptions and lower inventories would push crude prices higher as middle east tensions remain high and with trade optimism at a level where at least trade relations could not get worse after a trump xi meeting gold gold rally stops as investors take profit eye g20 gold dropped 0 42 percent but given the strong safe haven rally the yellow metal is still trading above 1 409 42 middle eastern tensions will continue to remain high as iran and the us do not seem ready to back down and have in fact escalated their verbal attacks the g20 is looking to be a disappointment to investors looking for a blockbuster trade deal to be announced and is now expected to yield a new round of talks between the us and china to be held later this year the gold suffered another setback as two prominent fed members chair powell and fomc voting member and known dove bullard were less dovish than a week ago on tuesday a 50 basis point rate cut is off the table as per bullard next meeting but the sense that there is no urgency from the fed was not lost on the market us president trump was back on the offensive against the fed and he called the current monetary policy insane trump was disappointed that the fed did not cut rates in its june federal open market committee fomc meeting even though the fed has hinted at an upcoming rate cut the comments of 50 basis points being too much could end up with the central bank holding rates steady if economic indicators rebound in the short term today s data was mixed with core durable goods beating the forecast but the headline of new purchases by manufacturers going into negative territory for a second month in a row and with a downward revision to the previous data point stocks equities mixed on less dovish fed and g20 uncertainty equities continued to lose momentum on wednesday as middle eastern tensions trade anxiety and a less dovish fed did not combine to reassure investors the trump administration is trying to downplay expectations of a significant outcome of the upcoming meeting between presidents trump and xi in japan the two leaders will meet at a sidebar of their g20 commitments and given the huge distance in their negotiating positions there is now little probability of a major announcement on trade the fed chair and the most prominent dove in the fomc were less dovish than two weeks ago chair powell stressed the negative impact trade disputes have on economic growth but he continues to be hawkish on the american economy despite the latest indicators showing some softness powell remarked that even the tariffs have not put a lot of pressure the fed s chief main job at the moment is to manage the expectations of the market the g20 meeting is likely not to produce an agreement despite positive comments by us treasury secretary mnuchin but at least the two nations are back on the table powell could feel secure in calling current headwinds temporary awaiting a rebound of economic indicators such as gdp and the expected jobs rebound in the first week of july crypto bitcoin gets safe haven and libra boost bitcoin prices hit an 18 month high at it smashed the 13 000 price level and is trading at 13 619 on the back of facebook s entry into the crypto world the introduction of libra is validating the claim of bitcoin as an alternative asset class especially with current market conditions when investors seek to diversify to hedge against uncertainty the new easing monetary policy cycle is another factor contributing to the rise of bitcoin as appetite for higher yields could drive investors away from more traditional asset

by michael lebowitz john kelly white house chief of staff james mattis secretary of defense jeff sessions attorney general rex tillerson secretary of state gary cohn chief economic advisor steve bannon white house chief strategist anthony scaramucci white house communications director reince priebus white house chief of staff sean spicer white house press secretary james comey fbi director every week is shark week in the trump white house wrote the hill contributing author brad bannon in august of 2018 a recent brookings institution study shows that the turnover in the trump administration is significantly higher than during any of the previous five presidential administrations the concern is that for a president without government experience a rotating cast of top administration officials and advisors presents a unique challenge for the effective advancement of u s policies and global leadership bannon no relation to former white house chief strategist steve adds inexperience breeds incompetence although the sitting president has broken just about every rule of traditional politics it is irresponsible and speculative to assume either ineffectiveness or failure by this one argument one area of politics that falls within our realm of expertise is a rule that donald trump has not yet broken firing the chairman of the federal reserve following the december federal open market committee fomc meeting in which the fed raised rates and the stock market fell appreciably bloomberg news reported that president trump was again considering relieving the fed chairman of his responsibilities this has been a continuing theme for trump as his dissatisfaction with the fed intensifies not that trump appears concerned about it but firing a fed chairman is unprecedented in the 106 year history of the central bank having tethered all perception of success to the movements of the stock market it is quite apparent why the president is unhappy with jerome powell s leadership trump s posture raises questions about whether he is more worried about his barometer of success stock prices or the long term well being of the economy acquiescing to either trump or a genuine concern for the economic outlook chairman powell relented in his stance on rate hikes and continuing balance sheet reduction clamoring for favor notwithstanding the abrupt reversal of policy stance at the fed president trump continues to snipe at powell and express dissatisfaction with what he considers to have been policy mistakes before backing out of consideration steven moore s nomination to the fed board fits neatly with the points made above reflecting the president s irritation with the powell fed moore was harshly critical of powell and the fed s rate hikes despite a multitude of inconsistent remarks shortly after his nomination moore and the president s director at the national economic council larry kudlow stated that the fed should immediately cut interest rates by 50 basis point 1 2 of 1 those comments came despite rhetoric from various fronts in the administration that the economy has never been stronger now the kudlow and moore tactics are coming from within the fed st louis fed president james bullard dissented at the june 19th federal open market committee meeting in favor a rate cut then non voting member and minneapolis fed president neel kashkari publicly stated that he was an advocate for a 50 basis point rate cut at the same meeting all this with unemployment at 3 6 and gdp tracking better than the 10 year average of 2 1 given trump s stated grievance with powell bullard and kashkari could easily be viewed as trying to curry favor with the administration even if that is not the case to appear to be so politically inclined is very troubling for an institution and board members that must optically maintain an independent posture it is unlikely that anyone has influence over trump in his decision to replace or demote powell he will arrive at his conclusion and take action or not if the first two years of his administration tells us anything it is that public complaints about his appointed cabinet members precede their ultimate departure setting aside his legal authority to remove powell which would likely not stand in his way the implications are what matter and they are serious for more on our thoughts on the ability of trump to fire the fed chairman please read our article chairman powell you re fired prepare for this tweet given trump s track record and his displeasure with powell we should prepare in advance for what could come as a surprise tweet with little warning ignoring legalities if trump were to demote or fire powell it is safe to assume he has someone in mind as a replacement that person would certainly be more dovish and less prudent than powell under circumstances of a voluntary departure a replacement with a more dovish disposition might be bullish for the stock market however the global economy is a complex system and there are many other factors to consider we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us the first and largest problem is such a move would immediately erode the perception of fed independence direct action taken to alter that independence would cast doubts on fed credibility other sitting members of the federal reserve appointed board members and regional bank presidents would likely take steps to defend the fed s independence and credibility which could create a functional disruption in the decision making apparatus within the fomc further there might also be an active move by congress to challenge the president s decision to remove powell although the language granting trump the latitude to fire powell is obtuse he can be removed for cause it is unclear that presidential unhappiness affords him supportable justification that would be an argument for the courts financial markets are not going to patiently await that decision with that in mind what follows is an enumeration of possible implications for various key asset classes fx markets the most serious of market implications begin with the u s dollar usd the world s reserve currency through which over 60 of all global trade transactions are invoiced the firing of powell and the likely appointment of a trump friendly chairman would drop the value of the usd on the expectations of a dovish reversal of monetary policy the question of fed independence along with the revival of an easy money policy would likely cause the dollar to fall dramatically relative to other key currencies an abrupt move in the dollar would be highly disruptive on a global scale as other countries would take action to stem the relative strength of their currencies versus the dollar and prevent weaker economic growth effects the term currency war has been overused in the media but in this case it is the proper term for what would likely transpire additionally the weaker dollar and new policy outlook would heighten concerns about inflation with the economy at or near full employment and most regions of the country already exhibiting signs of wage pressures inflation expectations could spike higher fixed income the bond market would be directly impacted by fed turbulence a new policy outlook and inflation concerns would probably cause the u s treasury yield curve to steepen with 2 year treasuries rallying on fomc policy change expectations and 10 year and 30 year treasury bond yields rising in response to inflation concerns it is impossible to guess the magnitude of such a move but it would probably be sudden and dramatic indecision and volatility in the treasury markets are likely to be accompanied by widening spreads in other fixed income asset classes commodities in the commodities complex gold and silver should be expected to rally sharply while not as definitive other commodities would probably also do well in response to easier fed policy a lack of confidence in the fed and the president s actions could easily result in economic weakness which would lessen demand for many industrial commodities and offset the benefits of fed policy changes stock market the stock market response is best broken down into two phases the initial reaction might be an extreme move higher possibly a move of 8 10 or more in just a few days or possibly hours however the ensuing turmoil from around the globe and the potential for dysfunction within the fed and congress could cause doubt to quickly seep into the equity markets two things we know about equity markets is that they do not like changes in inflation expectations and they do not like uncertainty economy another aspect regarding such an unprecedented action would be the economic effects of the firing of jerome powell economic conditions are a reflection of millions of households and businesses that make saving investing and consumption decisions on a day to day basis those decisions are dependent on having some certitude about the future if the disruptions were to play out as described consumers and businesses would have reduced visibility into the future path for the economy questions about the global response inflation interest rates stock and commodity prices would dominate the landscape and hamstring decision making as a result the volatility of everything summary although economic growth has been sound and stocks are once again making record highs the market and economic disruptions we have recently seen have been a long time coming market valuations across most asset classes have been engineered by excessive and imprudent monetary policy the recent growth impulse is artificially high due to unprecedented expansion of government debt in a time of sound economic growth and low unemployment in concert excessive fiscal and monetary policy leave the markets and the economy vulnerable the evidence this year has been clear notwithstanding the federal reserve s role in constructing this false reality president trump has not served the national interest well by his public criticism of the fed if trump were to remove powell as fed chair the prior sentence would be an understatement of epic proportions

many people will no doubt be asking why did they tinker with it why didn t they just leave the electric utility infrastructre in california the way it was why deregulate in the first place well why because of unscrupulous people one of the most assinine lies voters and consumers have been asked to swallow in recent years is the panacea of privatization everything is better some opine when privatized and or deregulated medical care education transportation services the internet and of course public utilities it fosters competition and that means innovation and lower prices right wrong what it generally means is that a politician and a private citizen enter into a kind of scam a public resource or facility which has been developed and maintained with taxpayer dollars looks good to this private citizen colluding with said politician they negotiate for it to be privatized sometimes there is a sham auction sometimes the private citizen simply buys or is even awarded what they want a quick survey of news articles about these ownership transfers reveals a common trend these private citizens are getting some incredible deals maybe they called up that guy with the question marks all over his suit in america we have some wonderful old reactionaries running around defending privatization and bashing the alternatives as communism socialism one thing many have in common is a complete lack of actual working knowledge of how privatization of a given entity actually works at the nuts and bolts level you must admit it s been nagging you hasn t it i mean ford and chevrolet can compete we know how that works you can go to different dealerships and buy one kind of car or the other but how exactly can electric utilities compete you don t have redundant power lines coming into your home redundant outlets or redundant power plants though power plants are the most plausible of all of these alternatives that s what everyone who se thought about this at all must think is the real heart of the competition scheme for electrical utilities right you can have a bunch of different power plants buying oil and selling electrity to the grid right but there is the problem of distribution why after all can t new york loan california a little of it s juice oh what s that distribution of electricity in volume is nearly impossible over long distances up to 80 of generated power is wasted in the distribution network really no let me tell you how competition really works in the power generation business if you build power plants the power supply goes up and your product is worth less hence your profits go down if you do not build power plants and or take some of your plants off line the power supply goes down and then your product is worth more supply and demand whopee time to raise the rates this is exactly what s happened in new york as well as in other areas where this scheme has been foisted on the taxpaying public step one privatize and deregulate the utilities step two surprise your rates just went up and hey it s dark in here the only difference is that in california the power distributors were not allowed to pass on the rate hikes to consumer causing the slight backup of money to the privateers no matter they ll be paid with public debt instead why because supply and demand economics and electrical utilities are the proverbial square peg and round hole you have to have your brains leaking out your ears to think this one would work markets are clever but not a panacea and if your attention span is long enough you will remember from the beginning of this writeup that the very power plants that are now price gouging you so hard that in another hour and a half you won t have the juice to even surf this site the very power plants that over the past three months have suddenly had the wherewithal to raise their rates almost 100 fold were constructed in many cases with your tax money or a government s gaurantee of debt and sold to a political crony for the express purpose of perpetrating this very situation the only possible way the private power generation companies can fail to get rich is by doing what they re supposed to which is provide ample cheap environmentally sound generating capacity if you want to make money on the other hand the opposite is true it s in the private utility s best interests to use the cheapest dirtiest power generating techniques available to encourage as much waste as possible and to cultivate their most profitable buyers at the expense of their least profitable low and middle income customers the other writeup here makes this sound almost like a little accident by california s political crew there is nothing accidental about that privatization of public utilties it s premeditated systematic theft of the public trust it has come to my attention that some people i e the ceo of national grid usa have been going around saying that the power shortage is due to california s and i quote absurdly restrictive environmental controls preventing the building of new power plants despite california s absurd restrictions the california environmental quality act which i doubt he s read is hardly what i d call absurd approximately 6 300 megawatts worth of new facilities or 13 of the state s total generating capacity have received approval regulation ironically is what they lack or they would be online already i quote the new york times but the real reason for the energy shortfall is that no new plants were built in the 1990 s because prices were low supplies were plentiful and producers wanted to wait until they better understood the new era of deregulation hey do you think they understand it better now oh my it gets better there are people going around claiming that increases in oil and natural gas prices have caused the stretch perhaps if the privately held california power generators would volunteer to raise their prices only to cover the exact increase in fuel oil costs no not interested in doing that for some reason funny that s what would have happened before under a regulated electic utility the generators would simply make a rate case which if validateable would be approved and pass along the increased fuel prices directly in your electric bill of course that would leave little room for exaggeration but then that s what this entire charade is all about i apologize to the crowd for capn haggis s smashing ignorance of the new utility infrastructure in california you see haggis

with a population of over 200 million and gross domestic product gdp of over us 2 trillion the region s attention is fixed on the new president of brazil jair bolsonaro who has said we will facilitate things for investors who want to build and maintain infrastructure in brazil through a consistent plan of public private partnerships and privatisations in fact jair bolsonaro s government has already begun fulfilling the promise made to open the country s economy to the international market concessions and privatisation in just three months of management the new government has begun an agenda of concessions and privatisation so far the state s asset disposal program has managed to generate concessions the right to use land or property for a specified purpose granted by a government for a highway and 12 small and medium sized airports in different parts of the country contractor ccr group won the concession for a 473 4km stretch of road in the south of the country under the condition of widening the portion of the road which was transferred to the company in the next 30 years ccr must invest a figure close to us 2 billion on this development improving travel in the two southernmost states of brazil show fullscreen the 12 airport concessions were pushed for by the ministry of infrastructure as part of a plan that aims to accept bids for another 20 airports to be auctioned off to concessionaries later this year in the first of these airport auctions the government raised us 620 million ten times more than the state required for the 12 concessions critics of the government claim that the minimum set price was too low at a recent event in the city of são paulo the new government s infrastructure minister tarcisio gomes de freitas said the minister aims to optimise public and expand private investments in infrastructure in addition to unlocking works and renegotiating concession contracts that are unbalanced we have to be able to show foreign investors that brazil is a safe port in which to invest and that our projects are well structured and with total legal certainty however if economic growth does return to truly significant levels the existing infrastructure will not be able to withstand the increase in demand for electricity aware of this the new government announced the public auction dates for advance energy purchases there will be an auction each year from now to 2021 for contracting electricity generated by new plants the brazilian electrical sector regulatory agency announced the approval of the auctions in december 2018 which

on a solar power station in the province of jujuy argentina which will become the largest of its kind in south america the plant will consist of 1 2 million solar panels and will provide the grid with

global in nature and is creeping higher in surveys of voter concerns in some countries it s at or near the top but it s not regarded with the same urgency the world over a bloomberg collation of polls reveals some glaring disparities in the way the emerging crisis is viewed against other worries like jobs and security that presents a dilemma for political leaders on the one hand many face pressure to burnish their environmental credentials as climate action becomes a priority for voters and companies alike on the other they can be accused by political opponents of focusing on a distant threat at the expense of more immediate existential concerns like healthcare or supporting economic growth the divide is not simply financial but often between urban and rural voters making the task for politicians all the more complex in many countries climate and the environment has become a political battlefield on which elections are increasingly being fought european union elections in may saw an unexpected surge in support for green parties yet australia s ballot the same month saw the pro environment coal industry skeptic labor party loses rural votes and the election even as it picked up support in major cities canada s fall vote is shaping up to be dominated by carbon taxes levied on fossil fuels as group of 20 leaders prepare to meet in japan this week the risk is that existing ideological differences over climate change are compounded by differing voter expectations of action putting any chance of consensus further out of reach consider the g 20 host japanese polls suggest that voter perceptions of the importance of addressing climate change have fallen in recent years showing the issue is not just one of rich world versus poor world the picture is further clouded by signs of concern when voters are specifically asked a march survey by japan s ministry of foreign affairs found the topics the public most wanted to be discussed at the g 20 were ocean plastic 49 3 followed by climate change 48 1 the implication may be that electorates simply don t see individual governments as able to tackle a global matter like climate and look to the g 20 for action here are

reasons including a surge in demand an increase in financial aid a lack of state funding a need for more faculty members and money to pay them and ballooning student services the cost of college has made a degree less advantageous than it was 10 years ago one expert said visit business insider s homepage for more stories advertisement josh kirdy knows how to hustle when he s not working full time as an assistant store manager at universal orlando the 26 year old is on the prowl for side work landing stints walking dogs and putting in part time hours at a local mall retailer he developed this juggling act to put extra payments toward his 37 000 student loan debt i m happy with my life today and with the education i received but it s unfortunate that i ll be paying for it for another seven years at least kirdy who attended a four year public university told business insider he s set to pay roughly 300 a month in student loan repayments until he s 35 advertisement there are many factors behind the cost of college and some people have stressed one or another richard vedder an author and distinguished professor of economics emeritus at ohio university told business insider but the ultimate driver of cost vedder said is the sheer number of people vying for a college education higher enrollment has brought an expansion of financial aid programs a need to increase budgets for faculty pay and on campus student services and a decline in financial support from state governments college tuition has more than doubled since the 1980s kirdy is just one of the more than 45 million americans with student loan debt and contributing to a whopping national total of 1 5 trillion according to student loan hero the average student debt per graduate who took out loans is higher than ever at 29 800 these stats are especially troubling considering their effects on people s long term goals millennials are facing unique financial struggles previous generations weren t like having to save longer for increased housing costs something that hasn t been helped by the burden of student loan debt advertisement graduates in the northeast have more debt on average while those in the southwest had the least on average andy kiersz business insider i feel like buying a house is a total pipe dream at this point in my life but i m tightening my belt as much as possible to save for a down payment right now a water resources engineer who graduated from a public university with roughly 25 000 in debt told business insider four years later she owes just under 19 000 her 300 payments are set on autopay which reduces her interest by 2 5 a month it s more than her 260 income driven payment plan requires but she ll pay it down quicker this way thankfully i have usaa who has a great first time homebuyer program so i only need a 3 down payment to get started she said but without that i would be trapped in a rent cycle until a second income magically appears in my life boone porcher who owes 32 645 after five years at a public university started paying double his minimum payment two years after graduating so he could pay off his debt in five years advertisement i started to think more about their impact when evaluating my long term planning and i made the decision that i wanted the debt gone entirely asap porcher a 26 year old supply chain consultant told business insider personally i don t feel comfortable taking a loan on a house while having student loans boone porcher owes more than 30 000 in student loans courtesy of boone porcher a recent student loan hero report found that while wages have increased by 67 since 1970 college tuition has increased at a faster rate continuing to deliver a fair amount of sticker shock roxy novo told business insider her 60 000 student loan debt from attending a private college had slowed down her life plans the 22 year old commutes two hours every day from new jersey to her job as a studio artist fellow in new york city because her 500 monthly loan payment is equivalent to a portion of what it would cost to rent an apartment in the city she said i definitely cannot consider moving closer until i get a higher paying job and get a good chunk of my debt paid novo said i m trying to do the responsible thing and eliminate loans before considering any expensive fun things but it can be really hard when your friends are out traveling the world and moving to the city and you re swimming in debt advertisement college tuition was more affordable for older generations student loan hero reported citing figures from the college board from the late 1980s to 2018 the cost of an undergraduate degree has risen by 213 at public schools and 129 at private schools adjusting for inflation the annual cost of college before fees and room and board shayanne gal business insider from the 2016 17 to the 2017 18 school year the average cost of tuition and fees increased by more than 3 at private and public colleges according to the college board s trends in college pricing 2017 report at a four year nonprofit private institution tuition and room and board is 46 950 on average four year public colleges charge an average of 20 770 a year for tuition fees and room and board for out of state students the total goes up to 36 420 and then there are costs beyond tuition like living expenses one of the main reasons why i accrued so much debt was because my parents didn t save any money for me to go to college and they couldn t afford to contribute to the cause so i used student loans not only to pay tuition but also to cover living expenses that my part time job which paid 8 per hour couldn t cover kirdy said advertisement everyone wants to go to college the demand for higher education has risen dramatically since 1985 vedder said once demand goes up and nothing else happens that will raise prices according to the department of education us colleges expected a total of 20 4 million students in fall 2017 about 5 1 million more than in fall 2000 the rewards for college have expanded and grown from 1985 to a little after 2000 and sort of leveled off in the past decade vedder said college enrollment is higher than ever lucy nicholson reuters the increase in the student population indicates that the advantages college offers outweigh its overwhelming costs advertisement there s a fear of failure if you didn t have a postsecondary education vedder said and yet he said the advantage of a degree today is less than it was 10 years ago because of the rising cost the return on investment has fallen he added and 40 of kids don t graduate within six years still it s a vicious cycle of supply and demand the more students who want to attend college the more the cost of college increases and the more students borrow money advertisement from 2000 to 2012 the percentage of students who took out student loans jumped to 60 from about 50 according to a report by the american academy of arts sciences the report also found that they began borrowing more money too the median cumulative loan amount rose to 20 400 from 16 500 in that time theories suggest financial aid causes tuition increases more student borrowers might partly explain why government financial aid programs have grown enormously but that s also causing tuition increases according to vedder in 1970 financial aid programs were almost nonexistent he said generally middle income people didn t get money from the federal government the large majority of students did not in 1978 congress passed a bill known as the middle income student assistance act this made all undergraduates regardless of income class eligible for subsidized loans and middle income students eligible for pell grants according to naspa student affairs administrators in higher education more and more students started applying for financial aid vedder said advertisement knowing that students will get this financial aid money the university raises fees and takes advantage to capture that themselves vedder explained referring to an idea known as the bennett hypothesis named for a former education secretary who believed that more government aid for students led directly to college cost increases the hypothesis is an ongoing topic of political debate but it has some vertical support in vedder s eyes citing a statistic from the federal reserve bank of new york vedder said that for every new dollar of federal student aid tuition is raised by 65 cents though tuition rose in 1978 so did people s incomes making the burden of college less than it was in the 1940s vedder explained but between 1978 and 2015 the burden of college began to rise again as tuition fees doubled and economic growth slowed state funding can t keep up with enrollment terry hartle a senior vice president of the american council on education boils down the increasing cost of college to this many state governments have cut operating support for higher education for at least a generation and let colleges replace the lost revenue with tuition hikes advertisement states provide less and students and parents pay more hartle told business insider studies have shown that when state support is level or increasing tuition is flat but when state support declines tuition goes up roughly 80 of america s students attend public colleges so it s not an exaggeration to say that the biggest determinate of the price they will pay for their education is the budgetary decisions made by state governments the college board s report underscores hartle s theory it found that prices at public colleges and universities rise faster when government funding per student sees little growth or is slowing down in the 2015 16 school year appropriations money given to a school by the government per full time enrolled student were 11 lower than 10 years before when adjusted for inflation for public institutions state appropriations make up a significant portion of the college s revenue and in recent years the state appropriations have not been able to keep pace with enrollment jennifer ma a senior policy research scientist at the college board told business insider vedder however doesn t think state funding cuts are the main culprit at least at private schools advertisement the total number of state dollars has gone up a little but enrollments have risen dramatically so on a per student basis they re getting less money he said it s a factor but not dominant because private schools don t get money from the state colleges need to pay more professors just as it costs money to learn it costs money to pay teachers higher education is a labor intensive industry and productivity gains come slowly hartle said the primary mechanism for delivering higher education at most institutions are highly educated people he said acquiring and recruiting highly educated faculty and staff costs money especially in jobs with significant demand outside academia hartle said the sorts of things that could lower these costs such as larger classes more adjunct faculty and fewer full time professors shorter hours and fewer books in the library were immensely unpopular with students parents and the public advertisement professor salaries are a big part of school budgets tulane public relations flickr colleges spend much of their money on staff and compensation so they have been experiencing an increasing cost of health insurance and other benefits ma said adding that while university tuition allocations vary by institution most use a large percentage of tuition to pay professors salaries vedder believes the percentage of university budgets used for instruction has fallen over the past 50 years a typical university around 1970 would have allocated 40 directly for instruction mostly professor salaries he said nowadays it s more like 30 this decline in money for teachers and classes in addition to state funding cuts may help explain why the number of part time faculty members has increased over time to about 51 of total faculty in 2011 from 30 in 1975 according to research compiled by the american association of university professors advertisement with more part time faculty members universities can dole out lower wages and benefits saving money for noninstructional full time roles and a smaller group of tenured faculty whom they can try to attract with higher salaries student services like counseling and healthcare are growing many of these noninstructional roles are for student services another increasing cost in campus budgets services such as academic support personal counseling and healthcare have been on the rise hartle said these services are always added because of student needs and most schools once they begin to offer them are very reluctant to take them away he said adding that there s also been a reallocation from instruction to administration expenses known as institutional support and research vedder says there has been an explosion in the number of non teaching personnel on campus with several administrators at top universities making six figure salaries with fringe benefits and secretarial support he said about two thirds of university budgets had nothing to do with teaching but instead go toward things like advocates dormitories and facilities advertisement is the cost of college worth it the irony in the demand for a degree is palpable by contributing to an increase in tuition it has perhaps also made the college degree less advantageous over time to illustrate the diminishing value of a college degree vedder cited figures from the new york fed saying that one third of college graduates are underemployed and 13 are in a low paying job so is the cost of college worth it it depends who you ask and how you measure the value of a degree college isn t cheap but is it still worth it spencer platt getty images honestly i don t have a lot of job satisfaction and i don t plan on being an engineer for the rest of my life the water resources engineer said in terms of getting me a job that pays well maybe in terms of overall happiness probably not advertisement novo said loans were her only option for her first choice school a few schools offered scholarship money but she said she felt they wouldn t help her reach her goals the debt is definitely worth it she said i picked my college with the hope that it would get me my first job and that it would be in my field and in nyc i happily have a job with all those requests for porcher the regret isn t obtaining a college degree but the lack of planning that put him over 32 000 in debt looking back i wish i had worked for a year or two and saved up or did half college half work he said but my job now wouldn t be possible without my degree i m actually the highest ranking person without a master s or ph d if i didn t have a good job this would be an enormous burden

parts to the solar industry kapenga claims special interests looking to kill the tesla bill fed the press in an attempt to discredit myself and tesla which is a great company i feel like it brought my character into question the senator said while he said he agonized over how he would vote on the budget he said wednesday that he is now a definite yes he said he arrived at his decision in large part

as trade tensions escalate between the world s two largest economies china s neighbours are counting the losses and gains despite president trump s promises to reduce trade imbalances the u s trade deficit widened to a 10 year high in 2018 due to higher consumer and business spending fuelled by tax cuts and a stronger dollar instead of re shoring or bringing back factories to the u s most production is moving from china to america s other trading partners in asia china s competitors have benefited from u s import substitution yet analysts warn of weaker global economic growth as a result of disrupted supply chains and business uncertainty looking beyond the u s china economic rivalry what is left are forces of globalization and protectionism discussions about the u s china trade deficit often ignore the reality of supply chain distortions which overstate the u s china trade imbalance by an estimated 35 40 asia is the best case study of integrated supply chains especially for the technology sector it is thus important to shift the dialogue from u s china rivalry to the effects of globalization and protectionism in order to take an honest look at the facts this warrants a closer look at how economies and sectors are faring especially with respect to trade and investment flows trade flows a recent study by economists at nomura show certain countries have benefited from u s china trade diversion in vietnam increased exports provided a 7 9 boost to its gross domestic product gdp a 2 1 increase for taiwan and a 1 3 increase for malaysia meanwhile korea singapore and thailand have gained 0 8 0 7 and 0 5 of their gdps from increased exports respectively tariffs imposed on chinese goods make them more expensive and thus goods from other countries more price competitive this is a boon for exporters competing with china in industries such as electronics electrical machinery and furniture that being said countries gaining from increased exports to the u s also experience a fall in exports to china in many cases gains from trade diversion do not offset decreases from lower chinese demand countries like south korea taiwan vietnam and malaysia all export intermediate goods such as electronic parts and components for assembly in china before reaching u s markets most notably exports from taiwan fell 4 8 year on year in may and dropped 9 4 in korea marking at least six consecutive months of decline in both countries while some companies have gained new business many others caught in the middle of the global supply chain are losing out investment flows to avoid u s tariffs many companies have accelerated plans to shift production from china to other developing countries in asia including vietnam indonesia thailand and india often in the form of greenfield foreign direct investment fdi given rising costs and slower expected growth in china this certainty isn t a new trend still u s china trade tensions have given many companies the final push according to the asian development bank adb chinese companies nearly tripled their investment in developing asia in 2018 while u s investment surged 71 vietnam in particular saw an 81 increase in fdi in april compared to the same period last year having said that economies in south and southeast asia are not yet fully prepared to absorb all new fdi inflows due to a lack of skilled labour infrastructure deficits and regulatory uncertainty supply chains are sticky and moving them requires significant investment something not all companies can afford while sectors like shoes and toys are more footloose mid level manufacturing requires a more literate and numerate workforce for quality assurance nevertheless the substitution of low value added manufacturing away from china and towards emerging economies coincides with beijing s efforts to move china s industry up the value chain key takeaway if the u s strategy is to confront and contain china it is missing the mark the present trade conflict has revealed china s economic vulnerabilities and rallied its citizens and corporations to address them while trade and investment may be flowing out of the country china is motivated to develop its own industries and focus on its internal market to shift to higher value added industries what the u s already enjoys indeed china is bracing itself for a protracted confrontation the escalation of tensions neither helps the u s reduce its trade deficit nor contains china s efforts in becoming a dominant power in asia it has only accelerated strategic competition while some third party economies may benefit from trade diversion increased trade tensions will have a net negative economic impact on most countries due to dampened business confidence and falling chinese and u s demand due to higher prices unilateral protectionist strategies backfire because they tend to reduce growth everywhere especially for trade reliant open economies in asia if there is a slowdown in the chinese economy then other countries with china as its largest trading partner will suffer as well in a trade war between two of the world s largest economies there are no winners the u s china trade spat will have spillover effects with severe consequences for not only asia but the rest of the world today s highly integrated global supply chains ensure everyone is negatively impacted if either one is hurt without a doubt there are important discussions left to be had on investors access to markets intellectual property protection state subsidies and other trade distorting government interventions however this should be considered on a multilateral and not just bilateral basis at present a few may be helped but more are hurt and there is no accountability for those caught in the cross fire
to be sure parts of the economy such as construction and private consumption have held up supported by upward wage pressure from foreign worker restrictions and large long term building projects but with exports equal to about 200 per cent of singapore s gross domestic product a much larger weighting than those in neighbouring malaysia and indonesia bumping up domestic consumption is unlikely to meaningfully boost growth singapore must expect some fallout from global trade disruption prime minister lee hsien loong told reporters in bangkok over the weekend you cannot just step on the gas and speed up and make up for a less favourable external environment mr lee said the uncertainty is prompting businesses to cut costs as they prepare for a drawn out battle between the world s two biggest economies no one wants to invest now because they want to see what happens in the trade war said mr john kong chief executive of building materials supplier m metal which employs 64 people mr kong has asked his workers to turn off air conditioning units when they leave for lunch and to stop printing in colour not out of the woods singapore s economic data has been grim lately electronics exports a major driver of singapore s growth over the past two years saw their biggest decline in more than a decade hit by a global downturn in the semiconductor industry data showed last week overall exports in may declined the most in more than three years as shipments to china slumped in the labour market the number of retrenchments rose 40 per cent in the first quarter of 2019 from a year ago driven by cuts in the manufacturing sector according to official data released this month the monetary authority of singapore closely tracks data and there is a growing chance it may ease its currency focused monetary policy for the first time in nearly three years some say the central bank could even ease outside of its biannual meeting schedule as it did in january 2015 when it sought to counter deflationary pressures amid slowing growth but a more accommodative stance won t be enough to reinvigorate the economy said cimb private banking economist song seng wun as a weaker singapore dollar will not necessarily push up exports singapore businesses won t suddenly become so competitive that we are going to be selling a lot more of our goods and services he said the finance ministry also has limited space to help given already low tax rates along with numerous incentives and cost offsets and an expansionary budget this year

some figures may lead to minor discrepancies in totals mine plan and production summary the 2019 fs mine plan is based on an annual feed rate to the plant of 5 2mtpa of ore delivering higher grade ore in the early years of the project by stockpiling of lower grade material and subsequent drawdowns in the later years the first 2 5 years of production will be free dig oxide ore only in year 3 the sulphide circuit will be commissioned and as it ramps up to 2 2mtpa capacity the throughput of the oxide circuit will be correspondingly reduced to 3 0mtpa to maintain the combined capacity at 5 2mtpa oxide mine waste will be utilized as construction material for the tailings storage facility thereby reducing water management costs and closure costs associated with waste dumps the oxide ore is free dig and is composed of over 70 passing 150 micron material that requires minimal grinding before leaching the upper transition although relatively soft will require some grinding to achieve expected recoveries the oxide ball mill is sized to handle a 70 30 oxide to upper transition blend the lt and sulphide ore which require conventional drill and blast mining methods will be mined using a separate equipment fleet to account for the increased density abrasion and hardness the calculated drill and blast pattern for the lt ore and waste are significantly lower than sulphide material with most of the lt material being minable through machine ripping estimated gold production and diluted head grades for each year are summarized in the table below table 4 summary production schedule year

oxide circuit thereby eliminating the need to operate the sulphide sag mill mine plan oxides mining will be by a local contractor using a conventional diesel hydraulic excavator fleet and small 30t and 50t road type rear dump trucks ore and waste are all free dig material with little or no oversize material eliminating the need for drill and blast this type of load and haul fleet is common in burkina faso and west africa for similar free dig material and will provide the needed versatility for a mine plan having a large number of shallow pits of varying tonnage sulphides mining of the sulphides in the first three years of phase ii will incorporate the high grade p17s ore blended with higher grade material from the other sulphide zones to maximize the value of the project the schedule was developed to satisfy physical and practical constraints including a sustainable production profile achievable vertical advance rates practical use of low grade stockpiling and minimizing mining of oxides and sulphides concurrently within the same pits mining of the lt and sulphides will be by contractor with trucks suited to the more abrasive and denser rock types the lt requires a less dense drill hole pattern and lower powder factor than needed for sulphides mineral processing metallurgical testing has been ongoing on all ore types since 2008 the most recent testing on oxide material was completed by sgs in quebec in q4 2017 and included grinding and reagent optimization work testing on the lt and sulphide ores was completed in may 2019 by base metallurgical laboratories located in kelowna british columbia testing was performed on a series of composite and variability samples from the various pits test work included determination of grinding and abrasion parameters and the effect of grind size cyanide addition pre aeration and leach time on gold extraction results also included settling tests and tailings and waste rock characterization test work lycopodium has reviewed the historical and recent test data and based the process flowsheet on this work oxides the flowsheet and plant have been designed to process the soft fine grained ore which eliminated the need for a crushing plant ahead of the grinding circuit the ore is direct dumped across a static grizzly into a large hopper and onto a variable speed apron feeder from the apron feeder the ore is transferred to a conveyor that feeds directly to a ball mill the plant is designed with two ore transfer points and one conveyor thereby minimizing issues associated with wet sticky ore in the rainy season the ball mill is equipped with a variable speed drive sized to accommodate a wide range of ore types and hardness ball mill discharge is pumped to a cyclone cluster with the oversize reporting back to the mill and the undersize fed to a pre leach tank and seven stage cil circuit the cil tails are thickened to recover process water and then pumped to a lined tailings facility the tailings facility is designed to be zero discharge with water recovered in a decant tower and returned to the process water tank at the plant gold is recovered in a standard 10t carbon desorption plant finishing with electrowinning and smelting to produce gold doré bars sulphides the comminution circuit will consist of a primary jaw crusher followed by a sag mill in closed circuit with hydrocyclones and a recirculation pebble conveyor system a surge ore bin and dead ore stockpile are included in the design to provide surge capacity between the crushing and grinding stages the cyclone overflow will be thickened and transferred to the pre oxidation and leaching circuit after 24 hours leaching the leached sulphide product will be combined with the oxide mill product and fed to the cil circuit for an additional 24 hours of residence time and gold recovery onto carbon adr plant expansion the 2018 fs was designed with a 5t carbon elution circuit for gold recovery additional test work completed in 2019 indicated that this plant was undersized and a new 10t elution circuit has been incorporated in the 2019 fs this will allow carbon stripping to be completed on a more systematic basis and provide capacity for further expansion optimization of the tailing storage facility the 2018 fs was based on a tailings storage facility footprint that was restricted by the location of low grade ore stockpiles during the front end engineering and design feed this design was optimized which eliminated these stockpiles allowing for an expanded tsf footprint this has reduced tailings embankment construction quantities through the lom reducing both up front capital and ongoing sustaining capital project infrastructure the project benefits from a mining friendly jurisdiction a strong mining culture and excellent local infrastructure burkina faso has experienced rapid development of its mining sector over the past decade which has contributed to the growth of available mining contractors suppliers and skilled labour in addition the project is favourably situated only 85 kilometres from the capital city of ouagadougou accessed by a 5 kilometre all weather gravel road connecting to the main sealed highway rn4 that runs between the capital and the coast the company has already seen the benefit of this in certain early works contracts where mobilization costs have been significantly lower than anticipated offices and accommodation orezone has constructed a main camp kitchen and office complex including warehousing sample preparation facility and small vehicle repair shop the facility was upgraded in 2018 19 including new accommodation blocks for senior staff upgrades to the kitchen and dining facility and certain new offices for technical staff a contractor will continue to be responsible for all camp operations including catering cleaning and maintenance activities all communication systems including internet are in place power supply a heavy fuel oil hfo power station will be constructed at the process plant by an independent power provider ipp under a build own operate agreement the power station will be fitted with 7 x 1 6 mw heavy duty

and procurement will commence in q4 2019 orezone is working with cutfield freeman on its project financing initiatives and expects to progress financial discussions through 2019 the estimated time to construct the bomboré oxide process plant pre production is 23 months including time to excavate the ocr complete the phase 1 rap and a four month commissioning and ramp up of the process plant the critical path items are the phase i rap and ocr excavation timely completion of the phase 1 rap will allow commencement of the ocr excavation which will meet the water needs for commissioning start up and subsequent operations as the ocr is filled during the rainy season each year from may through october construction of the sulphide expansion will commence in the second full year of oxide operations with construction estimated to take 12 months the critical path for this expansion will be delivery and installation of the large sag mill and motors project opportunities many of the

leaders from the world s wealthiest countries will land in the japanese city of osaka for the annual g20 summit over the upcoming weekend eager to overhaul a creaky global economy further dimmed by uncertainty many pin their hopes on the g20 a mechanism that helped tide the world over two financial crises to prevent the world s two biggest economic titans from plunging headlong into a cold war however whether the mechanism can continue wielding its influence in the midst of riven economic governance remains in doubt before pinpointing its role in the trade wrangle let s take a look at how the g20 took shape and its evolution over the past two decades a little history of post wwii economic governance the g20 mechanism was born out of the need to tide over the 1997 asian financial crisis and largely based on the g7 operation model back then the world was reeling from the deepest recession since wwii and the g7 had difficulty dealing with its widespread consequences why then was there a g7 this mechanism one of the biggest structural developments in global geopolitics was facilitated by huge economic ills in the 1970s and also by the ending of the u s dollar s convertibility to gold so when was the u s dollar pegged to the price of gold that dates back to the bretton woods system adopted after wwii said zhang yanling a former executive vice president of the bank of china the g7 also served as a tool for washington to sustain the bretton woods framework at a recent forum held by the chongyang institute for financial studies at renmin university of china zhang noted that the financial system collapses always due to a crisis the four stages of g20 the history of the g20 can be divided into four periods since its inception after the wake of the asian financial crisis in 1999 as penned in a report on the history of the g20 mechanism by the chongyang institute the first period spans september 1999 to october 2008 consisting of ministerial level meetings the second dealt with crisis resolution lasting from november 2008 to june 2010 the u s s subprime mortgage contagion which soon spread to europe s banks nudged the 20 nations to inaugurate a summit that became an annual gathering years later the third stage from 2010 to 2015 saw seven summits from toronto to antalya and the fourth is the new globalization period from 2016 until now the g20 comprises the g7 plus developing economies such as china russia and india countries that have contributed the most to global economic growth in recent years the g20 s primary mandate reflects its conception which is to prevent future world financial crises by having nations with influential economies convene to anticipate such concerns for instance at the london summit in 2009 g20 leaders pledged over a trillion u s dollars to the world bank and the international monetary fund to help emerging market economies in the midst of the worst economic catastrophe since the 1929 great depression they also agreed to develop new financial regulations and create a supervisory body in recent years the summits have taken on political overtones such as the ones in 2017 that focused on climate change and global trade u s president donald trump had pulled out of the paris climate agreement that year so the meeting also offered a chance to discuss the ramifications of the u s pullout from the landmark global agreement g20 comes to a gridlock this mechanism was successful in its first and second stages global economic growth was registered at an annual average of 4 2 percent from 1999 to 2008 it slowed to 3 4 percent between 2009 and 2018 when europe was mired in an unfolding debt crisis and brexit the u s s rating was downgraded from its prized aaa to aa as well as financial crises sweeping through emerging economies like argentina south africa russia and brazil according to wang wen executive dean of the chongyang institute so why is the g20 losing its shine the u s is leaving the world leaderless and global governance is getting fragmented said he yafei former chinese vice foreign minister consensus is shrinking with wider chasms among major economies resulting in increasing suspicion and rivalry the complication and sensitization of international relations are weakening the foundation of the g20 s operation added he the man behind china s participation in the mechanism in addition he pointed out g20 s own defect in that it has neither secretary nor resident institution the growing divisions within the g20 also confront the mechanism with existential challenges its members have their own overlapping groupings comprising the advanced economies of the g7 developing economies of the brics and moderately strong nations in mitka these smaller allegiances could exacerbate the growing factionalism and further weaken the globalization made possible by these member economies on top of those concerns are the vicissitudes brought on by the trends of history looking back financial mechanisms have been dominated by hegemonies britain initiated the gold standard and the u s came up with the bretton woods system said zhang yanling but now the decline of hegemonies is leading to these changes to international financial systems and could shift the conversation of the g20 toward further consideration of emerging leaders given such changes to these well

federal reserve chairman jerome powell on tuesday said the us central bank is insulated from short term political pressures and that its policymakers are wrestling with whether to cut interest rates as president donald trump has demanded the fed is insulated from short term political pressures what is often referred to as our independence powell said in a speech he delivered at the council on foreign relations in new york but powell said he and his colleagues are grappling with whether current risks to the economy warrant a rate cut advertisement the fed which paused its rate hike campaign this year and suggested last week that it could cut borrowing costs as early as next month amid concerns about us trade disputes and other economic risks is facing increasing anger from trump the us president who has said as recently as this weekend that he has the power to demote powell said on twitter on monday that the fed doesn t know what it is doing adding that it raised rates far to fast and blew it given low inflation and slowing global growth advertisement trump believes the us dollar is too strong and the euro too weak and feels the situation could be eased if the fed lowered rates a senior administration official said on tuesday the official also said the white house had no plans to demote powell who was nominated by trump in late 2017 and took over as fed chief in early 2018 some legal experts say it would be hard or impossible for trump to remove powell advertisement the us congress chose to insulate the fed from political pressure because it had seen the damage that often arises when policy bends to short term political interests powell said in his speech us stock indexes dropped following powell s remarks while yields on us treasury bonds ticked higher the dollar edged higher against a basket of currencies investors who have been anticipating rate cuts this year still expect the fed to cut its benchmark overnight lending rate next month though after powell s remarks they scaled back aggressive bets it would be reduced by half a percentage point next month advertisement separately st louis fed president james bullard told bloomberg television he does not think a cut of half a percentage point is warranted when the policy setting federal open market committee meets again in july even though he pushed to lower rates last week powell on tuesday reiterated that the central bank still sees u s growth prospects as strong with unemployment low and inflation near the fed s 2 annual target but that he and his colleagues are wrestling with whether uncertainty over trade and inflation support a case for lowering rates the question my colleagues and i are grappling with is whether these uncertainties will continue to weigh on the outlook and thus call for additional policy accommodation powell said advertisement many fomc participants judge that the case for somewhat more accommodative policy has strengthened but we are also mindful that monetary policy should not overreact to any individual data point or short term swing in sentiment he said powell said doing so would risk adding even more uncertainty to the outlook and that the fomc will closely monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion
