frank lee the ruling global elites of our time are like the bourbons before them have learnt nothing and forgotten nothing talleyrand it was sir john templeton the american born british investor banker fund manager and philanthropist who sardonically observed that in business and finance the expression this time it s different represented the four most expensive words in the business lexicon today s market fundamentalists seem fixated with the quasi religious belief that a bubbles can go on inflating forever or b i will take my profit just when the market tops out but how many times have the investing herd had their collective snouts rubbed into the reality that there is no such thing as a free lunch unless of course you are on the inside whenever a market is oversold and seems to offer something for nothing market participants behave like wildebeest herds on the plains of the serengeti stampeding in precisely the wrong direction to the refrain of this time it s different even sir isaac newton possibly the greatest mathematician physicist who ever lived was swept away in the euphoria of the south sea bubble in the spring of 1720 he owned shares in the south sea company the hottest stock in england sensing that the market was getting out of hand the great physicist muttered that he could calculate the motions of the heavenly bodies but not the madness of the people newton dumped his south sea shares pocketing a 100 profit totalling 7 000 smart move but just months later again swept up in the wild enthusiasm of the market newton jumped back in at a much higher price dumb move he lost 20 000 or more than 3 million in money for the rest of his life he forbade anyone to speak the words south sea in his presence poor old issy alas he should have known better but it has ever been thus and will continue to be so another salutary episode this time from the 20th century confirmed the emergence and path of bubble assets markets to their inevitable dénouement there had been feverish growth in us stock market in the run up to 1929 and as usual all the talk was of economic miracles new paradigms and so forth typical were the words of president coolidge in december 1928 no congress of the united states ever assembled on surveying the state of the union has met with a more pleasing prospect than that which appears at the present time there is tranquillity and contentment and the highest years of record prosperity speculators traders and investors in new york s financial district drove up the market to dizzying heights exhibiting the same frenzied hivemind bubble mania behaviour an archetypal boom to bust chapter later in october 1929 the prominent yale economist irving fisher opined that stock prices have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau hmmm i seem to have heard this somewhere more recently three weeks after this somewhat premature pronouncement the dow jones industrial average the us stock market was down by one third by the summer of 1932 the dow closed down nearly 90 lower than its 1929 pinnacle fisher and many others had made the mistake of thinking that the long bull market of the 1920s the roaring 20s had assumed an unstoppable momentum and would go on rising forever an end to boom and bust if you will throughout the 1920s the dow jones industrial average djia had risen inexorably this was in part due to the new technologies and production methods which were allowing scope for considerable economies of scale and therefore increases in output so that a mass consumer society was to come into being moreover modern management and marketing techniques could keep this consumer boom humming along in perpetuity or so it was thought this situation of optimism and as keynes put it rising animal spirits was conducive to the general propensity to invest in stocks and bonds everyone was playing the market the party was in full swing even in this era of prohibition something of the flavour of the times is captured in the novels of f scott fitzgerald the great gatsby or this side of paradise of course the situation was never going to last bubbles never do no matter how big or irreversible they may seem at the time it should also be noted that it is precisely when the bubble phenomenon and attendant growth levels reach their most febrile state that the correction becomes imminent and so it panned out the impact on the real economy of the stock market crash was that by 1933 unemployment had reached 25 of the american workforce and the economy had contracted by 30 worse still the catastrophe had spread to europe germany being particularly affected with unemployment levels comparable to the united states now the writers of the age were john steinbeck graphically illustrating the conditions of life in 1930s america in the grapes of wrath and cannery row the uk also felt the chill winds of depression crossing the atlantic as best expressed in the literature of arthur greenwood s love on the dole or orwell s the road to wigan pier thus the jazz age ended and was superseded by a more egalitarian order franklin d roosevelt was elected us president in 1933 and immediately used active fiscal policy to create jobs and stimulate the economy as well as social reforms like relief for the unemployed and old age pensions he did meet with partial success in that unemployment fell in the us up until 1938 however there was a fresh recession and unemployment began to rise again eventually rearmament and the second world war led the world out of the 30s depression as an interesting side bar the structural changes in the us economy from 1941 was profound albeit temporary the us war economy did not stimulate the private sector it replaced the free market and capitalist investment for profit consumption did not restore economic growth as keynesians should expect instead it was investment in weapons of destruction in many industries corporate executives resisted conversion to military production because they did no want to lose consumer market share to competitors who did not want to convert conversion thus became a goal pursued by public officials and labour leaders auto companies only fully converted to military production in 1942 and only began substantially contributing to aircraft production in 1943 from the beginning of preparedness in 1939 to peak of production in 1944 the war economy could not be left to the capitalist sector to deliver to organize the war economy and produce the goods needed for war the federal government created an array of mobilization agencies which often purchased goods closely directed the goods manufacture and heavily influenced the operation of private companies and whole industries the treasury department introduced the first income tax in american history and war bonds were sold to the public the government extended income tax to virtually the whole citizenry and collected it at source by deductions from wages at source those subject to income tax increased from 4 million in 1939 to 43 million in 1945 all told taxes provided about 136 8 million of the war s total costs of 304 billion to cover the other 167 2 billion the treasury expanded its bond programme which served as a valuable source of revenue for the government by the time that the war bond sales had ended in 1946 some 85 million americans has purchased 185 billion worth of securities often through automatic deductions from their pay checks now tell me that socialism or a command economy would never work or even be entertained in the united states at the present time we are experiencing a double whammy of a financial and increasingly economic collapse what gave rise to this was the biggest credit and property bubble in the history of capitalism the boom from the early 90s until mid 2007 was essentially floated on a sea of debt mortgages were advanced to almost anyone who wanted them regardless of their ability to pay individuals spent freely on credit cards without any thought for the morrow their debts could be rolled over or compensated by increasing asset prices mainly property so as consumers borrowed against the ongoing increase in their house prices banks would lend them more so there was an upward spiral the increasing level of credit led to an increase in property prices and the increase in property prices led to an increase in the availability and uptake of credit the classic bubble scenario worse still the mortgages held by the banks were repackaged securitised into new financial products mortgage backed securities mbs and collateralised debt obligations cdo and often sold on to other financial institutions hedge funds pension funds insurance companies and so forth okay so far so good the party roared on however the weak link in the chain was the american sub prime market a group termed ninjas no income no job no assets this group predictably began to default and the banks were found to be holding assets of very dubious value this initial default was the detonator which burst the house price bubble in all of those countries which had experienced a property boom the us uk ireland spain and australia the meltdown also started to affect countries who had not experienced a property boom but whose banks had foolishly purchased dreaded mortgage backed derivatives and collateralised debt obligations mbss and cdos banks in germany switzerland the low countries iceland and more especially eastern europe began to feel the heat many banks and even countries iceland were now insolvent and had to be rescued by the governments or usurious loans from the international monetary fund imf enter the credit crunch credit dried up even though property prices were falling since the us and uk economies had been essentially based upon the property market it was inevitable that the banking and property collapse would impinge very directly on the real economy at the time of writing unemployment was rising very sharply and deflation with falling or static prices and wages retailers were under the cosh with falling sales and bankruptcies and boarded up shops are an increasingly common sight we were already in a recession if not the beginnings of a longer term depression moreover there are likely to be further eruptions to come in the murky world of credit default swaps and derivatives these are totally unregulated and highly leveraged markets involving literally tens of trillions of dollars traded over the counter otc the only question remaining is how long and how deep this financial economic downturn was going to be more important still perhaps were the possible political ramifications of this situation such was the ignominious end to the fatuous claim of no more boom and bust the shame was that it was all so predictable and the shaming part was the extent that the government of the day colluded in terms of bank deregulation and ease of credit creation in and made possible this bubble creation by the financial and banking sector this was a joint market government failure fast forward 10 years from the nadir of the 2008 bust and the portents are manifest and alarming global debt levels are unprecedented in mid 2018 global debt hit another high climbing to 247 trillion in the first quarter of 2018 according to a report published wednesday of that figure the non financial sector accounted for 186 trillion the debt to gdp ratio has exceeded 318 percent marking its first quarterly rise in two years as far as individual countries are counted the us total debt is now 202 for private debt 2017 figures public debt has increased by 105 so that total debt to debt to gdp is in the range of 300 plus or 3 times as large as gdp china also has problems mostly private debt but total debt when public is added to private is a cool 34 trillion i suppose one consolation is that the debt is nominated in yuan but maybe that just clutching at straws but china does hold large volumes of us dollar denominated assets treasuries which it can dump any time now if the two major global economies have big problems one can only shudder for everyone else and think what might happen if both us and china hit the buffers at the same time in terms of vulnerability europe and the eu seem prime candidates for the debt shock waves emanating from both east and west gdp growth in euroland is stuttering between 1 5 and zero these are almost depression figures interestingly enough the big 4 euro economies have experienced the following increases in most recent annual real output figures as follows uk 1 5 france 0 9 germany 0 6 and italy at 0 1 for euroland as a whole the figure stands at 1 2 source trading economics it is also worth noting that the uk remainers might have a difficult time explaining why their dire predictions about the uk is somehow worse than the even more calamitous figures from mainland europe but hey let s not let facts spoil the remainer hysteria another important indicator of what is to come is the p e ratio price to earnings ratio as reported in the financial press is the prices of equities compared to their earnings according to the standard and poor s p composite index the average p e ratio market valuation since 1871 has been 16 9 at the present time it is 28 5 that is to say well above the average on only two occasions during the twentieth century has this figure been exceeded 32 6 in 1929 and 44 2 in 2000 this means that the us stock market is overvalued nothing can stay overvalued indefinitely even if central banks and treasury departments want it to their herculean efforts notwithstanding they have not and cannot invent a perpetual motion machine additionally there is the flattening of the long term bond yield curve government bonds and notes are sold for different durations from overnight to 50 years in normal times the rate of interest on these securities varies with the length of their maturity however when investment in long term bonds increasingly aligns with shorter term notes and bonds the long term yield carve begins to flatten and even dip below short term debt instruments this is usually a sign of a coming recession since investment in short term notes and bonds are exposed for shorter redemption dates in an unpredictable economic financial environment all of which makes jumpy investors wary about committing themselves to long term bets yield curve flattest since before financial crisis 3 48 pm et tue 4 dec 2018 02 35 one key recession indicator is flashing a warning signal to investors the yield curve has flattened to its lowest level since june 2007 with the 10 year treasury note yield only around 10 basis points above the 2 year note joseph lavorgna chief economist of the americas at natixis says the move has him very worried about what comes next the yield curve has almost always forecasted the direction of trend growth meaning when the curve flattens growth with a lag tends to slow and vice versa when the curve steepens lavorgna told cnbc s trading nation on tuesday the yield curve inverts when shorter term treasurys yield more than longer term treasury yields the relationship between the 2 year and 10 year yields is often used as a barometer of investor expectations for economic growth one of the consequences of the 2008 debacle and the great bank bail out was what followed in terms of income inequality and austerity the banks were partially bailed out there are still a number of basically insolvent banks out there deutsche bank being number one but what followed was a secondary corresponding bail out of national economies by the imposition of austerity social welfare programmes were cut as were wages pensions health and education transport interest rates on small savers with other miscellaneous parts of government expenditure this resulted in an income re distribution upwards in short the rich 1 got richer whilst most other cohorts either got poorer or trod water so much is common knowledge but the effects of a small group appropriating an increasingly large portion of national income means that their savings increase at a faster rate than their expenditures this results in low growth or no growth and stagnation in economist s jargon the rich have a greater marginal propensity to save rather than marginal propensity to consume expressed as mps mpc and the lower deciles have a greater marginal propensity to consume than to save mpc mps huge agglomerations of capital are therefore being effectively idled since the rich can t spend their fortunes quickly or exhaustively enough whereas the other deciles of more modest means cannot effectively consume because they don t have sufficient incomes or worse still they are sinking into debt peonage which adds an additional impediment to growth we can say with some certainty that these austerity policies are never going to work and i suspect that the elites know this there will be no catching up by the dispossessed this rising tide is not going to float all boats on the contrary it will sink many yet the

this crisis it is not going to stop other economic policies and possibilities have always existed and still do but don t count on any policy other than the one already foisted on us the ptb are guided by a learned ignorance in a more profound sense the question is not an inability to learn by our betters but a determination not to the ptb will not and cannot learn and like the bourbons they have learned nothing and forgotten nothing south sea bubble 1720 in the 1700s the british empire spanned the entire globe so the south sea company had no problem attracting investors when with an iou to the government worth 10 000 000 00 the company purchased the rights to all trade in the south seas the first issue of stock didn t even satiate the voracious appetite of the hardcore speculators let alone the average investors who were assured of this company s coming dominance eventually the management team of ssc took a step back and realized that the value of their personal shares in no way reflected the actual value of the company or its dismal earnings so they sold their stocks in the summer of 1720 and hoped no one would leak the failure of the company to the other shareholders like all bad news however the knowledge of the actions of ssc management spread and the panic selling of worthless certificates ensued a complete crash which would be heralded by the folding of banks was avoided due to the prominent economic position of the british empire and the government s help in stabilizing the banking industry the british government outlawed the issuing of stock certificates a law that was not repealed until 1825 the long depression michael roberts p 57 trading nation 7 57 am et wed 5 dec 2018 bob dylan the rise of neo nationalism in the globalization era as a movement for

nigeria africa s top oil producer is very vulnerable to global developments some of which pose huge risks to the nation s economy this year femi asu writes the world bank in january projected that global economic growth will slow to 2 9 per cent in 2019 from a downwardly revised three per cent in 2018 as trade and investment weakened it noted that international trade and manufacturing activities had softened trade tensions remained elevated and some large emerging markets had experienced substantial financial market pressures slowing external demand rising borrowing costs and persistent policy uncertainties are expected to weigh on the outlook for emerging market and developing economies the world bank said the international monetary fund also said in january that nigeria s economy would expand more slowly in 2019 than previously predicted the imf in its world economic outlook update titled a weakening global expansion revised down the country s gross domestic product projection for this year to two per cent from the 2 3 per cent projected in october 2018 the washington based fund downgraded its estimates for global growth for 2019 and 2020 to 3 5 per cent and 3 6 per cent respectively from 3 7 per cent each as previously predicted warning that the expansion seen in recent years was losing momentum it said emerging market and developing economies had been tested by difficult external conditions over the past few months amid trade tensions rising us interest rates dollar appreciation capital outflows and volatile oil prices members of the monetary policy committee of the central bank of nigeria at their meeting in january voiced concerns over the impact of global developments on the nation s economy the committee in a communiqué with the personal statements of members which was released on tuesday noted that financial market volatilities trade war between the us and key allies continuing monetary policy normalisation by the us brexit the termination of the european central bank s asset purchase programme in december and the slowdown in the chinese economy further heightened uncertainties for the global economy in 2019 nigeria has remained an active participant in the global economy with developments in the global economy having serious implications positive and negative for the local economy in the spheres of policy making macroeconomic performance and growth among others a member prof mike obadan said commenting on the normalisation of monetary policy in the us and the european union he stated that monetary policy rate was raised four times in the us last year while the european central bank put an end to its monthly purchase programme of bonds at the end of december after a total commitment of 3tn he noted that the implication of the monetary normalisation was the rise in interest rates in the us relative to other economies and the reverse flow of capital from emerging and developing economies to the us in nigeria the huge capital flight experienced in 2018 was largely due to the normalisation and it had adverse effects on the nation s external reserves and exchange rate stability nigeria would need to brace itself up to likely huge capital outflows as more normalisation actions are taken abroad obadan added according to the governor cbn mr godwin emefiele rising yields in the us and the concomitant capital flow reversals threaten nigeria s foreign exchange reserves exchange rate and inflation this is further exacerbated by the trade wars global political tensions and fragilities in the crude oil market he added the deputy governor corporate services cbn mr edward adamu said the protracted trade dispute between the us and china as well as geopolitical tensions continued to burden global economic activities prompting downward revisions of global growth forecasts for 2018 he noted that the developments resonated in slower output growths higher yields and unsettled stock markets across many countries including nigeria those external conditions could persist in 2019 thereby muffling the outlook for growth and financial stability it is important to note that the developments on the external front could translate to a protracted softening of oil prices and reduced capital inflows to nigeria implying that the much needed domestic growth impetus may not be coming from the external sector adamu said another member of the mpc prof adeola adenikinju warned nigeria and other countries of potentially significant uncertainties in 2019 saying these uncertainties have made several multilateral agencies to revise downwards their projections on global output growth according to him the key drivers of these uncertainties include us china trade war the slowing chinese economy resurgence of protectionism and rise of nationalism in different parts of the world continued volatility in capital markets and america s domestic policies he said global inflation rate is expected to trend up gradually as us domestic policies continue to impact on capital flows into emerging economies output growth in major blocs especially developed countries and china may trend lower from their 2018 levels nigeria therefore needs to factor the various scenarios into policy considerations for 2019 the external fragilities will have impact on rate of foreign reserves accumulation and fiscal buffers to stabilise the economy as well as other macroeconomic indicators the deputy governor financial system stability mrs aishah ahmad was of the view that a number of recent global economic developments had potential to degenerate bringing nigeria s vulnerabilities sharply into focus she said these call for review reflection and action to ensure the nigerian economy sustains its positive growth trajectory slower global growth prospects may have a negative impact on global demand and price of crude oil which has potential adverse implications for nigeria as a major oil producer the us fed s normalisation programme is another significant potential headwind which may impact the ability to attract foreign exchange flows with implications for exchange rate stability thankfully recent economic developments in the us suggest the fed may delay further rate hikes copyright punch all rights reserved this material and other digital content on this website may not be reproduced published

american middle class families are struggling to manage their finances yes the economic expansion is approaching its 10th birthday which would make it the longest in the nation s history and unemployment is low and still falling but despite these good statistics the middle class can t seem to find its financial footing take incomes median family income half of families have higher incomes and other half lower incomes has barely budged after inflation over the last 20 years throughout much of our history children could expect to earn much more than their parents not so anymore the finances of middle class americans look even shakier in light of the fact that they are no wealthier today than they were two decades ago median household net worth the difference in value of what the typical american family owns and what it owes has gone up and down with the wild swings in stock prices and housing values but after accounting for inflation it is currently about where it was in the late 1990s behind this poor performance were two recessions the downturn in the early 2000s triggered by the bursting technology bubble in the stock market and of course the financial crisis that hit a decade ago as the housing bubble burst unemployment peaked in the double digits a decade ago and although it has steadily declined during the current expansion only recently has unemployment returned to something consistent with full employment advertisement long running forces the most notable being the rapid pace of technological change have also hurt middle class finances the advent of the internet and its incorporation into business activities has been especially hard on middle paying occupations in a metaphorical if not real sense these jobs have been effectively coded out many of those losing jobs and without requisite skills have been forced out of the middle class altogether the economic gains from new technologies have been huge but so have the costs for many americans rapidly expanding global trade with the emerging world ushered in by the north american free trade agreement in the mid 1990s and the entry of china into the world trade organization in the early 2000s also hurt the middle class this is clearest in the large decline in manufacturing jobs the downside of these trade deals has played out but this is no solace to the workers who were nailed by them with constrained incomes and wealth middle class americans can t save since the late 1990s the saving rate for middle class families has been negative as often as it has been positive these families have spent beyond their incomes largely by borrowing more middle class baby boomers now in their 50s and 60 are now especially vulnerable as many are financially ill prepared for retirement it is also galling that the middle class share of the nation s income wealth and spending which is already disproportionately small continues to shrink most disconcerting is that the one fifth of families with incomes in the middle account for only about one tenth of total consumer spending a share that continues to decline as the middle class gets a shrinking piece of the nation s economic pie those with the highest incomes are taking a bigger slice almost half of all spending is currently enjoyed by those in the top one tenth of income earners there is some good news the federal reserve appears to be working to help address the plight of the middle class by keeping interest rates low although short term interest rates have risen they remain low by most historical standards and given stable inflation that is near the fed s target policymakers have indicated they will remain patient when considering future rate increases the tight labor market should continue to support stronger wage growth across all income groups but monetary policy can go only so far in helping the middle class and lawmakers need to act it makes little sense to allow personal tax rates to increase for middle income taxpayers but they are slated to do so under current tax law instead tax rates on high income and wealthy taxpayers and large corporations should increase to pay for fiscal efforts to support the middle class also particularly effective would be significant increases in infrastructure spending that would quickly create many middle paying jobs and open up development in stunted communities in the nation s inner cities and rural areas federal dollars to defray the costs of child care early childhood education and higher education would also go a long way to help parents work save more and build the wealth needed in retirement of course this will also provide our children with the skills they will need to win future high paying jobs our nation is only as strong as our middle class and we are struggling the causes are many what is clear is that lawmakers must refocus economic policy onto what matters for the typical american family the fortunes of the middle class and of the nation depend on it _________ mark zandi is chief economist at moody s analytics contact him at help economy com
by xinhua writers ma qian pan lijun luo jingjing xu xingtang new york feb 24 xinhua the chinese yuan cny has sharply appreciated against the greenback in the past week wrapping up friday s trade with a high of 6 71 per u s dollar and notching the largest weekly gains since jan 11 analysts and industry insiders believed that market optimism across the board on potential progress to be made in china u s trade relations as well as the long term resilience of the chinese economy has fueled the yuan s rally to pick up steam during the week market optimism on u s china trade relations a principal driver for the yuan hinged on upbeat market expectations and constant updates on this week s trade talks between china and the united states the yuan started to rise on monday after the two sides agreed on feb 15 to hold a new round of economic and trade talks in washington in the past week following the meeting in the previous week in beijing which both sides said had led to some progress an important factor explaining the recent cny appreciation is the increased market confidence on u s china trade talks and the prospects of a trade truce between both countries alejo czerwonko emerging markets strategist at ubs global wealth management told xinhua investors and traders have turned into a risk on sentiment as hopes for easing the lingering trade tensions boosted their appetite for riskier assets that has at the margin reduced demand for the u s dollar as a safe haven currency a weaker dollar has also underpinned the yuan s strength over the week ben randol a senior foreign exchange strategist at bank of america merrill lynch also believed that the global foreign exchange fx market and other asset classes have recently been infused with optimism about a u s china trade deal which has led to a declining tendency in the dollar the more positive progress on u s china trade policy is perceived to be the more strength we see in traditionally riskier currencies such as aud as well as the currencies of more economically open economies such as the euro randol told xinhua the australian dollar aud widely regarded as a barometer of global risk sentiment extended marked gains against the greenback for three days during the week i e tuesday wednesday and friday ending the final trading day at 0 7133 per dollar a sharp increase of 0 75 percent from the previous day some analysts cautioned that a disruption to the trade relationship between china and the united states would roil international economies the trade negotiation between the unites states and china has a direct influence on the currency markets said anthony minardo vice president and fx trader for bank leumi usa there will be a massive increase in currency volatility and large revaluations of global currencies in case of deterioration of trade tensions dovish fed pressuring greenback trade optimism has not been the only relevant factors behind year to date fx moves as global fx markets have already priced in a series of positive updates regarding trade other drivers tend to be longer term and are likely to play a growing role looking ahead the overall dovish tone by the u s federal reserve has recently added pressure on the dollar causing the yuan to strengthen as the market has already factored in the slowdown in future rate paths experts said the dollar index which measures the greenback against six major peers has been sliding on a downward path for four trading days of the past week except thursday the dollar index has turned lower since the start of the week due to one major reason the fed has continued to become more dovish with respect to interest rates in the united states and the pace going forward minardo told xinhua the overall consensus is for rates to remain on hold for the short to medium term and as a result the market has sold the dollar he added the central bank pledged a patient and flexible approach to future policy tightening moves as a way to manage risks while assessing incoming information bearing on the economic outlook according to its latest meeting minutes released on wednesday the fed has decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 2 25 to 2 5 percent said the minutes of the jan 29 30 policy meeting of the federal open market committee fomc the monetary policy arm of the fed system participants pointed to a variety of considerations that supported a patient approach to monetary policy at this juncture as an appropriate step in managing various risks and uncertainties in the outlook the minutes said these details are dovish in nature and point to the greenback experiencing a gradual depreciation in the coming months on the back of signs of slower economic activity according to czerwonko the ubs strategist january s minutes reveal that several fomc participants were of the view that no more hiking this cycle would be necessary unless inflation were to exceed expectations said czerwonko echoing his concerns blackrock investment institute pointed out in a latest report that the u s economic expansion is shifting into a late cycle phase of the business cycle the final phase before a downturn as fiscal and monetary stimulus is dissipating while the impact of protracted trade tensions is biting back we assess that it will enter the late cycle phase at sometime in the first half of this year elga bartsch chief economist at the institute said thursday while briefing the report themed the global economy and 2019 outlook she noted that the projection was based on analyzing a wide range of u s economic variables including a slowdown in growth gradually increase in wage inflation the employment rate being below the natural rate credit ratio and the savings behavior of the private sector outlook for turnaround in chinese economy asked about the recent yuan appreciation bartsch talked about one factor that could help support the chinese currency in a long term as she believed exchange rates pick up much different information and are always based on a relative basis one thing that might help explain the pattern is the fact that we now know chinese assets will be included in a number of indices in the not so distant future bartsch told xinhua some of that should support the chinese markets and create some inflows into chinese assets international financial information provider bloomberg will include chinese yuan denominated government and policy bank securities into bloomberg barclays global aggregate index starting in april enabling further opening up of china s bonds market the company confirmed on jan 31 chinese bonds will become the fourth largest currency component following the u s dollar euro and japanese yen after full inclusion china s bonds market stood at about 86 trillion yuan about 12 84 trillion u s dollars by the end of 2018 with about 1 8 trillion yuan about 270 billion u s dollars held by global investors up 46 percent year on year we see that the chinese government is taking very decisive steps to stimulate the economy both on the fiscal policy side and on the monetary and financial policy side said bartsch in our view it s just a question of time until this will start to show in the economic data she noted although they held china s economic growth seemed to be decelerating at the moment researchers at blackrock believed there would be a turnaround in the chinese economy with a modest growth re acceleration the chinese economy looks likely to regain its footing in the first half of 2019 said the outlook report co authored by bartsch as policymakers in china have started to moved toward policy easing with efforts to provide economic stimulus while limit financial leverage more specifically bartsch mentioned two main measures i e fiscal policy impulse coming through major tax relief measures to boost revenues and credit impulse to change credit flows with a clear focus on more channels toward small and medium sized companies than state owned enterprises blackrock also expected the people s bank of china or china s central bank to ease its liquidity provisions so as to avoid stoking capital outflows and putting pressure on the yuan exchange rate zhang zhongkai in beijing contributed to the report

during the week market optimism on u s china trade relations a principal driver for the yuan hinged on upbeat market expectations and constant updates on this week s trade talks between china and the united states the yuan started to rise on monday after the two sides agreed on feb 15 to hold a new round of economic and trade talks in washington in the past week following the meeting in the previous week in beijing which both sides said had led to some progress an important factor explaining the recent cny appreciation is the increased market confidence on u s china trade talks and the prospects of a trade truce between both countries alejo czerwonko emerging markets strategist at ubs global wealth management told xinhua investors and traders have turned into a risk on sentiment as hopes for easing the lingering trade tensions boosted their appetite for riskier assets that has at the margin reduced demand for the u s dollar as a safe haven currency a weaker dollar has also underpinned the yuan s strength over the week ben randol a senior foreign exchange strategist at bank of america merrill lynch also believed that the global foreign exchange fx market and other asset classes have recently been infused with optimism about a u s china trade deal which has led to a declining tendency in the dollar the more positive progress on u s china trade policy is perceived to be the more strength we see in traditionally riskier currencies such as aud as well as the currencies of more economically open economies such as the euro randol told xinhua the australian dollar aud widely regarded as a barometer of global risk sentiment extended marked gains against the greenback for three days during the week i e tuesday wednesday and friday ending the final trading day at 0 7133 per dollar a sharp increase of 0 75 percent from the previous day some analysts cautioned that a disruption to the trade relationship between china and the united states would roil international economies the trade negotiation between the unites states and china has a direct influence on the currency markets said anthony minardo vice president and fx trader for bank leumi usa there will be a massive increase in currency volatility and large revaluations of global currencies in case of deterioration of trade tensions dovish fed pressuring greenback trade optimism has not been the only relevant factors behind year to date fx moves as global fx markets have already priced in a series of positive updates regarding trade other drivers tend to be longer term and are likely to play a growing role looking ahead the overall dovish tone by the u s federal reserve has recently added pressure on the dollar causing the yuan to strengthen as the market has already factored in the slowdown in future rate paths experts said the dollar index which measures the greenback against six major peers has been sliding on a downward path for four trading days of the past week except thursday the dollar index has turned lower since the start of the week due to one major reason the fed has continued to become more dovish with respect to interest rates in the united states and the pace going forward minardo told xinhua the overall consensus is for rates to remain on hold for the short to medium term and as a result the market has sold the dollar he added the central bank pledged a patient and flexible approach to future policy tightening moves as a way to manage risks while assessing incoming information bearing on the economic outlook according to its latest meeting minutes released on wednesday the fed has decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 2 25 to 2 5 percent said the minutes of the jan 29 30 policy meeting of the federal open market committee fomc the monetary policy arm of the fed system participants pointed to a variety of considerations that supported a patient approach to monetary policy at this juncture as an appropriate step in managing various risks and uncertainties in the outlook the minutes said these details are dovish in nature and point to the greenback experiencing a gradual depreciation in the coming months on the back of signs of slower economic activity according to czerwonko the ubs strategist january s minutes reveal that several fomc participants were of the view that no more hiking this cycle would be necessary unless inflation were to exceed expectations said czerwonko echoing his concerns blackrock investment institute pointed out in a latest report that the u s economic expansion is shifting into a late cycle phase of the business cycle the final phase before a downturn as fiscal and monetary stimulus is dissipating while the impact of protracted trade tensions is biting back we assess that it will enter the late cycle phase at sometime in the first half of this year elga bartsch chief economist at the institute said thursday while briefing the report themed the global economy and 2019 outlook she noted that the projection was based on analyzing a wide range of u s economic variables including a slowdown in growth gradually increase in wage inflation the employment rate being below the natural rate credit ratio and the savings behavior of the private sector outlook for turnaround in chinese economy asked about the recent yuan appreciation bartsch talked about one factor that could help support the chinese currency in a long term as she believed exchange rates pick up much different information and are always based on a relative basis one thing that might help explain the pattern is the fact that we now know chinese assets will be included in a number of indices in the not so distant future bartsch told xinhua some of that should support the chinese markets and create some inflows into chinese assets international financial information provider bloomberg will include chinese yuan denominated government and policy bank securities into bloomberg barclays global aggregate index starting in april enabling further opening up of china s bonds market the company confirmed on jan 31 chinese bonds will become the fourth largest currency component following the u s dollar euro and japanese yen after full inclusion china s bonds market stood at about 86 trillion yuan about 12 84 trillion u s dollars by the end of 2018 with about 1 8 trillion yuan about 270 billion u s dollars held by global investors up 46 percent year on year we see that the chinese government is taking very decisive steps to stimulate the economy both on the fiscal policy side and on the monetary and financial policy side said bartsch in our view it s just a question of time until this will start to show in the economic data she noted although they held china s economic growth seemed to be decelerating at the moment researchers at blackrock believed there would be a turnaround in the chinese economy with a modest growth re acceleration the chinese economy looks likely to regain its footing in the first half of 2019 said the outlook report co authored by bartsch as policymakers in china have started to moved toward policy easing with efforts to provide economic stimulus while limit financial leverage more specifically bartsch mentioned two main measures i e fiscal policy impulse coming through major tax relief measures to boost revenues and credit impulse to change credit flows with a clear focus on more channels toward small and medium sized companies than state owned enterprises blackrock also expected the people s bank of china or china s central bank to ease its liquidity provisions so as to avoid stoking capital outflows and putting pressure on the yuan exchange rate zhang zhongkai in beijing contributed to the report
the mmters are right in the sense that yes modern governments that issue fiat currency need never default on their bonds but they are wrong if they think this observation absolves alexandria ocasio cortez from explaining how she will pay for the mmt and the green new deal taxes at all even as goodies contained in their proposals such as a trillion dollars in spending projects while downplaying taxes and regulations one of the most interesting aspects of the green new deal is that its progressive proponents hardly mentionat all even as some republican economists continue to champion a carbon tax faced with the political defeat of the waxman markey cap and trade bill as well as the failed carbon tax initiatives in washington state it seems that rep alexandria ocasio cortez and the other green new deal supporters are just going to accentuate the positive in other words they are going to focus on all thecontained in their proposals such as a trillion dollars in spending projects while downplaying taxes and regulations indeed some of the green new deal proponents have turned this liability into an apparent asset when asked how are you going to pay for this they flip the question around by bringing up modern monetary theory or mmt for short this is a relatively new economic school of thought that ostensibly overturns much of the conventional wisdom about government finance in the age of fiat money by directing the skeptics to mmt gurus like prof stephanie kelton using mmt to defend the green new deal there is a growing link between the green new deal and mmt indeed some of the green new deal proponents have turned this liability into an apparent asset when asked how are you going to pay for this they flip the question around by bringing up modern monetary theory or mmt for short this is a relatively new economic school of thought that ostensibly overturns much of the conventional wisdom about government finance in the age of fiat money by directing the skeptics to mmt gurus like prof stephanie kelton who served as chief economist for the democratic minority staff of the senate budget committee before advising bernie sanders campaign the green new dealers can dodge awkward questions and come out looking quite sophisticated in previous ier articles one two and three i have directly criticized the green new deal in the present post i will focus on its relationship to mmt and then i will explain why mmt is even more dubious than the green new deal itself there is a growing link between the green new deal and mmt on social media but here let me link to an article from forbes com that spells out the connection author robert hockett explains how ocasio cortez has deflected criticism by relying on the new financial framework representative alexandria ocasio cortez s announcement of an ambitious new green new deal initiative in congress has brought predictable and predictably silly callouts from conservative pundits and scared politicians how will we pay for it they ask with pretend incredulity and what about debt won t we have to raise taxes and will that not crowd out the job creators support canada free press representative ocasio cortez already has given the best answer possible to such queries most of which seem to be raised in bad faith why is it she retorts that these questions arise only in connection with useful ideas not wasteful ideas where were the pay fors for bush s 5 trillion wars and tax cuts or for last year s 2 trillion tax giveaway to billionaires why wasn t financing those massive throwaways as scary as financing the rescue of our planet and middle class now seems to be to these naysayers the short answer to how we will pay for the green new deal is easy we ll pay for it just as we pay for all else congress will authorize necessary spending and treasury will spend this is how we do it always has been always will be the money that s spent for its part is never raised first to the contrary federal spending is what brings that money into existence although hockett doesn t use the term mmt directly in the article he is clearly referring to the framework ocasio cortez herself has paul krugman warns that your economic philosophy downplays the dangers of government spending it s time to reevaluate your life choices in the same spirit then in the rest of this post i ll explain why the insights of mmt don t mean what its proponents seem to think representative ocasio cortez already has given the best answer possible to such queries most of which seem to be raised in bad faith why is it she retorts that these questions arise only in connection with useful ideas not wasteful ideas where were the pay fors for bush s 5 trillion wars and tax cuts or for last year s

answer to how we will pay for the green new deal is easy we ll pay for it just as we pay for all else congress will authorize necessary spending and treasury will spend this is how we do it always has been always will be the money that s spent for its part is never raised first to the contrary federal spending is what brings that money into existence although hockett doesn t use the term mmt directly in the article he is clearly referring to the framework ocasio cortez herself has explicitly endorsed mmt and so we see the clever rhetorical move the critics of the green new deal who focus on its price tag are cast as neanderthals and hypocrites to boot who don t understand that uncle sam can pay for anything he wants indeed given the shot in the arm from ocasio cortez mmt is becoming such a hot topic that even paul krugman has been moved to gently critique it incidentally whenwarns that your economic philosophy downplays the dangers of government spending it s time to reevaluate your life choices in the same spirit then in the rest of this post i ll explain why the insights of mmt don t mean what its proponents seem to think the u s government never needs to default perhaps the not be true but ever since 1971 the u s government has had no official constraints on its spending this is why mmters think it so old fashioned when the critics ask how will you pay for the green new deal or medicare for all a universal basic income etc to ask how will you pay for it implies that there is a budget where the federal government must first raise revenue and then spend it but as the first spends the money in order to bring it into existence and only then is it even possible to tax it back from the citizens this mmt mindset is quite clear in mosler s interview with me on already knew this indeed among free market economists it is a standard pedagogical device to tell the audience that the government has three ways of financing its spending namely 1 taxes 2 borrowing or 3 inflation so this notion that only the mmters perceive the possibility of the printing press as a means of paying for government programs is silly for proof consider the following excerpt from austrian economist murray rothbard s economics treatise it is obvious that the government cannot become insolvent like private individuals for it can always obtain money by coercion while private citizens cannot rothbard p 1028 bold added here is another example this one from perhaps the single biggest insight of the mmt camp is that the united states government as an issuer of an unbacked fiat currency and an entity that doesn t carry significant foreign debts can never become legally insolvent in short no matter how many treasury securities outsiders hold ultimately the federal reserve can simply create more dollars in order to pay them off under a gold standard this wouldbe true but ever since 1971 the u s government has had no official constraints on its spending is why mmters think it so old fashioned when the critics ask how will you pay for the green new deal or medicare for all a universal basic income etc to ask how will you pay for it implies that there is a budget where the federal government mustraise revenue andspend it but as the mmt gurus like warren mosler explain under a fiat currency a governmentin order to bring it into existence and only then is it even possible to tax it back from the citizens this mmt mindset is quite clear in mosler s interview with me on my podcast i hate to break it to the mmters but fuddy duddy economists indeed among free market economists it is a standard pedagogical device to tell the audience that the government hasof financing its spending namely 1 taxes 2 borrowing or 3 inflation so this notion that only the mmters perceive the possibility of the printing press as a means of paying for government programs is silly for proof consider the following excerpt from austrian economist murray rothbard s economics treatise man economy and state published in 1962 many right wing opponents of public borrowing on the other hand have greatly exaggerated the dangers of the public debt and have raised persistent alarms about imminent bankruptcy for it can always obtain money by coercion while private citizens cannot rothbard p 1028 bold added here is another example this one from ludwig von mises speaking in 1951 on wartime finance what is needed in wartime is to divert production and consumption from peacetime channels toward military goals in order to achieve this it is necessary for the government to tax the citizens part of the funds may also be provided by borrowing from the public the citizens but if the treasury increases the amount of money in circulation or borrows from the commercial banks it inflates inflation can do the job for a limited time but it is the most expensive method of financing a war it is socially disruptive and should be avoided there is no need to dwell upon the disastrous consequences of inflation all people agree in this regard but inflation is a very convenient makeshift for those in power it is a handy means to divert the resentment of the people from the government in the eyes of the masses big business the profiteers the merchants not the administration appear responsible for the rise in prices and the ensuing need to restrict consumption a truly democratic government would have to tell the voters openly that they must pay higher taxes because expenses have risen considerably but it is much more agreeable for a government to present only a part of the bill to the people and to resort to inflation for the rest of its expenditures what a triumph if they can say everybody s income is rising everybody has now more money in his pocket business is booming mises bold added for a third and final example economics in one lesson which came out way back in 1946 it is because inflation confuses everything that it is so consistently resorted to by our modern planned economy governments we saw in chapter four to take but one example that the belief that public works necessarily create new jobs is false if the money was raised by taxation we saw then for every dollar that the government spent on public works one less dollar was spent by the taxpayers to meet their own wants and for every public job created one private job was destroyed but suppose the public works are not paid for from the proceeds of taxation suppose they are paid for by deficit financing that is from the proceeds of government borrowing or from resort to the printing press then the result just described does not seem to take place the public works seem to be created out of new purchasing power you cannot say that the purchasing power has been taken away from the taxpayers for the moment the nation seems to have got something for nothing hazlitt bold added as the above examples illustrate there is nothing new under the sun free market economists have long understood that modern governments have the legal ability to resort to the printing press to finance their expenditures the problem is creating green slips of paper or electronic bank reserves doesn t generate more labor hours or acres of farmland the problem of scarcity isn t banished simply because we ve gotten rid of the pesky gold standard part of the funds may also be provided by borrowing from the public the citizens but if the treasury increases the amount of money in circulation or borrows from the commercial banks it inflates there is no need to dwell upon the disastrous consequences of inflation all people agree in this regard but inflation is a very convenient makeshift for those in power it is a handy means to divert the resentment of the people from the government in the eyes of the masses big business the profiteers the merchants not the administration appear responsible for the rise in prices and the ensuing need to restrict consumption what a triumph if they can say everybody s income is rising everybody has now more money in his pocket business is booming mises bold added for a third and final example here is henry hazlitt writing in his classic book which came out way back in 1946 it is because inflation confuses everything that it is so consistently resorted to by our modern planned economy governments we saw in chapter four to take but one example that the belief that public works necessarily create new jobs is false if the money was raised by taxation we saw then for every dollar that the government spent on public works one less dollar was spent by the taxpayers to meet their own wants and for every public job created one private job was destroyed then the result just described does not seem to take place the public

hazlitt bold added as the above examples illustrate there is nothing new under the sun free market economists have long understood that modern governments haveto resort to the printing press to finance their expenditures the problem is creating green slips of paper or electronic bank reserves doesn t generate more labor hours or acres of farmland the problem of scarcity isn t banished simply because we ve gotten rid of the pesky gold standard moving the discussion from revenue to inflation now to be fair the more responsible mmt proponents do not say deficits don t matter though see does say just that notwithstanding the other mmters willful refusal to admit as such rather people like warren mosler and stephanie kelton merely point out that insolvency is never an issue in other words we don t need to worry that uncle sam will go broke or be unable to pay the bills but we might worry that too much spending will lead to undesirably high price inflation but if this is the essential mmt insight then it s old news again the three examples from the previous section show that classically liberal free market economists have known this all along what those economists recognized however is that financing government spending through taxation and to a lesser extent borrowing is more honest in the sense that the public can better understand the actual costs involved consider a simple example suppose the green new deal contains a proposal to spend 24 8 billion on political benefit of this method of finance is that no american is apparently down any money and yet the lucky cities get their infrastructure projects with all of the spillover effects in terms of construction jobs etc they entail it seems that inflationary finance is all gain no pain but of course in reality real resources are still being diverted from the private sector into the channels dictated by the political process the construction workers who move to the cities in question are now no longer able to work on private buildings or houses the rubber cement steel glass lumber and other materials devoted to the new projects are not available for use in other possible projects elsewhere in the economy when all is said and done the average american still pays for the new government spending but via higher prices in other words rather than the average american s income dropping by 100 instead the prices of other goods and services rise slightly so that the original income no longer fetches as much stuff in the market however the two methods are not equivalent most obvious the source of the real income drain is harder to detect under inflation if a family can t make ends meet because of taxes then it knows to blame the government but if a family sees prices rising at the store faster than the paychecks from work it might blame greedy capitalists or trade unions or opec it might not realize the federal reserve is the true culprit conclusion the mmters are right in the sense that yes modern governments that issue fiat currency need never default on their bonds but they are wrong if they think this observation absolves alexandria ocasio cortez from explaining how she will pay for the green new deal the printing press doesn t create real resources it only obscures the method by which the government siphons them away from the private sector to be sure mmters would respond that the economy currently suffers from excess capacity and then we could safely accommodate large deficit finance without pushing up the cpi yet we have now moved beyond economy works i am happy to have that debate as well but much of the existing discussion involves mmters acting as if they alone understand that the government can buy stuff by printing money yes free market economists have understood that all along and have explained in elementary detail why it is such a dangerous option now to be fair the more responsible mmt proponents dosay deficits don t matter though see these examples from bill mitchell where hesay just that notwithstanding the other mmters willful refusal to admit as such rather people like warren mosler and stephanie kelton merely point out thatis never an issue in other words we don t need to worry that uncle sam will go broke or be unable to pay the bills but weworry that too much spending will lead to undesirably high price inflation but ifis the

recognized however is that financing government spending through taxation and to a lesser extent borrowing is more honest in the sense that the public can better understand the actual costs involved consider a simple example suppose the green new deal contains a proposal to spend 24 8 billion on electric vehicle mass transit options in certain cities if the proposal were financed by a flat 100 tax on every adult american of which there are about 248 million then it would be obvious what the cost of the proposal was every adult american would have 100 less to spend on private investment or consumption and the government would devote the 24 8 billion in funds to the green infrastructure projects but what if instead the treasury floated 24 8 billion in additional bonds thus increasing the federal budget deficit and the federal reserve kept interest rates from rising by creating 24 8 billion in new money with which it bought 24 8 billion in treasuries from the bond market this would be a convoluted way of having the fed effectively pay for the projects using the electronic printing press thebenefit of this method of finance is that no american is apparently down any money and yet the lucky cities get their infrastructure projects with all of the spillover effects in terms of construction jobs etc they entail it seems that inflationary finance is all gain no pain but of course

2014 bloomberg finance lp after 25 years of capitalism in russia investors still don t feel safe shareholder disputes can demolish a business there too easily russia has not yet managed to build sufficient investor protection from securities fraud fraud that is often committed by newcomer bank owners who use complicated offshore schemes coupled with a corrupt russian judicial system that often protects them from angry clients dmitry ananyev 49 and his brother alexei 54 are your typical post soviet businessmen they opened a bank and made millions of dollars worth of the savings of their most loyal customers disappear they re paying for it now their growth story is almost typical of any russian billionaire they saw an opportunity with the fall of the centrally planned economy and the creation of private enterprise they got involved in everything from it companies like technoserv to real estate and became forbes listed billionaires they still are they started a bank to fund their companies called promsvyazbank psb back in 1995 they turned it into a top 15 russian bank in eight years they opened an office in beijing in 2004 they won industry awards locally in 2007 2009 and 2010 by then they had 10 000 employees psb survived two crises the 1998 ruble crisis and the 2014 sanctions crisis but they couldn t survive the central bank of russia s demand to recapitalize the bank due to mismanagement according to court documents psb loaned millions of dollars to related and un related companies and the funds were never returned meaning they never got paid for the loans there is an ongoing investigation in russia about whether those loans were fraudulent ananyev s top tier clients from psb are holding around 250 million in bonds issued by peters international a special purpose vehicle created by the ananyev brothers in the cayman islands to raise funds the notes were guaranteed by peters international n v and promsvyaz capital b v with promsvyaz capital being a shareholder in the ananyev s other bank the smaller vozrozhdenie bank now owned by vtb bank no longer in control of the banks they created dmitry ananyev has had over 28 million of his assets frozen a london court issued a freezing order on july 20 2018 on october 24 new investors holding two year psb defaulted loan notes want to be added in a joinder claim to the original list of 9 hoping to get the same high commercial court of justice in london to grant them the same freezing order as the other psb debt holders investors want another 11 5 million and 5 4 million euros frozen by the courts which is the equivalent of what they lost in their investment based on court documents rumor has it that there are many more waiting in the wings if the dispute goes the way of the psb investors it would be a bigger fraud case than the one engulfing american private equity investor michael calvey founder of baring vostok capital partners in moscow photo by mikhail svetlov getty images russian investors target billionaire s lost bank ananyev s attorneys in london want the case thrown out saying the new investors like the last 9 have no business sueing in a british court the problem is the ananyev brothers owned the banks there through u k registered holding companies the jurisdictional challenges of the latest suit by the 24 russian clients are relevant to any additional freezing order of ananyev s assets psb s vip clients said that peters international and promsyvaz capital in the british virgin islands acted as brokers and peters international investment nv were guarantors based on court documents of the financial transactions that have the firm s name on them they say the two firms were co guarantors to the psb bonds peters is considered central to the ananyev brothers corporate structure and was the means by which they funneled money from these short term bonds offered to their top tier clientele the two british holding companies urgula platinum and antracite investment limited were opened in the u k in 2014 a psb press release on its website dated june 18 2014 says the sole shareholder of anthracite is alexei and the sole shareholder of urgula is dmitry as to whether or not those companies fall under british law their own press release says in the uk all e u directives are applied including in terms of anti money laundering and counter terrorism financing legislation information disclosure protection of investors rights corporate standards compliance with oecd recommendations which will protect the interest of psb and other investors of psb setting up the british companies had less to do with taxation and more to do with shifting the brothers business to europe with eu investor protections applied by the british courts through these holding companies the ananyev brothers held 88 ownership of psb with the u k holding companies the ananyev s may have stepped into a potential trap they set up themselves because of their location the english courts british jurisdiction laws and regulations apply broadly to both russia based investors want to move on from all these bad headlines of bankers in trouble as one moscow hedge fund manager told me this week off the record about the new case in london scheduled for feb 25 we know nothing we want to know nothing to american investors who have nothing to do with psb the russian banking system has been cleaned up psb isn t the only one to fall from grace though it is the one with the most investor attacks against previous owners no one wants to discuss how bad the russian business climate is or was some say business sentiment in russia is on the mend moody s gave it investment grade this month investors are longing for good news there if you re going to buy bonds or any fixed income instrument of a russian bank it becomes a question of who are the owners how are they viewed by the kremlin and how are the viewed by international courts the bar is set very high says katherine renfrew an emerging markets bond fund manager for tiaa investments look in 2012 you had over 900 banks in russia and now you have around 500 the central bank has been tough on mid sized and smaller lenders like psb and cleaned them up it s been a good trend it has every foreign investor in russia says so but it has been a negative for dozens of psb clients and the two billionaire brothers who blame the central bank s takeover and subsequent ban on all transactions over 1 million rubles per month or around 15 000 for their crash landing the central bank did not return requests for comment money to burn psb s high net worth clients say they were advised by representatives of the bank to buy short term loan notes that yielded over 5 interest in dollars and euros months ahead of the central bank takeover these are the defaulted bonds in question the money was supposedly used by the ananyev brothers to prop up other businesses which had inadequate capital investors say that they were given guarantees but come to find out those guarantees were worthless and never put on paper evgeny atamanov 48 is one of the russian investors on the claim he has two children he s married he started banking with psb in 2015 court documents state that atamanov was a vip client and was offered the loan notes by a bank rep in april 2017 he sunk the minimum 100 000 into one issue and 100 000 euros into another the minimum amount required by qualified investors the deal was registered in july five months later the central bank takes over psb psb representatives then instructed him and other holders to sell those loan notes at a discount he signed them over and never got paid others invested over a million dollars in the dollar bond and over a million euros in the euro bond according to financial transactions records submitted to the court as evidence each investor received one coupon payment for each issue back in october 2017 that was the first and only payment the principal investment is gone lawyers for the 24 newcomers say that the ananyev s misappropriated very large amounts from those customers for their own benefit and shifted it around through a company u k called fintailor peters and other entities all that has changed is that dmitry ananyev has paid money to the court in response to the original freezing order andrew john ford an attorney for the russian investors at lipman karas in london wrote in a court statement dated oct 2 2018 this is at best a neutral factor the speed at which dmitry ananyev was apparently able to cause the transfer of a substantial sum of money presumably from some part of his wealth of holding structures underlines his facility to easily move assets around when desired the money was moved from psb client banks through offshore units which the ananyev s owned a 50 stake at least according to court documents skadden never commented on the case here but a trove of court documents and letters between the opposing legal teams sets the story skadden will try to prove again that the freezing order never should have happened against dmitry in october skadden filed an application with the court trying to get dimitry s millions unblocked from the original freezing order they said that as he resides in cyprus and not the u k he should be sued there instead moreover they say that at least one of the companies being sued fintailor is not registered to dmitry or alexei the central bank of russia said that bank accounts in the name of fintailor were used to hold assets improperly diverted from psb bank before the takeover began fintailor also transacted with peters international setting the table for ties with the ananyevs court documents of financial records show 2018 bloomberg finance lp from best to bust psb s implosion has been a catastrophe for everyone psbs founders built in relatively short order one of the most important systemic banks in russia until it was taken over by the central bank to prevent the collapse it was ranked no 8 nationwide in terms of retail deposits and no 5 for small to mid sized business loans it had grown exponentially year over year since 2001 the bank ran into some liquidity problems in 2012 it withdrew its ipo plans it was not alone numerous russian banks were hurting alarm bells went off at the central bank they found that psb s credit profile was loaded with risk and bad equity investments on the eve of psb getting taken over by a temporary administration put in place by the central bank of russia the ananyev brothers orchestrated the sale and buy back of 20 of the bank s shares in order to enable them to remove substantial amounts of capital from their bank before it was essentially nationalized money was believed to have been moved to cyprus according to court records shortly before this dozens of psb vip clients were talked into swapping their deposits into these loan notes for safety lawyers for the russian investors say dmitry and alexei knowingly misrepresented the financial health of their business empire when selling those issues that empire has shrunk the ananyev brothers cyprus investment firm postscriptum capital withdrew its investment license in november 2018 after the worldwide freezing order postscriptum was used to transact between all of the various financial entities owned by ananyev including psb bank and peters international the ananyevs have sold all of their relevant businesses technoserv a top five it firm is now majority owned by vtb bank the takeover of banks like psb have been seen as positive i met with russian central banker elvira nabiullina in 2017 when all of this was happening and she was matter of fact about what they were doing says russia investor phillip torres co head of emerging markets for aegon asset management the russian banking system had gotten out of control and oligarchs had set up banks of their own to funnel special business deals or to make payments to their friends through depositors it s obvious that those under regulated banks are a recipe for disaster nabiullina looked at it and said we have to shut it down i think it was a good plan and they are doing a good job dmitry ananyev says he is a victim of poor circumstances between strict capital requirements and a temporary freeze on what they could spend in the lead up to their takeover there was no way psb could have paid its investors he says over the past few months i have faced legal claims and character attacks that i could never have anticipated he wrote in a witness statement to the high court of justice in london dated oct 26 there s a roadshow of lawyers in moscow trying to persuade former psb clients to sue me this whole situation is incredibly frustrating for me and has caused me a great deal of stress he says from the date of the central bank s takeover all of my powers as chairman of the board were suspended i lost my life s work and a business i spent 20 years building with my brother dmitry is the main target of the investors he acquired the remainder of alexei s stakes in the company s they built together he lives in limassol cyprus with his wife and three children ananyev said that previous loan notes his vip clients purchased all ran to maturity and were paid interest plus principal he says the 33 clients were qualified investors under russia law and should have known that risks of losing their principal investment were real a london court will decide this week how much closer those investors get to see their money in july 2018 high court judge sara cockerill called the u k holding companies the alter ego of dmitry and alexei ananyev in october 2018 cockerill went after another billionaire or rather an ex billionaire this time it was kingfisher beer man vijay mallya from india ordering him to sell a fleet of luxury cars including a 2012 maybach and two ferraris to pay debts back home seeing how cockerill has already upheld a recent jurisdiction claim and has no problem going after foreigners with assets kept in the british financial system or on british soil it seems probable that dmitry gets hit with another freezing order later this week there is also a case in the second district court of new york that involves u s banks who have information on financial transactions between the two parties the ananyevs case is much smaller than bernie madoff the american wealth manager who stole billions from over 4 000 clients but it s the difference of size not substance said one of the moscow based investors that is part of the class actions after 2012 when the company was losing money the bank founders leaned on their vip clients to keep them afloat claimant attorneys said based on court filings for foreign investors psb s downfall was something no one wanted to see repeated after hundreds of banks have gone bust the dust is still settling but for them looked at from far away when a russian bank explodes so long as the able bodies at the central bank are running the bomb squad then all is well that ends well
making the economy political in jordan s tax revolts s ince early december 2018 protesters have gathered every thursday in amman s fourth circle in the zahran district in opposition to a revised version of the unpopular tax bill introduced last june that original legislation had sparked a broad based tax revolt across jordan which quickly turned into an informal referendum on theof neoliberal development including diminishing social services lower wages and rising unemployment while the december 2018 and january 2019 protests echoed the economic refrains of the original june tax revolt the tax protests took on a political character after the monarchthe revised law these renewed protests were spearheaded by a broad coalition of jordanians tired of a long standing hashemite strategy of undermining the civilian government and promising reform after sacking prime minister hani mulki in june king abdullah ii appointed omar al razzaz a former world bank economist who previously served as jordan s education minister as the new prime minister the king tasked al razzaz s cabinet with launching a new national dialogue as a step toward developing a revised tax bill al razzaz was also asked to review the entire tax system with the aim of delineating the relationship between citizens and the state through a clear social contract that identifies rights and duties the original june protests quieted as a watchful public waited to see whether change was on the horizon opposition to the tax reforms remained broad uniting jordanians from diverse class and geographic backgrounds against the political establishment and economic elites when government ministers toured the country in september 2018 to promote modified legislation local delegations in the southern governorates of maan and tafileh and northern jerash and ajloun expelled the politicians and firmly rejected the bill despite these clear negative signals the new tax bill received parliamentary and monarchical approval and went into effect on january 1 2019 since the law appeared in the official gazette on december 2 2018 protestors have returned to amman s fourth circle every thursday angry with not only the new tax system and a flagging economy but also with a political process that fosters corruption and absolutism to satisfy protestors the monarchy will need to establish the terms of a new social contract which require far reaching economic and political reforms that reach the highest levels of jordanian political and economic power an obsolete social contract from the early decades of jordanian statehood the hashemite regime cultivated a broad social contract that insulated the ruling elite from demands for political inclusion by providing government jobs and public services to key constituencies the government used foreign aid inflows to subsidize basic commodities and expand the public sector to bolster national employment under this arrangement citizens tolerated minimal political rights in exchange for state jobs and economic patronage both the diminishing nature of state resources and the widening grievances of jordanian protesters necessitate a solution to this political economic crisis the will and resources to sustain the old social contract are dwindling but no coherent alternative has emerged under king abdullah ii however hashemite strategy has pivoted away from this welfare based social contract instead favoring the interests of a rising capitalist elite and the withdrawal of welfare provisions and government supports king abdullah ii s neoliberal economic reforms of the early 2000 s restructured the public and private sectors concurrently without dismantling the patronage networks of his father s era these networks reliant on state institutions and funds began to falter without being completely dismantled as state policy shifted toward private interests thursday protesters from the middle and lower classes feel that they are therefore being asked to shoulder a double burden due to the erosion of long standing entitlements and increased taxes for that reason income tax reform is considered one of the most controversial bills on the jordanian legislative agenda among the fourth circle protestors for example ahmad from madaba described his motivation for protesting in terms of restoring the prior arrangement we want to return to the original social contract that we jordanians agreed on with the monarchy the protection of the throne for the attainment of a decent life population growth refugee inflows and variations in external revenue from the gulf cooperation council and western donors however have inhibited the regime s ability to continue to finance the old contract while jordanian citizen s pocketbooks bear the burden of adjustment ghaith a public sector employee cited his meagre income as his main reason for joining the protests he makes 380 jd us 535 per month which he says is insufficient to meet his basic needs he and other young jordanian workers are wasting their lives on jobs that cannot provide a decent living as state welfare provision contracts the state s demands for increased tax revenue has hit jordanians hard the new tax law widens the base of income taxpayers by reducing the annual household income that is tax exempt from jd 24 000 33 778 to jd 18 000 25 334 exemptions for individuals were also lowered from jd 12 000 16 889 to jd 8 000 11 260 al razzaz s government argues that the new law does not affect most jordanians because a majority earn income below the new tax threshold as much as 80 percent of workers registered with the jordanian social security corporation earn less than jd 7 200 annually this winter s thursday protesters continue to express similar economic grievances to those raised in june 2018 protesters predominantly come from the professional and middle classes and certain provisions of the new law are directly at odds with their interests protestors in june directed much of their ire at the fact that the proposed tax bill would increase their tax burdens without providing for adequate public services and support in education healthcare and finances that they rely upon a national poll taken at the time found that 77 percent of jordanians supported protest action to prevent the tax increases although the bill was the most progressive tax legislation since king abdullah ii took power in 1999 it was regressive in comparison to the tax laws introduced in the 1980s and 1990s in addition the revised bill passed in january was even more regressive than the original june reform because it cancels the deductible allowances of jd 4000 5 630 for personal expenditures for education medical treatment and interest payments on personal loans moreover since june 2018 protestors have also used the tax bill as a vehicle to demand greater public oversight of the political process and express criticism of the government for farah a young professional translator the june strikes were the first protest action that brought her to the street in december she returned to the fourth circle again to protest the proposed tax law s economic effects on the middle class but also expressed frustration with the broader political process whatever economic measures were eventually adopted by the government she said what matters now is that we are fed up with uncommitted promises we do not want to be fooled again by the regime political corruption and neoliberal reforms although economic grievances often take pride of place in response to the tax law protesters largely blame jordan s broader economic crisis on the political establishment and its cozy relationship with elite economic interests ghaith shares the view of many that f the government revised the tax exemptions for the powerful capitalists and combated tax evasion it would not need to raise taxes on the poor protesters responses to the tax legislation typically speak to a more fundamental rejection of politics as usual which they view as corrupt and benefiting only a small national and economic elite these perceptions are symptomatic of the economic liberalization policies implemented since king abdullah ii was crowned in 1999 under the late king hussein the government was run by a cadre of professional public servants and bureaucrats who upheld the established patronage network king abdullah ii however has turned to a different set of elites to set government policies and run its affairs primarily the ammani business and capitalist classes this reality is not lost on the protestors who took to the streets this winter several protestors expressed their view that the privatization and austerity reforms of the last 20 years were designed to benefit a corrupt capitalist elite bringing capitalists and neoliberals into government has blurred the lines between public and private interests the capitalist political elite quickly adapted the political rules of the ancien regime for their private gain parliamentarians who also have private companies may be tempted to steer government policies and expenditures in a direction that favors their interests without substantive political reforms economic liberalization resulted in a less inclusive political system in jordan than under the previous king hisham a jordanian lawyer who was among the protesters told us we want true economic reform revision of the privatization policies we want those policies to benefit all jordanians not only a few persons most jordanians believe that the government is not serious about tackling corruption and that the majority of parliamentarians evade taxes while the rich skim off the top hisham again connects the economic reforms to the political system election laws gave us a group of moneymen and contractors those laws failed to produce genuine representatives of the people indeed a recent report in the jordanian press found deep links between parliamentarians and private business with 60 percent of parliamentarians holding shares worth some us 775 million in approximately 460 jordanian companies additionally parliamentarians are privileged with access to public tenders amounting to hundreds of millions of jd questioning the monarchy s control the tax law ratified on january 1 2019 underscores the need for serious political restructuring of the unequal relationship between the monarchy and the civilian government which has been a key theme among fourth circle protestors the monarchy s ultimate power is often illustrated by its frequent removal of the existing government in response to popular grievances playing the role of the pressure valve and allowing the government to take the fall for unpopular decisions moreover the monarchy often overrides the government in response to popular complaints subverting the authority of the ministerial cabinet these powers have become even more pronounced in light of 2016 constitutional amendments that granted expanded powers that concentrated control of the judiciary foreign policy defense and security in the hands of the monarch that the monarchy often sidesteps his cabinet and calls the shots was recently exemplified by successful concessions gained by protestors on other hot button issues such as the controversial lands in baquorah and ghummar leased to the israeli government under the 1994 peace treaty although the government was expected to allow the israeli state to continue using the land the king responded to protests against this prospect in october by unilaterally terminating treaty provisions governing these lands when their 25 year lease expired on october 25 this anecdote highlights a fundamental tension in the unfolding drama over jordanian state society relations although the 1994 peace treaty between jordan and israel was negotiated by the prime minister and his cabinet the king repeatedly steps in to resolve issues that should be the domain of elected officials while king abdullah ii frequently references his commitment to a future devolution of power to the prime minister and his cabinet his actions throughout this period of upheaval and dissent demonstrate that true power remains reserved for the monarchy and select elites by defaulting once again to such conservative policies the king is trying to confine the terms of the debate to the economic sphere but veteran opposition figures and young protesters alike have reached a consensus that structural change cannot be confined to the economy alone sofyan a communist activist since the 1970s when political parties were banned described the situation as one of arrested institutions the cabinet has no authority over state institutions all the authority is concentrated in the hands of a one man the king is the only decision maker in the country the monarchy must make the first move to open jordanian parliamentary politics because the king is the only individual capable of making decisions about reform the government lacks authority both the diminishing nature of state resources and the widening grievances of jordanian protesters necessitate a solution to this political economic crisis the will and resources to sustain the old social contract are dwindling but no coherent alternative has emerged instead the regime appears trapped under the political weight of its large public sector locked in by patterns of dependence and distribution at the same time the few businessmen and capitalists who have benefitted from the new status quo have an interest in maintaining a weak parliamentary system because it allows them to direct policy and pillage the state s resources any new social contract will have to establish new more inclusive ways of distributing state benefits while increasing fiscal capacity this kind of reform will be a herculean task as long as the political will to enact tangible and inclusive political reforms remains elusive in the face of the government s weakness by design and an elite culture of cronyism and corruption the jordanian citizenry remain unwilling to pay more taxes the old system no longer works but the way forward demands that jordan s leaders address the need for substantive institutional reforms in both the economic and political systems that currently govern jordanian lives

on february 20 2019 russian president vladimir putin addressed the federation council the address was attended by federation council members state duma deputies members of the government leaders of the constitutional court and supreme court and governors in his speech putin tackled two main topics social justice and sovereignty arrogating to himself the role of the popular tribune chastising the elites in the first part of his address putin discussed demographic problems increasing life expectancy creating jobs and boosting pensions stressing that it is the state s role to help people and extricate them from difficult situations in their lives putin also stated we must not repeat the mistakes of the past decades and wait for communism to arrive in the second part of his speech putin addressed one of his pet topics sovereignty putin stressed russia has been and always will be a sovereign and independent state this is a given it will either be that or will simply cease to exist we must clearly understand this without sovereignty russia cannot be a state some countries can do this but not russia putin concluded his speech by commenting on the us withdrawal from the inf treaty and warning washington against deploying medium and short range missiles in europe i am saying this directly and openly now so that no one can blame us later so that it will be clear to everyone in advance what is being said here russia will be forced to create and deploy weapons that can be used not only in the areas we are directly threatened from but also in areas that contain decision making centers for the missile systems threatening us putin menaced below are excerpts from putin s address presidential address to the federal assembly source kremlin ru presidential address to the federal assembly source kremlin ru presidential address to the federal assembly source kremlin ru presidential address to the federal assembly source kremlin ru we must not repeat the mistakes of the past decades and wait for communism to arrive president of russia vladimir putin members of the federation council state duma deputies citizens of russia if someone prefers to work in the business as usual mode without challenges avoiding initiative or responsibility they had better leave immediately i already hear that some things are impossible too difficult the standards are too high and it will not work with such an attitude you had better stay away besides you cannot fool the people they are acutely aware of hypocrisy lack of respect or any injustice they have little interest in red tape and bureaucratic routine it is important for people to see what is really being done and the impact it has on their lives and the lives of their families and not sometime in the future but now we must not repeat the mistakes of the past decades and wait for communism to arrive we have to change the situation for the better now at the same time i would like to emphasize and repeat our development projects are not federal and even less so agency based they are national their results must be visible in each region of the federation in every municipality it is here on the ground that the majority of specific tasks is implemented allow me to underscore thanks to years of common work and the results achieved we can now direct and concentrate enormous financial resources at least enormous for our country on development goals these resources have not come as a rainfall we have not borrowed them these funds have been earned by millions of our citizens by the entire country they need to be applied to increase the wealth of russia and the wellbeing of russian families very soon this year people should feel real changes for the better it is on the basis of their opinion and assessments at the beginning of next year that we will evaluate the first results of our work on the national projects and we will draw the appropriate conclusions about the work quality and performance at all levels of executive power the state must help people help them out of difficult life situations colleagues let me now share some specifics on our objectives i will begin with the key objective of preserving our nation which means providing all around support to families family childbirth procreation and respect for the elderly have always served as a powerful moral framework for russia and its multi ethnic people russia has entered an extremely challenging period in terms of demographics as you know the birth rate is declining as i have already said this is caused by purely objective reasons which have to do with the immense human losses and birth dearth experienced by our country in the 20th century during the great patriotic war and the dramatic years following the dissolution of the soviet union this does not mean however that we must accept this situation or come to terms with it definitely not we succeeded in overcoming the negative demographic trends in the early 2000s when our country faced extreme challenges this seemed to be an impossible challenge at the time nevertheless we succeeded and i strongly believe that we can do it again by returning to natural population growth by late 2023 early 2024 and last but not least the tax on land must be fair obviously the cadastral or market value of a land plot can change but tax rates must not go up and down unpredictably like roller coaster rides we have already limited to 10 percent the annual growth of the tax rates for residential property i suggest establishing the same limit for land plots colleagues solving our demographic problems increasing life expectancy and reducing mortality rates are directly related to eradicating poverty there are many reasons for poverty not only in our country but also in the world but it always literally crushes a person dimming their life prospects the state must help people help them out of difficult life situations how does it work and what is this all about the state helps people find jobs and improve their skills the state provides financial resources to families to run a household farm or to start a small business and by the way these are substantial resources of tens of thousands of rubles let me emphasize that support programs will be tailored to meet the needs of every specific applicant the allocation of these resources creates some obligations for the recipients they have to go through training find a job in the given field and provide a steady income for their family and children mechanisms of this kind are in place around the world and are very effective social contracts can change the lives of those who really want to do it it is estimated that more than 9 million people will be able to benefit from these support measures over a five year period i instruct the government to assist the regions that are proactive in introducing social contracts and work with them on co financing mechanisms let me emphasize that as we seek to overcome poverty and develop the social security net we need to reach every family in need and understand the problems it faces it should not be possible to refuse assistance simply because the life circumstances a person is facing are slightly inconsistent with the criteria set by a program and of course it is necessary to be scrupulous and attentive to every detail by way of example and this is not a very good example for our work i would like to say the following pensions were adjusted for inflation under the pension reform this year but if a pensioner s income exceeded the subsistence rate the social payments were no longer made at the same level they were either cancelled altogether or reduced as a result the pensions were not increased at all or the increases were much less than a pensioner expected so many people feel cheated with good reason probably many people in this hall understand what this is all about we made payments from the regional or federal budget to achieve the subsistence level we made adjustments for inflation and the cost of living either matched or exceeded it so these payments were discontinued and that was it it was necessary to take into account all the nuances but this was left undone and of course this should not be allowed to happen this injustice and it is certainly an injustice should be sorted immediately starting this year adjustments of pensions and monthly payments should by all means be above the subsistence rate of pensioners that is established every year in other words the state should first bring pensions to the subsistence level and only after that make adjustments in pensions and monthly payments payments for the first months of this year must be recalculated and people should be paid the money due to them that they have not received i would like to emphasize that all those who work in the social sphere or join the government or municipal services in order to help people resolve their urgent problems must meet the highest professional standards i believe by and large this is the case of course this is a very complicated job we all understand that working with people every day from morning until night is indeed difficult but if you have this job you should realize that it is no less important to understand people to know what they feel empathize share their worries and concerns and never permit yourself arrogant attitudes or a lack of respect for people either in word or deed i would like you to always remember this for the first time ever our reserves fully cover not only the sovereign debt which is quite small but also private borrowings colleagues the next important subject is healthcare i know that on the one hand its current state seems to be improving and medical treatment is becoming more accessible nevertheless many people are not satisfied it is easy to understand the reasons for this as a rule people judge the healthcare system by its primary component that is outpatient clinics and paramedic stations people voice complaints with regard to their work quite often they have to wait many days to see a specialist and it is impossible to quickly undergo the required tests free of charge people in remote communities are even having trouble getting appointments with medical personnel yes the number of paramedic stations and mobile medical units continues to increase but people in areas where there are no such facilities care nothing about the overall statistics i want to emphasize that medical treatment should become accessible for everyone by the end of 2020 in all populated areas across russia without exception and for all citizens regardless of their place of residence for your information an additional 1 590 outpatient clinics and paramedic stations are to be built or renovated in 2019 2020 and i hope that this will be accomplished more than 70 million people work in manufacturing agriculture or the services or are small business owners the state of russia s economy has a direct bearing on their income wellbeing and confidence in the future the primary tool for achieving steady wage increases is to promote quality employment and free enterprise qualified well paid jobs in all regions including both traditional and new sectors high economic growth rates are essential this is the only way to overcome poverty and ensure steady and perceptible increases in income this is the key to success as soon as in 2021 russia s economic growth rate must exceed 3 percent and stay above the global average afterwards this objective should not be discarded the government and the central bank are once again tasked with complying with the target inflation rate i have already said this and we knew that this would happen when we put aside financial resources for the national projects this was an expected outcome and now we need to make sure that the situation gets back to normal we can do this as i said the government and the central bank must ensure that the inflation targets are met and create a favorable macroeconomic environment for facilitating growth in general we have a strong financial safety cushion i have something positive to share with you for the first time ever our reserves fully cover not only the sovereign debt which is quite small but also private borrowings these funds are at work and investment of the national welfare fund generates budget revenue therefore i would like to address those of our colleagues who constantly criticize the government its financial and economic ministries and ask where the money went and where we invested it we set a target to reach a certain level after which we can use these funds although cautiously so as not to cause any macroeconomic disturbances we are about to reach this level and are beginning to do it the proceeds from these investments go to the federal budget in 2018 proceeds from investing the national welfare fund in the amount of 70 5 billion rubles were added to the budget as concerns the defense industry we must use our current capacities for diversification to expand civil production colleagues understand what i am talking about here there are certain targets for each year and they must be achieved no matter what and of course now is the time for more daring initiatives for creating businesses and production companies for promoting new products and services this wave of technological development allows companies to grow and win markets very quickly there are already examples of successful companies innovative companies we need many more of them including in such fields as artificial intelligence big data the internet of things and robotics the most crucial indicator of a business s efficiency and competitiveness lies in expanding export and entering external markets the success of our agricultural industry is of course a good example of such development our agricultural export increased by 19 4 percent in 2018 reaching 25 8 billion in 2024 we must reach 45 billion incidentally we are not only one of the largest wheat exporters last year we exported 44 million tonnes we have at least one more significant achievement thanks to the developments of russian researchers we are no longer dependent on other countries for wheat seeds experts will confirm how critically important this is russia must have the entire range of its own advanced agricultural technology which must be available not only to large but also to small farms this is literally a matter of national security and successful competition in the growing food markets improving the quality of life for those who work in rural areas is a key long term factor of the agricultural industry s steady growth i would like to point out to the government that as soon as this year they must approve a new development program for rural territories that must be enforced as of january 1 2020 one more thing i think everybody will agree that our massive natural resources constitute our natural advantage they need to be used for increasing the production of organic produce i am instructing the government to create a protected brand for clean products a brand that will guarantee safety of the technology used and win the reputation of high quality both on the domestic and foreign markets trust me it will be extremely popular abroad there is hardly anything clean left there this year the railway section of the crimean bridge will be launched and will become a powerful impetus i would like to take this opportunity to thank all the construction and railway workers we saw that a bypass railway was built near krasnodar alongside an approach railway to this junction from the caucasus coast as i have said trains will begin using the crimean bridge in 2019 creating a powerful development driver for crimea and sevastopol in addition to this the expressway linking moscow and st petersburg is expected to be completed creating new business opportunities and jobs for people living in novgorod tver leningrad and moscow regions the nuclear defense project gave the country nuclear power to achieve a revolution in communications navigation and systems for remote sensing of the earth we must dramatically increase the capabilities of our satellite group russia has unique technology for this but such tasks require a fundamental upgrade of the entire space industry i am instructing roscosmos and the moscow government to establish a national space centre my colleagues came to me and told me about it this is a good project is designed to unite relevant organizations design bureaus and prototype production facilities and to support scientific research and the training of personnel we are seeing that global competition is increasingly shifting to science technology and education just recently it seemed inconceivable that russia could make not just a breakthrough but also a high tech breakthrough in defense this was difficult complex work much had to be restored or started from scratch it was necessary to break new ground and find bold unique solutions nevertheless this was done it was done by our engineers workers and scientists including very young people that grew up with these projects let me repeat that i know all the details of this large scale effort and i am completely justified in saying for instance that the development of the avangard strategic hypersonic glide vehicle is tantamount to the launching of the world s first artificial satellite and not just in terms of enhancing the country s defense capability and security although this is the primary goal but in influencing the consolidation of our scientific potential and the development of unique technological assets at one time the nuclear defense project gave the country nuclear power the construction of a missile shield that started with the launch of the world s first artificial satellite allowed the country to begin peaceful space exploration today we need to use the personnel knowledge competences and materials we have acquired from developing the next generation of weapons to produce the same kind of results for civilian applications we have yet to implement new ambitious scientific and technological programs an executive order on genetic research has already been signed and i propose launching a similar large scale program at the national level on artificial intelligence in the middle of the next decade we should be among the leaders in these science and technology areas which of course will determine the future of the world and the future of russia to implement such projects we need to accelerate the development of an advanced scientific infrastructure incidentally the reactor pik a mega science class research unit was recently launched in leningrad region over the next 20 years it will be one of the world s most powerful sources for neutron research enabling scientists to conduct unique research in physics biology and chemistry and to develop new drugs diagnostic tools and new materials for the first time in decades russian shipyards will break ground for several modern research vessels capable of working in all strategic areas including the arctic seas and the antarctic exploring the shelf and the natural resources of the world ocean to promote powerful technological development we need to build a modern research and development model this is why we are setting up research and education centers in the regions that will integrate all levels of education with the potential of research facilities and business within three years centers like this should be established in 15 regions in the russian federation the first five this year three of them in tyumen and belgorod regions and perm territory are close to completion and are to open this year we need specialists capable of working at advanced production facilities developing and applying breakthrough technology solutions therefore we need to ensure a broad introduction of updated curricula at all levels of professional education to organize personnel training for the industries that are still being formed i want to speak directly to our young people your talents energy and creative abilities are among russia s strongest competitive advantages we understand and greatly value this we have created an entire system of projects and personal growth competitions in which every young person from school to university age can show what they are made of these include proektoriya my first business i am a professional russian leaders and many others i want to stress that all this is being created for young people to take advantage of these opportunities i urge you to take a chance and use them be bold realize your dreams and plans do something of value for yourself your family and your country russia has been and always will be a sovereign and independent state colleagues russia has been and always will be a sovereign and independent state this is a given it will either be that or will simply cease to exist we must clearly understand this without sovereignty russia cannot be a state some countries can do this but not russia building relations with russia means working together to find solutions to the most complex matters instead of trying to impose solutions we make no secret of our foreign policy priorities these include strengthening trust countering global threats promoting cooperation in the economy and trade education culture science and technology as well as facilitating people to people contact these tenets underpin our work within the un the commonwealth of independent states as well as within the group of 20 brics and the shanghai cooperation organization we believe in the importance of promoting closer cooperation within the union state of russia and belarus including close foreign policy and economic coordination together with our integration partners within the eurasian economic union we will continue creating common markets and outreach efforts this includes implementing the decisions to coordinate the activities of the eaeu with china s belt and road initiative on the way to a greater eurasian partnership russia s equal and mutually beneficial relations with china currently serve as an important factor of stability in international affairs and in terms of eurasian security offering a model of productive economic cooperation russia attaches importance to realizing the potential of the special privileged strategic partnership with india we will continue to promote political dialogue and economic cooperation with japan russia stands ready to work with japan on finding mutually acceptable terms for signing a peace treaty we intend to promote deeper ties with the association of southeast asian nations we also hope that the european union and the major european countries will finally take actual steps to put political and economic relations with russia back on track people in these countries are looking forward to cooperation with russia which includes corporations as well as small and medium sized enterprises and european businesses in general it goes without saying that this would serve our common interests the unilateral withdrawal of the us from the inf treaty is the most urgent issue in russian american relations the unilateral withdrawal of the us from the inf treaty is the most urgent and most discussed issue in russian american relations this is why i am compelled to talk about it in more detail indeed serious changes have taken place in the world since the treaty was signed in 1987 many countries have developed and continue to develop these weapons but not russia or the us we have limited ourselves in this respect of our own free will understandably this state of affairs raises questions our american partners should have just said so honestly rather than make far fetched accusations against russia to justify their unilateral withdrawal from the treaty it would have been better if they had done what they did in 2002 when they walked away from the abm treaty and did so openly and honestly whether that was good or bad is another matter i think it was bad but they did it and that is that they should have done the same thing this time too what are they doing in reality first they violate everything then they look for excuses and appoint a guilty party but they are also mobilizing their satellites that are cautious but still make noises in support of the us at first the americans began developing and using medium range missiles calling them discretionary target missiles for missile defense then they began deploying mk 41 universal launch systems that can make offensive combat use of tomahawk medium range cruise missiles possible i am talking about this and using my time and yours because we have to respond to the accusations that are leveled at us but having done everything i have just described the americans openly and blatantly ignored the provisions envisaged by articles 4 and 6 of the inf treaty according to item 1 article vi i am quoting each party shall eliminate all intermediate range missiles and the launchers of such missiles so that no such missiles launchers shall be possessed by either party paragraph 1 of article vi provides that and i quote upon entry into force of the treaty and thereafter neither party may produce or flight test any intermediate range missile or produce any stages or launchers of such missiles end of quote using medium range target missiles and deploying launchers in romania and poland that are fit for launching tomahawk cruise missiles the us has openly violated these clauses of the treaty they did this some time ago these launchers are already stationed in romania and nothing happens it seems that nothing is happening this is even strange this is not at all strange for us but people should be able to see and understand it how are we evaluating the situation in this context i have already said this and i want to repeat russia does not intend this is very important i am repeating this on purpose russia does not intend to deploy such missiles in europe first if they really are built and delivered to the european continent and the united states has plans for this at least we have not heard otherwise it will dramatically exacerbate the international security situation and create a serious threat to russia because some of these missiles can reach moscow in just 10 12 minutes this is a very serious threat to us in this case we will be forced i would like to emphasize this we will be forced to respond with mirror or asymmetric actions what does this mean i am saying this directly and openly now so that no one can blame us later so that it will be clear to everyone in advance what is being said here russia will be forced to create and deploy weapons that can be used not only in the areas we are directly threatened from but also in areas that contain decision making centers for the missile systems threatening us what is important in this regard there is some new information these weapons will fully correspond to the threats directed against russia in their technical specifications including flight times to these decision making centers we know how to do this and will implement these plans immediately as soon as the threats to us become real i do not think we need any further irresponsible exacerbation of the current international situation we do not want this what would i like to add our american colleagues have already tried to gain absolute military superiority with their global missile defense project they need to stop deluding themselves our response will always be efficient and effective the work on promising prototypes and weapon systems that i spoke about in my address last year continues as scheduled and without disruptions we have launched serial production of the avangard system which i have already mentioned today as planned this year the first regiment of the strategic missile troops will be equipped with avangard the sarmat super heavy intercontinental missile of unprecedented power is undergoing a series of tests the peresvet laser weapon and the aviation systems equipped with kinzhal hypersonic ballistic missiles proved their unique characteristics during test and combat alert missions while the personnel learned how to operate them next december all the peresvet missiles supplied to the armed forces will be put on standby alert we will continue expanding the infrastructure for the mig 31 interceptors carrying kinzhal missiles the burevestnik nuclear powered cruise missile of unlimited range and the poseidon nuclear powered unmanned underwater vehicle of unlimited range are successfully undergoing tests in this context i would like to make an important statement we did not announce it before but today we can say that as soon as this spring the first nuclear powered submarine carrying this unmanned vehicle will be launched the work is going as planned today i also think i can officially inform you about another promising innovation as you may remember last time i said we had more to show but it was a little early for that so i will reveal little by little what else we have up our sleeves another promising innovation which is successfully being developed according to plan is tsirkon a hypersonic missile that can reach speeds of approximately mach 9 and strike a target more than 1 000 km away both under water and on the ground it can be launched from water from surface vessels and from submarines including those that were developed and built for carrying kalibr high precision missiles which means it comes at no additional cost for us on a related note i want to highlight that for the defense of russia s national interests two or three years ahead of the schedule set by the state arms program the russian navy will receive seven new multipurpose submarines and construction will begin on five surface vessels designed for the open ocean sixteen more vessels of this class will enter service in the russian navy by 2027 the us policy toward russia in recent years can hardly be called friendly to conclude on the unilateral withdrawal by the us from the treaty on the elimination of intermediate range and shorter range missiles here is what i would like to say the us policy toward russia in recent years can hardly be called friendly russia s legitimate interests are being ignored there is constant anti russia campaigning and more and more sanctions which are illegal in terms of international law are imposed without any reason whatsoever let me emphasize that we did nothing to provoke these sanctions the international security architecture that took shape over the past decades is being completely and unilaterally dismantled all while referring to russia as almost the main threat to the us let me say outright that this is not true russia wants to have sound equal and friendly relations with the us russia is not threatening anyone and all we do in terms of security is simply a response which means that our actions are defensive we are not interested in confrontation and we do not want it especially with a global power like the united states of america however it seems that our partners fail to notice the depth and pace of change around the world and where it is headed they continue with their destructive and clearly misguided policy this hardly meets the interests of the us itself but this is not for us to decide we can see that we are dealing with proactive and talented people but within the elite there are also many people who have excessive faith in their exceptionalism and supremacy over the rest of the world of course it is their right to think what they want but can they count probably they can so let them calculate the range and speed of our future arms systems this is all we are asking just do the maths first and take decisions that create additional serious threats to our country afterwards it goes without saying that these decisions will prompt russia to respond in order to ensure its security in a reliable and unconditional manner i have already said this and i will repeat that we are ready to engage in disarmament talks but we will not knock on a locked door anymore we will wait until our partners are ready and become aware of the need for dialogue on this matter we continue developing our armed forces and improving the intensity and quality of combat training in part using the experience we gained in the anti terrorist operation in syria much experience was gained by practically all the commanders of the ground forces by covert operations forces and military police warship crews army tactical and strategic and military transport aviation i would like to emphasize again that we need peace for sustainable long term development our efforts to enhance our defense capability are for only one purpose to ensure the security of this country and our citizens so that nobody would even consider pressuring us or launching an aggression against us colleagues we are facing ambitious goals we are approaching solutions in a systematic and consistent way building a model of socio economic development that will allow us to ensure the best conditions for the self fulfillment of our people and hence provide befitting answers to the challenges of a rapidly changing world and preserve russia as a civilization with its own identity rooted in centuries long traditions and the culture of our people our values and customs naturally we will only be able to achieve our goals by pooling our efforts together in a united society if all of us all citizens of russia are willing to succeed in specific endeavors such solidarity in striving for change is always the deliberate choice of the people themselves they make this choice when they understand that national development depends on them on the results of their labor when a desire to be needed and useful enjoys support when everyone finds a job by vocation one is happy with and most importantly when there is justice and a vast space for freedom and equal opportunity for work study initiative and innovation these parameters for development breakthroughs cannot be translated into figures or indicators but it is these things a unified society people being involved in the affairs of their country and a common confidence in our power that play the main role in reaching success and we will achieve this success by any means necessary

news national by staff reporter the government s decision to dump the united states dollar and adopt some form of local currency will hit workers the hardest as their incomes have been eroded with the floating of the exchange rate experts have warned reserve bank of zimbabwe rbz governor john mangudya s hugely anticipated monetary policy statement delivered last wednesday effectively brought back the local currency the rbz denoted the existing electronic balances bond notes and coins in circulation as realtime gross settlement rtgs dollars making them the official legal tender after a decade of a multi currency system the central bank also removed the 1 1 peg on the local currency against the us dollar practically de dollarising in a move which authorities hope will curb growth of the parallel market and ease foreign currency shortages that have crippled business however labour expert abraham kavalanjila described the rbz measures as daylight robbery against workers as they eroded the value of salaries paid in local currency this is daylight robbery against workers he said in my view the workers salaries need to be reviewed in line with what the unions were demanding the creation of a new currency will leave the worker the poorest human on this land of zimbabwe civil servants have been demanding payment of their salaries in united states dollars arguing that the devaluation of bond notes on the parallel market had significantly eaten into their incomes since october last year since december last year doctors and teachers have embarked on crippling strikes in an effort to force the government to review their salaries but to no avail kavalanjila said it was clear that salaries had been eroded by a factor of five the highest possible rate of rtgs to the us considering that they were originally pegged in bond notes at a rate of one is to one the workers were paid in bond notes that government said were equal to the us which was a lie he said what the government did last wednesday was to say we now agree that the bond note is not equal to the us what unions now need to do is to review the salaries based on the poverty datum line guided by the new prices of basic commodities zimbabwe congress of trade unions president peter mutasa said the new fiscal measures announced by the rbz spelt doom for workers who were already underpaid it means that all our salaries which were eroded by the parallel market rate are now being eroded officially he said there is now a mismatch between the incomes and cost of living and 95 of the working class has now been thrown into abject poverty he said the monetary policy is anti worker and there is nothing new about it we had this in 2008 and the results were disastrous we are expecting that the economy is going to sink further in 2008 the then central bank governor gideon gono abandoned the willing buyer willing seller priority focused twinning arrangement exchange rate after the interbank rate had failed to attract foreign currency to the formal market so subdued were the official exchange rates that the local currency traded at zw 100 330 21 against the us dollar compared to a record 9 million on the parallel cash rate which surged after the increase of daily withdrawal limits by the central bank jefrey matenje a labour expert said employers must brace for a fresh round of salary negotiations in response to the currency reforms the salaries have just lost two thirds of their value businesses can adjust pricing but in all fairness we need to have wage negotiations starting with the largest employer which is government i could be wrong but salaries and wages should go up for desmond tshele 34 who works for a bulawayo company as a cleaner the latest currency adjustments would condemn him to abject poverty this is absolute disaster i have been impoverished tshele a father of three said tshele earns 300 bond a month and with the rbz devaluing the local currency it means that he will now be taking home less than us 100 life is tough how can i take care of my family with this paltry salary remember i must take my kids to school i have to pay rentals i must get transport to work i need to feed my family and clothe them it s a very difficult situation he said joseph gunda the confederation of zimbabwe industries czi matabeleland chapter president said although the rbz had adopted proposals made by business the floating of the exchange rate would leave workers exposed whilst the issue of interbank trade of forex is a step in the right direction the monetary policy poses a challenge to labour he said it would appear labour has further been exposed as the diminishing buying power of the employee especially those in formal employment has worsened the employee has further been impoverished as their earnings or balances have been reduced or devalued three or four times by the official exchange rate that has clearly indicated the acceptance that the bond or rtgs dollar was not at par with the us gunda anticipates that the collective bargaining process would be tough this year following the rbz measures there is definitely going to be pressure from employees on employers to review salaries but on the other hand businesses are struggling for survival and many could be incapacitated to do so even though they fully understand the plight of the worker he said collective bargaining is going to be tough and we may witness more companies applying for wage increase exceptions and for those that are owed this may open up litigations the prices of basic commodities in the supermarkets will officially be pegged at the exchange rate prevailing on the day but the goods will be beyond the pocket of the employee thus the impact of the monetary policy on labour needs to be fully interrogated the value of bond notes and rtgs started plummeting in october last year when the rbz ordered banks to open separate foreign currency accounts for clients a surge in prices of goods and services led to severe shortages of basic commodities and fuel which still persists
the monetary policy presented by the central bank governor john mangudya remains very much the talk of the country and rightly so because of the ramifications the policy wroughts to the economy and the public in general editorial comment the monetary policy presented by the central bank governor john mangudya remains very much the talk of the country and rightly so because of the ramifications the policy wroughts to the economy and the public in general it is not a secret that the 1 1 peg for the united states dollar against the surrogate bond note currency was unsustainable quantified by finance minister mthuli ncube at a breakfast meeting yesterday at 2 billion per year that is a costly price to pay for policy failure and intransigence and the decision to scrap the peg brings a welcome end to a failing monetary policy while the larger section of the business community lauded the move which while expected would not have surprised anyone who has had dealings with successive zanu pf governments which have so far valued political expediency more than logic if it had not happened question marks still remain if the move represents the best solution to the country s deeper economic crisis it appears that for the umpteenth time zimbabweans have to deal with a new currency one called real time gross settlement dollars even in a movie script for the absurd its difficult to craft something so gleefully ridiculous every self respecting business person is treating the move with caution which is unlikely to tamper the demand for black market dollars and ease inflation unless the official interbank rate which comes into effect on monday rapidly catches up with the unofficial rate of exchange it needs no clairvoyant to explain that zimbabweans have very little trust in the economic management abilities of the zanu pf government and fears remain that the whole facade could trigger a return to the hyperinflation era it could work but requires utmost discipline from government and for the central bank to keep the liquidity low to keep the exchange rate stable even then president emmerson mnangagwa desperately needs to regain public trust but in the 15 months of his rule since the army forced long time strongman robert mugabe out in a coup in november 2017 he has shown no inclination and even capacity to work for that trust brutality by security forces in putting down public dissent has only widened the distance between the new leader and his subjects government efforts must therefore include not just fiscal discipline but convincing a sceptical public that it finally has a solution that has long eluded its predecessors and that zimbabweans can look forward without any trepidation and fear for the future
by roger j kerr the aussie dollar was trading quietly around 0 7150 against the usd last thursday 21 february ahead of their january employment data which the prior forecasts were for a 15 000 increase in jobs over the month a much stronger than expected job increase of 39 000 propelled the aud immediately higher to 0 7200 pulling the kiwi up to neat 0 6900 against the us unit the euphoria of a positive economic number for the aussie dollar bulls however proved to be short lived with westpac s economists immediately coming out with a new bearish forecast of two ocr interest rate cuts in 2019 whether the timing of the westpac announcement was coincidental or not we will never know if westpac s proprietary fx traders had forewarning of the negative ocr forecast release from their banks economists they would have been the aggressive sellers of the aud up near 0 7200 it certainly reversed the direction of the aussie dollar in the forex markets with the aud usd rate plunging to a low 0 7075 on friday the nzd usd rate reached a low 0 6770 on friday 22 february however has since recovered to 0 6840 the whip saw movements of both currencies in the end turning out to be a bit of a storm in a tea cup as the kiwi returns to a level at the end of the week very similar to where it started the previous 0 6750 to 0 6950 trading range for the nzd usd rate continues to hold firm with the daily ranges closing in on the mid point of 0 6850 it is difficult to see what the local negative factor could be to push the kiwi below the 0 6750 support area in the short to medium term the next major economic release is the december 2018 quarter s gdp growth number on 21st march retail sales figures for the december quarter on monday 25 february could prove to be an important lead indicator for the overall growth numbers both retail and gdp were flat in the september 2018 quarter and whilst it was not a boomer christmas sales period for retailers on line sales appear to have been strong a quarter on quarter retail sales increase above 1 0 will be positive for a gdp lift above the rbnz s forecast of 0 8 later next month such an outcome would be positive for the kiwi dollar on its own accord impact of brexit and cgt on the nz currency zero many economic and financial market commentators seem to take pleasure in extrapolating the global news of the day and confidently predicting that these events will send the kiwi dollar higher or lower the daily brexit shenanigans is a good case in point with the impending 31 march deadline looming as an event risk that will impact on the kiwi dollar if the free transfer of goods across the uk s borders is suddenly disrupted by a hard brexit some new zealand exporters will be inconvenienced if they have not taken precautionary measures beforehand however the direct impact on the nz economy and thus our currency value in my view will be negligible if the brits have managed to organise a complete mess for themselves the consequences for us are in reality quite minor and remote our politicians messing up our diplomatic and trading relationships with china is a much more serious matter one that we cannot afford to be cavalier about let us hope that our gcsb quickly follow the lead of the uk and germany government security outfits and state that huawei communications equipment offers no threat to new zealand s security if and when spark is allowed to use huawei 5g gear it should be positive for the kiwi dollar as the china relationship will be back on track the coalition labour government s tax working group has recommended a far reaching capital gains tax regime that if implemented would stifle a lot of business and entrepreneurial investment in our economy one objective of introducing a capital gains tax in new zealand was to attract investment dollars away from non productive residential property assets and into productive business investment assets what has been recommended by the twg appears to do the opposite the taxation technocrats in the group have taken a purist taxation approach without understanding that all investment entails both risk and reward and therefore should not be treated exactly equal when it comes to being taxed our economy needs risk takers and the cgt recommendations will stifle and dissuade this important component the minority group of three within the twg have published an alternative view with a much more sensible property speculation tax approach that would probably be more politically saleable there was absolutely no impact from the cgt recommendations on the new zealand dollar exchange rate trade deal draws closer president donald trump is not sure about a broad memorandum of understanding with the chinese on trade tariffs however a trade deal is what he wants and we could see such an agreement within a matter of weeks no matter which way you look at it a settlement and agreement by the chinese and americans to reduce tariffs and sign up to a trade deal is very positive news for commodity growth currencies like the nzd and aud our currencies weakened sharply in august to november last year when the us and china were trading insults with each other and both increasing import tariffs the opposite currency impact has to be expected when the tariffs are reversed watch for the kiwi dollar to break up through the 0 6950 resistance level when the donald is finally able to announce a victory for himself on the trade deal nzd aud cross rate stalling at 0 9600 yet again one limiting influence on further nz dollar appreciation over coming weeks will be speculators in the nzd aud cross rate unwinding their long kiwi short aussie positions the punters will be selling kiwi dollars to take their profits on the move up from 0 9000 to 0 9600 over the last four or five months the consistent trading pattern of the nzd aud exchange rate over the last five years has been that it never stays too long above 0 9600 when it spikes up to that level fx market speculative positioning does play an important part in short term exchange rate direction and thus a return to 0 9300 looks more likely over coming months aud importers should be hedged to the hilt of policy limits at 0 9600 whilst aud exporters who previously loaded up with hedging at 0 9000 0 9100 can continue to hold off and use up the hedging they have email roger j kerr

a former u s government official believes president donald trump is severely hurting the american economy in various ways we have a delusional unhinged madman in the oval office and anything is possible david stockman the former director of the office of management and budget omb under president ronald reagan told yahoo finance s the ticker video above he s conducting four wars on the american economy and it s not going to make it great again stockman who just published peak trump the undrainable swamp and the fantasy of maga argued that trump is waging a trade war a border war a political war against the fed and a war on the nation s solvency u s president donald trump points a finger during a special session entitled fair and sustainable future as part of g20 leaders summit in buenos aires argentina on november 30 2018 photo murat kaynak anadolu agency getty images 1 trade war in march 2018 trump slapped a 10 tariff on 200 billion worth of chinese goods he accused the country of unfair trade practices that were hurting americans and the u s economy china quickly responded with retaliatory tariffs on roughly 50 billion worth of u s goods tensions escalated for months with both sides refusing to budge on the issue kicking up tariffs even further the trade war is a war on consumers stockman said if it goes from 10 which is already costing 30 billion a year just on chinese imports to higher that is only going to be that much worse negotiations are underway on a trade deal that would address issues including forced technology transfer and cyber theft intellectual property rights services currency agriculture and non tariff barriers to trade it looks like perhaps this new version of the titanic will avoid the iceberg american apparel footwear association s president and ceo rick helfenbein told yahoo finance s on the move clearly that makes all of us very happy because we have serious concerns if these tariffs come in it s already hitting us a bit it s already baking some inflation into our system president donald trump talks with reporters as he gets a briefing on border wall prototypes tuesday march 13 2018 in san diego ap photo evan vucci 2 border war stockman then referred to trump s hardline stance against illegal immigrants as a border war on immigrant labor because of shifting demographics the domestic labor force is shrinking stockman explained we need immigrant labor we shouldn t be having a you know silly battle over a wall in a border where there isn t a crisis a promise he made while on the campaign trail trump now has appropriated enough funds to commence building a nearly 2 000 mile long border wall across the u s mexico border the trump administration has also inspired harsh immigration enforcement tactics carried out by the u s immigrations and customs enforcement stricter immigration policies will strengthen national security they argued we re moving in tremendous numbers of people to get out the ms 13 gangs and others gangs that illegally come into our country said trump and we re getting them out by the thousands but this is a perilous situation and it threatens to become even more hazardous as our economy gets better and better graphic david foster yahoo finance 3 attacking the fed trump s third war was a political one said stockman and it was aimed at the federal reserve for its interest rate hikes he s conducting a political war on the fed that finally was getting enough courage up to normalize interest rates stockman explained for crying out loud 10 years interest rates have been below the inflation rate which means zero money market costs it s been a boon like never before to speculators it s done nothing for main street after a decade of keeping rates low following the great recession the fed began to accelerate interest rates hikes with a third one in september 2018 chairman jerome powell indicated that the central bank was going to be more data dependent in its decisions but trump expressed frustration over the hike fearing that it may stall the economy and tweeted the only problem our economy has is the fed they don t have a feel for the market they don t understand necessary trade wars or strong dollars or even democrat shutdowns over borders the fed is like a powerful golfer who can t score because he has no touch he can t putt donald j trump realdonaldtrump december 24 2018 he even discussed firing powell according to a report by bloomberg but last week s fed minutes indicate that the fed would be more patient in evaluating financial conditions which means that it is pausing interest rate hikes given risks and uncertainties in the outlook the u s capitol building dome is seen through a beveled window at the library of congress in washington photo ap carolyn kaster 4 war on the nation s solvency stockman s final gripe with trump is over the national debt as the number soars past 22 trillion which is 22 times higher than when reagan and stockman were in office trump remains mum on the issue he s conducting a war on the nation s solvency with a fiscal policy that is more out to lunch than anything i ve seen since 1970 when i started on capitol hill stockman fumed the big challenge was that even though the economy has been expanding at a rapid pace we re in the last months you don t raise the deficit to 1 2 trillion at the very tippy top of a business cycle and expect anything but bad results said stockman hence stockman said everything he s doing is wrong the trade war is wrong the massive deficits are wrong beating up on the fed when it s trying to go in the right direction is wrong he added that the combined effect would be that when the recession finally comes and it will come in the next year or two years the deficit is going to soar to 2 trillion a year as revenue collapses like it always does and as there are considerable tailwinds coming at the economy both domestically and overseas stockman argued that we re going to go into the 2020s with a massive retirement wave from the baby boom a deficit that is beyond belief in size and a national debt that s out of control it will be a nonstop crisis for the entire decade unless we do something big and quick and i think it s too late aarthi is a writer for yahoo finance follow her on twitter aarthiswami read more follow yahoo finance on

zealand dollar exchange rate trade deal draws closer president donald trump is not sure about a broad memorandum of understanding with the chinese on trade tariffs however a trade deal is what he wants and we could see such an agreement within a matter of weeks no matter which way you look at it a settlement and agreement by the chinese and americans to reduce tariffs and sign up to a trade deal is very positive news for commodity growth currencies like the nzd and aud our currencies weakened sharply in august to november last year when the us and china were trading insults with each other and both increasing import tariffs the opposite currency impact has to be expected when the tariffs are reversed watch for the kiwi dollar to break up through the 0 6950 resistance level when the donald is finally able to announce a victory for himself on the trade deal nzd aud cross rate stalling at 0 9600 yet again one limiting influence on further nz dollar appreciation over coming weeks will be speculators in the nzd aud cross rate unwinding their long kiwi short aussie positions the punters will be selling kiwi dollars to take their profits on the move up from 0 9000 to 0 9600 over the last four or five months the consistent trading pattern of the nzd aud exchange rate over the last five years has been that it never stays too long above 0 9600 when it spikes up to that level fx market speculative positioning does play an important part in short term exchange rate direction and thus a return to 0 9300 looks more likely over coming months aud importers should be hedged to the hilt of policy limits at 0 9600 whilst aud exporters who previously loaded up with hedging at 0 9000 0 9100 can continue to hold off and use up the hedging they have email roger j kerr is executive chairman of barrington treasury services nz limited he has written commentaries on the nz dollar since 1981
consistency has never been one of us president donald trump s great attributes and with such a wild card in the white house it seems almost inconceivable that the future of the global economy and along with it your livelihood could well be determined within the next few weeks as foreshadowed mr trump has delayed his self imposed friday deadline to significantly scale up his fight with beijing by raising tariffs on a range of chinese imports from their current 10 per cent to 25 per cent with talks proceeding and donald trump saying there has been substantial progress in discussions the us president now will meet with his chinese counterpart xi jinping at his florida estate to personally hammer out a deal previous truces including one last november have done little to salve the growing list of casualties from the conflict a dispute that threatens to extend from trade and economic philosophy to a more fundamental power play the truces agreed between mr trump and mr xi have still hurt their respective economies reuters kevin lamarque the global economy recovery no more since christmas the global economy has taken a decided turn for the worse as the world s two largest economies have dug in on their positions there is no doubt mr trump has hurt china already saddled with extraordinary levels of debt the chinese economy is slowing markedly which could well have social repercussions something beijing desperately wants to avoid but america too is feeling the pinch consumer sentiment is at rock bottom manufacturing is going backwards corporate earnings in the most recent quarter were unexpectedly lower and december s retail sales number was a shocker the collateral damage has extended to south korea where data last week showed exports particularly for electronics and semi conductors had plummeted meanwhile in europe germany barely has avoided slipping into recession and uk industrial production has slumped rarely has the need for an urgent resolution been so acute and yet rarely has there been such little concern despite the looming deadline global investors have blithely piled back into stocks wall street took another bold leap forward friday night it s now up more than 18 per cent since december s dark clouds stripped trillions of dollars from markets across the globe as panicked investors headed for safety why because the set is in as much as mr trump rails against china for rigging markets especially the currency market he has successfully cajoled the us central bank to again position itself to rig stock and currency markets since the financial crisis a decade ago and even prior to that the us federal reserve has manipulated the value of the us dollar deliberately devaluing the greenback wall street traders seem to be the only ones benefitting from the trade showdown reuters brendan mcdermid it s simple really create an extra us3 5 trillion 4 9 trillion out of thin air pump it into the us economy and just like any commodity watch the value decline suddenly your exports are much cheaper your economy much more competitive a great deal of that cash found its way to wall street which helps explain the extraordinary gains for us stocks since the great recession but with the fed now abandoning its rate rise program the bet is that should things again turn really ugly the central bank will lurch into reverse and reopen the cash spigot pushing stocks and bonds higher that s right the worse things are the greater the cheer from investors celebrating the end of the rate hike cycle and perhaps even new stimulus a bet on bad news trump s trade troika mr trump is being torn by three factions within his administration over how to play the china trade negotiations while it has been criticised for throwing away decades of convention and trampling over the previous rules based system via the world trade organisation the trump administration correctly identified legitimate concerns about china s treatment of us corporations for years the chinese government has pressured us companies to hand over technology to chinese partners handed out massive subsidies to state owned firms and turned a blind eye intellectual property theft all ignored by previous administrations but the boisterous and bellicose approach to the problem along with a similar stance on defence and particularly the response to china s power plays in the pacific have the potential to inflict grave harm a mercurial character and one easily persuaded by the most recent argument it s difficult to know which way he will bend there are those within his orbit such as treasury secretary steve mnuchin who simply want the us to strike a deal with china to sell more product like soybeans and help alter the trade imbalance another faction led by us trade representative robert lighthizer is pushing for a tough approach including greater tariffs to force a confrontation with beijing that would address the main concerns over subsidies technology transfers and intellectual property theft a third faction led by presidential advisor peter navarro want the us to break ties with china completely while mr lighthizer has held sway until now that appears to be shifting anxious to strike a deal of any kind and spooked by the stock market meltdown late last year mr trump is looking for a win according to a report in the wall street journal over the weekend he does after all face an election next year what it all means for us australia relies heavily on chinese tourists and students abc midwest and wheatbelt laura meachim ructions on financial markets aside we will be deeply affected by the deteriorating diplomatic and trade affairs between our biggest ally and our major trading partner if recent events are a yardstick it s unlikely any deal struck within the next month will be permanent australia has an unhealthy dependence upon china almost 38 per cent of our total exports land there last week australian coal reportedly was banned by dalian port authorities in what would appear to be retaliation for statements in parliament that alluded to cyber attacks emanating from china it s not just raw materials in the firing line almost 1 3 million chinese tourists spent 11 5 billion here last year now under threat by a cooling chinese economy similarly our universities have bent over backwards to take advantage of the demand for higher education from china s growing middle class current estimates from austrade are that chinese students account for around 30 per cent of all attendees at australian higher education facilities that s around 250 000 students if mr trump can t engineer a long term agreement with beijing it could result either in a dramatic slowdown in china s economy or a diplomatic freeze from beijing either way things could get ugly

ancillary business that depends on providing services to the residents of the properties leased by the affiliated operating company sabra s tenant for a meaningful part of the ancillary business s profitability and has below market ebitdar coverage cash net operating income cash noi the company believes that net income attributable to common stockholders as defined by gaap is the most appropriate earnings measure the company considers cash noi an important supplemental measure because it allows investors analysts and its management to evaluate the operating performance of its

debt the principal balances of the company s revolving credit facility term loans senior unsecured notes and secured indebtedness as reported in the company s consolidated financial statements consolidated enterprise value the company believes consolidated enterprise value is an important measurement as it is a measure of a company s value the company calculates consolidated enterprise value as market equity capitalization plus consolidated debt market equity capitalization is calculated as i the number of shares of common stock multiplied by the closing price of the company s common stock on the last day of the period presented plus ii the number of shares of preferred stock multiplied by the closing price of the company s preferred stock on the last day of the period presented consolidated enterprise value includes the company s market equity capitalization and consolidated debt less cash and cash equivalents ebitdar earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and rent ebitdar for a particular facility accruing to the operator tenant of the property not the company for the period presented ebitdar includes an imputed management fee of 5 0 of revenues for skilled nursing transitional care facilities and senior housing leased communities and an imputed management fee of 2 5 of revenues for specialty hospitals and other facilities the company uses ebitdar in determining ebitdar coverage ebitdar has limitations as an analytical tool ebitdar does not reflect historical cash expenditures or future cash requirements for facility capital expenditures or contractual commitments in addition ebitdar does not represent a property s net income or cash flow from operations and should not be considered an alternative to those indicators the company utilizes ebitdar as a supplemental measure of the ability of the company s operators tenants and relevant guarantors to generate sufficient liquidity to meet related obligations to the company ebitdar coverage represents the ratio of ebitdar to cash rent for owned facilities excluding senior housing managed communities for the period presented ebitdar coverage is a supplemental measure of a property s ability to generate cash flows for the operator tenant not the company to meet the operator s tenant s related cash rent and other obligations to the company however its usefulness is limited by among other things the same factors that limit the usefulness of ebitdar ebitdar coverage includes only stabilized facilities and excludes significant tenants with meaningful credit enhancement through guarantees which include genesis holiday and two legacy ccp tenants one ancillary supported tenant and facilities for which data is not available or meaningful ebitdarm earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization rent and management fees ebitdarm for a particular facility accruing to the operator tenant of the property not the company for the period presented the company uses ebitdarm in determining ebitdarm coverage the usefulness of ebitdarm is limited by the same factors that limit the usefulness of ebitdar together with ebitdar the company utilizes ebitdarm to evaluate the core operations of the properties by eliminating management fees which vary based on operator tenant and its operating structure ebitdarm coverage represents the ratio of ebitdarm to cash rent for owned facilities excluding senior housing managed communities for the period presented ebitdarm coverage is a supplemental measure of a property s ability to generate cash flows for the operator tenant not the company to meet the operator s tenant s related cash rent and other obligations to the company however its usefulness is limited by among other things the same factors that limit the usefulness of ebitdarm ebitdarm coverage includes only stabilized facilities and excludes significant tenants with meaningful credit enhancement through

divided by the same period cash rent expense interest expense and mandatory principal payments for operations of any entity that guarantees the tenants lease obligation to the company fixed charge coverage is a supplemental measure of a guarantor s ability to meet the operator tenant s cash rent and other obligations to the company should the operator tenant be unable to do so itself however its usefulness is limited by among other things the same factors that limit the usefulness of ebitdar fixed charge coverage is calculated by the company as described above based on information provided by guarantors without independent verification by the company and may differ from similar metrics calculated by the guarantors funds from operations attributable to common stockholders ffo and adjusted funds from operations attributable to common stockholders affo the company believes that net income attributable to common stockholders as defined by gaap is the most appropriate earnings measure the company also believes that funds from operations attributable to common stockholders or ffo as defined in accordance with the definition used by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit and adjusted funds from operations attributable to common stockholders or affo and related per share amounts are important non gaap supplemental measures of the company s operating performance because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight line depreciation except on land such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time however since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions presentations of operating results for a real estate investment trust that uses historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative thus nareit created ffo as a supplemental measure of operating performance for real estate investment trusts that excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization among other items from net income attributable to common stockholders as defined by gaap ffo is defined as net income attributable to common stockholders computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from real estate dispositions plus real estate depreciation and amortization net of amounts related to noncontrolling interests plus the company s share of depreciation and amortization related to our unconsolidated joint venture and real estate impairment charges affo is defined as ffo excluding merger and acquisition costs stock based compensation expense straight line rental income adjustments amortization of above and below market lease intangibles non cash interest income adjustments non cash interest expense change in fair value of contingent consideration non cash portion of loss on extinguishment of debt provision for doubtful straight line rental income loan losses and other reserves and deferred income taxes as well as other non cash revenue and expense items including ineffectiveness gain loss on derivative instruments and non cash revenue and expense amounts related to noncontrolling interests and our share of non cash adjustments related to our unconsolidated joint venture the company believes that the use of ffo and affo and the related per share amounts combined with the required gaap presentations improves the understanding of the company s operating results among investors and makes comparisons of operating results among real estate investment trusts more meaningful the company considers ffo and affo to be useful measures for reviewing comparative operating and financial performance because by excluding the applicable items listed above ffo and affo can help investors compare the operating performance of the company between periods or as compared to other companies while ffo and affo are relevant and widely used measures of operating performance of real estate investment trusts they do not represent cash flows from operations or net income attributable to common stockholders as defined by gaap and should not be considered an alternative to those measures in evaluating the company s liquidity or operating performance ffo and affo also do not consider the costs associated with capital expenditures related to the company s real estate assets nor do they purport to be indicative of cash available to fund the company s future cash requirements further the company s computation of ffo and affo may not be comparable to ffo and affo reported by other real estate investment trusts that do not define ffo in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition or

i have heard that every good walk in ireland ends in a pub i followed that recommendation a couple of sundays ago in limerick when i crossed the river shannon and traversed what has become a vibrant city center a squall arose as i made my way over to st mary s and king john s castle they say that ireland would be a perfect country if it just had a roof over it the warmth of the curragower was a welcome conclusion to the trek as i was strolling another irish walk was on my mind one captured on video by actor stephen rea rea s sojourn skirted the border between northern ireland which is part of the united kingdom and the republic of ireland the two sides are currently part of the european union but brexit threatens to separate them the two share substantial commercial ties that are now in jeopardy as well as a difficult history no one wants to relive as negotiators from london and brussels continue to struggle in their search for a separation agreement countries like ireland are caught in the middle as a result one of the world s more interesting economic success stories may be at risk the republic of ireland has achieved strong results by defying prevailing economic patterns it is a country with low corporate taxes and a balanced budget it is an exceptionally open economy at a time when many other countries are looking inward it has favorable demographics and has good relations with both the east and the west ireland is also distinguished by its reaction to crisis the country entered 2008 as the celtic tiger having enjoyed a robust run rivaled only by emerging asian nations the crash hit ireland particularly hard a difficult recession set in and several leading financial institutions had to be nationalized in 2010 the international monetary fund and european authorities arranged a bailout of 85 billion for the country other bailouts from that era remain problematic but instead of allowing its problems to fester ireland chose to address them head on by the spring of 2013 the irish treasury had successfully issued debt on the market and by year s end the international support program was officially concluded today irish government bonds carry yields well below the eurozone average the european commission s latest forecast projects real growth of 4 5 for ireland in 2019 the second highest rate in the eurozone only malta which is 26 times smaller than ireland is projected to do better a year ago the united states passed a sweeping tax reform bill lowering the income tax paid by corporations to 21 and offering inducements for u s firms to repatriate profits earned overseas the measure increased competition with ireland s advantageous tax rates but has not diminished the country s momentum ireland s corporate tax rate of 13 is still lower and american companies have brought home only about 20 of profits that had been stranded overseas it takes more than just a low tax rate to secure economic mass it requires strong talent modern infrastructure a strategic location and a pro business environment ireland continues to offer all of these and its resident companies seem intent on deepening their investments in the country brexit has provided a boost to that momentum as global firms seek to ensure they can continue to serve their european clients fluidly no matter the outcome of negotiations some financial firms in particular have moved operations from london to ireland for this purpose as europe s financial landscape shifts ireland s potential position as one of only two countries in the european union with english as an official language is a decided advantage but as well as it has worked ireland s economic strategy presents certain risks in the current environment trade has become a four letter word in some circles and international cooperation is under stress the success of the irish economy depends critically on both of these things the biggest risk to irish prosperity is the border since the good friday agreement ended the sectarian conflict between irish catholics and protestants 21 years ago peace has reigned and business has boomed every day 30 000 people cross the border for work or leisure every year about 5 billion of goods move across it those sums would be at risk if northern ireland were no longer part of the european customs union and the return of checkpoints along the border would be reminiscent of less pleasant times it seems fairly clear that most britons who voted to leave the european union had little comprehension of the trouble it would create for the irish those politicians who supported the effort glossed over the complications suggesting any disruption could be minimized boris johnson the former foreign secretary and a brexit supporter called the border issue a gnat with only a few weeks left before the uk s scheduled departure date of march 29 negotiators from westminster and the eu would do well to dispense with that kind of useless rhetoric and get serious about reaching a productive agreement while those i spoke with in ireland remain confident of a positive outcome they were justifiably frustrated that important issues were minimized for political gain perhaps the negotiators should go for a long walk along the wicklow way pausing to observe the lake bordering the guinness estate topped with white sand to look like a pint of the brown nectar they could then adjourn to a pub and indulge in the irish art of productive conversation brexit would be solved in short order and the delegates wouldn t have to go far to toast their success fragmented landscape last friday spanish prime minister pedro sánchez called an early general election for april 28 after his government s 2019 budget was voted down it will be spain s third election in four years the budget defeat came on the heels of the government s refusal to discuss another independence referendum for catalonia leading to a loss of vital support until a new government can be formed last year s budget will simply be rolled over the socialist government has been on thin ice relying on support from catalan separatists and the anti establishment party podemos the new elections will likely return a fragmented parliament with the socialists in the lead followed by the conservative people s party the current political landscape isn t unique to spain it reflects a broader trend across europe where divisive forces are steadily gaining ground this makes consensus within and across countries difficult to achieve european equity markets and spanish bond markets have been largely unaffected by recent developments but the situation could soon change as indicated by the sudden emergence of vox a far right party in opinion polls vox s popularity has been fueled by resentment of political scandals the deep economic contraction and the growing demand for a strong nationalist response to catalonia s demands for independence the ascendance of this faction has heightened concerns that europe s fourth largest economy will fall victim to the already elevated euro skeptic sentiment this will also have implications for the european parliamentary elections in may as vox is likely to appoint its first representatives to the body political fragmentation which has taken a toll on italy s economy hasn t yet weighed on growth in spain the spanish economy has done reasonably well after years of austerity under the previous regime in fact owing to robust private and public spending spain has been has been quite resistant to the broader slowdown in economic activity across european economies spanish unemployment while still elevated is about half of what it was five years ago in the years since the european sovereign and banking crisis spain has also made significant progress in correcting its macro imbalances structural reforms have advanced growth and export oriented measures that have helped spain regain its regional competitiveness spain s current account balance has moved from a large deficit of 9 3 of gross domestic product gdp in 2008 to a surplus of 1 8 of gdp in 2017 government balances have also witnessed a turnaround with the deficit improving from 10 5 of gdp in 2012 to 3 1 of gdp in 2017 public sector debt appears to have stabilized while the private sector has gone through significant deleveraging the health of the banking sector has also improved all of this should augur well for the spanish budget but lingering unemployment will keep benefits expenditures elevated consumption will be supported by an extraordinary 22 hike in the minimum wage and a large public sector hiring program sánchez recently unveiled persistent uncertainties won t necessarily have a material impact on spanish growth which has coped well with volatile politics in the past but the magnitude of external threats like brexit and internal dissonance could escalate significantly in the coming weeks the tourism sector which accounts for a sizeable 15 of gross domestic product would likely suffer the most hopefully cooler heads will prevail as the election approaches allowing spain to remain on its recent course of improvement but ever increasing political fragmentation in europe is threatening spain at a delicate time not a trend yet in the aftermath of the u s government shutdown statistical agencies are working hard to return to the normal schedule of data releases recent publications have contained mixed news including a retail sales reading showing a notable decline in the month of december and an industrial production measure indicating an improbable slowdown the disappointing announcements caught many observers by surprise other readings on the economy from proprietary indices to individual retailers operating results have suggested consumer spending ended 2018 with a flourish the severe weather that can impair spending did not start until january unemployment remains low and wage growth is outpacing inflation suggesting an empowered consumer these are not circumstances that should have led to a spending retreat a few drivers may have worked together to complicate the retail results thanksgiving fell early in 2018 allowing shoppers more time in november to complete their holiday shopping lower energy prices led to lower receipts at gasoline stations and while e commerce results are included in the census bureau s panel of approximately 5 500 employers the growing concentration of online retailers may make estimation more difficult meanwhile the fall in industrial production was led by a decline in vehicle production that followed several months of high output from automobile plants the decline observed in the most recent reading may have been less of a contraction than a return to the mean despite a significant decline month over month retail sales have increased on a year over year basis since november 2009 the current level of 2 3 annual growth is still above rates observed as recently as 2016 and this was not the first monthly decline observed in the current growth cycle like most metrics any reading can be volatile but the overall trend for retail sales remains solid the drops in retail sales and industrial production will weigh significantly on the estimate for fourth quarter gross domestic product growth due on february 28 gdp calculations are an amalgam of inputs reflecting economic activity and given the importance of consumer spending to the u s economy slow retail sales lead directly to slow overall growth all measures will be revised at least once more in march we expect 2019 to be a year of transition to a slower rate of growth and a slowdown may lead to some confusing readings although a reading may appear alarming a single data point does not always start a trend

core inflation has been below 2 for almost all the time since the gfc although it is currently close to target under an average inflation targeting framework the fed would target a period of higher inflation to compensate for the earlier undershoot while no decisions have been made the discussion around average inflation targeting suggests the hurdle for the fed resuming rate hikes is high us 10

in recent times fascist movements have emerged around the world they have mobilized thousands of people around racist reactionary ideas and in some cases have directly won political power the most recent fascist victory was in brazil where jair bolsonaro won the presidential election besides brazil fascist politics have taken hold in the united states britain hungary poland and other parts of europe to make sense of contemporary fascism new literature on the subject has proliferated including john bellamy foster s trump in the white house michael joseph roberto s the coming of the american behemoth and enzo traverso s new faces of fascism 1 old books on fascism such as nicos poulantzas fascism and dictatorship are also being republished and studied although all these works should be read paul sweezy s theory of fascism in the theory of capitalist development remains the best place to begin a study of fascism in clear and accessible language sweezy s analysis explains what fascism is how it comes to power and its class dynamics sweezy wrote the theory of capitalist development in 1943 when fascism was in power in germany and italy the book was designed to explain the basic principles of marxism in accessible language while retaining its theoretical complexity sweezy was in the united states when he wrote it and its audience was primarily those who had participated in popular front organizations against fascism this was a mass movement led by communists to defend democratic institutions and prevent fascism from coming to power sweezy s account shares some of the same principles put forward by georgi dimitrov and r palme dutt two major marxist theorists on fascism at the same time sweezy developed his own unique theory of fascism which connects the emergence of fascism to the development of monopoly capitalism and imperialism to demonstrate how sweezy builds on existing theories of fascism while further elaborating them i will begin by briefly discussing the main marxist theories of fascism that existed at the time georgi dimitrov on fascism one of the primary theorists of fascism in the thirties was georgi dimitrov a bulgarian communist who served as secretary of the world committee against war and fascism while he was in berlin in 1933 he was arrested by the nazis who falsely claimed he had helped set the reichstag on fire dimitrov had assigned counsel present at the trial but insisted that he would be his own counsel which german procedure permitted at that time he was acquitted of the false charges the fascists brought against him at the seventh world congress of the communist international dimitrov gave a speech about the rise of fascism and how the working class can fight it this speech is important because it contains not just the comintern s main theoretical positions on fascism but also important self criticism on its previous positions in this speech dimitrov defines fascism as as the open terrorist dictatorship of the most reactionary most chauvinistic and most imperialist elements of finance capital 2 fascism is identified by dimitrov as having its ideological origins in the middle class that is the petty bourgeoisie but only becomes dominant by receiving political support from the capitalist class according to dimitrov a defining feature of fascism is its large mass base which actively carries out the reactionary policies of a fascist government and consolidates its power this mass base is composed primarily of the middle class petty bourgeoisie which includes small shop owners peasants small time merchants and some professionals during an economic crisis the middle class is most devastated often going bankrupt and joining the ranks of the working class according to dimitrov the middle class are the ideological representatives of fascism in its early stage blaming the economic crisis on national minorities trade unionists and communists lacking the class solidarity of the working class the middle class develops fierce nationalism and racist views demanding a strong state to resolve the contradictions of capitalism fascism only becomes a real danger in society when the capitalist class actively supports it and provides it with financial assistance because fascism generally creates political instability the capitalist class will only resort to it during an economic and political crisis dimitrov identifies three major reasons why the capitalist class would support fascism and bring it to power first there must be a strong working class movement which significantly challenges the rule of capital over labor in the thirties the communist party of germany was a major political force winning millions of votes and having tremendous influence in german trade unions to counteract the influence of communists the capitalist class will support fascists and help make fascism a hegemonic political trend second dimitrov points out that there must be a serious economic crisis which makes the continued existence of capitalism itself unlikely although fascism has never eliminated the contradictions of capitalism the bourgeoisie perceives a strong fascist state as a temporary solution to an economic crisis third dimitrov demonstrates that fascism will generally only receive support from the bourgeoisie when there is a political crisis such a crisis involves the inability of the capitalist class to come to any agreement making democracy itself insufficient for the bourgeoisie to rule for dimitrov fascism does not arise overnight with the election of a fascist politician rather fascism comes to power in stages beginning with attacks on the democratic rights of working people the imprisonment of communists and trade unionists hostility to national minorities and immigrants and the gradual erosion of democratic institutions it relies on its mass supporters mostly from the middle class but also including workers and intellectuals to carry out these policies once fascism has consolidated power it begins to build up the fascist state and engages in expansionary imperialist wars the terrorist dictatorship of finance capital is only fully established when all opposition has been outlawed and a fascist state machinery has been completely developed 3 dimitrov points out that although a fascist like hitler or mussolini might get elected their success is not inevitable in his speech he calls upon trade unions communists and social democrats to work together to fight every attack on the popular masses he points out that when fascism receives the support of the bourgeoisie the progressive forces must defend the basic institutions of bourgeois democracy to prevent fascism from destroying them this was the theory of the popular front a government of progressive forces that build a mass anti fascist movement sweezy on fascism dimitrov s ideas about fascism were held by most communists during sweezy s time the main weakness of dimitrov s theory is that most of his writings are in what louis althusser calls a practical state but lack theoretical elaboration this is not dimitrov s fault but is the result of pressure to produce theory for the practical struggle against fascism in his theory of capitalist development sweezy builds on dimitrov s theories but gives them a more theoretically precise form he makes an important contribution to the theory of fascism and incorporates it into the larger horizon of marxian economics sweezy adds a layer of historical analysis to the comintern s theory of fascism he does this by defining it as the product of imperialism which can only develop in the era of monopoly capitalism following in vladimir lenin s footsteps sweezy views militarism and wars of redistribution as an integral part of imperialism in the era of monopoly capitalism the capitalist class must find a profitable outlet for their surplus capital this capital generally does not yield a high rate of profit in the imperialist metropolises as the workers have a higher level of trade union organization and higher wages the solution to this problem is to export capital to the colonies where the cost of land and labor is cheap and the rate of profit is high this generally results in wars of redivision in which imperialists struggle to conquer as many colonies as possible in order to secure an outlet for investment in their later monopoly capital sweezy and paul baran research and discuss the specific dynamics of imperialism coming to the conclusion that it cannot resolve the contradictions of capitalism sweezy s analysis of fascism articulates the emergence of fascism within the context of imperialism and war after an imperialist war some countries are economically politically and morally devastated there are extreme food shortages housing crises high levels of unemployment divisions in the military and serious political crises of the bourgeoisies furthermore the defeated countries lose a significant amount of their colonial holdings and are thereby weakened internationally in russia there was a strong revolutionary movement and a socialist revolution that addressed these contradictions when these objective conditions do not result in a socialist revolution sweezy argues that a fascist movement will emerge to address the contradictions of capitalism instead of a new socialist state some post war countries in europe developed a transitional state form that appeared ultra democratic with high levels of worker participation sweezy points out that these transitional states create a temporary class equilibrium in which neither the working class nor the bourgeoisie play a dominant role although there is a strong workers movement that challenges the bourgeoisie the working class does not hold state power the trade unions and workers parties are able to advance significant progressive legislation such as expanded welfare food subsidies and some forms of social housing the same officials however continue to occupy the major departments of the capitalist state as before and there is no qualitative change in its functioning such a transitional state existed in germany france and the united kingdom after the first world war during this time many social democrats and communists thought that such a transitional state was a necessary stage preceding the seizure of power by the working class sweezy argues that this was a mistake as these transitional states actually contained a heightened level of class struggle that was hidden underneath the surface the apparent class equilibrium was just the form taken by class contradictions and disequilibrium operative in the postwar conjuncture sweezy points out that the gains won by the greatly strengthened trade unions and the enactment of social legislation under working class pressure put burdens on capitalist production which it is ill prepared and even less willing to bear 4 in the immediate postwar situation there was temporary employment insofar as it involved massive investments in the production of the means of production workers everywhere were employed to rebuild the factories machinery and housing that were destroyed during the war creating an outlet to absorb the economic surplus however sweezy observes that once the reconstruction was achieved the absorption of the surplus through the sale of consumption goods became a necessity there was increased inflation and neither the middle class nor the proletariat could afford high levels of consumption the countries that came out of the imperialist war with more colonies such as france and the united kingdom could simply send capital abroad and find outlets for productive investment however in countries that lost the war such as germany there was a weakened military no colonies for capital export and no immediate solution in the domestic market to resolve this problem the capitalist state tried to fund consumption through taxing the middle class the small shop owners and businesses independent farmers and merchants as postwar impoverishment prevented the middle class from saving their income they felt attacked by these measures sweezy demonstrates that the middle class in the defeated countries felt alienated from the state they were neither represented by the trade unions nor were the bourgeois parties able to address their grievances furthermore the inability to absorb the economic surplus resulted in inflation and high levels of unemployment a few years after the war whereas the working class could use their trade unions to make demands on the state the middle class lacked class representation hence sweezy observes that it is precisely these groups which are most disastrously affected during the period of class equilibrium 5 in a similar way to dimitrov dutt and togliatti sweezy argues that fascist ideology arises in the middle classes that have been devastated by an unsuccessful imperialist war ideologically they lack the class solidarity of the working class and tend to identify with notions of racial superiority and a strong nation they are extremely hostile to finance capital the organized working class and national minorities which they blame for their economic devastation the middle class imagines that the contradictions of capitalism can be resolved by a strong nationalist state they use violence fueled by racism and nationalism to attack communists social democrats and trade union leaders although fascism ideologically arises in the middle class sweezy points out that they are able to win over unorganized workers many of whom are unemployed do not have contact with the trade unions and lack political education the fascists use anticapitalist language combined with racism and nationalism to explain why the unorganized and unemployed workers are impoverished they also win over young people who have few opportunities in the crisis ridden postwar situation as well as criminal elements who later form the paramilitary wing of fascist organizations sweezy views fascism as a mass movement led by the middle class that receives support from some workers students and sectors of the lumpen proletariat sweezy and dimitrov share the view that fascism becomes a serious danger when the capitalist class embraces it politically what makes sweezy unique is that he relates the capitalist response to fascism to the transitional period of apparent class equilibrium he points out that in the defeated countries the capitalist class is unable to fully respond to the demands of the workers nor is it able to start a new imperialist war at the same time workers constantly make democratic demands and the capitalists are themselves encircled by hostile imperialist countries the bourgeoisie is reserved and reluctant to support fascism mainly because of its attacks on finance capital however seeing that fascism is extremely hostile to communists and trade unions the bourgeoisie provides it with financial subsidies supporting fascist politicians in the elections and encouraging the growth of the fascist movement sweezy says that once the fascists are in power the bourgeoisie sets out with ruthless energy to destroy the class equilibrium which underlies the indecision and paralysis of the people s republic 6 it relies on its mass base to carry out its policies such as murdering communists arresting trade union leaders and criminalizing workers organizations according to sweezy once a fascist state is thoroughly established and its mass base consolidated the imperialists use their strengthened position to wage new imperialist wars of redivision although a fascist state might restore the class power of the bourgeoisie sweezy argues that it cannot resolve the contradictions of capitalism capitalism can only be abolished through a socialist revolution such as the ones that happened in russia cuba and china sweezy s theory of fascism today both sweezy and dimitrov agree that fascism arises in the middle class and becomes a threat when the bourgeoisie embraces it but sweezy s unique contribution is to demonstrate fascism s relationship to the postwar transitional period of class equilibrium this is a precise historical moment characterized by complex class dynamics and structural contradictions specific to monopoly capital a major question that arises is does sweezy s analysis of fascism apply only to fascism in germany italy and spain or can it be used to make sense of fascism today i will answer in the affirmative and briefly turn to samir amin to demonstrate how in his the law of worldwide value amin points out that the principal contradiction in today s capitalism is the one that counterposes the peoples of the periphery the proletariat and the exploited peasantry to imperialist capital 7 the way this contradiction operates is through the emergence of fascist movements that are assisted by u s imperialism in the developing world particularly in latin america in recent months we have seen the election of bolsonaro in brazil perhaps the most openly fascist politician to take power in contemporary times in other parts of latin america such as chile venezuela and argentina there has been a rise of fascist movements and paramilitary organizations which have received assistance from the united states in these countries a similar situation of apparent class equilibrium existed over an extended period of time articulating similar class dynamics as those described by sweezy here i would like to use brazil to briefly demonstrate how these dynamics structure political situations around the world in brazil the workers party pt held power for over thirteen years and made considerable improvements in the lives of working people as alfredo saad filho shows in brazil neoliberalism versus democracy luiz inácio lula da silva s lula ascension to power was largely due to the economic devastation caused by twenty years of neoliberalism following the end of military rule 8 while he was president lula created many new institutions in brazilian society that reduced poverty improved literacy increased employment and strengthened the position of the trade unions although not entirely anti imperialist lula helped reduce imperialist domination of the brazilian economy and helped build many brics institutions saad filho discusses the class dynamics operative in brazil during pt rule and they are very similar to those described by sweezy first the communist party of brazil pcdob cogoverned brazilian society and occupied many important functions in the state the trade unions which make up the bulk of pt support exercised considerable power in brazilian society at the same time some large brazilian companies such as petrobras and odebrecht received support from the state which created some self sufficiency for the brazilian domestic bourgeoisie in order to retain its support from the brazilian domestic bourgeoisie neither lula nor his successor dilma rousseff challenged the neoliberal institutions created by previous administrations in this situation the brazilian middle class often was excluded from the state government ministries and did not always benefit from lula s policies saad filho points out that the pt did not abolish the contradictions of capitalism from brazilian society which were rather intensified while lula was in power in brazil only the domestic bourgeoisie represented by brazilian companies such as petrobras were united with the pt the other sector of the capitalist class the comprador bourgeoisie aligned itself with imperialism and constantly conspired against lula and the pt the comprador bourgeoisie used its control over the media to create scandals about corruption which began in 2005 and resulted in the impeachment of rousseff in 2015 16 the comprador bourgeoisie sought alignment with the middle class and blamed the pt trade unions and other progressive forces for all the problems of brazilian society 9 it was this unstable class equilibrium that spurred the fascist movement in brazil and helped bolsonaro get elected in his first month in power bolsonaro has set out to destroy this class equilibrium by destroying institutions created by the pt attacking indigenous people and reestablishing the class domination of the comprador bourgeoisie just as with any fascist movement he is relying on his mass base to use violence and terror to enforce his policies although bolsonaro is not waging a direct war of redivision it is engaging in expansionary practices such as eliminating environmental protection and cutting down trees in the amazon he has also aligned himself with the united states in supporting a coup in venezuela against the democratically elected president nicolás maduro conclusion although the historical context today is very different from when sweezy wrote the theory of capitalist development the core of his theory of fascism is still relevant his theory of class equilibrium was formulated in the aftermath of an imperialist war but this does not mean such a structure only exists in a postwar situation in the case of brazil it existed during the period when lula was president and it was the result of economic devastation created by imperialist and neoliberal policies such an unstable class equilibrium may create improved material conditions but unless it is fully resolved by the working class a very dangerous political situation follows in brazil the pt did not succeed in going beyond social democracy and left the basic institutions of neoliberalism intact as a result the comprador bourgeoisie aligned with imperialism was able to take advantage of the contradictions and successfully pushed a fascist to power if one combines sweezy s analysis of fascism with his later work in monopoly capital there is great theoretical potential to deepen our knowledge of fascist movements today 10 it is important to study sweezy s work in today s turbulent times times in which fascists

news national by staff reporter the reserve bank of zimbabwe rbz will continue to help pension companies preserve the value of their funds in united states dollars the bank s governor dr john mangudya said on friday as at june 30 last year the pension industry had six life offices insuring 860 pension funds there have been growing concerns that pension savings would be eroded after central bank liberalised the exchange rate by introducing the inter bank market last week it is believed that removing the 1 1 peg of the us dollar to bond notes and rtgs would devalue some assets but the rbz has since moved in to ring fence pension values we have assisted some of the pension firms in this country to purchase what we call deposit receipts in foreign currency so as to preserve the value for their funds for the pensioners and that is at our expense not their expense said dr mangudya at a breakfast meeting on friday the issue of maintaining the value of pension funds is particularly relevant especially after concerns were raised on how pension companies converted pension benefits from the zimbabwe dollar to the united states dollar following the dollarisation of the economy in early 2009 numerous pensioners found their contributions eroded overnight as pension companies claimed that savings had been wiped out by hyperinflation in his contribution at friday s meeting economist dr gift mugano noted that floating the us dollar would have adverse effects on savings it is undeniable that the floating of the exchange rate will result in erosion of savings and pensions of the ordinary zimbabweans consider one who deposited 100 000 us dollars eight years ago and now bring in the hypothetical liberalised exchange of 1 4 into account one will see that the real value of the 100 000 today is now us 25 000 the same observation applies to pensioners this was again one of my reservations on floating this experience where economic agents have lost their pension twice in a 10 year period will discourage savings which are key for driving investment and economic growth said dr mugano while pensioners are being paid pittances pension companies seem to be in good health according to an insurance and pensions commission ipec second quarter report for last year the pension industry had an asset base of 4 4 billion as at 30 june 2018 reflecting a 5 3 percent increase from the 4 2 billion reported as at 31 march 2018 the growth in the asset base was mainly a result of an increase in the value of quoted equities from 1 4 billion as at 31 march 20 18 to 1 6 billion as at 30 june 2018 noted ipec the total assets translated to an industry average capital accumulation per member of 7 487 as at 30 june 2018 the average capital accumulation per member was 5 7 percent higher than the 7 081 per member reported as at 31 march 2018 the increase in the average capital accumulation was mainly due to the aforementioned increase in total assets meanwhile ipec is soon expected to announce a compensation framework to policyholders whose claims were eroded during the conversion of values from zimbabwe dollar to the us dollars during the february 2009 period this is after a commission of inquiry into the conversion process found that pensioners and policy holders suffered a significant loss of value and recommended compensation it also noted that values were not only lost during the conversion period but during the 1996 2014 period the commission s investigations covered the 18 year period to 2014 and looked into the operations of life insurance companies pension fund administrators stand alone pension funds funeral assurance companies the guardians fund government s pension system and the national social security authority

general news of sunday 24 february 2019 source theheraldghana com president akufo addo on thursday delivered his third state of the national address sona to parliament but did not touch on two major issues on the lips of ghanaians the continuous fall of the cedi and the three takoradi girls who were kidnapped by a nigerian with their whereabouts unknown the local currency is not faring well currently against most international currencies it is exchanging at five cedis twenty eight pesewas gh 5 28 to one united states dollar six cedis fifty four pesewas gh 6 54 to the pound sterling and five cedis sixty eight pesewas gh 5 68 to the euro the cost of living has been running high with the prices of goods and services going up by the day indeed many traders including those in okaishie agbogbloshie abossey okai markets and others who rely on these international currencies for trading were disappointed in the failure of the president to mention it and give assurances could be a low point in his address as far as the traders were concerned 15 year old priscilla mantebea koranchie and 18 year old ruth love quayson went missing in december last year whilst 21 year old priscilla blessing bentum went missing as far back as august last year but both the western regional police and the takoradi divisional police have not made any significant inroad into those behind the kidnapping aside the arrest of 28 year old samuel udoetuk wills the suspected kidnapper interestingly despite the national uproar president akufo addo has not spoken about the incident and offer hope to the girls families on what the security agencies were doing in tracing and rescuing the three girls and arresting those behind the kidnapping and his failure to mention it at the sona could be disappointing to their relatives who been holding vigils and press engagements to have their girls back on other issues the president said tax exemption policy has proving to be an achilles heel and a growing menace to fiscal stability and revenue generation in the country revenue mobilization poses the biggest challenge in the management of our economy with the tax exemption policy in particular proving to be an achilles heel and a growing menace to fiscal and revenue generation according to the president in the last eight years tax exemptions in respect of import duty import vat import nhil and domestic vat have grown from gh 392 million that is 0 6percent of gdp in 2010 to gh 4 66 billion that is 1 6percent of gdp in 2018 these figures do not include exemptions from the payment of corporate and individual income taxes concessions on tax rates petroleum tax reliefs customs tax exemptions enjoyed by diplomatic missions and waiver of processing charges at the ports if we continue at this rate in less than sixteen years half of ghana s revenue base will be given away as tax exemptions he added we intend to do something about tax exemptions by introducing suitable measures that may disrupt the easy and comfortable arrangements that many have become accustomed to but which we have to take to ensure that we have the firmest of foundations for the economic take off that has escaped us for so long president akufo addo reiterated his government s commitment to maintaining the needed discipline to ensure that ghana does not return to the international monetary fund imf for the 17th time a team from the imf this week completed the 7th and 8th reviews under the extended credit facility program which ghana entered into in 2015 an approval from the imf board in march should lead to ghana exiting the program after april 3rd and delivering his state of the nation address president akufo addo stated that in order not to repeat the cycle of returning to the fund immediately after exiting ghana will have to ensure that systems put in place like the fiscal council which are to ensure discipline in the management of the economy are as effective as possible we ve just concluded the program with the imf and with continued discipline we shall sign off from the deal in april this is the 16th time ghana has had to go to the imf in its history mr speaker we cannot make the progress we all desire unless we are consistent and disciplined in the management of our economy we have gone through another round of painful impositions to get to where we are today with healthy fundamentals the president added that a repeat of actions that led to a return to the imf in the past will not be repeated under his government as we prepare to exit from the imf program we expect the impressive figures and good performance to continue we are very much aware that this is not the first time we have had such good a set of figures but we re determined to do things differently this time around we ve imposed on ourselves fiscal discipline we re paying off legacy debts and deepening good governance practice and business confidence is growing we will maintain the discipline and bring progress to our country sanitation in the country has improved significantly since president akufo addo promised to make accra the cleanest city in 2017 this is the assessment of president akufo addo more than a year after he made the declaration according to him although there is a lot more the government can do to ensure that the target is met it has currently achieved significant results in improving sanitation in the country last year i reiterated before you my pledge of improving sanitation in the country and making accra the cleanest city in africa by the end of my term mr speaker there has been a significant improvement in sanitation even though i acknowledge that more can be done he said the country had increased the capacity of solid waste it manages from 16 to 53 noting that the government in 2018 alone constructed more than 35 000 household toilets to deal with open defecation this is currently the state of play we are witnessing increase of the average of solid waste management to 16 to 53 and over the course of last year 35 862 household toilets were built as oppose to 1 698 in 2016 he said akufo addo expressed displeasure at the incident of open defecation in the country which he said should not be the case in 2019 he said such conduct was undeserving of ghanaians and must be eschewed the president said the government was working to enforce sanitation by laws and deal with persons who flout it in 2018 president akufo addo decried filth which he said had engulfed the country s capital cities he further disclosed that a gh 200 million had been earmarked to address the issue of filth especially in accra urgently we are putting gh 200m into addressing the sanitation challenges that we have i am confident that by the time i come back next year appreciable gains would have been made in improving our sanitation he said president akufo addo also has added his voice to calls by various civil society groups and international agencies for the two major political parties in the country to disband their vigilante groups delivering his 2019 state of the nation address in parliament he said he had instructed the leadership of the new patriotic party npp which he belongs to to extend an invitation to the opposition national democratic congress ndc to discuss how to disband their respective vigilante groups akufo addo said the phenomenon of political vigilantism has the potential of destabilizing the country and reversing the democratic gains the country has made over the years i want to use the platform of this message to make a sincere passionate appeal to the leaders of the two main political parties in our country npp and ndc to come together as soon as possible preferably next week to agree on appropriate measures to bring an end to this worrying and unacceptable phenomenon of vigilantism in our body politic he said citing the recent violence that marred the ayawaso west wuogon constituency due to activities of supposed politically aligned vigilante groups president akufo addo promised to use legislation to stop the phenomenon of political vigilantism if the two parties fail to stop it voluntarily i have asked the leadership of the npp to extend an invitation to the leadership of the ndc for such a meeting the security services of the country will be on standby to assist this meeting if voluntary disbandment by the parties is not feasible then i will initiate legislation on the matter vigorous debate and the exchange of ideas should be the true basis of political dialogue and competition in our country not the activities of party vigilante groups he added the phenomenon of vigilantism has become a topical issue in the country following a surge in acts of physical attacks and assaults carried out by members of vigilante groups aligned to ghana s major political parties ndc and npp some of these attacks have resulted in death and injuries on victims including innocent citizens recently the presence of some masked and armed men at a polling station during the ayawaso wuogon by election sparked conversations on the matter
there is an escalating crisis in asia a crisis developing from the symbiosis of organised crime terrorism and the covert domestic and foreign policy ambitions of several asian nations dr gary k busch examines organised crime and international politics in asia part 2 greater china china has a unique and complicated history one in which the chinese government the chinese communist party ccp china s military forces the peoples liberation army pla and criminal organisations like the triads all played important roles to a high degree this history has been one of internal military strife weak central governments widespread criminal organisations and a post war consolidation of political power in the hands of the communist party these three actors the ccp the pla and the triads have played a major role in expanding the criminal activities of organised crime across the world and especially in promoting and expanding chinese political policies towards hong kong macau and taiwan in many areas the triads have also played a major role in chinese economic and political interactions with china s neighbours and trading partners especially in the international trade of drugs chemical substances and people smuggling triads and the road to china s military industrial complex the influence of the chinese military in the economic affairs of china has been extensive for the last three thousand years it has always dominated the agricultural sector and after the death of mao tse tung it has been the dominant force in chinese industry and politics there has been a long tradition of warlords in china especially from 1916 to the late 1930s when the country was divided among military cliques a division that continued until the fall of the nationalist government in the mainland china regions of sichuan shanxi qinghai ningxia guangdong guangxi gansu yunnan and xinjiang in this period a warlord maintained his own troops loyal to him dominated and controlled the agriculture and mining in his area or region and acted as the de facto political power in that region to maintain themselves they often fought with their neighbouring warlords and against any attempt by the emperor or central government to control them some of the most notable warlord wars post 1928 including the central plains war involved nearly a million soldiers the central government was weak and relied on the power and support of these fractious warlords by the beginning of the 19th century the discovery of china s wealth by the european colonial powers and the japanese resulted in demands on the ruling emperors and unequal treaties that created foreign concessions in china s ports the weakness of the central government allowed the rise of regional warlords whose armies fought with each other for territory and plunder and were funded in this by foreign powers after a period of ever increasing presence of foreign traders christian missionaries foreign troops and british supplied opium a violent surge of protest occurred among the chinese this included many of the warlords the landowners and the newly urbanised poor their rebellion against foreign rule and in support of qing dynasty reforms led to their capture of beijing where they attacked the foreign legations the 1899 boxer rebellion initially they were successful but the foreign imperial powers formed an eight nation alliance uk russia japan france u s germany italy and austro hungary against the chinese they assembled 50 255 foreign troops expeditionary forces plus 100 000 russian troops to occupy manchuria the imperial troops were defeated beijing was seized and these eight foreign powers extracted further concessions from the weakened qing government by 1911 12 the chinese military instigated a series of revolts by reform minded officers this led to the proclamation of the republic of china under sun yat sen and abdication of the last qing emperor sun yat sen attempted to build national institutions but was unable to stand up to the growth of warlordism and the rise of the communist party in china after the russian revolution of 1917 in 1912 sun yat sen became the first president of the provisional republic of china founding the kuomintang kmt and serving as its first leader sun yat sen known as the father of the nation had been a triad member from an early age while he had lived in honolulu and chicago he was known as a 426 fighter of the triads the chief enforcer of the three harmonies triad kwok on wui these connections and sympathetic goals helped him launch the revolution which in 1911 officially ended imperial rule in china and restored han dominance with the formation of the communist international comintern which had formed in russia after the 1917 revolution numerous unionists were sent to china to help strengthen the nascent chinese communist trades unions and parties which had begun to organize after the fall of the imperial system the communist party of china drew its strength from the urban working class in such large cities as shanghai and canton during this time however power in china remained firmly in the hands of the local warlords whose min t uan private armies controlled much of the rural areas by far the most important development emerged in 1923 when the workers students and peasants began to form national parties among the first was the kuomintang or nationalist party the other major party was the kung ch antang the communist party the kuomintang found a close ally in the communist party of the soviet union which sent down instructors and advisers to shape the kuomintang into a disciplined bolshevik party the soviets sent advisers to instill communism in the military forces and set up a training facility known as the whampoa military academy the russians also shipped in arms and instructors to bolster the kuomintang forces the leadership of the kuomintang would soon rest on the director of the whampoa military academy and the military hero chiang kai shek in support of the kuomintang workers in the communist unions of shanghai had begun a series of major strikes at the height of this demonstration more than half a million workers went out on strike backed by an armed workers militia of more than five thousand on 26 march 1927 chiang kai shek marched into shanghai welcomed by the striking workers as their liberator at that time shanghai was known as the vice capital of the world organised crime in shanghai was controlled by the notorious green gang triad under du yuesheng it specialised in opium which was supported by local warlords gambling and prostitution chiang kai shek had barely been in the city for a few days when he contacted the leaders of the green gang to make a deal with them allied with these forces chiang began a purge of all the communists especially the unionists by the end of what would become known as the white terror massacre approximately 5 000 pro communist strikers in the city of shanghai would lose their lives when the strikes ended in may of 1927 communist control had been wrenched from the unions by the kuomintang the soviets had inadvertently succeeded in creating a kuomintang which devoured the local communist party the kuomintang set about obliterating the communists driving them from the cities to their stronghold in hunan the chinese communists led by the son of a wealthy hunanese peasant mao tse tung adopted these lessons to the communist struggle in china after the defeat of the kuomintang leadership of ex warlord chiang kai shek in the wake of the second world war and japanese occupation a ravaged china was left in the hands of the chinese communist party led by mao tse tung mao ruled as both the chairman of the chinese communist party as well as the chairman of the central military committee his rule was personal direct and disastrous the great leap forward and the cultural revolution led to the virtual self destruction of china millions starved to death many more were exiled or driven away from the cities one major aspect of china didn t change much under the rule of the ccp the official chinese government s structure for the military regions of the pla remained generally the ancient divisions of china in the period of the warlords this is very important to the understanding of the early development of the chinese military industrial complex the origins of the chinese triads the triads have an almost mystical version of their history mixing nationalism and rebellion in equal parts they started as robin hood like groups fighting against the excesses of the emperors organising in rural china they took part in the many rebellions of the chinese people against their emperors but were somewhat constrained by the military might at the regional level by the warlords the first reference to a secret society in china was a group known as the red eyebrows which appears to have been established when the western han dynasty was collapsing in ad 9 the group played an important role in helping wang mang a han dynasty official overthrow the dynasty and found the xin renewed replacement however after his rule from ad 9 23 the han dynasty was restored in ad 184 a group of rebels known as the yellow turbans turned against the han dynasty and although their efforts failed they helped hasten the fall of the han dynasty in ad 220 in ad 618 the tang dynasty came into power marking a pivotal moment for china s secret societies as buddhists became targets of purges that forced them underground organizations like the red turbans led by zhu yuanzhang who eventually became emperor later fought against the mongolian rulers and in 1367 managed to overthrow the yuan dynasty following the collapse of the yuan dynasty the ming dynasty was the ruling government for almost 300 years but in 1644 another outside force overthrew the empire of the great ming and the precursors of what today are called the triads established themselves the ming dynasty in beijing fell into the hands of rebel li zicheng some 20 years later the white lotus society the buddhist sect which the red turbans had previously formed around morphed with the heaven and earth society or tiandihui as they were known and became the triad society this is also the period where early worker associations formed more like guilds than unions but active in social movements within their regions or cities they were separate and distinct from the nascent triads when another rebellion began against the newly installed qing the emperor requested assistance from his subjects to help fight against the ming attackers among those heeding this request were the shaolin monks at the siu lam monastery despite being pro ming they decided to help the emperor because they didn t want the empire taken over by barbarians they were also skilled warriors and wanted to show their warlike skills in the hopes they might impress people to join them when the time came to revolt finally they hoped that by pretending eagerness to fight for the emperor it might get them greater autonomy once victorious emperor shunzhi was not only impressed with their skills but he also began to see them as a potential liability just to be on the safe side he ordered them to be executed and their monastery burned after the assault eighteen survivors escaped although thirteen of them died from their wounds and malnutrition the remaining five shaolin monks tsoi tak chung fong tai hung ma chiu hing wu tak lee shik hoi became the five ancestors of the new triad society they found shelter and eventually began recruiting for their rebellion vowing loyalty to their code of overthrowing the qing and restoring the ming they gathered new forces and attacked the emperor they lost and disbursed to safe havens abroad or in the chinese main urban centres where they turned from patriotism to crime they found a ready ally in the foreign imperial forces taking over their concessions in china and peddling their opium to the masses these chinese criminals weren t always private sector entrepreneurs seeking to earn a quick if dishonest buck they felt they were part of the rebel movements seeking justice under the emperors when their efforts were defeated they turned to a more profitable profession crime the triads developed a set of rituals and practices to preserve their anonymity and to bind each member to the society a lot like the freemasons they set up a triangle of power that reflected the heavens the earth and man things were explained as variations on the triangular theme however power was vertical as in a pyramid the shan chu mountain master was the overall leader responsible for making the final decision on all matters the fu shan chu deputy mountain master when appointed was the deputy leader and directly assisted the leader the heung chu incense master was responsible for all ceremonies of initiation and promotion the sin fung vanguard was responsible for recruitment and organising and assisting in ceremonies the hung kwan red pole was the fighter rank of the society the pak tsz sin white paper fan was responsible for the general administration of the society the cho hai straw sandal was the liaison officer for the society the 49 chai was the ordinary member usually recruited to follow a particular office bearer triads also use numeric codes to distinguish between ranks and positions within the gang for example 426 refers to fighter while 49 denotes a rank and file member 489 refers to the mountain master while 438 is used for the deputy mountain master 415 for white paper fan and 432 for the straw sandal 25 refers to an undercover law enforcement agent or spy from another triad and has become popularly used in hong kong as a slang for traitor when a triad member is sworn in he must take thirty six oaths of loyalty to his brothers that include secrecy and obedience should he violate them he will most likely suffer what is known as a slashing or more charmingly the death of a thousand cuts it is an orchestrated attack where the victim is cut multiple times by a meat cleaver and left for dead the multi faceted ritual oaths taken by triad recruits repeatedly refer to the death penalty for violation of any aspect of the triad code when the kmt was driven south by the communists many fled to taiwan others were trapped in south china among them was the 997th brigade of the kmt which settled in northern burma there they promoted the production of opium and began its export to the rest of the world including the use of us aircraft sent in to deliver supplies to the 997th and with nothing to take back this became a thriving business air america throughout the 1960s 1970s and into the 1980s notable warlords with fuzzy motivations arose in the shan state it was often unclear whether they were ethno nationalists or communists drug lords cronies of rangoon or a combination of these the most predominant such leaders were general li of the kmt commanding groups in burma from thailand li hsing ho of the rangoon supported home guard also known as the ka kwe ye kky kyi myint zhang zhiming of the cbp and the infamous khun sa of the shan united army sua the refining of this morphine base was undertaken by the union corse the corsican mafia operating in french indo china as anti communist allies of the french colonial government up until dien bien phu when the french and the corsicans were driven out of indo china the drug business reverted to the triads and gangs who had stayed loyal to the kmt and who had taken up residence in taiwan along with local nationalist burmese and vietnamese for a long time the drug business was dominated by the taiwanese gangs united bamboo four seas hung mun hip shing hop shing on leong three mountains tsung tsin ying ong suey sing because of the close ties with the kmt government in taipei however by 1954 power had passed from taiwan to the relocated triads on hong kong including the kmt drug trade this was largely because the kmt government in taipei was becoming increasingly concerned with the rise of communist china and its attempts to impose a one china policy especially in the un the triads found a welcoming home in hong kong and macau besides the usual trifecta of illegal gambling drug trafficking and sex work modern triads also exerted their influence through extortion of businesses from small newsstands to huge construction companies they regularly shook down wealthy businessmen and were always busy in the kidnaping for profit business the triads traditionally engaged in drug trafficking loan sharking prostitution smuggling gunrunning extortion and protection rackets they eventually moved into credit card fraud call girl rings trade in illicit substances people smuggling and computer software and music and video pirating working outside the law they were able to accrue large sums of unvouchered cash which they used to fund many building projects in the expanding hong kong building boom and provided working capital at a price to many new businesses just as in the integration of the indian gangs with the growth of bollywood the triads have helped create a film industry in hong kong and later china which they controlled their first successes were the scores of films about the triads action films which glorified their role the young and dangerous film series were popular with young and old alike the appeal relied on the protagonist s careful balance of sinister saintly and cool despite their crime affiliation the gangsters were often depicted as loyal and just individuals navigating a corrupt society the triads control an empire worth many billions of dollars the largest and most powerful sun yee on composed mostly of chiu chow from eastern guandong has more than 45 000 members many in hong kong the sun yee on is well connected with the hong kong tycoons and communist party elite and is well integrated with the hong kong police among the most popular ventures shared by chinese officials and hong kong triads are the businesses that triads know best nightclubs karaoke bars and brothels in shanghai the people s liberation army owns a string of nightclubs with the sun yee on and where the public security bureau police operates several high class houses of prostitution including one called the protected secret club the second and third largest triads respectively are wo sing wo and 14k 14 stands for the road number of a former headquarters and k stands for kowloon in september 2017 philippine president rodrigo duterte said that 14k and the taiwan based united bamboo triad are now running the drug trade in the philippines there is also a particularly brutal triad group which developed in hong kong formed initially to stop triad extortions in the city however its violent and cutthroat behaviour soon won them a place in the hearts of the triad societies who used them for some of their most brutal offenses this is the big circle gang formed by ex red guards after their purge and rustication by the pla during 1968 and 1969 a large number of these red guards were purged by the pla and exiled to guangzhou for re education many escaped and travelled to hong kong after the death of mao tse tung in 1975 since the mid 1970s the term big circle boys has been used explicitly to refer to criminal groups based in mainland china by the triads and the police in hong kong their criminal enterprises extend around the globe with a high level of activity in africa in the trade in illicit chemicals abalone gold diamonds and ivory most recently the big circle boys has been connected to a massive billion dollar fentanyl ring in canada a 2003 u s library of congress report found that the triad had established cells in new york boston seattle san francisco and los angeles and was extensively engaged in sex slave rings alien smuggling prostitution gaming offenses vehicle theft and various financial intellectual property rights and high tech crimes the report also called the big circle boys the most active chinese crime group operating in canada with hundreds of members in toronto and vancouver the triads have been equally as strong in macau as they were in hong kong especially in the casino business where the largest and most notorious triad is the 14k their boss or dragon head was the infamous wan kuok koi known as broken tooth koi after a brutal conflict between 14k and shui fong 14k eased out most of their rivals the chinese made a film about broken tooth koi which gained a worldwide audience in july 2018 wan kuok koi through his company world hung mun investment said it raised us 750 million in less than five minutes at a star studded event in cambodia in an initial coin offering ico for his hb cryptocurrency wan partnered with a mysterious beijing firm to back chess and poker tournaments in mainland china while criminal enterprises are not unique to china the development of the triads has a special degree of intensity because they have become linked with the emergence of a military industrial complex of corporations controlled by the chinese military and then as the result of the economic reforms of deng xiaoping a close working relationship with the chinese communist party inside china and abroad the chinese military industrial complex mao tse tung left china in a weak position he was succeeded by hua guofeng who attempted to keep a tight control over the power structures of china including the central military committee however his power waned and control was transferred to the reformer deng xiaoping who revolutionised the economy of china deng never held office as the head of state or government but he did serve as the de facto leader of the people s republic of china from 1978 to the early 1990s as leader of the communist party of china ccp deng represented the next generation chinese leadership and was instrumental in introducing chinese economic reform also known as the socialist market economy and he partially opened china to the global market deng is generally credited with pushing china into becoming one of the fastest growing economies in the world and for raising the standard of living deng xiaoping s ouster of hua guofeng was the moment when the market policies of economic reform began this reform was carried on primarily by the military companies created in the various regions by the armies which controlled them with this opening into market reforms and a relaxation of control by the ccp the military groups began to form companies on their own in their own regions it is not difficult to see why the people s liberation army pla controlled the security situation in its region that meant it issued permits to enter or leave the region it controlled the communications network in the region it had the trucks and other transport under its control and it was charged with maintaining order it was in fact in charge this was not controlled by one central pla group but was under the control of the individual army for each military region some like the 28th army and the 39th army were in economic hotspots and were able to thrive quickly the northern army was quick to exploit its opportunities these burgeoning military corporations were aided in their efforts by the presence of the triads especially in the urban areas while the military had the physical control of the region and the industries the triads had the seed capital and the local administrative middle management people the local civil administration had become enmeshed in the activities of the triads and was able to operate corrupt enterprises without a reliance on the chinese communist cadres who were notionally in charge of the regions usually they too became part of the corrupt enterprise until the end of hua guofeng s rule the ccp was opposed to the activities of the triads as a general rule communist parties don t like the criminal fraternity as they want no competition from the private sector in stealing from the people however with the accession to power of deng xiaoping the situation had changed in 1978 deng xiaoping initiated a series of economic reforms that led to the opening of china the reforms allowed for economic decisions to be made at the local level this let states and townships take greater responsibility for their own economic activities as a result china s economy grew to be less regulated by the central government this opened the door to the development of corporations and the integration of the triads into the system of administration deng was famous for his saying it doesn t matter if a cat is black or white as long as it catches mice it s a good cat in essence the black cat and white cat stood for planned economy and market economy and deng was saying that whichever one gets the job done will be adopted this greatly improved the power of the triads and created a dependency by the local party and civil administration to the military and the triads for their sustenance these included gifts or donations as a tool for organized criminals to purchase the cooperation of the police at the highest level of political corruption was the practice known as maiguan maiguan or the selling of government posts to criminals or action by government officials to protect criminals and heijin the penetration of mobsters into the legitimate business sector and the political arena an interesting aspect of the role of the triads came during the civil disturbances of the tiananmen square uprising when the chinese communist party under li peng cracked down on china s democracy movement ordering in the troops to battle the students the pla was ambivalent about this and seven retired senior military officers openly criticized the martial law order imposed by the beijing government and called for the ouster of premier li peng the populace was outraged and the authority of the communist party waned the pla had realised it was free from the controlling hand of the party and became agents of change primarily corporate change encouraged by deng xiaoping retired but active during the march for democracy the triads were used to rescue some of the leading protestors operation yellowbird was a plan to rescue activists from beijing to a safe haven in hong kong and then abroad after the chinese government quashed the tiananmen square protests of 1989 beijing issued a wanted list of ringleaders of the protests in response activists in hong kong including the hong kong alliance in support of patriotic democratic movements in china set up operation yellowbird in mid june 1989 to help wanted activists escape from china they raised large sums of money from the hong kong democrats and engaged the triads to sneak the dissidents beyond the ccp control closely following the aftermath of the protests seven of the twenty one most wanted students escaped china through the operation s assistance although some had no knowledge of its existence at the time yellowbird successfully helped more than four hundred dissidents who were smuggled through hong kong and then onwards to western countries chan tat ching or brother six was the mastermind of the escape as the triads had the speedboats and other smuggling equipment which could get the protestors out the u s and british intelligence agencies offered their assistance and the french consulate prepared the diplomatic papers and passports to get them out of hong kong this was achieved with the co operation of two of the pla armies the build up of pla corporations had began in earnest they already had numerous companies under pla control manufacturing goods for the defence sector during mao tse tung s rule and the era of sino soviet tensions the military moved many of its factories inland in case of a possible attack on china manufacturing purely military products such as arms and ammunition as well as electronics plastics and metals for military applications these so called third line factories were built in remote mountain regions far away from transportation routes and power sources the factories bought supplies at subsidized costs from other factories manufactured the weaponry and related products generally low tech and low quality and then sold them to the military at subsidized prices after mao s death in 1976 the new leadership encouraged the military plants to begin exploring civilian uses for their products and to engage in the broader liberalizing economy the nimblest managers were free to exploit new markets for their goods during the early 1980s the pla s share of the national budget declined spurring it to look to other sources for cash especially hard currency the higher organizational levels of the pla created trading companies like china xinxing china poly and china songhai to take advantage of the opening of china s economy to the international market they formed banks holding companies and international trading companies like everbright to market these goods worldwide the pla ran farms factories mines hotels brothels paging and telephone companies and airlines as well as major trading companies the number of military run business exploded during the boom of the late 1980s the third line factories opened branches in the coastal areas earning increasingly high profits from the manufacture of civilian goods even the lowest levels of the pla set up production units in fact the pla had a largely captive audience of chinese who had never really had the chance to acquire personal goods produced in china before in addition to their international arms sales their production of consumer goods for the domestic market soared the government first attempted to regulate the pla s business activities in 1989 it issued a series of decrees that included a prohibition on active military personnel holding positions at commercial enterprises the reforms were intended to prevent lower ranking officers from becoming involved in the daily functioning of the military companies in the wake of the rejection of the party in 1989 these government strictures fell away the government tried again the early 1990s when the central leadership of the military took steps to coordinate the production of the vast number of military factories by tying the plants together under group companies the groups acting like conglomerates were successful in centralizing management and production running the trading companies and expanding the groups business operations the pla acted as a state within a state with its power growing substantially along with the wave of chinese economic expansion many of these companies then listed themselves on capital markets in hong kong and elsewhere these so called red chips companies listed on the hong kong exchange but which were in fact mainland chinese firms were the hottest stocks on the market hong kong is the pla s favoured stock exchange because of its loose disclosure guidelines foreign companies looking for a foothold in china like partnering with the pla because of the stability it can offer to any long term project companies with military partners get the added security of knowing that the top management of many of the pla companies are from the ranks of the princelings the children and relatives of senior chinese communist party officials these influential princelings assure that the business operations of the pla will have the government connections that are so important in china s corrupt system in the case of china poly chair wang jun and president he ping act as brokers between the government and the military wang jun is the eldest son of the late vice president wang zhen he ping is the son in law of the late deng xiaoping wang jun s brother wang bing is the chair of the pla navy helicopter company china carrie s president is ye xuanning the second son of late pla marshal ye jianying these military companies established joint ventures with many of the largest international firms making full use of their intellectual property this dominant role of the pla corporations grew after tiananmen square as the communist party was in some disarray by 1998 the party tried to reassert itself in control there was an effort by the chinese government to try and rein in some of these companies but to no avail more than a year after the chinese military was ordered to disband its octopus like business empire 1999 and return to the barracks its influence over the nation s economy continued during 1999 some pla high profile investments such as beijing s five star palace hotel were handed over to central government shareholders with great public fanfare at least 150 large profitable enterprises were grabbed up by the central government most however stayed with the pla by the mid 1990s the so called pla inc included over twenty thousand companies in everything from agribusiness to electronics to tourism to arms exports the 1989 1990 reforms had only a marginal effect the party had diminished control of these companies enter xi with the rise to power of xi jinping in 2012 the party began to reassert control of the military and its companies in addition to his role as chairman of the communist party xi jinping took over the leadership of the central military council cmc the party s control organisation in charge of the military he used his position to dramatically reduce the number of soldiers and he reorganised the military structures most importantly xi embarked upon a strict anti corruption campaign president xi jinping concentrated on the rule of law within china an important part of the rule of law was the eradication or at least suppression of corruption since the start of his anti corruption drive in november 2012 more than forty high level officials have been investigated and shamed these officials include current and former municipal and provincial party secretaries and vice governors senior government officials and executives at state owned enterprises this anti corruption campaign was not embarked upon solely to punish party and army leaders who had stolen from the state it was also a means of removing from the leadership of the party many of xi s enemies both on the left bo xilai and the new left in china and the right jiang zeminists zuo yongkang xu caihou and guo boxiong xi and wang qishan politburo standing committee member and head of the powerful central commission for discipline inspection made it clear that the new pla will not tolerate a senior military leadership that has its loyalties anywhere but the cmc many of the leaders of the pla military corporations had to choose between the companies and their ranks in the army this effectively returned many of the companies to communist party discipline at the same time after 2014 and the collapse of the real estate market the large and mostly unregulated shadow banks in china were brought back under the control of the large state banks by far the most important development was the gradual expansion of the state owned enterprises soe yangqi under state party control there are about 120 large soes in china managed by the state owned assets supervision and administration commission sasac as well as several large banks and insurance companies not supervised by the sasac president xi jinping was seen as an unlikely leader of the party or as a reformer of the economy at the time of his accession to power as he had no apparent political base supporting him he was never viewed as part of either the conservative or reformist factions of the party but wavered around a broadly centrist stance perhaps this is due to his background and his experience unlike his predecessors in the office xi has had a prolonged military experience and is a princeling of the military establishment after graduating from tsinghua university in 1979 xi s father was able to get him a job as a secretary to the central military committee the nerve centre of the peoples liberation army pla his father was xi zhongxun a former vice premier and a crony of then defence minister general geng biao xi s wife peng liyuan a popular singer with the pla song and dance troupe has the rank of major general xi is known to be on good terms with the disproportionately large number of princelings who have since the early 2000s risen to the post of major general or above these military princelings who were recently made full generals with high military ranks included political commissar of the academy of military sciences liu yuan political commissar of the second artillery corps zhang haiyang and the vice chief of the general staff ma xiaotian perhaps xi s greatest success has been the relentless purging of the pla of corrupt leaders starting in 2012 xi shook up the structure of the pla and the cmc he eventually netted two of the biggest fish in that pond in january 2015 xu caihou 71 a former vice chairman of the central military commission and a member of the powerful politburo confessed to taking massive bribes in exchange for assisting in promotions he was found guilty and expelled from the party in april 2016 china s top general guo boxiong was arrested and expelled from the party for massive corruption along with members of his family the man who ran the world s largest army was charged with accepting 12 3 million in bribes the result of this attack on corruption changed the balance between the military and the party leadership the pla was presented with the option of allowing many of the major military industrial companies to morph into state owned enterprises in return for a proper funding and reorganisation of china s military the pla chose to return to its more military pursuits and leave much of the business to the state and party leadership in return the pla got new equipment a reorganised structure and a more focussed program the withdrawal of the pla from many of its business ventures and its reorganisation into a more solidly military configuration has increased its efficiency and made the military triad relationship much less important however the triads have continued to prosper throughout china as they still retain a lot of the cash circulating through the economy while the ccp may use reform and anti corruption to weed out its enemies in the political structure it still needs the triads to help manage the commerce across the vast areas of china most importantly the ccpf and the pla have been using their symbiotic relationship with the triads to engage in policies in which it cannot or will not be seen to be engaged the triads as adjuncts to chinese foreign policy goals there are three key areas in which the triads act to promote the foreign policy of the chinese state the suppression of dissent and labour activism in hong kong and macau the preparations for the chinese military takeover of the island of taiwan and the expansion of the new belt and road initiative of the chinese state as the chinese government cracks down on dissent in supressing the discontent of workers across china in strikes and demonstrations the local administration frequently calls on the local triads to suppress the dissent however this took on a more important role in the use of the triads in suppressing the dissent in hong kong s umbrella revolution from 26 september to 15 december 2014 the ccp in beijing demanded that they pre screen all candidates for the election of new leaders for hong kong the students and other activists took to the streets and blocked traffic and commerce to protest the violation of the separate system agreed with the british when they vacated the colony when london and beijing signed their agreement returning hong kong to chinese control on july 1 1997 the fear was that the colony s criminal syndicates would relocate to europe or the united states instead the syndicates moved into southern china on the sixth day of the democracy protests in hong kong in both the central district and mong kok on kowloon a new and violent force engaged in the clash between the authorities and the student demonstrators despite the peaceful nature of the protest even when the police used tear gas against the students there seemed to be reluctance on both sides to enter into pitched and violent battles but on the sixth day of the protests a violent group of anti occupy protestors joined the conflict and engaged in trashing student tents and hurling obscenities and projectiles against the students on that friday in mong kok they beat the students and destroyed their banners and posters and chanted go home water bottles and other missiles were thrown abandoned buses that had stood at the site since activists occupied it were boarded and driven off to loud cheers for a long period the police were unable or unwilling to separate the two sides female activists were sexually abused and foreign journalists attacked this was the result of the ccp engaging the triads in the suppression of dissent in fact the big circle gang of ex red guards who had practice in breaking up crowds as well as the sun yee ong were employed since 2014 the ccp and local ccp officials in hong kong have mobilised the triads especially the big circle gang in suppressing any dissent labour student or democrat the main current thrust of ccp and triad co operation is the determination by china that the island of taiwan must be returned to the control of the chinese state there have been many abortive efforts by the pla to prepare for an invasion of taiwan but they were never actually conducted as part of the bargain made by xi jinping with the pla was an agreement that the pla would be allowed to liberate taiwan one of the keys to preparing for the invasion of taiwan has been the activation of the triad organisations in taiwan as an adjunct to ccp power a primary vehicle for this move has been the china unification promotion party cupp a pro mainland group created by chang an le former head of one of the most powerful triads the bamboo union about 500 of his followers attempted to physically remove anti beijing protestors from the taiwanese parliament in april 2014 the cupp is known to regularly contribute manpower to violent protests organized by other groups there is also evidence of growing collaboration and coordination between pro beijing triads in hong kong and the cupp in taiwan tensions continue to grow between china and taiwan china is trying to limit taiwan s international space and undermine support for the island s incumbent ruling party the u s actively supports taiwan as part of its policy towards china this year one may expect an increase in chinese pressure on taiwan because of upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections scheduled for early 2020 on the island snake heads the chinese triads are one of the world s largest organisations involved in international criminal activity their snake heads smuggle men and women all over the world they supply or carry much of the world s trade in amphetamines ephedrine heroin opium mandrax and similar drugs they have a large stake in the success of the new chinese belt and road initiative which will engage international trade using chinese transport facilities this engagement with chinese vessels trains ports and handling facilities is breathing new life into chinese organised crime and offers a bonanza in business to the triads especially with the support of the chinese government during the cultural revolution in china the theme song of the movement was the east is red the cultural revolution may have passed into history but indeed the east is still red the belt and road initiative will spread the power and control of the ccp across the globe and

everybody wants to be bernie sanders these days no they aren t mimicking the vermont senator s rumpled look or his trademark jumpshot instead they re stealing the independent senator s policies as they and he run for the 2020 democratic nomination for president here s everything you need to know about sanders platform and how it s changed since 2016 is bernie sanders a democrat when he first ran for president in 2016 sanders was considered an outlier in the democrat party many argued he wasn t truly a democrat he identified as an independent and was considered too far to the left but in the early stages of the 2020 democratic primary it s easier to point out the democrats who aren t aligned with bernie sanders the initial entries into the race are all politicians claiming to support sanders trademark proposals like medicare for all the green new deal free college and a 15 minimum wage one of those proposals 15 minimum wage is hard to mince words about either you re being paid 15 an hour or you aren t other issues sanders supports like the green new deal medicare for all and free tuition aren t so easy to pin down but unlike candidates who have danced around medicare for all during their launches sanders has had a staunch set of principles for each issue he supports bernie sanders 2020 platform and issues 1 medicare for all defining healthcare proposals can be tricky this is particularly true in our current moment when medicare for all is gaining popularity but a number of presidential hopefuls are still taking cash from the healthcare industry the essential distinction between a real medicare for all plan and a pretender is the role of private insurance companies there shouldn t be one in the real deal under the plans championed by sanders rep pramila jayapal d wa rep alexandria ocasio cortez d n y and other progressives private insurance companies would no longer play a role in the healthcare needs of americans they argue that this is vital because if private insurance companies continue to exert power in the martketplace the government will have trouble keep prices low for patients a public option by contrast would allow the government to provide a plan that is offered alongside private insurance plans under this policy the price gouging of private insurance companies would remain a part of american life a quick handy way to tell if other candidates plans stack up is if they support a single health program with comprehensive coverage that is free at the point of service and covers everyone while the government oversees pricing that is what bernie sanders supports this quick and dirty analysis does not account for every aspect of healthcare sanders plan is the truest to medicare for all of the candidates currently in the presidential race but he has been criticized from the left for some aspects of his plan including the way it handles long term care and elder care for a full accounting of the differences between the various iterations of medicare for all tim faust s the only guide to medicare for all that you will ever need at splinter is a nice deeper dive read more 2 green new deal similarly many candidates say that they support a green new deal but they don t necessarily support the green new deal resolution introduced by ocasio cortez furthermore ocasio cortez s resolution is just a broad framework and so it is easy for less environmentally friendly candidates to say they support it while still taking cash from corporations and lobbyists working against its goals when it comes to a green new deal sanders is the real deal he is reportedly working on his own version of a green new deal and early speculation is that it is will flesh out ocasio cortez s version in similarly aggressive terms though we are likely months away from sanders official plan being released it is expected to dig into how america could move towards zeroing out carbon emissions while offering many of the same aggressive benchmarks laid out by ocasio cortez reading ocasio cortez s resolution introduced alongside sen ed markey d mass and progressive thinktank data for progress 40 page proposal should give you an idea of where sanders will land ocasio cortez s non binding resolution contains a variety of measures aimed at curbing climate change and protecting the environment some of the proposed measures include overhauling and upgrading america s infrastructure investing in renewable energy expanding public transportation and jobs training expect a similar focus in sanders expanded proposal 3 15 minimum wage here we have a policy proposal that requires less explanation bernie sanders supports raising the minimum wage to 15 an hour the current minimum wage in the united state is 7 25 an hour and has not been raised since 2009 4 bernie sanders tax plan how are we going to pay for it is a common refrain among bernie s opponents what this ignores is that bernie has a fairly detailed proposal for how to pay for his programs in addition to cuts to military spending sanders would raise taxes it is important to point out that for your average working class person the modest increase would be mostly offset by getting rid of things like health insurance premiums and student loans the bulk of the money to pay for sanders programs would come from wealthy corporations and individuals steep increases

president donald trump and china s president xi jinping arrive at a state dinner in beijing photo getty images president donald trump said friday that he will probably host chinese president xi jinping next month at his mar a lago estate in florida and expects to finalise a sweeping trade agreement that would end a nearly year long tariff war speaking in the oval office the president said chinese negotiators who had planned to leave washington today had agreed to extend their stay for two additional days an apparent sign of progress if the two sides can t make a deal by march 1 us tariffs on 200 billion in chinese products are scheduled to jump to 25 per cent from 10 per cent ultimately i think the biggest decisions and some even smaller decisions will be made by president xi and myself the president told reporters and we expect to have a meeting some point in the not too distant future and i think president xi and i will work out the final points perhaps and perhaps not trump said negotiators this week reached a final agreement to stabilise currency values the first tangible accord with beijing since he began imposing tariffs on chinese imports last year administration officials released no additional details but have been seeking china s agreement to avoid manipulating the value of the yuan to gain a trade advantage the chinese government intervenes in foreign exchange markets to prevent the yuan from rising or falling in value too rapidly between april and october 2018 the yuan dropped about 9 per cent all but offsetting the effect of trump s first round of tariffs some analysts said the currency deal represents no real concession chinese authorities are very reluctant to let the dollar value of one yuan rise above 7 because it encourages chinese citizens to move their money outside the country said robin brooks chief economist for the institute of international finance so this agreement isn t a big win for the us since china doesn t want a destabilising yuan devaluation anyway brooks said on twitter the fate of two chinese telecommunications companies that us officials say pose national security concerns huawei and zte also may be included in the trade discussions trump said adding that he will consult with attorney general william barr before deciding the president and his chief trade negotiator robert lighthizer had a bizarre exchange in front of the press over what to call a china trade deal the white house had announced feb 15 that the two sides were negotiating several memoranda of understanding but after lighthizer gave a lengthy explanation of the term mou saying it was equivalent to a contract trump contradicted his trade chief in front of chinese officials and reporters saying flatly i disagree after a back and forth over what the two sides were negotiating which included the president saying that moe s don t mean very much lighthizer conceded we ll never use mou again the veteran trade negotiator also said that major hurdles remain before a deal can be struck that s just as well say some analysts who fear the president is preparing to settle for minor concessions and chinese promises to buy more american products beijing s perennial strategy for defusing trade complaints if we walk away with just some purchase commitments that means this whole process would have been essentially for nothing we need to get a lot more or this wasn t worth it said scott kennedy a china expert at the center for strategic and international studies on wall street the dow jones industrial average rose more than 180 points as investors anticipated us and chinese negotiators would head off a planned march 2 tariff increase on 200 billion worth of chinese goods the dow is up nearly 6 per cent over the past month a period that coincides with the president s increasingly positive statements about the likelihood of a deal we are encouraged at this point that they re getting closer to getting an agreement said myron brilliant executive vice president and head of international affairs for the us chamber of commerce who said he has spoken this week with officials from both governments but brilliant said the remaining gaps over issues at the center of the year long trade dispute mean that talks are likely to continue for some time trump has publicly suggested that he may extend his original deadline saying earlier this week there was nothing magical about the march date chinese vice premier liu he who leads beijing s team met this week with lighthizer and his 11 man us delegation in two days of talks at the eisenhower executive office building the two sides are trying to hammer out six moe s that will address us complaints about china s trade practices including intellectual property protections joint venture technology transfer requirements and non tariff barriers along with specifying a substantial increase in chinese purchases of american products chinese officials have reportedly offered to buy an additional 30 billion worth of us agricultural exports each year more than doubling the current 24 billion figure and to buy more american semiconductors the president has said that any deal must include profound structural changes in china s state led economic system we re covering everything all of the points that people have been talking about for years and said couldn t be done he said last week that s a tall order brilliant who visited beijing earlier this week said chinese officials have been slow to recognize the need to offer more than just an increase in their purchases from the united states notable gaps remain over trump s demand for far reaching changes in china s compulsory technology transfer requirements for foreign companies and its subsidies for state owned enterprises structural reform means something different for both governments trump said chinese officials have tried to parry us demands by repackaging policy changes they already had planned to make and by launching a frontal attack on lighthizer claims of chinese misdeeds said michael pillsbury a china expert at the hudson institute chinese officials also have drafted a contingency plan to offer additional trade concessions if the threatened tariff increase to 25 per cent from 10 per cent is implemented he added the two sides also are far apart on provisions for enforcing any agreement an issue that lighthizer has called essential to remaking the us china relationship us officials have considered leaving some tariffs in place or reimposing them if china fails to fulfill its promises chinese officials meanwhile want enforcement handled through further dialogue brilliant said that s not what we re looking for we want it very clear and very concrete in the text of the agreement

applications of them could continue to stall their entry into one of the world s largest markets trump administration officials have used the broad category of non tariff barriers to include china s

chief among the u s targets has been the made in china 2025 subsidies targeted at 10 strategic high technology sectors where beijing wants to gain a dominant position including semiconductors robotics

between the two countries but the trump administration has refrained from accusing china of manipulating its currency in recent months however u s officials including mnuchin have warned china against

sogar ein jude hat seinen nutzen frau ivanka das weiße haus wird meine hundehütte sein und sie können mit meinem jagdhund donald spazieren on wednesday mr trump granted mr kurz a one on one meeting and an expanded session with his senior aides the kind of attention that leaders of smaller countries almost never get du arbeitest jetzt für eine deutsche welt frau verified account lagarde sebastiankurz to the imf today we had a good discussion on the economic outlook for austria and the european economy more broadly i also extended my gratitude to austria for its support of our imfcapdev efforts i was also happy to meet the austrian staff members at the worldbank thank you for your great work and what was donald trumps day not one mention of chancellor sebastian kurz in proper etiquette but he was raging about everything from blacks to andrew mccabe to this bizarre post about the completed new mexico wall which was one block of concrete and a pile of dirt verified account realdonaldtrump donald j trump retweeted donald j trump the wall is under construction right now donald j trump added 0 23 donald j trump verified account realdonaldtrump we have just built this powerful wall in new mexico completed on january 30 2019 47 days ahead of schedule many miles more now under construction finishthewall the lame cherry picks this up again now in a fine series of articles by zerohedge which has a profound insight to world events because they view them from the correct perspective of the slavic peoples who for centuries have had to be the most astute people in always being fought over and in diplomacy and resistance learning to survive what the hedge has been tracking is for the past several years beginning under obama there has been a mass repatriation of gold from london and new york vaults led by the germans and the dutch this is the reason why donald trump has been in such a fury against germany in trying to balkanize europe for american control is the germans have pulled their gold out of the west and brought it back home to berlin in the entire kurz summit donald trump was attempted by the new york times to be portrayed as grandfatherly to sebastian kurz when it was absolutely condescending and in that condescension the president of the united states ignorantly approached sebastian kurz as another small european state to fillet off of europe for the trump balkanizing and crushing of germany sebastian kurz is the kingpin of this entire european gold train and mr trump s failure to comprehend that is as stupid of calculation of franklin roosevelt concerning pearl harbor which started world war ii it is that gold and where it has been moved as the process is complete 4216 6 tons of gold germany austria netherlands turkey 3732 1 russia china 2814 imf tons of gold tyler durden by one week ago the world was not exactly shocked to learn that after germany and the netherlands one more country had unofficially joined the ranks of nations who have seen this all before and know how it ends when reports emerged that austria would repatriate 140 tons of gold from the bank of england appropriately immortalized in this is what happens when you hand your gold over to the bank of england for safekeeping as of today it is official earlier today the austrian central bank confirmed the kronen zeitung report and said that by the year 2020 it would hold 50 or 140 tons of its gold domestically up from 17 currently this means that austria will withdraw some 140 tons of gold from the boe which holds 80 of austria s gold currently and will soon hold only 30 and send 92 4 tons back home to vienna with another 47 6 tons being sent to switzerland tyler durden by after venezuela germany austria and the netherlands prudently repatriated a substantial portion if not all of their physical gold held at the ny fed or other western central banks in recent years this morning turkey also announced that it has decided to repatriate all its gold stored in the us federal reserve and deliver it to the istanbul stock exchange according to reports in turkey s yeni safak it won t be the first time turkey has asked the ny fed to ship the country s gold back in recent years turkey repatriated 220 tons of gold from abroad of which 28 7 tons was brought back from the us last year according to the latest imf data turkey s gold reserves are estimated at 591 tons worth just over 23 billion this makes ankara the 11th largest gold holder behind the netherlands and ahead of india tyler durden by on january 16 2013 the bundesbank one of the biggest gold holder in the world with 3 378 tonnes shocked the world out of the blue the german central bank announced that by december 31 2020 it intends to store half of germany s gold reserves in its own vaults in frankfurt up from only 31 at the time the plan would mean repatriating a total of 674 tonnes of gold 300 from the new york fed s gold vault and another 374 from the bank of france the transfer the bundesbank explained was meant to build trust and confidence domestically and the ability to exchange gold for foreign currencies at gold trading centers abroad within a short space of time writing s on the wall texas pulls 1 billion in zero hedge governor greg abbott today signed house bill 483 capriglione r southlake kolkhorst r brenham to establish a state gold bullion depository administered by the office of the comptroller the law will repatriate 1 billion of gold bullion from the federal reserve in new york to texas news 2015 06 13 writings wall texas pulls 1 billion gold ny fed makes as another lame cherry exclusive in matter anti matter after chancellor sebastian kurz summit with president donald trump in which the chancellor fired donald trump as leader of the world a most tale of two worlds emerged in it was the best of kurz and the worst of trump appeared in print for donald trump he was twitter raging again about blacks coup plotters and his border wall violating all etiquette in not thanking chancellor kurz for coming to america it is noted that the new york times specifically noted in recording this historic meeting that small countries are never afforded this type of audience unless it is to mock them like the irish for being drunks on st patties day in the kurz world of global leadership the chancellor thanked the trump weak links for attempting to obtain his good graces to save them from their crimes and then the chancellor went on to meet with the world bank and the imf to make this perfectly clear sebastian kurz after firing donald trump as world leader went to visit the global banking houses which control the world economy this is a monumental moment in world history and everyone has missed it it is that gold which is in nuclear eurasia with reserves building out of venezuela and iran which begins equaling the united states claimed reserves i stated claimed because if one examines zerohedge s articles it is discovered that the germans were delayed in repatriating their gold reserves because the netherlands was already pulling their gold out of new york that should be a warning sign in the netherlands had only 600 tons of gold and the united states and england were halting german withdrawals of their 3300 tons that translates to a reality that the gold is not in those vaults that conclusion is significant in the above realities point to that london and dc have only paper promissory notes in those vaults exactly as the looting of the us treasury in social security funds that gold is gone and it requires time for it to be reacquired from the sources holding it it was chancellor kurz though focusing after firing donald trump as world leader which is significant in the chancellor was at the world bank and the imf and there is almost 3000 tons of gold there on deposit which is the banking for the world economy which is currently backing the bankrupt us petro dollar the imf and world bank are key in this in who controls them it is not the united states as the americans are outnumbered by 82 in the imf and 85 in the world bank who controls the world economic fund it is the cartel nathan mayer rothschild leading the world elite in their international rapine and debt enslavement and after chancellor sebastian kurz fired donald trump as leader of the world the chancellor met with the financial house which controls the world and austria s habsburgs are about to usher in a new era without the united states from the old order of global prosperity for the cloth of the land i have been attempting to educate each of you in the movements of chancellor kurz in setting up the african consumers for european goods produced from slavics as europa like a tidal wave moves past the united states with asian technology and finance from singapore south korea and japan the rothschild cartel has been switching from backing the americans to returning to their financial house in europe as the indications are there that the london and new york gold reserves are paper the gold holdings are now dominated by the germans imf russia and china with the french in vichy state to germany and the japanese growing closer to vienna by the moment the leadership the gold and the finance are not in american debt but in austrian europa command in the below hedge links covering the history of this gold movement out of new york and london you will note something surprising out of bush country in the republic of texas several years ago the texans began moving all of their gold out of new york and into texas vaults at 1 billion dollars worth of gold the texas oil men are a lindsey williams knowledgeable association of the cartel the republic is not going to be stuck with banana republic dollars and is not about to find a paper note in it s deposit box instead of a billion dollars in gold as chancellor sebastian kurz moves on the world and moves past a world with america as a superpower for the risen beast of europe all of these gold depositors for the past years have become aware of something which is cartel generated and it all focuses on the new york federal reserve and it appears more in depth than the rumor of less than full bank vaults perhaps the reason for the texicans moving their gold along with others is close to a scene in the cancelled cbs television seriesin which the wonderful star of the series skeet ulrich is searching for supplies in a nearby town and the vendors there absolutely did not want gold or silver for payment as those precious elements were making people sick whatever the reason the gold is gone from new york and chancellor sebastian kurz is arisen from the seas of the peoples of the planet and he is on the most friendly of terms with peoples who are holding the world future in thousands of tons of gold in their vaults nuff saidagtg
beijing china should seek stable development of its economy while not forgetting to fend off risks to its financial system chinese leader xi jinping said at a recent study session held for senior communist party officials preventing and resolving financial risks especially systemic financial risks is a fundamental task xi told officials on feb 22 it is necessary to focus on preventing risks on the basis of steady growth while strengthening the countercyclical adjustment of fiscal policy and monetary policy and ensuring that the economy operates in a reasonable range xi said according to a report by state run media xinhua china s economy is growing at its slowest pace in almost 30 years spurring policymakers to bolster growth by easing credit conditions and cutting taxes xi s speech echoes one he made in january where he told cadres to prevent and control any economic risks that could threaten social stability the sense of urgency he conveyed hinted at the severe state of china s economic downturn also in january xiang songzuo a well known economist gave a speech at a shanghai finance summit explaining the reasons for china s economic downturn in the past year according to xiang china s capital market fell by 30 percent last year and the market value shrank by more than 7 trillion yuan roughly 1 trillion looking at the past decade as a whole china s stock market decline has been comparable to the economic depression in the united states in 1929 he said xiang further predicted that china s debt problem would soon lead to a minsky moment an economic phenomenon in which a debt bubble collapses due to falling asset and property prices state intervention earlier in the week on feb 20 premier li keqiang said that the chinese regime wouldn t resort to flood like stimulus such as it has unleashed in past downturns but after a spate of weak data investors are asking if beijing needs to speed or boost support to reduce the risk of a sharper slowdown china has so far refrained from cutting benchmark interest rates to spur the slowing economy which would ease financing costs but risk adding to a mountain of debt but to free up more funds for lending to small and private businesses the central bank has cut the reserves that banks need to set aside five times in the past year last month chinese banks made the most new loans on record a total of 3 23 trillion yuan 481 billion beijing officials so far have downplayed the effects of lending growth telling chinese business news media caixin that growth in social financing doesn t indicate that china is opening the credit floodgates as the new borrowing meets actual economic demands and remains at a stable level but the move indicates that beijing is willing to adopt aggressive stimulus measures by ben blanchard judy hua and ryan woo the epoch times contributed to this report

company s results terex refers to various gaap u s generally accepted accounting principles and non gaap financial measures which management believes provides useful information to investors these non

to and not in lieu of gaap financial measures terex believes that this non gaap information is useful to understanding its operating results and the ongoing performance of its underlying businesses management of terex uses both gaap and non gaap financial measures to establish internal budgets and targets and to evaluate the company s financial performance against such budgets and targets the amounts described below are unaudited are reported in millions of u s dollars except share data and percentages and are as of or for the period ended december 31 2018 unless otherwise indicated 2019 outlook the company s 2019 outlook for earnings per share and 2019 full year adjusted forecasted tax rate are non gaap financial measures because they exclude items such as restructuring and other related charges transformation costs the impact of the release of tax valuation allowances gains and losses on divestitures and other unusual items such as the impact of the 2017 us tax law changes the company is not able to reconcile these forward looking non gaap financial measures to their most directly comparable forward looking gaap financial measures without unreasonable efforts because the company is unable to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty the exact timing and impact of such items the unavailable information could have a significant impact on the company s full year

of its ongoing operations after tax gains or losses and per share amounts are calculated using pre tax amounts applying a tax rate based on jurisdictional rates to arrive at an after tax amount this number is divided by diluted weighted average shares outstanding to provide the impact on earnings per share the company highlights the impact of these items because when discussing earnings per share the company adjusts for items it believes are not reflective of ongoing operating activities in the periods restructuring and related charges are a recurring item as terex s restructuring programs usually require more than one year to fully implement and the company is continually seeking to take actions that could enhance its efficiency although recurring these charges are subject to significant fluctuations from period to period due to varying levels of restructuring activity and the inherent imprecision in the estimates used to recognize the costs and taxes associated with

san francisco from atop his gleaming new headquarters salesforce ceo marc benioff has an inspirational view of mountains the bay and an endless pacific ocean but when benioff looks down he s not so happy some 60 floors below his salesforce tower offices is what he calls an inequality train wreck city streets out of control with thousands of homeless and often infirm citizens who have rendered sidewalks a landmine of feces and drug paraphernalia many have been destitute for years but others are newly minted refugees of a housing crisis created in large part by the very technology boom that has made benioff and other tech entrepreneurs billionaires many times over that s why benioff along with some of his tech peers and civic leaders say it s time for corporations in general and tech companies specifically to contribute financially toward fixing a problem that looms large from seattle to boston activists meanwhile warn that housing stock has lagged so severely in some cities that even huge infusions of cash will struggle to make an impact san francisco s woes are particularly acute its housing stock is a quarter of its need which has led to real estate prices that are among the highest in the nation some 15 000 tech positions were added in the city in 2016 and 2017 according to a report from brokerage firm cbre seattle another tech hub has experienced the same housing deficit phenomenon all while local tech powerhouses amazon and microsoft helped create 33 000 new tech jobs in 2016 and 2017 the cbre report says and as amazon moves into northern virginia and apple into austin local lawmakers and housing experts there are keeping careful watch on how an explosion of technology jobs will hit their communities across the nation the influx of high paying jobs in areas with limited housing has sent housing prices soaring for local residents since 2010 median home values in san francisco have doubled to 1 37 million according to zillow seattle and boston also doubled to 730 000 and 600 000 respectively austin jumped from 212 000 to 364 000 in that time period benioff whose family has been in san francisco for generations says more foresight should have gone into managing the tech explosion there s been really poor planning in our state and our cities benioff says with measured anger look at paris they build social housing into their city he says you can have an amazing economy with high end residences but also accommodate everyone you just have to plan for all income types the government has to step in and companies have to help more tiny homes are popping up across us here s how they could help affordable housing crisis more the 10 cities with the best public transportation the housing crisis must be addressed by a careful collaboration between politicians advocacy groups and corporate entities says corianne scally principal research associate with the urban institute in washington d c there is no magic solution says scally companies need to understand the pressure they are creating particularly when taxes levied on them aren t covering their impact when you take into account the tax incentives that they get for setting up shop some already digging deep many tech giants say they are already reaching into their pockets to fund affordable housing solutions google has donated 3 million toward homelessness solutions being proposed by san francisco mayor london breed a spokesperson for the search giant said it had granted over 250 million since 2014 in the areas of homelessness economic opportunity and education in mid january microsoft revealed that it was going to allocate 500 million toward housing initiatives around its seattle area headquarters in a blog post trumpeting the news microsoft president brad smith and cfo amy hood said the move was spurred by a realization that this is a big problem and it s a problem that s only going to get worse microsoft said because jobs have grown 21 percent since 2011 while housing has only expanded by 13 percent the company would be investing 225 million toward building middle income housing 250 million to support low incoming housing and 25 million in grants to help those tackling homelessness issues about a week after microsoft laid out its plan a san francisco corporate consortium calling itself partnership for the bay area s future announced it was halfway toward a goal of raising 540 million the partnership s investment fund is aimed at providing financial assistance toward a goal of building 8 000 new housing units across the bay area in the coming years its policy fund will support initiatives to preserve and expand housing with a particular focus on strengthening low income tenant protections to guard against landlords evicting low income renters so they can charge higher rates preserving affordable housing also is a mission of newly installed california gov gavin newsom who has made housing a top priority he recently sued the southern california city of huntington beach for resisting efforts to build affordable housing ultimately civic leaders and some tech leaders warn that ignoring housing issues is bad for business san francisco s homeless problem already has caused some companies to plan lucrative conventions elsewhere and an inviting urban core also is considered a key recruiting tool a place like the bay area is very diverse and vibrant which is why companies want to be here and hire here says caitlyn fox director of justice and opportunity for the chan zuckerberg initiative the foundation started by facebook founder mark zuckerberg and his wife priscilla chan the foundation is part of the new partnership for the bay area s future along with facebook the ford foundation genentech morgan stanley and others we all came to the bay area because of its promise and now we have a stake to ensure that promise remains for all says fox because that s being threatened will amazon match microsoft it is not uncommon for tech companies flush with cash to create programs aimed at placating communities where they operate apple which put 70 million into transit infrastructure and affordable housing around its new billion dollar headquarters in cupertino california a few years ago also said it had contributed to 1 8 million to area bike lanes apple also said that in 2018 its employees donated more than 125 million to non profits around the world representatives at the iphone maker would not say whether it has plans to work with local officials on housing issues including in texas where apple s plan to build by 2021 a new 133 acre campus in austin would make it the largest private employer in the city in seattle amazon said it has donated 40 million to mary s place a local homeless shelter working with the non profit amazon has created two temporary homeless shelters on its campus which will become permanent in 2020 but amazon also has come under heavy fire for contributing to rising inequality in seattle as well as for successfully killing a head count tax on employees 275 per worker on companies making more that 20 million a year that would have raised money partly for affordable housing when microsoft announced their news the feeling here was ok amazon what are you going to do says jeff shulman a marketing professor at the university of washington who has been studying amazon s impact on seattle s growth shulman notes that amazon has been good for the area not only in terms of tech jobs but also jobs at every level particular in terms of people moving here to serve amazon employees but he adds such cafeteria workers janitors teachers child care workers increasingly find themselves priced out of the areas in which they work resulting in endless commutes along clogged roads tech companies need to lure talent and for those employees quality of life includes where they live how they get to work where their kids go to school and even cultural amenities but the housing crunch is pushing all but those paid big tech salaries far away says shulman and just recently amazon abruptly pulled out of plans to build part of its new headquarters in the queens borough of new york city after politicians and activists there raised questions about the company s financial commitment to the region while receiving 3 billion in subsidies real estate agents in new york had already starting seeing evidence of an amazon effect on prices just as a result of the announcement that the everything store tech behemoth was moving to new york and virginia michelle winters executive director of the alliance for housing solutions in northern virginia says so far amazon has not said how it plans to help beyond bringing thousands of jobs to the area she remains optimistic but fears the worst you could have dual impacts says winters one is the immediate local impact near campus where there might be a large scale displacement of residents who have been there for generations and the other is a broader regional impact where affordable homes are only available in outlying area with a negative impact on traffic that creates a poorer quality of life in san francisco fernando marti co director of the council for community housing organizations a non profit that crafts affordable housing public policy says he is grateful for the newfound corporate focus on the housing crisis but is also skeptical about whether the gestures are too little too late marti points out that for one thing in the bay area even 500 million doesn t go far consider that at an average home building cost of 300 per square foot a new 1 500 square foot home would cost 450 000 to construct that means 500 million would only build 1 111 new homes i remain optimistic that more will be done by these companies says marti it s all tied together in the end housing and education and quality of life and all of that if not resolved affects their ability to do business most can t afford california indeed the california dream is proving increasingly elusive especially for younger residents a recent quinnipiac university poll indicated that 43 percent of california voters said they couldn t afford life in the state while 61 percent of 18 to 34 years old living in the world s fifth largest economy said it was beyond their means in silicon valley s backyard only high end housing needs in san francisco have been met over the past four years ending in 2017 according to casa the committee to house the bay area in contrast over the same period low income and middle income housing demand outstripped new housing supply four to one one solution may well be to leverage technology itself to make housing construction more affordable that s the mission of factory os a new company os stands for off site just north of san francisco that takes an automotive assembly line approach to building os builds apartments in its factory at around a 30 percent costs savings over on site construction factory os already has an order from 300 small apartments from google which is looking to add short term accommodation options for employees who come to its mountain view california headquarters to work on projects company ceo rick holliday says he was forced to innovate due to the pressures he s facing from the very housing shortage he s hoping to alleviate we re in a mess and part of the issue is my own labor shortage says holliday who said between unaffordable bay area housing and younger workers not getting into building trades he has lost 30 percent of his workforce in recent years we need to tackle hard costs and get more housing out of those dollars he says tackle those costs get sacramento politicians engaged and ask tech companies to engage you do those three things and you might make a dent more think the gender pay gap is bad women in tech face an equity gap and it s even worse more diversifying tech black professionals are finding success in spite of the odds tech leaders are far from reaching a consensus on how and even whether to pay for affordable housing benioff for example was a huge backer of san francisco s proposition c which passed in november it stipulates that any company with revenues over 50 million would be charged 0 5 percent on income over that mark so if you pull in 55 million one year you d be assessed 25 000 in prop c taxes while that s a small amount for many of the roughly 400 area companies affected by the law supporters estimate that the city will be able to collect around 300 million a year from the tax that money would go toward 1 000 new beds for the city s homeless and also over time allot 150 million to 4 000 new housing units dedicated to lower income families but the san francisco chamber of commerce along with some tech entrepreneurs opposed the measure arguing that the tax could drive companies away from san francisco benioff and twitter founder jack dorsey even got into an online feud over the matter with dorsey predicting that smaller companies would get disproportionately hurt by the measure the city has started to collect these taxes but nothing has yet been distributed because the measure is facing a court challenge as it did not pass by a two thirds majority benioff hails proposition c is an example of how big change can come from public private partnerships ultimately however he said a solution can t be reached if multi billion dollar tech companies don t see pitching in on housing as a fundamental part of their corporate responsibility homelessness is my number one priority says benioff it s about getting san francisco cleaned up again follow usa today national correspondent marcodellacava
there is a very good chance that the united states would strike a deal with china to end their trade war said us president donald trump adding that he was inclined to extend his march 1 tariff deadline and meet soon with chinese president xi jinping us and chinese negotiators had made progress and will extend this week s round of negotiations by two days through sunday trump told reporters at the white house as he met with his top negotiators and their counterpart chinese vice premier liu he i think that we both feel there s a very good chance a deal will happen trump said liu agreed there had been great progress from china we believe that it is very likely that it will happen and we hope that ultimately we ll have a deal and the chinese side is ready to make our utmost effort he said at the white house the republican president said he probably would meet with xi in march in florida to decide on the most important terms of a trade deal extending the deadline would put on hold trump s threatened tariff increase to 25 from 10 on 200 billion of chinese imports into the united states that would prevent a further escalation in a trade war that already has disrupted commerce in goods worth hundreds of billions of dollars slowed global economic growth and roiled markets optimism that the two sides will find a way to end the trade war lifted stocks especially technology shares the s p 500 stock index reached its highest closing level since november 8 oil prices rose to their highest since mid november with brent crude reaching a high of 67 73 a barrel trump and treasury secretary steven mnuchin said the two sides had reached an agreement on currency trump declined to provide details but us officials long have expressed concerns that china s yuan is undervalued giving china a trade advantage and partly offsetting us tariffs announcement of a pact aimed at limiting yuan depreciation was putting the currency cart before the trade horse but would likely be positive for asian emerging market currencies said alan ruskin global head of currency strategy at deutsche bank in new york how can you agree to avoid excessive chinese yuan depreciation or volatility if you have not made an agreement on trade that could have huge fx implications ruskin asked in a note to clients trump said a deal with china may extend beyond trade to encompass chinese telecommunications companies huawei technologies and zte corp published in the express tribune february 24 2019 like business on facebook follow tribunebiz on twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation
published sunday 24 february 2019 print disqus dramatic weakening missing inversion no credit stress not going global the rest of the story i m an american pat caddell rip dallas athens and houston an old joke says economists predicted 15 of the last 10 recessions in other words they re frequently wrong and often too pessimistic i think it s not so simple every recession prediction is eventually correct some just get the timing wrong that s because so long as we have a business cycle a recession is always coming the only question is when it will strike there s also some dispute about what exactly counts as recession the usual definition is two consecutive quarters of falling real gdp but as i ve written gdp itself is a nebulous statistic with substantial margin of error we can never be quite sure my own outlook has been consistent the current growth phase is getting old and will end as they all do but we probably have another year or so that is about as far out as my data reads can actually give us any statistical confidence macro events like federal reserve error trade war ugly brexit and others could hasten the decline but as of now the us and the developed world seem likely to sustain at least mild growth through 2019 that doesn t mean we rest easy it means we have time to prepare for the worse conditions that we know are coming how much time that will be today s topic as we review some recent analysis first a quick invitation my personal physician at the cleveland clinic dr mike roizen is holding a private conference call with chris wood of health wealth research they ll be discussing the nine supplements mike says can help you age proof yourself maybe you would like to join me and others in taking them your health is important so take this opportunity seriously the call is on february 28 and you can click here to reserve your free spot now let s review the recession forecast dramatic weakening recession antennae everywhere popped up on february 14 when the commerce department reported retail sales fell 1 2 in december it was the worst month over month decline since 2009 chart bloomberg now there are reasons to doubt this report s significance it came out four weeks later than scheduled due to the government shutdown and thus is more subject to revision than normal it also conflicts with private sector data like redbook which climbed sharply in december and even if the data is right this is only one month and one month doesn t make a trend nevertheless retails sales are an important input to recession models like the atlanta fed s gdpnow that model s estimate for q4 2018 instantly plunged from 2 7 just two weeks earlier to 1 5 ugh that will be a dramatic weakening if the final q4 gdp report confirms it but i doubt it will i think this report is a glitch and will fade away as other data supersedes it but even if it s right 1 5 gdp growth isn t a recession it would mean 2018 was an okay though not spectacular year and a recession call by definition is at least six months away since it takes two negative gdp quarters to mark one this illustrates an important point the recession outlook is a moving target it changes as we get new data forecasts should change with it and i don t blame anyone who lets new information change their mind it might make me trust them even more missing inversion i trust dave rosenberg of gluskin sheff enough to make him a perpetual sic speaker and he has been my leadoff hitter on the first morning for at least 10 years but at the moment we disagree dave is screaming recession every chance he gets which for him is every business day in his breakfast with dave letters but he is not a perma bear by any means he s been bullish at the right times in the past so i pay attention even if i m not convinced i should note he turned uber bullish nine or 10 years ago announcing his new forecast at my conference it was way outside the consensus at the time but dave has never cared much about being part of the consensus dave summarized his argument in a letter last month over my shoulder members can read it here weeks before the retail sales report knocked the legs out of more bullish outlooks if that data holds up he s going to look more prescient than most his key points make a great launching pad for discussion about the probabilities of recession this letter will be more like a back and forth between rosie and i when we are together i hope you enjoy our conversation my comments are in brackets his points are in italics his key points we are now in month 115 of the current expansion double the post ww2 norm and five months from becoming the longest ever the yield curve doesn t have to completely invert for a recession call it barely did so the last two times stocks appear to have peaked last fall average lead time from market peak to business cycle peak is seven months fed policy changes are coming too late it already overtightened as it did so often in the past rosenberg thinks neutral fed funds rate is no more than 1 75 so the last two hikes were missteps recessions historically begin when the unemployment rate climbs 0 4 percentage points above its cycle low which this time seems to have been 3 7 so 4 1 unemployment when it happens should ring an alarm bell the recession will probably be mild but there is no correlation between a recession s severity and how far equity markets decline this time the bubble is on corporate balance sheets as firms borrowed money at historically low rates instead of productive use much of the borrowing went to share buybacks this did nothing to cover future debt servicing costs while many focus on high yield the leveraged loan market is in a bubble of its own a key risk for this year is a debt refinancing tsunami as trillions in debt has to be rolled over at higher rates share buybacks and capital spending will be curtailed as cash flow falls while wages and debt servicing costs rise a 35 decline in stocks would be typical for this kind of recession though rosenberg thinks some non cyclical and defensive names could outperform to zero in further i think the main question is whether the fed stayed hawkish too long as dave thinks or is loosening up in time to keep the economy growing we don t know yet for that matter we don t know if they are turning dovish we only know they re talking about ending the rate hikes and or ending the balance sheet reductions the fomc meets again march 19 20 so whatever they do then should tell us more and if the economy perks up the fed can talk about more tightening later in the year no credit stress canaccord genuity analysts tony dwyer and michael welch differ from rosenberg and outlined their own case in a february 13 macro strategy note titled still no recession in sight dwyer and welch concede all the big question marks slowing growth brexit trade war and so on their conclusion is these will make the fed even more dovish than it would otherwise have been they think the fed can do this because four factors will forestall recession quoting from their note nfib small biz optimism index cycle peaks offer long runway clearly survey based indicators have seen sharp declines from their respective august 2018 peak which makes sense given the q4 18 market crash and early year us government shutdown the good news is the cycle peak in the nfib small business optimism indices historically leads recession by a median 41 months it is even longer if you use the last three credit driven cycles credit stress indicators never even budged as market swooned it is hard to have a credit crisis when there aren t any signs of credit stress again we turn to the chicago fed s national financial conditions subindices that measure 105 indicators of credit stress in banking shadow banking and the financial markets these subindices barely moved suggesting a fear based market event rather than a sign of a coming credit crisis driven recession figure 3 source canaccord genuity if rosie is right and the fed has already tightened too much we should see it in credit conditions we don t at least not yet credit is still available to businesses that need it although at higher rates in some cases that s not all bad it might mean fewer zombie companies haunting the economy the question is whether their demise will cause other damage we shall see not going global so far we ve talked about the us economy but no country is an island anymore all are exposed more or less to the greater world economy so let s look overseas in italy the recession argument is over because they are officially in one that got lost in other news but it really is happening the italian economy shrank 0 2 in the fourth quarter following 0 1 growth in q3 that is about as mild as a recession can be but it counts germany may not be far behind europe s largest economy contracted 0 2 in last year s third quarter reports suggest the fourth quarter was no better and possibly worse meanwhile in asia china is not in recession and nowhere near one if we believe government data much depends on how or if the country resolves trade disputes with the us as of now a comprehensive agreement still looks elusive but trump appears willing to extend the march 1 deadline for another tariff hike the uncertainty isn t good but it s better than a major trade war looking internally at china we all want to know how long beijing can sustain such amazing growth rates gavekal s chen long wrote in a report this week that china s credit cycle appears to be turning back up after a few rough months he sees solid bank lending and a recovery in the shadow banking sector contributing to overall credit growth this typically leads economic growth by 6 9 months suggesting the chinese economy could be back on firmer ground by this fall again all this is subject to macro risks all bets are off if china weakens too much or the uk makes a hard brexit as of now however nothing is exploding in a way that would set off a worldwide recession that suggests 2019 may not be a great year in the markets but it won t be a terrible year either things could certainly be worse the rest of the story one of my top challenges in writing these letters is knowing when to stop there s a fine line between telling the full story and making the letter too long to read fortunately i have a solution over my shoulder my membership service that gives you some of the most interesting research that crosses my screen each week often it s the source material behind thoughts from the frontline literally the rest of the story over my shoulder members already saw in full some of the research i mentioned in this letter including dave rosenberg s recession outlook yield curve analysis by michael lebowitz canaccord genuity s reasons recession isn t near china s credit cycle turns from gavekal better yet we gave members all that research to read at their leisure and a quick summary of each written by my master of brevity co editor patrick watson this keeps members informed without overwhelming them over my shoulder membership normally costs 14 95 month but

best economic and financial research from many different sources click here to join me i m an american pat caddell rip source wikimedia commons i learned in emails from several close friends a few mornings ago my friend pat caddell had passed away i will miss him as will many others he added so much to the national conversation i had pat on an evening panel with neil howe and steve moore at last year s strategic investment conference we were talking politics in the country i forget what the actual topic of the moment was but regarding some particular policy backed by democrats i turned to pat and said something like i thought you would agree that s your team isn t it he looked at me and without hesitation said i don t have a team i m not a democrat i m not a republican i m an american the applause and shouts were stunning i sat up and took note because he was absolutely right i ve tried to keep that exact same frame of mind ever since i think a lot of people in the audience came away with a change in focus hamilton jordan chairman of the 1976 jimmy carter presidential campaign attributed their victory in great part to caddell he was involved with many campaigns but he gravitated to change agents thus he worked for trump in the last election pat and i became friends at that conference and then stayed in close touch over the phone i talked to him about two weeks ago he was slated to appear again at this year s conference talking about the 2020 election cycle he was quite passionate and totally involved the country and those of us who called him friend are going to truly miss him he was one of a kind the new york times ran a great obituary for those of you who are interested maybe we can all join pat in saying i m not a democrat i m not a republican i m an american he would like that to be his legacy dallas athens and houston shane and i fly to dallas tomorrow to begin moving our furniture to either puerto rico or a new smaller apartment that will be our texas base the sale of my other apartment should close next friday monday night i will be in athens texas for an ashford inc board meeting then wednesday morning i fly to houston to meet with smh and then on thursday with the rise economic council at rice university then back to dallas to help shane move us and back on a plane the next day to return to puerto rico i m going to hit the send button as thinking about pat caddell doesn t have me in the mood to tell any personal stories so let me wish you a great week as we all need to spend more time with our friends and family

via casey research justin s note are billionaires bad many americans on the left are asking themselves this question and alexandria ocasio cortez the democrat s new rising star is certainly no exception just look at what aoc said in a recent interview it s not to say someone like bill gates for example or warren buffett are immoral people i do not believe that i do think a system that allows billionaires to exist when there are parts of alabama where people are still getting ringworm because they don t have access to public health is wrong aoc of course isn t alone two weeks ago the huffington post published a piece titled should billionaires even exist the new york times followed up a few days later when it ran a similar piece titled abolish billionaires in short class warfare is no longer just a radical leftist idea it s gone mainstream to figure out what s behind this i got doug casey on the phone below is a transcript of that conversation justin doug class warfare is heating up in the united states and billionaires are getting the worst of it so far what do you make of this are billionaires as bad as the left says should they be allowed to exist or is that a policy failure doug well i ve said for years that the time to eat the rich would come that is of course a very bad thing here s a fact most people who are rich got that way because they re smart productive hard working and virtuous most people who are poor suffer from stupidity sloth and bad habits yes i know saying that is extremely un pc and smacks of calvinism i m very aware that some rich people are swine who stole their wealth and in today s world where the government is involved in everything and is expected to be a cornucopia increasing numbers got it by being cronies i m also very aware that there are some righteous poor who suffer from bad luck nor can everyone be helen keller or the who s tommy the deaf dumb and blind kid who nevertheless played a mean pinball that said bad luck tends to afflict the unprepared but that s another discussion the intense hostility towards the rich combined with the visceral hatred between red and blue parts of the country tells me that we re moving into a time similar to that before the french revolution or the war between the states or maybe the russian revolution and this trend is accelerating it s going to be very tumultuous for reasons i ve spelt out in past interviews it s said there are about 2 200 billionaires in the world about a quarter of them in the u s but i m sure there are many more that keep themselves under the radar certainly those who made a killing in drugs politics or other criminal activity politicians and the rich have always feathered each other s nests since government today is far far more powerful and intrusive than ever before the rich are more inclined than ever to curry favor with politicians and politicians are equally anxious to cozy up with the rich it s much easier to get a few checks with lots of zeroes after the dollar sign than cadging nickels and dimes from the unwashed many billionaires are wealthy largely because they re cronies all of them have benefited from being connected to the firehose of money created by the fed they receive favors from the government they re granted government contracts licenses monopolies and the like frankly they deserve to be eaten but those are exactly the ones who are safest the rich can make massive campaign contributions to politicians in the present and it s understood that they ll assist in paying huge speaking fees consulting fees book deals directorships seven figure employment sweetheart investment deals and the like after the pol is out of office in our interview on aoc i said she was already well on her way to her hundred million dollars she ll get that but not the traditional way with briefcases stuffed with 100 bills that no longer works in the u s because of onerous bank regulations money laundering laws and the decreasing utility of cash in addition the u s is still a relatively high trust society government officials are reasonably comfortable waiting a few years for a fat payoff it s different in the third world where trust is very limited and payoffs tend to be in cash on the barrelhead justin sure but not every billionaire exists because of government handouts right doug of course many billionaires are wealthy because they ve created immense wealth for the common man the average human should worship creative billionaires for vastly increasing his standard of living instead they prefer to apotheosize political figures and actors who throughout history have been classed with prostitutes con men and professional liars mass media and the leisure economy have inverted many traditional values the problem is that humans are essentially chimpanzees and i don t mean the gentle bonobo either as individuals they can be quite rational but they immediately fall to the lowest common denominator if you put them together it s easy to get them to hooting and panting anxious to tear apart some real or imagined enemy and a lot of that has to do with envy a much nastier vice than simple jealousy or covetousness jealousy says you have it i want it i ll take it from you that s understandable it s how the world has worked for at least 500 million years since animal life arose envy however says you have it i want it i ll not only take it from you but i ll hurt you for having it and if i can t have it i ll destroy it so you can t have it either one chimpanzee has a bunch of fat appetizing grubs and the other chimpanzees well represented by all the democrats running for president are chock full of envy i m afraid that s just the way things are on planet earth today not just with chimps but even more so with humans it s well known that earth s twenty or whatever richest people control about half of the planet s wealth and half of the people on earth have approximately nothing that doesn t seem fair an extremely dangerous word when we re talking politics so it s perfectly natural for the poor chimpanzees to try and take it away from the rich chimps they ll use the time tested method of violence in some places but the political process is a much lower risk way to get what you want if you re incapable of creating something and trading they ll vote for someone who promises to give them free stuff and even things out make things more fair that s what happened in venezuela it s what happened in zimbabwe it happens constantly in africa although sometimes things get a bit out of control as they did in rwanda twenty years ago where you ll recall a million folks were hacked up with machetes it s happened in scores of countries in just the last century it can happen anywhere the united states is no exception in fact it s starting to happen here right now justin yeah all this hate directed at billionaires and support for things like wealth taxes tells me the u s is moving closer to full blown socialism with each passing day doug well this term socialism is bandied around constantly however very few people know what it actually means let s define a few words if you can t define a word precisely then you can t really understand what you re talking about i m afraid that s true of 90 of people add to that the fact that they don t actually think they feel no wonder tempers run high when either politics or economics are discussed we revert to mimicking our cousins the chimps karl marx defined socialism as a system where the means of production farms mines schools hospitals factories and the like are owned by the people which is to say by the state socialism is supposed to be a temporary stage on the way to communism communism is a system where not only the means of production are owned by the state but where consumer goods are also common property under socialism consumer goods like cars houses retail stores handicrafts are still privately owned this ties into what fascism is another term often used descriptively but never defined fascism has nothing to do with jackboots and black uniforms those can be a part of any statist system again if you don t define words properly and precisely it means that you don t know what you re talking about let me define fascism it s an economic system where both the means of production and consumer goods are privately owned but very important they re totally regulated by the state in today s world the only real socialist countries are north korea and cuba every other country in the world is fascist in the sense that both the means of production and consumer goods are privately owned but are all regulated controlled by the state justin so you don t think there are any capitalist countries in the world doug no capitalism is a system where everything is not only privately owned but it s totally privately controlled in other words the state has no intervention or influence in the economy at all capitalism doesn t exist anywhere in the world today justin and yet people blame capitalism for all of today s problems i don t just mean some people distaste for capitalism has gone mainstream at this point there s no doubt in my mind that the democrats will rally around eating the rich during the next presidential race doug no question about it we re on the cusp of a cultural revolution not dissimilar to what china went through between the mid sixties and the mid seventies and it could totally overthrow america s most important traditions the u s has been mutating on its way to becoming another country for a long time it used to be unique and exceptional now it s just another nation state like the 200 others covering the face of the globe like a skin disease it s a major trend and cultural civilizational trends usually accelerate until they reach a crisis the thing is that most people have no understanding of economics why because economics is an intellectual matter and people are not interested in intellectual arguments they re only interested in emotional arguments justin in what sense doug the key is the difference between think and feel those words are used interchangeably which is absolutely wrong and part of the problem people don t think which means using logic reason and solid fact what they do is feel using emotion stray anecdotes and gut impressions they dramatize their buried psychological aberrations they have very nebulous undefined notions of right and wrong one thing that s for sure though they re interested in feeling like they re the good guys they want to be on the right side the moral side of issues everybody likes to feel god s on his side it doesn t matter whether it s yahweh jesus allah krishna odin or crom here s the critical thing the socialists have positioned themselves as the good guys the ones doing the moral thing and nobody with the exception of ayn rand and libertarians has ever defended capitalism on a moral basis which is actually the way it should be defended but their arguments are intellectual not emotional so they re totally lost on the average chimp the republicans are completely worthless less than worthless in this battle they re an active liability at best they make a weak effort to defend the free market based on the fact that it s productive and efficient but that s not going to cut it no wonder they re viewed correctly in my view as weak kneed sellouts hypocrites and moral cripples the average person is going to go for what he thinks is socialism because he wants to feel that he s doing the right thing i m afraid the battle is completely lost at this point the only way to change course is through intellectual arguments that s supposed to happen in school but perversely that s where arguments for socialism are made instead the average person just gets the bottom line socialist values are good and right i ll tell you what they want they want free housing free medical care free schooling free food and if it s not completely free then it should at least be subsidized they want to be taken care of what they really want is a fascist welfare state why so they can still own stocks and maybe get wealthy socialism is just kind of a buzzword for free stuff for the fascist welfare state people don t really care who owns the means of production they think stuff is produced magically justin yeah it is quite remarkable how people pin so much blame on capitalism while ignoring the fact that socialism has destroyed entire economies countless times doug and it will happen again it will ultimately result in the collapse of the economy producers will decide to hell with it i m not going to bother it s not worth it i don t want to be a milk cow for a considerable number of people it s going to be more trouble than it s worth to produce when you account for all the aggravation the risks and hard work that goes into being an entrepreneur anyway it s kind of fun having a guaranteed annual income and binging on a tv series all day is a new dark age possible of course anything is possible on both the upside and the downside there are of course some reasons for optimism one is that the average person notwithstanding socialist rhetoric and welfare state benefits is wired like a squirrel to produce more than he consumes and save the rest which creates capital another is technology which believe it or not has been advancing at the rate of moore s law for about 200 000 years it s possible that technology in the form of artificial intelligence nanotech biotech and such can advance quickly enough to create new wealth faster than stupid ideas can destroy it perhaps only a generation or two from now robots will produce everything that people need that s possible though unlikely in the short term what s more likely is that stupid ideas which also seem to be gaining ground at an exponential rate will destroy immense amounts of capital perhaps enough that there won t be sufficient pools of capital to conduct science and build new technology these things are highly capital intensive today we need large pools of capital to keep advancing the kind of pools that hated billionaires shepherd and make grow if socialists succeed in making it impossible or perhaps just unpalatable and apparently anti social to become a billionaire you re not going to have the pools of capital to keep science and technology advancing the economy and society will fall apart that s what destroyed the ussr and mao s china it s possible that we could be facing either the singularity or a new dark age i don t know which it will be it s a toss up maybe both in different areas but the best predictor isn t going to be think tanks it will be science fiction there will be political ramifications i fully expect the republican party to break up into at least two but that s a subject for a different discussion however the most degraded ignorant misguided and unintelligent people are those rising to the top in the democratic party which incidentally is also going to break into at least two pieces just wait until the u s economy collapses later this year now i know i ve been very premature on this call but i m convinced it s imminent when that happens people will start losing their houses they re going to have their cars repossessed even if they don t lose their jobs they ll be unable to service all their debts they re going to go wild things will get ugly could we have a real civil war as you know i m prone to look at the bright side since half of the country is on prozac ritalin xanax and 50 other psychiatric drugs and the other half is glued to their video screens maybe people will give fighting a pass justin i hope i m outside of the states when that happens like you i d much rather watch this play out on the television preferably in a country where things are more stable doug yeah but joe

san francisco from atop his gleaming new headquarters salesforce ceo marc benioff has an inspirational view of mountains the bay and an endless pacific ocean but when benioff looks down he s not so happy some 60 floors below his salesforce tower offices is what he calls an inequality train wreck city streets out of control with thousands of homeless and often infirm citizens who have rendered sidewalks a landmine of feces and drug paraphernalia many have been destitute for years but others are newly minted refugees of a housing crisis created in large part by the very technology boom that has made benioff and other tech entrepreneurs billionaires many times over that s why benioff along with some of his tech peers and civic leaders say it s time for corporations in general and tech companies specifically to contribute financially toward fixing a problem that looms large from seattle to boston activists meanwhile warn that housing stock has lagged so severely in some cities that even huge infusions of cash will struggle to make an impact san francisco s woes are particularly acute its housing stock is a quarter of its need which has led to real estate prices that are among the highest in the nation some 15 000 tech positions were added in the city in 2016 and 2017 according to a report from brokerage firm cbre seattle another tech hub has experienced the same housing deficit phenomenon all while local tech powerhouses amazon and microsoft helped create 33 000 new tech jobs in 2016 and 2017 the cbre report says and as amazon moves into northern virginia and apple into austin local lawmakers and housing experts there are keeping careful watch on how an explosion of technology jobs will hit their communities across the nation the influx of high paying jobs in areas with limited housing has sent housing prices soaring for local residents since 2010 median home values in san francisco have doubled to 1 37 million according to zillow seattle and boston also doubled to 730 000 and 600 000 respectively austin jumped from 212 000 to 364 000 in that time period benioff whose family has been in san francisco for generations says more foresight should have gone into managing the tech explosion there s been really poor planning in our state and our cities benioff says with measured anger look at paris they build social housing into their city he says you can have an amazing economy with high end residences but also accommodate everyone you just have to plan for all income types the government has to step in and companies have to help more tiny homes are popping up across us here s how they could help affordable housing crisis more the 10 cities with the best public transportation the housing crisis must be addressed by a careful collaboration between politicians advocacy groups and corporate entities says corianne scally principal research associate with the urban institute in washington d c there is no magic solution says scally companies need to understand the pressure they are creating particularly when taxes levied on them aren t covering their impact when you take into account the tax incentives that they get for setting up shop some already digging deep many tech giants say they are already reaching into their pockets to fund affordable housing solutions google has donated 3 million toward homelessness solutions being proposed by san francisco mayor london breed a spokesperson for the search giant said it had granted over 250 million since 2014 in the areas of homelessness economic opportunity and education in mid january microsoft revealed that it was going to allocate 500 million toward housing initiatives around its seattle area headquarters in a blog post trumpeting the news microsoft president brad smith and cfo amy hood said the move was spurred by a realization that this is a big problem and it s a problem that s only going to get worse microsoft said because jobs have grown 21 percent since 2011 while housing has only expanded by 13 percent the company would be investing 225 million toward building middle income housing 250 million to support low incoming housing and 25 million in grants to help those tackling homelessness issues about a week after microsoft laid out its plan a san francisco corporate consortium calling itself partnership for the bay area s future announced it was halfway toward a goal of raising 540 million the partnership s investment fund is aimed at providing financial assistance toward a goal of building 8 000 new housing units across the bay area in the coming years its policy fund will support initiatives to preserve and expand housing with a particular focus on strengthening low income tenant protections to guard against landlords evicting low income renters so they can charge higher rates preserving affordable housing also is a mission of newly installed california gov gavin newsom who has made housing a top priority he recently sued the southern california city of huntington beach for resisting efforts to build affordable housing ultimately civic leaders and some tech leaders warn that ignoring housing issues is bad for business san francisco s homeless problem already has caused some companies to plan lucrative conventions elsewhere and an inviting urban core also is considered a key recruiting tool a place like the bay area is very diverse and vibrant which is why companies want to be here and hire here says caitlyn fox director of justice and opportunity for the chan zuckerberg initiative the foundation started by facebook founder mark zuckerberg and his wife priscilla chan the foundation is part of the new partnership for the bay area s future along with facebook the ford foundation genentech morgan stanley and others we all came to the bay area because of its promise and now we have a stake to ensure that promise remains for all says fox because that s being threatened will amazon match microsoft it is not uncommon for tech companies flush with cash to create programs aimed at placating communities where they operate apple which put 70 million into transit infrastructure and affordable housing around its new billion dollar headquarters in cupertino california a few years ago also said it had contributed to 1 8 million to area bike lanes apple also said that in 2018 its employees donated more than 125 million to non profits around the world representatives at the iphone maker would not say whether it has plans to work with local officials on housing issues including in texas where apple s plan to build by 2021 a new 133 acre campus in austin would make it the largest private employer in the city in seattle amazon said it has donated 40 million to mary s place a local homeless shelter working with the non profit amazon has created two temporary homeless shelters on its campus which will become permanent in 2020 but amazon also has come under heavy fire for contributing to rising inequality in seattle as well as for successfully killing a head count tax on employees 275 per worker on companies making more that 20 million a year that would have raised money partly for affordable housing when microsoft announced their news the feeling here was ok amazon what are you going to do says jeff shulman a marketing professor at the university of washington who has been studying amazon s impact on seattle s growth shulman notes that amazon has been good for the area not only in terms of tech jobs but also jobs at every level particular in terms of people moving here to serve amazon employees but he adds such cafeteria workers janitors teachers child care workers increasingly find themselves priced out of the areas in which they work resulting in endless commutes along clogged roads tech companies need to lure talent and for those employees quality of life includes where they live how they get to work where their kids go to school and even cultural amenities but the housing crunch is pushing all but those paid big tech salaries far away says shulman and just recently amazon abruptly pulled out of plans to build part of its new headquarters in the queens borough of new york city after politicians and activists there raised questions about the company s financial commitment to the region while receiving 3 billion in subsidies real estate agents in new york had already starting seeing evidence of an amazon effect on prices just as a result of the announcement that the everything store tech behemoth was moving to new york and virginia michelle winters executive director of the alliance for housing solutions in northern virginia says so far amazon has not said how it plans to help beyond bringing thousands of jobs to the area she remains optimistic but fears the worst you could have dual impacts says winters one is the immediate local impact near campus where there might be a large scale displacement of residents who have been there for generations and the other is a broader regional impact where affordable homes are only available in outlying area with a negative impact on traffic that creates a poorer quality of life in san francisco fernando marti co director of the council for community housing organizations a non profit that crafts affordable housing public policy says he is grateful for the newfound corporate focus on the housing crisis but is also skeptical about whether the gestures are too little too late marti points out that for one thing in the bay area even 500 million doesn t go far consider that at an average home building cost of 300 per square foot a new 1 500 square foot home would cost 450 000 to construct that means 500 million would only build 1 111 new homes i remain optimistic that more will be done by these companies says marti it s all tied together in the end housing and education and quality of life and all of that if not resolved affects their ability to do business most can t afford california indeed the california dream is proving increasingly elusive especially for younger residents a recent quinnipiac university poll indicated that 43 percent of california voters said they couldn t afford life in the state while 61 percent of 18 to 34 years old living in the world s fifth largest economy said it was beyond their means in silicon valley s backyard only high end housing needs in san francisco have been met over the past four years ending in 2017 according to casa the committee to house the bay area in contrast over the same period low income and middle income housing demand outstripped new housing supply four to one one solution may well be to leverage technology itself to make housing construction more affordable that s the mission of factory os a new company os stands for off site just north of san francisco that takes an automotive assembly line approach to building os builds apartments in its factory at around a 30 percent costs savings over on site construction factory os already has an order from 300 small apartments from google which is looking to add short term accommodation options for employees who come to its mountain view california headquarters to work on projects company ceo rick holliday says he was forced to innovate due to the pressures he s facing from the very housing shortage he s hoping to alleviate we re in a mess and part of the issue is my own labor shortage says holliday who said between unaffordable bay area housing and younger workers not getting into building trades he has lost 30 percent of his workforce in recent years we need to tackle hard costs and get more housing out of those dollars he says tackle those costs get sacramento politicians engaged and ask tech companies to engage you do those three things and you might make a dent more think the gender pay gap is bad women in tech face an equity gap and it s even worse more diversifying tech black professionals are finding success in spite of the odds tech leaders are far from reaching a consensus on how and even whether to pay for affordable housing benioff for example was a huge backer of san francisco s proposition c which passed in november it stipulates that any company with revenues over 50 million would be charged 0 5 percent on income over that mark so if you pull in 55 million one year you d be assessed 25 000 in prop c taxes while that s a small amount for many of the roughly 400 area companies affected by the law supporters estimate that the city will be able to collect around 300 million a year from the tax that money would go toward 1 000 new beds for the city s homeless and also over time allot 150 million to 4 000 new housing units dedicated to lower income families but the san francisco chamber of commerce along with some tech entrepreneurs opposed the measure arguing that the tax could drive companies away from san francisco benioff and twitter founder jack dorsey even got into an online feud over the matter with dorsey predicting that smaller companies would get disproportionately hurt by the measure the city has started to collect these taxes but nothing has yet been distributed because the measure is facing a court challenge as it did not pass by a two thirds majority benioff hails proposition c is an example of how big change can come from public private partnerships ultimately however he said a solution can t be reached if multi billion dollar tech companies don t see pitching in on housing as a fundamental part of their corporate responsibility homelessness is my number one priority says benioff it s about getting san francisco cleaned up again follow usa today national correspondent marcodellacava

via casey research justin s note are billionaires bad many americans on the left are asking themselves this question and alexandria ocasio cortez the democrat s new rising star is certainly no exception just look at what aoc said in a recent interview it s not to say someone like bill gates for example or warren buffett are immoral people i do not believe that i do think a system that allows billionaires to exist when there are parts of alabama where people are still getting ringworm because they don t have access to public health is wrong aoc of course isn t alone two weeks ago the huffington post published a piece titled should billionaires even exist the new york times followed up a few days later when it ran a similar piece titled abolish billionaires in short class warfare is no longer just a radical leftist idea it s gone mainstream to figure out what s behind this i got doug casey on the phone below is a transcript of that conversation justin doug class warfare is heating up in the united states and billionaires are getting the worst of it so far what do you make of this are billionaires as bad as the left says should they be allowed to exist or is that a policy failure doug well i ve said for years that the time to eat the rich would come that is of course a very bad thing here s a fact most people who are rich got that way because they re smart productive hard working and virtuous most people who are poor suffer from stupidity sloth and bad habits yes i know saying that is extremely un pc and smacks of calvinism i m very aware that some rich people are swine who stole their wealth and in today s world where the government is involved in everything and is expected to be a cornucopia increasing numbers got it by being cronies i m also very aware that there are some righteous poor who suffer from bad luck nor can everyone be helen keller or the who s tommy the deaf dumb and blind kid who nevertheless played a mean pinball that said bad luck tends to afflict the unprepared but that s another discussion the intense hostility towards the rich combined with the visceral hatred between red and blue parts of the country tells me that we re moving into a time similar to that before the french revolution or the war between the states or maybe the russian revolution and this trend is accelerating it s going to be very tumultuous for reasons i ve spelt out in past interviews it s said there are about 2 200 billionaires in the world about a quarter of them in the u s but i m sure there are many more that keep themselves under the radar certainly those who made a killing in drugs politics or other criminal activity politicians and the rich have always feathered each other s nests since government today is far far more powerful and intrusive than ever before the rich are more inclined than ever to curry favor with politicians and politicians are equally anxious to cozy up with the rich it s much easier to get a few checks with lots of zeroes after the dollar sign than cadging nickels and dimes from the unwashed many billionaires are wealthy largely because they re cronies all of them have benefited from being connected to the firehose of money created by the fed they receive favors from the government they re granted government contracts licenses monopolies and the like frankly they deserve to be eaten but those are exactly the ones who are safest the rich can make massive campaign contributions to politicians in the present and it s understood that they ll assist in paying huge speaking fees consulting fees book deals directorships seven figure employment sweetheart investment deals and the like after the pol is out of office in our interview on aoc i said she was already well on her way to her hundred million dollars she ll get that but not the traditional way with briefcases stuffed with 100 bills that no longer works in the u s because of onerous bank regulations money laundering laws and the decreasing utility of cash in addition the u s is still a relatively high trust society government officials are reasonably comfortable waiting a few years for a fat payoff it s different in the third world where trust is very limited and payoffs tend to be in cash on the barrelhead justin sure but not every billionaire exists because of government handouts right doug of course many billionaires are wealthy because they ve created immense wealth for the common man the average human should worship creative billionaires for vastly increasing his standard of living instead they prefer to apotheosize political figures and actors who throughout history have been classed with prostitutes con men and professional liars mass media and the leisure economy have inverted many traditional values the problem is that humans are essentially chimpanzees and i don t mean the gentle bonobo either as individuals they can be quite rational but they immediately fall to the lowest common denominator if you put them together it s easy to get them to hooting and panting anxious to tear apart some real or imagined enemy and a lot of that has to do with envy a much nastier vice than simple jealousy or covetousness jealousy says you have it i want it i ll take it from you that s understandable it s how the world has worked for at least 500 million years since animal life arose envy however says you have it i want it i ll not only take it from you but i ll hurt you for having it and if i can t have it i ll destroy it so you can t have it either one chimpanzee has a bunch of fat appetizing grubs and the other chimpanzees well represented by all the democrats running for president are chock full of envy i m afraid that s just the way things are on planet earth today not just with chimps but even more so with humans it s well known that earth s twenty or whatever richest people control about half of the planet s wealth and half of the people on earth have approximately nothing that doesn t seem fair an extremely dangerous word when we re talking politics so it s perfectly natural for the poor chimpanzees to try and take it away from the rich chimps they ll use the time tested method of violence in some places but the political process is a much lower risk way to get what you want if you re incapable of creating something and trading they ll vote for someone who promises to give them free stuff and even things out make things more fair that s what happened in venezuela it s what happened in zimbabwe it happens constantly in africa although sometimes things get a bit out of control as they did in rwanda twenty years ago where you ll recall a million folks were hacked up with machetes it s happened in scores of countries in just the last century it can happen anywhere the united states is no exception in fact it s starting to happen here right now justin yeah all this hate directed at billionaires and support for things like wealth taxes tells me the u s is moving closer to full blown socialism with each passing day doug well this term socialism is bandied around constantly however very few people know what it actually means let s define a few words if you can t define a word precisely then you can t really understand what you re talking about i m afraid that s true of 90 of people add to that the fact that they don t actually think they feel no wonder tempers run high when either politics or economics are discussed we revert to mimicking our cousins the chimps karl marx defined socialism as a system where the means of production farms mines schools hospitals factories and the like are owned by the people which is to say by the state socialism is supposed to be a temporary stage on the way to communism communism is a system where not only the means of production are owned by the state but where consumer goods are also common property under socialism consumer goods like cars houses retail stores handicrafts are still privately owned this ties into what fascism is another term often used descriptively but never defined fascism has nothing to do with jackboots and black uniforms those can be a part of any statist system again if you don t define words properly and precisely it means that you don t know what you re talking about let me define fascism it s an economic system where both the means of production and consumer goods are privately owned but very important they re totally regulated by the state in today s world the only real socialist countries are north korea and cuba every other country in the world is fascist in the sense that both the means of production and consumer goods are privately owned but are all regulated controlled by the state justin so you don t think there are any capitalist countries in the world we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us doug no capitalism is a system where everything is not only privately owned but it s totally privately controlled in other words the state has no intervention or influence in the economy at all capitalism doesn t exist anywhere in the world today justin and yet people blame capitalism for all of today s problems i don t just mean some people distaste for capitalism has gone mainstream at this point there s no doubt in my mind that the democrats will rally around eating the rich during the next presidential race doug no question about it we re on the cusp of a cultural revolution not dissimilar to what china went through between the mid sixties and the mid seventies and it could totally overthrow america s most important traditions the u s has been mutating on its way to becoming another country for a long time it used to be unique and exceptional now it s just another nation state like the 200 others covering the face of the globe like a skin disease it s a major trend and cultural civilizational trends usually accelerate until they reach a crisis the thing is that most people have no understanding of economics why because economics is an intellectual matter and people are not interested in intellectual arguments they re only interested in emotional arguments justin in what sense doug the key is the difference between think and feel those words are used interchangeably which is absolutely wrong and part of the problem people don t think which means using logic reason and solid fact what they do is feel using emotion stray anecdotes and gut impressions they dramatize their buried psychological aberrations they have very nebulous undefined notions of right and wrong one thing that s for sure though they re interested in feeling like they re the good guys they want to be on the right side the moral side of issues everybody likes to feel god s on his side it doesn t matter whether it s yahweh jesus allah krishna odin or crom here s the critical thing the socialists have positioned themselves as the good guys the ones doing the moral thing and nobody with the exception of ayn rand and libertarians has ever defended capitalism on a moral basis which is actually the way it should be defended but their arguments are intellectual not emotional so they re totally lost on the average chimp the republicans are completely worthless less than worthless in this battle they re an active liability at best they make a weak effort to defend the free market based on the fact that it s productive and efficient but that s not going to cut it no wonder they re viewed correctly in my view as weak kneed sellouts hypocrites and moral cripples the average person is going to go for what he thinks is socialism because he wants to feel that he s doing the right thing i m afraid the battle is completely lost at this point the only way to change course is through intellectual arguments that s supposed to happen in school but perversely that s where arguments for socialism are made instead the average person just gets the bottom line socialist values are good and right i ll tell you what they want they want free housing free medical care free schooling free food and if it s not completely free then it should at least be subsidized they want to be taken care of what they really want is a fascist welfare state why so they can still own stocks and maybe get wealthy socialism is just kind of a buzzword for free stuff for the fascist welfare state people don t really care who owns the means of production they think stuff is produced magically justin yeah it is quite remarkable how people pin so much blame on capitalism while ignoring the fact that socialism has destroyed entire economies countless times doug and it will happen again it will ultimately result in the collapse of the economy producers will decide to hell with it i m not going to bother it s not worth it i don t want to be a milk cow for a considerable number of people it s going to be more trouble than it s worth to produce when you account for all the aggravation the risks and hard work that goes into being an entrepreneur anyway it s kind of fun having a guaranteed annual income and binging on a tv series all day is a new dark age possible of course anything is possible on both the upside and the downside there are of course some reasons for optimism one is that the average person notwithstanding socialist rhetoric and welfare state benefits is wired like a squirrel to produce more than he consumes and save the rest which creates capital another is technology which believe it or not has been advancing at the rate of moore s law for about 200 000 years it s possible that technology in the form of artificial intelligence nanotech biotech and such can advance quickly enough to create new wealth faster than stupid ideas can destroy it perhaps only a generation or two from now robots will produce everything that people need that s possible though unlikely in the short term what s more likely is that stupid ideas which also seem to be gaining ground at an exponential rate will destroy immense amounts of capital perhaps enough that there won t be sufficient pools of capital to conduct science and build new technology these things are highly capital intensive today we need large pools of capital to keep advancing the kind of pools that hated billionaires shepherd and make grow if socialists succeed in making it impossible or perhaps just unpalatable and apparently anti social to become a billionaire you re not going to have the pools of capital to keep science and technology advancing the economy and society will fall apart that s what destroyed the ussr and mao s china it s possible that we could be facing either the singularity or a new dark age i don t know which it will be it s a toss up maybe both in different areas but the best predictor isn t going to be think tanks it will be science fiction there will be political ramifications i fully expect the republican party to break up into at least two but that s a subject for a different discussion however the most degraded ignorant misguided and unintelligent people are those rising to the top in the democratic party which incidentally is also going to break into at least two pieces just wait until the u s economy collapses later this year now i know i ve been very premature on this call but i m convinced it s imminent when that happens people will start losing their houses they re going to have their cars repossessed even if they don t lose their jobs they ll be unable to service all their debts they re going to go wild things will get ugly could we have a real civil war as you know i m prone to look at the bright side since half of the country is on prozac ritalin xanax and 50 other psychiatric drugs and the other half is glued to their video screens maybe people will give fighting a pass justin i hope i m outside of the states when that happens like you i d much rather watch this play out on the television preferably in a country where things are more stable doug yeah but joe louis was right you can run but you can t hide justin thanks for speaking with me today doug doug you re welcome
the us believes that with chinese growth slowing china s leaders are desperate for a deal to end the bilateral trade war regardless of when the current 90 day truce actually ends but the two economies longer term fundamentals compel a very different verdict about which side has the upper hand new haven us president donald trump s administration has underestimated china s resilience and strategic resolve with the chinese economy slowing the us believes that china is hurting and desperate for an end to the trade war but with ample policy space to address the current slowdown china s leadership has no need to abandon its longer term strategy while a cosmetic deal focused on bilateral trade appears to be in the offing the sharp contrast between the two economies fundamental underpinnings points to a very different verdict regarding who has the upper hand yes the chinese economy has weakened significantly in the past few months but contrary to us perceptions that this is due to its successful tariff strategy china s downturn has been largely self inflicted it was initially brought on by a deleveraging campaign aimed at neutralizing the mounting risks of debt intensive economic growth to their credit chinese policymakers have moved aggressively to avoid the dreaded japan syndrome not just a debt overhang but also a profusion of zombie companies and related productivity challenges largely as a result of this effort credit growth has moderated from around 16 at the start of 2016 to about 10 5 in late 2018 this has had marked repercussions for china s once powerful investment engine the largest component of the economy which has slowed from 20 growth in late 2013 to about 6 in late 2018 meanwhile the effects of us tariffs are only just starting to bite while exports to the us fell by about 3 year on year in december 2018 and january 2019 shipments to the rest of the world have continued to expand owing largely to resilience in emerging markets especially asia to the extent that exports may have been front loaded ahead of both the lunar new year holiday and potential further increases in us tariffs some fallback can be expected while that could temper near term prospects it is hard to pin the slowdown of the past few months on exports to hedge its risks china has been quick to exploit its intrinsic advantage much greater policy flexibility than western economies which have largely hit their limits on fiscal and monetary stimulus cutting reserve requirements five times in the past year has led to higher bank lending and a pick up in credit growth in early 2019 which should support an improvement in overall economic activity by midyear by contrast the us economy is more of a short term momentum story thanks to the outsize tax cuts of late 2017 economic growth picked up to about 3 in 2018 nearly one percentage point faster than the anemic 2 2 pace of the prior eight years but with fiscal stimulus fading gdp growth should follow suit consistent with the congressional budget office s latest projection of just a 2 3 rise in 2019 subscribe to ps digital subscribe to ps digital access every new ps commentary our entire on point suite of subscriber exclusive content including longer reads insider interviews big picture big question and say more and the full ps archive subscribe now risks of an even weaker outcome are mounting the rebound in us equity prices in early 2019 has not offset the sharp decline in late 2018 which took a heavy toll on household wealth and consumer confidence prompting an outsize decline in retail sales in december with jobless claims starting to inch higher the housing sector already weak the global economy on increasingly shaky ground and the federal reserve having limited ammunition the us economy s resilience looks increasingly tenuous the likelihood of contrasting economic growth trajectories a policy induced improvement in china and a policy constrained slowdown in the us reinforces a more serious mismatch of longer term fundamentals china s domestic saving rate in 2018 at 45 of gdp was nearly two and a half times the us rate of 18 7 although china s saving rate has fallen from its 2008 peak of 52 as consumer led rebalancing has prompted a shift from surplus saving to saving absorption it still has a cushion that the us would die for moreover fully 85 of america s gross saving goes toward replacement of obsolete and worn out capital stock adjusting for depreciation the us had a net national saving rate of just 3 in 2018 less than half the 6 3 average in the final three decades of the twentieth century and even further below the net saving position of china where the capital stock is considerably newer and in less need of replacement these saving disparities underscore a critical difference in the investment underpinnings of both economies growth potential china s investment was 44 of its gdp in 2018 more than double the 21 share in the us and given america s aging capital stock the disparity between the capacity enhancing net investment positions of the two economies is even wider that underscores china s relative advantage in funding its longer term growth imperatives such as urbanization investment in infrastructure human capital and research and development and the shift to indigenous innovation moreover the saving gap between america and china is likely to widen further in the years ahead as seemingly chronic us budget deficits push domestic saving even lower a further complication is that in funding its limited investment potential the us will require equally chronic current account deficits to augment depressed domestic saving and of course with the current account deficit comes an outsize multilateral trade deficit underscoring the weakest link of the pending trade deal reliance on a bilateral chinese fix for a far more insidious deficit problem with over 100 trading partners in the end economic strength is relative the us economy s current strength appears fleeting its short term resilience is already faltering and in view of worrisome long term fundamentals may fade further china is in the opposite position today s short term weakness should run its course by midyear against a backdrop of relatively solid longer term fundamentals this reality will come as a rude awakening to us negotiators who are misreading china s strength and the hollow benefits of a cosmetic trade deal

osisko gold royalties ltd nyse or q4 2018 results conference call february 21 2019 10 00 am et company participants sean roosen chairman and ceo bryan coates president elif levesque cfo and vp finance conference call participants dan rollins rbc capital markets kerry smith haywood operator good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the osisko gold royalties q4 and year end 2018 results conference call please note that this call is being recorded today february 21 2019 at 10 a m eastern time today on the call we have mr sean roosen chair of the board of directors and chief executive officer of osisko gold royalties mr bryan coates president of osisko gold royalties and ms elif levesque chief financial officer and vice president of finance i would now like to turn the meeting over to our host for today s call mr sean roosen sean roosen iâ ll ask everybody to look at the forward looking statements we will be going from the powerpoint that is on our website that is titled 2018 q4 and year end results and iâ m going to start on page three i want to make sure everybody has a look at the forward looking statement prior to that 2018 an interesting year in terms of market conditions gold price and a bit of a disconnect between capital markets and the commodity price here today weâ re enjoying an increased share price from last year weâ re currently trading around the c 14 50 rate up from a low of c 9 and change in 2018 highlights from q4 2018 starting with starting a little over 20 000 gold equivalent ounces earned in the fourth quarter revenue of c 30 7 million creating net cash flow from operating activities of c 18 6 million we did however take a write down on ã lã onore which resulted in a c 0 73 per share impairment and weâ ll talk more about that when we get into ã lã onore and weâ ll give you more details on that adjusted earnings for the year at c 13 million or c 0 08 per basic share overall for 2018 a record of just over 80 500 ounces produced with a significant margin of just under 90 record revenues of c 127 6 million cash flows again at an all time high of c 82 2 million the loss of course attributed to the property through the write down of c 105 6 million which is a special write down which weâ ll get into later we also repaid c 123 5 million on our revolving credit facility making that we are completely paid down with what we paid down in 2019 as well and we received c 159 4 million from pretium exploration to repay and purchase back the stream that we had acquired during the orion transaction in 2013 for a net profit to osisko shareholders of c 9 1 million so all in all a pretty good return considering the amount of time that we were invested we also acquired a 5 net smelter return on the eagle project owned by victoria in the yukon and weâ ll have a look at that a little bit later in the presentation another unsung item from 2018 was the amended renard stream where we invested an extra c 21 6 million and significant improved the economics to the osisko shareholders on that asset which weâ ll touch on in more detail we acquired a 1 75 royalty for c 20 million on the cariboo property held by barkerville gold increasing our overall net smelter return on that property to 4 we also have an option to increase it to 5 subsequent to december 31st we repaid the remaining c 30 million that was out on our revolver meaning that we now have a full c 450 million available to us on our revolver if required we acquired also 852 000 shares for c 10 2 million at an average price of c 11 95 of osisko common stock which will be cancelled and returned to treasury we declared a quarterly dividend of c 0 05 per common share payable on april 15 2019 and bringing us to the record date of march 29 2019 if you want to qualify for that dividend on page five production in terms of gold equivalent ounces in our guidance last year we significantly out performed in terms of our margins and we were mid of our guidance 80 553 ounces up from 58 933 ounces in 2017 our guidance for 2019 is 85 000 to 95 000 geos and weâ re looking for about an 88 operating margin making one of the highest in the sector we did achieve just under 90 margins in 2018 in terms of production mine production we saw our key asset which is the 5 top line royalty at canadian malartic performing well with the mine having produced just under 700 000 ounces at 697 200 ounces with gold attributable ounces of zero cost to osisko gold royalties of 35 400 ounces being a record royalty earner for us on that we would highlight that canadian malartic is canadaâ s largest gold mine and itâ s 14th in the world with cash costs in the first quartile running at c 579 an ounce and it is one of the worldâ s best mining jurisdictions being between val dâ or and rouyn noranda with significant amount of mine life left to go and significant upside as they start to develop the barnat portion of the project and also thereâ s been some significant resources added in the odyssey and east malartic zones which will be going through feasibility and preparing for mine development as we get further into 2019 and 2020 a little more detail on eagle construction which is owned by victoria gold of which we own 15 5 of the equity as well as a 5 royalty on the asset the project is now 75 complete the team there the management team has done an excellent job weâ re only a degree and half off the arctic circle and theyâ ve been able to carry through most of the winter with all of the mining fleet being fully commissioned and construction progressing well even at this time in the colder months of the year being january and february work construction continues to proceed and theyâ re looking forward to putting first ore on the pad in july and having the first gold pour sometime in the last half of 2019 and we applaud the efforts of management and the team at eagle for having fought through a bit of a wet spring and some hard weather earlier in 2018 and then really stepped on the gas in the last half of 2018 and into 2019 working well page eight a look at where our assets are performing obviously canadian malartic remains the cornerstone asset with ã lã onore in second place at about 7 500 zero cost royalty being delivered to it i wonâ t go through the rest of the assets they all range between sort of 1 000 and 3 500 ounces earned and in terms of silver still getting good geo equivalent ounces from mantos and sasa gibraltar continues to contribute as well and a little bit of silver coming out of malartic here diamonds obviously a big portion of our story right now representing 11 of our geos a gold equivalent ounce of about 8 400 ounces this leaves us if we look at the way that our revenue is split up 69 from gold 17 from silver for a total of 86 represented by precious metals and if we add diamonds into that mix we get to 97 with only 3 coming from other metal so itâ s pretty much a pure precious metals play if you like diamonds as well iâ m going to hand it over to elif to go through the impairment charge that we took for ã lã onore elif levesque thank you sean so we have reviewed our assets for impairment indicator for the fourth quarter and recognized impairment charges of c 166 3 million amounting to c 123 7 million net of income taxes the most important component of that was on ã lã onore for c 148 5 million and c 109 1 million net of income taxes during the fourth quarter goldcorp issued updated reserve and resource estimates on the ã lã onore gold mine which led to a total loss of mineral inventory of over two million ounces in january newmont also announced the acquisition of goldcorp in a deal valued at about us 10 billion so consequently on february 13 2019 goldcorp announced an impairment of us 1 6 billion representing us 1 4 billion net of income taxes on the ã lã onore gold mine due to the decrease in the reserve and resources and reduction in the estimated fair value of ã lã onoreâ s exploration potential osisko evaluated all the tax and circumstances and concluded an impairment of c 123 7 million net of income taxes we still believe that the exploration potential on the ã lã onore project is there itâ s just a valuation currently not reflecting the potential so going forward based on goldcorpâ s guidance we would still be expecting about 8 800 ounces of gold annually from this royalty if you go to the next page on page 10 we have record cash flow from operating activities of c 82 2 million and even with a higher finance cost compared to previous year of c 13 million we still had a pretty good year and thatâ s really a reflection of the chart that you see on the right thatâ s kind of based on the record revenues basically from a very good year from canadian malartic as well as reflecting a full year of results and cash margins from the orion portfolio that we acquired in 2017 and if you look at the net loss for the year 2018 and 2017 both reflecting the impairment charges we stand at a loss of c 105 6 million for 2018 and operating loss of c 113 5 million but if we do exclude the impairment charges the operating income would be at c 52 8 million versus c 18 6 million in 2017 which shows the growth in cash margin and the c 9 1 million gain that we made as sean said on buyback of the brucejack stream so if you look at the adjusted earnings that actually also reflects the positive impact that we just talked about previously standing at c 31 4 million for 2018 compared to c 22 7 million for 2017 page 11 gives you a breakdown of the revenues by our different interests and i think the strong cash margins showing at 89 for the year 2018 which reflects almost 100 of cash margins from our royalties and 63 on the streams as well as 1 4 on the off take and of course the royalty interest being the majority of the interest that we hold reflects for 2018 a strong outcome of 89 going on to page 12 kind of the results at a summary level as we previously discussed i guess i would just like to draw your attention here on to the realized gold price and in canadian dollars weâ re standing at c 1 649 per ounce this year and we have seen over c 1 700 per ounce at the end of 2018 as well as the beginning of 2019 so this is quite a big i guess increase level if we look at five years back when we just started the business 2014 when we were mainly in the c 1 400 level in us dollars we may look at a more even line but in canadian dollars we have seen some increases since we started operations page 13 shows the stable and growing dividends that weâ ve been declaring we have declared another c 0 05 per share dividend for this quarter as well currently the amount returned to shareholders stands at c 86 3 million since our inception in 2014 going on to page 14 we do finish the year with a very strong balance sheet and as you have seen we have used the payment that we received from the buyback of the brucejack stream to pay down our debts we had been very disciplined about that in 2018 and we had already started the program paying down our debt using our operating cash flows with the brucejack stream buy down we actually reduced this now as of january so the full credit facility remains available at this point with that sean back to you sean roosen thank you elif as you know we announced a normal course issuer bid of c 400 million up c 200 million the normal course issuer bid is still active and we use our discretion as to when and where we may purchase stock at any given time we have purchased 1 7 million shares at an average cost of c 11 95 for a total investment of c 20 million under our normal course issuer bid to date page 16 has a bit more detail on the eagle project and you can see some of the photos there this is a 30 000 tonnes per day heap leach operation being built just north of mayo in the yukon 64 5 degrees latitude just to put things in context precipitation at the eagle mine site is the same as phoenix arizona so it doesnâ t get a lot of snow it can be cold in january and february and the average the reserve life here gives us 10 years at about 10 000 ounces to our royalty so weâ re quite keen to see this mine get up and going and right now construction is very much on track for gold production in the second half of the year as we move forward page 17 a bit more detail and colour on the amendment of the stornoway stream we paid c 21 6 million to reinforce the stornoway balance sheet and we still hold a clear and concise stream of 9 6 of all the diamonds produced at renard what changed in the deal was the way the transfer price is structured the transfer price is 40 of achieved diamond sale price or maximum us 40 per carat with no escalation so itâ s much easier and cleaner for us to understand and we make money on each and every diamond that is produced through our stream at that point in time this applies to the life of mine production over the entire diamond property so weâ ve expanded the footprint and increased our cash margins on the stream and we also have better downside protection on any pressure that may come to bear in the diamond market itself and we also captured the exploration upside as well to create a liquidity for stornoway to carry out the optimization work needed at the mill site and to continue their underground development at the time so we see that as a pretty good win win on that project and we look forward to 2019 being a pretty good year over at stornoway in terms of getting into some of the better grade zones in the underground and to see the final optimizations in the mill process barkerville gold a large play here over 2 000 square kilometres of mineral rights contained here historic production in this camp has been north of four million ounces for those of you who followed the story we really got involved in a significant way in 2016 we have increased our 2 25 royalty to 4 during 2018 we have an option to buy another 1 for c 13 million on the project the benefit to osisko of course is that weâ re exposed to all the exploration in this land package weâ ve seen a significant amount of drill results with over 120 000 metres of drilling carried out in 2018 very much positive the mine also carried out small mine which generated a little over 21 000 ounces of gold production last year and itâ s fully permitted to continue on with explotable vein mining in 2019 and 2020 and optics on the development of the resource there which currently stands at 1 6 million ounces of measured and indicated with another inferred resource there of 2 1 million ounces for an overall resource if you looked at it just from an inferred level sitting at about 3 7 million ounces there so more to come one of the more exciting drill stories out there at this point in time and an increased royalty for us on that in terms of our asset distribution on page 19 you can see we have over 100 assets in north america ã lã onore renard lamaque and canadian malartic being the top producers for us at this point in time with island gold coming on strong with a reported increase in resource last week and a significant amount of assets in north america as we move forward our main asset in south america at this point in time is the mantos silver stream and we also have brauna 1 there others that are outside of north america would be sasa kwale and matilda continue on page 20 is just sort of a graphic representation of that we have over 130 royalties right now with streams and precious metal off takes included within that number 103 in north america nine in south america and the rest mostly in europe and australia the simple story on osisko at this point in time very strong balance sheet between our acquisition line cash on hand and our portfolio of equities we have more than c 1 billion available for investment and we continue to generate strong cash flows page 22 before i summarize i just want to say thank you to mr andrã gaumond who has served with the board for a little over five years since we acquired virginia gold and the ã lã onore royalty andrã has taken his retirement from the board right now and if i was a moose i would be very scared because heâ s hunting in several jurisdictions as we speak and i look forward to working with andrã as we go forward andrã pioneered the ã lã onore discovery in the james bay area and really set the stage for discovery and development in a territory that most people had shied away from prior to andrã carrying out the successful discovery of ã lã onore there and goldcorp subsequently building that mine setting a beachhead in a brand new mining camp that we think will be around for a long time to come we also have the retirement of pierre chenard because he has a new position heâ s assumed the role of executive vice president of strategy and business development at anglo gold pierre was previously the nominee for the caisse de dã pã t on our board and a legal advisor at rio tinto weâ re excited to see pierre in his new role and we look forward to working with pierre as he takes on that role and it should be an exciting time for pierre and heâ s done a great job helping us with his insight and his long history in quã bec and knows our team very well we wish him luck and hopefully his fortune will be ours as well summary for the day obviously the cornerstone assets in osisko being canadian malartic and ã lã onore and the attributable earned ounces this year of over 80 000 ounces looking for 85 000 to 95 000 geos for 2019 dividend yield currently at above 1 5 i think weâ ve demonstrated that our accelerator model is starting to provide benefits to us generating significantly higher returns on our royalties and stream acquisitions through that model as we move forward and we see a lot of opportunity in the current environment obviously the theme for 2019 there seems to be a lot of consolidation discussion going on and we see streaming and royalties as part of a finance package to be incorporated in some of those transactions as well as we hope to see more project finance come to be and i think that in 2019 we have significant amount of opportunities in front of us to deliver performance to our shareholders as we move forward weâ re celebrating our fifth year of business weâ re sitting at about c 2 2 billion market cap now having ipoâ d at around c 700 million market cap so itâ s been pretty good growth all in all and we are cash flow profitable and we make money every day of the week seven days a week so i think where weâ re sitting right now is osisko is one of the stronger companies in the space and we move forward with our business plan into 2019 and at that i will open up for any questions that we may have regarding 2018 year end question and answer session operator your first question comes from the line of dan rollins with rbc capital markets dan rollins sean i just wonder if you provide a little bit color around the strategy of the company going forward obviously it starts to develop as you start to build the base but my first question on that is with respect to the incubator model realizing that you have done some deals through equity that have gotten you some pretty nice royalties but you also continue to take equity stakes of the royalties is there a thought process of what differentiates between buying an equity stake in a company versus taking an equity stake and then actually clipping that royalty coupon as well just wondering if that s going to change and you re going to be a little bit more aggressive and start to say like if you want money we re going to need a royalty and have some equity as well sean roosen dan the only equity position i think that we own where we didnâ t have a royalty we actually earned a financing right so typically speaking our equity investments are tied to either a royalty opportunity or a project financing opportunity but to my knowledge weâ ve not issued too many equity positions idm and some of the smaller stocks which were sort of chip shots to set the stage on an exploration story but typically weâ ll stick to our strategy of equity as a means to an end in terms of setting the stage for another project financing or royalty streaming opportunity i donâ t think youâ ll see us do a lot of straight equity thatâ s not incorporated in a deal the big equity deal that we did do last year was c 50 million in the victoria which was tied to a c 98 million acquisition of a 5 royalty on the eagle project subsequent to that we did put some more equity into barkerville but we also have a 4 royalty with the right to go to 5 on that project so weâ ll continue to stick to that theme dan and our equity as we say itâ s part of a package and a ways to an end dan rollins okay so even on the smaller deals we see like the c 2 5 million c 3 5 million here and there they tend to have a financing link to them through that equity we just will see when it s press released sean roosen that s correct dan theyâ d have first offer or some other financing right dan rollins okay that s great and then just obviously there s struggle for small single asset companies there s struggle for development stage companies you seem to have built yourself a bit of a portfolio of high quality projects in canada is there any thought process of trying to massage the various equity vehicles to put themselves together to create something with a little bit of critical mass once one gets into production and then you can start to leave it and then sort of use that as a growth vehicle and then you could help fund it through royalties going down the road sean roosen i don t think iâ d want to get into any specifics on dan rollins not specifics but just do you see an opportunity on that yes sean roosen yes as a general trend i think that weâ re all looking at the cost of running a single asset public company and trying to manage that g a exposure and to consolidate expertise and focus on getting money into the ground so as a general theme the answer is definitely we do see advantages there but my key criteria to all that is access to capital our strategy is twofold we like to be at the very beginning of an incubation where we own royalty on an equity and then we also like to be in the last money in strategy which is essentially coming to the value time value curve out the other side where weâ re partner in a fully financed package so those are our two main drivers and anything in between there that would involve consolidation to the advantage of those outcomes we would be supportive but we stick pretty much to first principals about how we earn a royalty and then get paid on the equity as we did in arizona or in the case of victoria where weâ re part of the project financing on the last money in strategy dan rollins okay and then last one from me just on the return of capital to investors with the share price sort of coming off the loads of late last year are you still committed to completing the share buyback and number 2 depending on what your deal flow is is the potential dividend increase in the cards here for 2019 sean roosen well being a shareholder myself i always like the dividend in terms of our use of capital this year it is a bit of a target rich environment out there so the decision process to decide whether we buy our own stock or whether were investing in something else will be opportunity driven if we have better returns on a growth story that we could bring onto the balance sheet we would focus on that however if we feel that our stock is undervalued we will act as we did last year in terms of purchasing our stock back if thatâ s the best use of shareholdersâ capital we think we were pretty effective last year on the buy back and weâ re certainly happy to see the share price rebounded up about 45 from the lows of last year this year so weâ re happy to see that valuation coming back into the marketplace which is more in line with our belief system of what the asset base at osisko should be earning in the marketplace and as i said itâ ll be opportunity driven depending on what we have in front of us dan rollins okay thatâ s great appreciate the color and good luck in 2019 operator your next question comes from the line of kerry smith with haywood kerry smith when you went through your assets and looked at the write down on the ã lã onore what was the thought process as it relates to amulsar with what s happening over there and could you just remind me what your book value is on that asset sean roosen the thought process on amulsar is this has been a great pattern but i ll refer to elif as more master for these things than i elif levesque so we as you know we have 2 interests in the amulsar project we have stream and the offtake and together they re about c 150 million we hold investments in usa and the thought process when we did the acquisition as you know we still had some time ahead in terms of the constraint in construction process it was about a year and i guess the thing is right now what we were really waiting on was what was happening with the government over there they went through elections again in december and now actually really the popular person nikol pashinian was elected and so far we re seeing some movement in terms of trying to get the project going of course this still depends on the speed of how things will go through so far what happened what we ve seen is they ve elected a third party consulting company so it s just to go to their impact again overall and we think that process should probably take about 2 to 3 months and we re hoping that with the new government in place things will take a little bit of a normal speed but of course that s going to be a project that we re going to be following very closely in 2019 sean roosen and just for clarity s sake it was c 115 million not c 150 million kerry smith sorry 1 1 5 sean okay i thought it was 1 5 0 elif levesque the streams and the offtake the offtake s is there operator there are no further questions at this time sean roosen if there are no further questions i thank everybody for their time this morning good luck out there and we appreciate any inbounds if you didn t get chance to ask a question now please give us a call at your leisure we are happy to answer your questions at this point and good luck everybody thank you operator ladies and gentlemen this concludes today s conference call you may now disconnect
the housing crisis must be addressed by a careful collaboration between politicians advocacy groups and corporate entities activists says the housing crisis must be addressed by a careful collaboration between politicians advocacy groups and corporate entities activists says san francisco from atop his gleaming new headquarters salesforce ceo marc benioff has an inspirational view of mountains the bay and an endless pacific ocean but when benioff looks down he s not so happy some 60 floors below his salesforce tower offices is what he calls an inequality train wreck city streets out of control with thousands of homeless and often infirm citizens who have rendered sidewalks a landmine of feces and drug paraphernalia many have been destitute for years but others are newly minted refugees of a housing crisis created in large part by the very technology boom that has made benioff and other tech entrepreneurs billionaires many times over in this file photo taken on june 09 2016 a homeless man sleeps in front of a luxury auto dealership in san francisco california that s why benioff along with some of his tech peers and civic leaders say it s time for corporations in general and tech companies specifically to contribute financially toward fixing a problem that looms large from seattle to boston activists meanwhile warn that housing stock has lagged so severely in some cities that even huge infusions of cash will struggle to make an impact san francisco s woes are particularly acute its housing stock is a quarter of its need which has led to real estate prices that are among the highest in the nation some 15 000 tech positions were added in the city in 2016 and 2017 according to a report from brokerage firm cbre seattle another tech hub has experienced the same housing deficit phenomenon all while local tech powerhouses amazon and microsoft helped create 33 000 new tech jobs in 2016 and 2017 the cbre report says and as amazon moves into northern virginia and apple into austin local lawmakers and housing experts there are keeping careful watch on how an explosion of technology jobs will hit their communities across the nation the influx of high paying jobs in areas with limited housing has sent housing prices soaring for local residents since 2010 median home values in san francisco have doubled to 1 37 million according to zillow seattle and boston also doubled to 730 000 and 600 000 respectively austin jumped from 212 000 to 364 000 in that time period benioff whose family has been in san francisco for generations says more foresight should have gone into managing the tech explosion there s been really poor planning in our state and our cities benioff says with measured anger marc benioff ceo of tech giant salesforce is shown here campaigning for san francisco s prop c last fall the measure passed requiring all large companies to be taxed in order to put more money towards the city s massive homelessness problem look at paris they build social housing into their city he says you can have an amazing economy with high end residences but also accommodate everyone you just have to plan for all income types the government has to step in and companies have to help more tiny homes are popping up across us here s how they could help affordable housing crisis more the 10 cities with the best public transportation the housing crisis must be addressed by a careful collaboration between politicians advocacy groups and corporate entities says corianne scally principal research associate with the urban institute in washington d c there is no magic solution says scally companies need to understand the pressure they are creating particularly when taxes levied on them aren t covering their impact when you take into account the tax incentives that they get for setting up shop some already digging deep many tech giants say they are already reaching into their pockets to fund affordable housing solutions google has donated 3 million toward homelessness solutions being proposed by san francisco mayor london breed a spokesperson for the search giant said it had granted over 250 million since 2014 in the areas of homelessness economic opportunity and education in mid january microsoft revealed that it was going to allocate 500 million toward housing initiatives around its seattle area headquarters in a blog post trumpeting the news microsoft president brad smith and cfo amy hood said the move was spurred by a realization that this is a big problem and it s a problem that s only going to get worse microsoft said because jobs have grown 21 percent since 2011 while housing has only expanded by 13 percent the company would be investing 225 million toward building middle income housing 250 million to support low incoming housing and 25 million in grants to help those tackling homelessness issues about a week after microsoft laid out its plan a san francisco corporate consortium calling itself partnership for the bay area s future announced it was halfway toward a goal of raising 540 million the partnership s investment fund is aimed at providing financial assistance toward a goal of building 8 000 new housing units across the bay area in the coming years its policy fund will support initiatives to preserve and expand housing with a particular focus on strengthening low income tenant protections to guard against landlords evicting low income renters so they can charge higher rates preserving affordable housing also is a mission of newly installed california gov gavin newsom who has made housing a top priority he recently sued the southern california city of huntington beach for resisting efforts to build affordable housing ultimately civic leaders and some tech leaders warn that ignoring housing issues is bad for business san francisco s homeless problem already has caused some companies to plan lucrative conventions elsewhere and an inviting urban core also is considered a key recruiting tool a place like the bay area is very diverse and vibrant which is why companies want to be here and hire here says caitlyn fox director of justice and opportunity for the chan zuckerberg initiative the foundation started by facebook founder mark zuckerberg and his wife priscilla chan the foundation is part of the new partnership for the bay area s future along with facebook the ford foundation genentech morgan stanley and others we all came to the bay area because of its promise and now we have a stake to ensure that promise remains for all says fox because that s being threatened will amazon match microsoft it is not uncommon for tech companies flush with cash to create programs aimed at placating communities where they operate apple which put 70 million into transit infrastructure and affordable housing around its new billion dollar headquarters in cupertino california a few years ago also said it had contributed to 1 8 million to area bike lanes apple also said that in 2018 its employees donated more than 125 million to non profits around the world representatives at the iphone maker would not say whether it has plans to work with local officials on housing issues including in texas where apple s plan to build by 2021 a new 133 acre campus in austin would make it the largest private employer in the city in this may 24 2018 file photo a man sleeps on the sidewalk as people behind line up to buy lunch at a dick s drive in restaurant in seattle a new federal report says the number of people living on the streets in los angeles and san diego fell this year meanwhile homelessness overall was up slightly across the country including seattle in seattle amazon said it has donated 40 million to mary s place a local homeless shelter working with the non profit amazon has created two temporary homeless shelters on its campus which will become permanent in 2020 but amazon also has come under heavy fire for contributing to rising inequality in seattle as well as for successfully killing a head count tax on employees 275 per worker on companies making more that 20 million a year that would have raised money partly for affordable housing when microsoft announced their news the feeling here was ok amazon what are you going to do says jeff shulman a marketing professor at the university of washington who has been studying amazon s impact on seattle s growth shulman notes that amazon has been good for the area not only in terms of tech jobs but also jobs at every level particular in terms of people moving here to serve amazon employees but he adds such cafeteria workers janitors teachers child care workers increasingly find themselves priced out of the areas in which they work resulting in endless commutes along clogged roads virginia gov ralph northam speaks during a news conference in the crystal city neighborhood in arlington va tuesday nov 13 2018 amazon which has grown too big for its seattle hometown said it will split its much anticipated second headquarters between new york and northern virginia tech companies need to lure talent and for those employees quality of life includes where they live how they get to work where their kids go to school and even cultural amenities but the housing crunch is pushing all but those paid big tech salaries far away says shulman and just recently amazon abruptly pulled out of plans to build part of its new headquarters in the queens borough of new york city after politicians and activists there raised questions about the company s financial commitment to the region while receiving 3 billion in subsidies real estate agents in new york had already starting seeing evidence of an amazon effect on prices just as a result of the announcement that the everything store tech behemoth was moving to new york and virginia michelle winters executive director of the alliance for housing solutions in northern virginia says so far amazon has not said how it plans to help beyond bringing thousands of jobs to the area she remains optimistic but fears the worst you could have dual impacts says winters one is the immediate local impact near campus where there might be a large scale displacement of residents who have been there for generations and the other is a broader regional impact where affordable homes are only available in outlying area with a negative impact on traffic that creates a poorer quality of life in san francisco fernando marti co director of the council for community housing organizations a non profit that crafts affordable housing public policy says he is grateful for the newfound corporate focus on the housing crisis but is also skeptical about whether the gestures are too little too late marti points out that for one thing in the bay area even 500 million doesn t go far consider that at an average home building cost of 300 per square foot a new 1 500 square foot home would cost 450 000 to construct that means 500 million would only build 1 111 new homes i remain optimistic that more will be done by these companies says marti it s all tied together in the end housing and education and quality of life and all of that if not resolved affects their ability to do business most can t afford california indeed the california dream is proving increasingly elusive especially for younger residents a recent quinnipiac university poll indicated that 43 percent of california voters said they couldn t afford life in the state while 61 percent of 18 to 34 years old living in the world s fifth largest economy said it was beyond their means in silicon valley s backyard only high end housing needs in san francisco have been met over the past four years ending in 2017 according to casa the committee to house the bay area in contrast over the same period low income and middle income housing demand outstripped new housing supply four to one one solution may well be to leverage technology itself to make housing construction more affordable that s the mission of factory os a new company os stands for off site just north of san francisco that takes an automotive assembly line approach to building os builds apartments in its factory at around a 30 percent costs savings over on site construction factory os already has an order from 300 small apartments from google which is looking to add short term accommodation options for employees who come to its mountain view california headquarters to work on projects company ceo rick holliday says he was forced to innovate due to the pressures he s facing from the very housing shortage he s hoping to alleviate we re in a mess and part of the issue is my own labor shortage says holliday who said between unaffordable bay area housing and younger workers not getting into building trades he has lost 30 percent of his workforce in recent years we need to tackle hard costs and get more housing out of those dollars he says tackle those costs get sacramento politicians engaged and ask tech companies to engage you do those three things and you might make a dent more think the gender pay gap is bad women in tech face an equity gap and it s even worse more diversifying tech black professionals are finding success in spite of the odds tech leaders are far from reaching a consensus on how and even whether to pay for affordable housing benioff for example was a huge backer of san francisco s proposition c which passed in november it stipulates that any company with revenues over 50 million would be charged 0 5 percent on income over that mark so if you pull in 55 million one year you d be assessed 25 000 in prop c taxes while that s a small amount for many of the roughly 400 area companies affected by the law supporters estimate that the city will be able to collect around 300 million a year from the tax that money would go toward 1 000 new beds for the city s homeless and also over time allot 150 million to 4 000 new housing units dedicated to lower income families but the san francisco chamber of commerce along with some tech entrepreneurs opposed the measure arguing that the tax could drive companies away from san francisco benioff and twitter founder jack dorsey even got into an online feud over the matter with dorsey predicting that smaller companies would get disproportionately hurt by the measure the city has started to collect these taxes but nothing has yet been distributed because the measure is facing a court challenge as it did not pass by a two thirds majority benioff hails proposition c is an example of how big change can come from public private partnerships ultimately however he said a solution can t be reached if multi billion dollar tech companies don t see pitching in on housing as a fundamental part of their corporate responsibility homelessness is my number one priority says benioff it s about getting san francisco cleaned up again follow usa today

by modern diplomacy by giancarlo elia valori the meeting between the leader of the democratic people s republic of korea kim jong un and the president of the united states donald j trump will be held in hanoi vietnam on february 27 28 2019 the primary aim as stated by both heads of state is the solution of the north korean and us nuclear issue in south korea the news of the meeting had initially been delivered by president trump in his speech on the state of the union but also in a long series of now inevitable twitter messages indeed after the singapore summit between kim jong un and trump in the first half of june 2018 the negotiations between the two countries had clearly stalled the results reached in singapore however were very significant the us armed forces cessation of the joint exercises with south korea s military structures the certainty as stated by president trump that kim jong un would dismantle his nuclear system very quickly but also the continuation of us economic sanctions against north korea unless quick and new choices were made by kim jong un it should also be noted that the decision to suspend the joint military exercises with south korea was a real bolt from the blue for the country above all while president trump enabled north korea to use the nuclear and conventional iaea safety measures an unavoidable and necessary factor of a future and quick disarmament since the singapore summit the denuclearization of the whole korean peninsula has been the aim of both heads of state but with a too generic approach on the procedures and time schedule of the checks on disarmament for the time being however while from the beginning of its autonomous negotiations with south korea north korea has always avoided carrying out nuclear or missile exercises and tests certainly no one has declared or shown interest in really endeavouring for denuclearization in both koreas however why has hanoi been chosen as venue of the meeting the choice has been made precisely by president trump because the capital of vietnam which is still a painful symbol for the united states has managed to become a great pole of international economic development after its reunification with the communist north vietnam in a twitter message president trump wrote under kim jong un s leadership north korea will become the great economic powerhouse of southeast asia considering that i have gotten to know kim and fully understand how capable he is as a politically rational leader it is not just flattering probably president trump has been fascinated by this young north korean leader heir to an extraordinary ancestry who studied in switzerland followed his cursus honorum in the true control rooms of north korea s power and was modest while he was learning and is now assertive without rhetoric when he rules pending his visit to vietnam the north korean leader will visit the factories of the bac ninh province northeast of hanoi with a view to probing the concrete possibility of building a smartphone factory jointly with the south korean company samsung most likely there will also be a visit by the north korean leader to ha long bay a popular tourist area near haiphong if we do not think about quality tourism we cannot properly imagine the future development of north korea which will also fit very well in the new global food chains it should also be noted that this visit by kim jong un is the first one he pays to vietnam it is also worth recalling that north korea sent some of its air forces to fight alongside the vietmihn of the vietnamese communist resistance as well as russia and china currently however vietnam s primary economic partner is coincidentally south korea and this has certainly not contributed to preserve good relations between north korea and vietnam the meeting between the head of us negotiators stephen biegun with his north korean counterpart kim hyok chol has already taken place in hanoi and pyongyang a meeting always focused on topic number 1 namely denuclearization before this assignment in relation to north korea stephen biegun was responsible for ford motor co s international relations he knows russian and moscow s economic and political circles very well he is member of the board of the u s russia foundation and of ford sollers the joint venture of ford motor co in the russian federation kim hyok chol had met biegun also in pyongyang where they had already talked about complete denuclearization the denuclearization that will probably emerge in its already final form at the end of the hanoi talks between the two leaders we can already predict it will envisage the dismantling of the yongbyon reactor and some funds to support north korea s economic growth with a very long term loan for funding the nuclear decommissioning of the democratic people s republic of korea in fact the latest satellite images of the north korean reactor yongbyon show a still active and well maintained site while the main structures of the reactor seem to be still unused to date kim jong un has already decided that yongbyon will be the start of the great north korean denuclearization process both symbol and substance an image to be shown the world and a credible subject of negotiation kim jong un has always said also to his south korean counterpart that it would be yongbyon to be closed down at the beginning of negotiations if there were corresponding actions by the united states which actions it is easy to imagine them the sincere measures envisaged by kim jong un in his last new year s speech are the removal from south korea of the us military and nuclear structures that can allow a response to the first nuclear attack from the north in 2018 alone north korea also destroyed both a nuclear base and a missile structure but the united states said that these operations had not been fully accomplished and in any case they could be easily reversed according to some us nuclear disarmament experts kim jong un could reach a level just at the limit of complete nuclear disarmament but such measures would be such as to clearly regionalize north korea s nuclear and hence missile threat in short kim jong un rescues the united states from its missiles this also means that in a military or geopolitical regional crisis kim jong un could also involve both china and japan in the negotiations thus multiplying both the effect of his threat and the strength of his final resigning to continue the attack the other factor will be the new and soft phase of relations between north and south korea with a significant reduction in the number of guard posts and internal weapons within the demilitarized zone for the north korean leader the next step will be to almost completely put an end to the old alliance between south korea and the united states which in his opinion is always a harbinger of dangerous military and in the future also economic presences that would push a de facto unified korea to get out of the triangle which will effectively replace the north korean nuclear system i e the north korean strategic integration with china and the russian federation even the planned dismantling of yongbyon however would leave north korea with a substantial amount of nuclear weapons and the possibility of producing enriched uranium elsewhere nevertheless there would anyway be a definitive stop to the production of plutonium by north korea which is a very important political and strategic result it should be recalled however that even the sole dismantling of yongbyon is a remarkable technological financial and political operation a stable connection would be needed between the united states the russian federation china and probably south korea and even the now residual european union in addition to iaea of course it will take many years and huge funds to achieve this result needless to cherish the fond hope just to give an example the rocky flats us headquarters used for storing plutonium was dismantled in 14 years at a cost of 9 billion us dollars in belgium eurchemic was decommissioned and dismantled in 25 years at a cost of 333 75 million us dollars probably the most rational and quick choice will be to entrust the decommissioning of yongbyon to a joint political and financial organization between the united states and north korea nevertheless how will north korea afford it obviously it will not want to have external support and rightly so but hence how can the issue be solved the huge cost of decommissioning the site must anyway be shared by a sufficient number of actors north korea cannot materially bear 50 of all costs hence support will be inevitably needed from south korea the russian federation and china but also from japan and probably an axis between vietnam and thailand for example it is impossible for the united states and north korea alone to bear all the costs we could also think about an ad hoc investment bank which at international level would be entrusted with the task of funding the operation at least partly so as to later organize business projects in north korea in full agreement with kim jong un s leadership once clarified the financial framework the technical operations of decommissioning could also be very quick reinforced concrete containers to be filled with nuclear n materials would be used then the reactor and the iodine selector filters cells would be emptied but what is left would be covered again with much reinforced concrete without further removals that could be postponed to economically better times the plasma torches and all the other current techniques could almost immediately stop the action of radioactive materials but with a maximum amount of staff that could be about 150 technicians and at least 70 elements all selected among north korean experts in short if all this can happen in the future the solution for yongbyon will be found in less than a year and at a predictable cost of 6 million us dollars the 5 mwe reactor defueling is a further problem this is the primary source of plutonium the defueling would cost approximately 3 million us dollars all inclusive while the real dismantling would cost about 30 million us dollars hence the total cost for dismantling the plutonium and uranium networks the centrifuges and the reactor will range between 300 million us dollars in an initial and scarcely effective phase and as many as 1 6 billion us dollars under iaea sole control the dismantling of all north korean facilities will last at least twenty years at the aforementioned cost of 1 6 us dollars but without iaea supervision it will take at least ten years and almost one billion us dollars why confining the negotiations for peace and inclusion of the democratic people s republic of korea into the world market only to the nuclear issue it is most likely that the north korean chemical weapon warehouse is old but there are certainly still vx and cw agents g series and v series nerve agents that are certainly not negligible in any confrontation capable of endangering north korean stability and political identity what about discussing it in the summit at least in an initial phase what about establishing a rational military balance between the united states russia and china in the whole asian continent kim jong un could and certainly will be a fully rational actor who will know how to evaluate the best potential for the defence of his country but without the silly memories of the cold war this also applies to north korea s chemical weapons which kim jong un will deal with the necessary flexibility but also with a compensatory criterion with respect to his nuclear system hence the prospects for the north korean leadership could be the following a keeping a minimum share of chemical bacteriological and even nuclear weapons to effectively react to any north korea s political crisis the calculation of the minimum that a statesman must always be able to do a possible solution could be an official statement just before or even during the forthcoming hanoi summit that there will be a mutual and official recognition between the united states and north korea a definitive document dealing with borders the political personality the regular exchange of ambassadors and cultural commercial and financial relationships b an agreement for the transfer of nuclear and bacteriological chemical stocks to a third country under the supervision of the international agencies responsible for the operations an already possible agreement could be separating and dividing stocks between china the russian federation south korea japan the united states and even the irrelevant eu c support to the military police and security forces of the democratic people s republic of korea for monitoring staff stocks and their political use by unreliable elements of kim jong un s regime a relationship between intelligence services that is unavoidable considering the future commitments hence north korea must know very well that if there is someone interested in the stability of the regime this is precisely the axis of western powers that are accepting kim jong un s openings with laborious rationality it will therefore be essential to envisage with the figures and costs already mentioned above as well as the respective allocations and breakdowns a refinancing project especially in the short term of the democratic people s republic of korea which shall mainly concern 1 the prevention of humanitarian disasters also with the same un agencies that have been supporting north korea on these issues for over 23 years once again there is no problem in this regard apart from china that in fact currently supports almost alone north korea against international sanctions it will be necessary to stabilize aid and organize it in a different way considering the costs of the large nuclear decommissioning 2 how can it be done it is simple after all it could be done by immediately establishing an international bank for korea and asia in the south west which would collect aid deal with investment in north korea support the population and above all submit to the north korean government the new industrialization projects mainly in the tourist environmental and food chain sectors but also in fine technologies the entry of a great country such as north korea into the world market will be the real great deal of the century and the true and stable guarantee for future peace it will be good to jump at the chance without making a fuss about it 3 finally we should help north korea to become what it already is namely a rich country certainly with its parallel liberalizations north korea s current leadership has already done much but here very strong liquidity injections will be needed as well as new and effective projects to be quickly submitted to kim jong un s government 4 the origin of this north korean small economic boom is still bilateral trade with china hence we need to preserve and strengthen it indeed as has already been envisaged in china we need to imagine a rational inclusion of north korea in the chinese belt and road initiative towards the west the maritime networks currently already present in an eminently maritime country such as north korea would be perfect for managing the chinese networks that already start from gwadar 5 it would therefore be silly to do what some us leaders suggest i e to force north korea to choose between nuclear weapons and economic support kim jong un has studied marx very well when he was in switzerland and knows all too well that aid never comes without strings attached 6 hence the real costs of the great nuclear decommissioning must be calculated accurately with an initial dismantling of the chemical and bacteriological arsenal to which the evaluation of social and economic impact shall be added finally this shall also be matched by an initial rational and credible support for starting a new industrialization of the north korean economy which cannot obviously be only the result of south korean investments hence besides defining a good policy line for intervening on nuclear decommissioning we shall also do a rational and economic calculation of future costs and investments this is needed to make kim jong un s relinquishment of his nuclear system not coincide with an economic crisis and a weak integration of the country in the future world market which will however be very different from the current one about the author advisory

the us dollar could extend declines to high beta currencies if we see continued progress with china and us reaching a broad trade deal that prevents the us from raising tariffs on chinese goods next week the biggest data release of the trading week will be the us fourth quarter gdp reading which is expected to decline from 3 4 to 2 4 the expectations for this release range from 1 4 to 3 0 with the median average estimate being 2 3 a strong miss could help solidify the markets expectations that the next fed move will be a rate cut currently markets are seeing a 25 4 chance that the next move would be a rate cut at the january 29 2020 meeting the greenback will also be highly impacted by a plethora of fed speak with vice chairman clarida speaking on monday fed chairman powell testify on the semiannual monetary policy report before the senate banking committee and fed president s bostic harker and kaplan speak on thursday the fed has clearly signaled that rates are hold for now but this week s commentary could give further light on when we could see quantitative tightening end this year the trump kim summit takes place in vietnam on wednesday and any steps that lead toward

major acquisition after posting biggest loss in history usd the us dollar started the week on softer footing as expectations remain high a trade deal will be reached between the us and china tensions are likely to heat up as both sides try to finalize the final terms and ways of an enforcing an agreement what is also important to watch is president trump s satisfaction with his team last week s spat with top trade negotiator robert lighthizer highlights the volatility we could see if the president will ultimately sign off on a deal gbp there is not enough time to deliver brexit on time so we should not be surprised that prime minister may confirmed we will not see a meaningful vote this week and that it will occur by march 12th the key date on everyone s calendar is the eu summit in brussels on march 21st and 22nd the eu will want the final terms agreed amongst uk parliament before the eu decides whether or not to alter the terms of the brexit agreement as we near the march 29th brexit deadline speculation will grow on how brexit will be delayed early on sunday the telegraph reported the pm is considering extending article 50 and could see brexit delayed for up to two months stocks earnings season has one last full week of companies reporting results but the focus will likely remain on the trade front us stocks have delivered better than expected results and price action on the s p 500 has delivered a v shaped recovery that has reached a key resistance level with the financial markets heavily pricing in a trade deal to happen before the march 1st deadline we may see limited upside on the official announcement gold gold prices safe haven flows in general have had some difficulty providing a clear directional move as global growth concerns have been countered with positive developments on the us china trade war the precious metal is also supported by accommodative stances from the fed ecb pboc and rba the thursday release of fourth quarter gdp for the us could provide a significant move for the precious metal current expectations are for gdp to fall from 3 4 to 2 4 oil crude prices continue to be supported on optimism a trade deal will be reached in the coming days by the world s two largest economies opec and friends remain committed to production cuts and shortages of heavy crude supplies that stem from american sanctions on venezuela and iran oil markets are well aware of growing us production that will eventually take away the effectiveness of the opec production cuts but that story may not come to fruition until the summer months in the short term we could see oil vulnerable to a buy the rumor sell the fact situation a formal announcement of trade deal with the chinese and americans could see limited upside as exhaustion enters the

i ll come clean i am a capitalist i ve started two businesses one not so successful due to injuries and health issues at an inconvenient stage though we did ok in the end another which shows all the signs of a healthy infant i don t expect we will make a fortune but it will make enough currently i work for a multinational it is one of life s irony s that someone like me an advocate for the mixed economy democratic socialist model that has proven the most successful economic system to date is considered any way radical no one has yet found a better system for allocation of day to day resources within a community than a market capitalist system you see potential customers for your market garden or building skills you invest in training as a builder buy a set of tools or in a plot of land and seeds if you do it well you make a good living but how much profit you can make is limited by the fact there are many other small builders and market gardeners and your potential customers can see who grows the best vegetables or builds houses that stay up at this level a free market works fine the economy is pretty much in a steady state as is the use of natural resources as soon as you grow the community larger than one where everyone knows the skills and honesty of the other members you need ways of ensuring those with market power do not accumulate too much of the communities wealth basically that real contributors to the community don t lose out to cheats resulting in the breakdown of the system no capitalist society has succeeded without a healthy dose of co operation common infrastructure goods and services and regulation socialism countries that are successful by all our normal measures have an economy balanced between private and state the most successful have high progressive taxation and a state share of the economy around 50 to 60 ours is down to 28 and it shows without the rule of law healthy and educated workers public infrastructure and regulation of the cheats if you like we cannot have a successful business and wider economy private provision of mass public goods has proven to be incredibly inefficient and wasteful like our power companies it suits bill gates and others to attribute human advancement to capitalism a self justification for having extorted extreme wealth others attribute advances to human co operation in developing infrastructure and services laws and sharing wealth and advancement which capitalism can never deliver both are correct the usa s post war advancement was due to high taxes socialist redistribution a high quality public education system state sponsored research and innovation public infrastructure spending anti trust laws banking regulation and a large middle class all were needed to make capitalism work the concentration of wealth and power with late stage insufficiently regulated monopoly capitalism and the winding back of social infrastructure and redistribution is causing the usa s decline in our example of small community capitalism above people pretty much get out what they put in the market limits how much they can take as profit a steady state economy without growth is possible you are buying yourself a job if you like in a truly free market an impossibility of course where there is perfect information and competition there cannot of course be any profit free marketeers free traders don t want a free market they simply want one distorted in their favour any business knows that to make a profit you have to distort the market in some way convince people you are better than your competitors get government to legislate in your favour or give you subsidies or public goods or use monopoly or oligopoly power to eliminate competition and keep wages low your profit is always someone else s loss capitalism requires growth to function the motivation behind capitalists is profit getting out more than you put in why start a business and take that risk if you are going to make the same amount as you would as an employee however most people do make less than they put in so that others can profit many functioning businesses don t make a real profit including most of our essential small businesses they make enough small builders make a good living but you could hardly say they take out more than they put in the degree of competition precludes that building material suppliers however make huge profits in new zealand because they are a duopoly big box stores and banks are extremely effective in removing wealth from communities in a finite world the exponential growth required to make increasing profits and pay interest is not possible capitalism is cannibalising the human and natural environment it needs to survive the concentration of wealth and power insufficiently regulated capitalism and excessive profit taking has caused now works against the survival of human civilisation with the wealthy opposing any attempts to limit the damage
fearing a dangerous state of disrepair for the state s highways and bridges the director of the ohio department of transportation testified thursday in favor of a proposal that would significantly increase the state s gas tax which is the lowest among all great lakes states the proposal to increase the gas tax from 28 cents per gallon to 46 cents per gallon comes as state officials grapple with a significant funding shortfall which could halt future road projects and curtail the maintenance of existing roads the 64 percent increase in the state s gas tax which hasn t been increased since 2005 would generate 1 2 billion in additional revenue the state would receive 60 percent of that additional revenue while cities towns townships and counties would divvy up the remaining 40 percent ohio s gas tax rate is in the middle of the pack nationwide in 2013 then gov john kasich cobbled together a short term fix to infrastructure funding shortfalls by borrowing 1 5 billion against future revenues from turnpike tolls that money however has already been allocated or spent in recent years gas tax revenues have been slowly undercut by more fuel efficient vehicles hybrids and rising inflation surrounding construction costs one dollar spent on infrastructure in 2005 is worth almost half that now according to figures provided to news 5 by odot with less money to go around as many as 20 major road projects across the state could be put on hold state officials said by halting these projects and having less money to spend on maintenance odot director jack marchbanks told the ohio house finance committee that driver safety could be put in peril we know that deteriorating road conditions lead to more crashes more crashes lead to more fatalities marchbanks said more of our roads and bridges would inevitably slip into a dangerous state of disrepair putting the safety of ohio s drivers at risk part of the upcoming budget that lawmakers will consider the proposed gas tax hike comes as odot has slashed operational expenses by 700 million since 2011 marchbanks said as many as 700 positions have not been filled or eliminated the state agency has also implemented other measures to improve overall efficiency according to marchbanks the proposed legislation also contains a provision that would tie the gas tax rate to the consumer price index by doing so proponents say the rate would be tied to inflation which is a similar tactic that other states have implemented for a driver who logs 15 000 miles per year and drives a vehicle that gets an average of 30 miles per gallon the proposed gas tax increase would cost nearly 100 more per year proponents point to the fact that the increase is less than paying for a new tire that s needed because of bad road conditions any time a tax is brought up as an issue i m always thinking about what it s supposed to fund said driver cybil freeman of twinsburg if it is something i can use or would make life easier for us day to day i definitely want to support that you just figure out how to budget elsewhere other drivers on the other hand worried about the potential impact that a gas tax hike would have if gas prices ever creep north of 3 or 4 per gallon i think we need all the money we can get to go into the roads it s just how they go about getting it said motorist bill fiegelist of parma i don t know if they can squeeze any more from the people that actually have to pay for gas and how that is going to affect the economy right now it s pretty good local municipalities would also see a minor windfall in road funding odot estimates that the city of parma for example would receive nearly an additional 2 million per year the city of cleveland would receive nearly an additional 7 million per year that money can only be used for road related improvements or maintenance freeman said funding road improvements by way of a tax hike is a necessary expense even if it will cause budget constraints for her family if it s going to help the roads in ohio northeast ohio we kind of need that our roads kind of suck freeman said you do what you have to do pinch a penny somewhere else and figure out how you can fit in the budget a vote on the proposed gas tax hike has not been scheduled odot has also created an interactive map that shows the projects and maintenance that could be impacted if the gas tax isn t raised view it below or click here

business leaders who were instrumental in passing the state s last gas tax increase are wary of gov tim walz s plan to fix crumbling roads and bridges by asking minnesotans to pay 20 cents more per gallon the state must spend significantly more on its transportation system chamber of commerce presidents labor leaders and representatives from the agricultural and trucking industries said but exactly how to pay for it remains a matter of intense debate when the minnesota business partnership meets with walz this week executive director charlie weaver said the group will likely tell walz they agree with his goal then they will detail their opposition to a series of new costs for businesses outlined in the governor s budget proposal let s talk about this payroll tax and 12 weeks paid leave weaver said and if we can arrive at an agreement around these other issues that are expensive and burdensome to business then we can have a productive discussion around the gas tax walz a democrat set out a spending plan last week that included a 70 percent increase in the gas tax igniting debate across industries about how to improve transportation without overwhelming taxpayers and businesses minnesota has the 28th highest gas tax in the nation at 28 6 cents per gallon according to the tax foundation walz s proposal would move the state to fourth highest bringing in billions of additional dollars over the next decade the governor repeatedly talked about raising the gas tax on the campaign trail and when he debuted his full budget plan he said it is an idea voters endorsed in october an 800 person poll by the star tribune and minnesota public radio found 56 percent of respondents supported a 10 cent gas tax increase to build and maintain roads and bridges the poll did not ask about 20 cents this is not a choice between having a gas tax or not walz said it is a choice between living in a state with the best and safest transportation system in the country or living in a state with crumbling roads and bridges that risk our safety and keep away businesses the state s roads earned a d plus in the latest american society of civil engineers report card five of the 100 worst truck bottlenecks in the nation were in minnesota according to the american transportation research institute frustrations are growing and momentum is building to fix those problems but this year is different from 2008 when there had been a two decade gap since the last gas tax increase minnesota chamber of commerce president doug loon said with the interstate 35w bridge collapse as a catalyst and a concerted push by powerful business groups a contingent of republican legislators broke ranks that year they joined democrats to override then gov tim pawlenty s gas tax veto and passed an 8½ cent increase that was phased in over a number of years this year republican legislative leaders remain resolute in their opposition to a gas tax increase there are other ways to pay for transportation needs said senate majority leader paul gazelka r nisswa republican legislators proposed shifting revenue from sales taxes on auto parts and repairs and devoting that to roads and bridges the tax dollars currently go to the general fund and are used for a variety of government programs if we continue to take from the general fund we cannot invest in our children s education walz said house minority leader kurt daudt r crown said he thinks minnesotans consider 20 cents extreme in his district an hour north of the metro people often commute to the twin cities for work and spend a lot on gas daudt said the gas tax is one of the most regressive taxes you can put in place he said it hurts low income people much more than high income people and it s also something that hurts greater minnesota much more than it hurts the metro brainerd lakes chamber of commerce president matt kilian echoed daudt s concern about the disproportionate impact on rural communities where people drive longer distances and don t have the option of taking transit the increase would also affect their local economy he said because if people have to pay more to reach cabin country they will spend less on dining and activities when they arrive with a surplus in the state s budget kilian said the governor should not be looking to taxpayers for additional infrastructure money several groups like the minnesota farm bureau are particularly opposed to a crucial piece of walz s plan indexing the gas tax to inflation so it would automatically grow over time it s disingenuous not to account for inflation walz said if the state does not keep up with inflationary costs the upkeep of roads and bridges will fall behind he said resulting in more gridlock and potential catastrophes any increases should happen in a transparent way not automatically minnesota farm bureau president kevin paap countered minnesota trucking association president john hausladen said the walz administration s ability to pass the increase will depend on whether it can show specifically where the money will go why it s needed and how people will benefit the gas tax increase is just one of the ways the governor wants to raise money for transportation his plan also increases the vehicle registration tax and the motor vehicle sales tax that people pay when buying a car those changes along with the gas tax would generate about 11 billion over a decade according to budget estimates walz also wants the state to borrow more money for transportation and in the metro area he proposed residents pay a one eighth of 1 cent sales tax specifically for buses and transit to offset the various transportation cost increases walz is seeking a tax credit for lower and middle income families over time improvements to the transportation system would save people time and money on gas and repairs said kris fredson campaigns director of the minnesota chapter of the laborers international union of north america the union is advocating for the 20 cent gas tax increase the average twin cities driver spends about 41 hours a year in traffic at an average cost to the driver of 1 332 per year the american society of civil engineers report found with the population projected to grow that will get worse transportation commissioner margaret anderson kelliher said it would take a 16 cent gas tax increase just to cover debt service and maintenance costs any new roads and bridges and ability to move more freely in the system comes above 16 cents so this is not a pie in the sky proposal said anderson kelliher who was house speaker in 2008 and instrumental in passing the last gas tax increase for many minnesotans the demand for a certain road improvement project is critical and personal hwy 14 in southern minnesota which needs to be fully expanded to four lanes is one of those walz said his neighbor died on that highway patrick baker vice president of greater mankato growth inc said hwy 14 is one of the reasons his organization has not taken a firm stance opposing the gas tax every day the hwy 14 project is delayed he said more people are put at risk there are some businesses that are willing to take on that additional cost to make sure we can keep moving forward as an economy baker said i will say all of the other things that are surrounding the budget related to the cost of doing business really have them concerned and i think is going to get in the way of finding some sort of compromise on transportation
the government is here to help journalist h l mencken famously observed the whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace alarmed and hence clamorous to be led to safety by menacing it with an endless series of hobgoblins all of them imaginary ronald reagan just as famously warned the nine most terrifying words in the english language are i m from the government and i m here to help rahm emanuel summed it all up neatly when he said you never want a serious crisis to go to waste and what i mean by that is an opportunity to do things that you think you could not do before the corollary of rahm s law is that the government will tend to create crises so that we will need more government to fix them a case in point is stock buybacks senators chuck schumer d ny and bernie sanders d vt who is running for president as a socialist long for the good old days they believe that our nation s glory days can be restored by limiting corporate stock buybacks they said so in a 2 3 nyt op ed according to the two senators the 1950s 70s were a golden age for workers because american corporations shared a belief that they had a duty not only to their shareholders but to their workers their communities and the country that created the economic conditions and legal protections for them to thrive however in recent decades corporate managements and their boards of directors have become greedy focusing on maximizing shareholders earnings at the expense of workers earnings the result has been the worst level of income inequality in decades they claim as proof they offer the explosion of stock buybacks from 2008 2017 corporations have boosted their earnings per share and the value of their stocks by spending close to 100 of their profits on buybacks 53 and dividends 40 which the senators characterize as corporate self indulgence they bemoan that corporations haven t been investing enough to strengthen their businesses or boost the productivity of their workers so stock holding managements have gotten richer at the expense of workers who don t hold stock and haven t benefited from rising stock prices thus exacerbating both income and wealth inequality adding insult to injury the median wages of average workers have remained relatively stagnant while the corporate fat cats are getting fatter on buybacks workers get handed a pink slip the two senators who have never managed any business intend to fix this problem they are planning to introduce a bill that will prohibit any corporation from buying back its shares unless it first provides a minimum wage of 15 an hour and a basic package of employee benefits which presumably the bill will spell out the senators recognize that corporations would respond by paying out more in dividends if they can t buy back their shares they promise more legislation to deal with that issue if necessary maybe by amending the tax code original sin i humbly offer our two senators a bit of good advice courtesy of erasmus from his essay in praise of folly let not the wise man glory in his wisdom the reason is obvious because no man hath truly any whereof to glory i am from yardeni research and i m here to help where shall i begin to expose the folly of the senators arguments i ll begin at the beginning 1 sec eases the rules on buybacks not widely known is that for many years after the great crash of 1929 the securities and exchange commission sec viewed buybacks as bordering on criminal activity that was the case up until the reagan years when the sec began to ease the rules on buybacks under john shad chairman from 1981 to 1987 he believed that the deregulation of securities markets would be good for the economy in a widely read september 2014 harvard business review article titled profits without prosperity william lazonick a professor of economics at the university of massachusetts argued that buybacks are effectively a form of stock price manipulation the article was a big hit with progressive politicians like senator elizabeth warren d ma who is running for president 2 bill clinton inadvertently boosts stock compensation for top execs granted some corporate executives are paid too much and spend too much time boosting their stock prices purportedly under the banner of enhancing shareholder value they claim that high compensation and rising stock prices most of them are shareholders incent them to work hard to manage their companies very well ironically many became even bigger shareholders after president bill clinton changed the tax code in 1993 when he signed into law his first budget creating section 162 m of the internal revenue code this provision placed a 1 million limit on the amount that corporations could treat as a tax deductible expense for compensation paid to the top five executives this was later changed by the sec under bush to the top four execs it was hoped that would put an end to skyrocketing executive pay the law of unintended consequences trumped the new tax provision which had a huge flaw it exempted performance based pay such as stock options from the 1 million cap businesses started paying executives more in stock options and top executive pay continued to soar liberal critics notably senator warren concluded that the 1993 tax code change had backfired badly and that soaring executive pay has exacerbated income inequality 3 buybacks don t boost earnings per share the widely believed notion that buybacks boost earnings per share by reducing the share count isn t supported by the data s p provides for the companies it s true that from 2008 through 2017 s p 500 companies repurchased a whopping 4 trillion of their shares as the senators state in their op ed however the spread between the growth rates in s p 500 earnings per share and aggregate s p 500 earnings has been tiny since the start of the available data during q4 1994 to calculate per share earnings the s p divides aggregate earnings by a divisor which ensures that changes in shares outstanding capital actions and the addition or deletion of stocks in the index do not change the level of the price index fig 3 from the start of 2008 through the end of 2017 it is down just 2 6 or 0 3 per year on average that certainly doesn t support the notion that buybacks have reduced the share count meaningfully thus boosting earnings per share the best explanation for this surprising development is that the s p 500 companies are mostly buying back their shares to offset the dilution of their shares resulting from compensation paid in the form of stocks that vest over time not just for top executives but also for many other employees so the latest bull market has been driven by rising earnings but they haven t been artificially boosted on a per share basis by stock buybacks nevertheless buybacks might have provided a lift to stock prices since the buybacks occur in the open market while the issuance of stock as compensation has no immediate market impact especially if not yet vested rewarding workers what about the claim that corporations have been spending almost 100 of their profits on buybacks and dividends rather than expanding and improving their productive capacity and workforce it is factually accurate the problem is the claim s underlying assumption that the biggest source of corporate cash flow is profits rather it is depreciation allowances this is the corporate income that is sheltered from taxation to reflect the expenses incurred in replacing depreciating assets it s this cash that nonfinancial corporations nfcs mostly use for gross capital spending which rose to a new record high during q3 2018 and continues to rise in record high territory recent net capital spending by nfcs is comparable to levels in previous business cycle expansions though making such comparisons may understate the technological enhancements in current spending now i will consider the plight of all those workers whom schumer and sanders want to help 1 record employment and quits granted it took longer than usual for payroll employment to recover from the previous recession which was among the worst since world war ii however by may 2014 payroll employment did regain what was lost during the severe downturn it too has continued to move higher and hit 150 5 million during january surpassing the previous cyclical peak during january 2008 by 8 8 the has been running around just 4 0 since march 2018 job openings is at a record high exceeding the number of people unemployed since last march the quit rate is around record highs as workers have lots of alternative prospects for boosting their pay and their benefits 2 record income and consumption per household perhaps one of the biggest myths of all about our economy is that real incomes have stagnated for most americans over the past 15 20 years even donald trump often made this claim when he was running for president this assertion is based on one widely followed and extremely flawed inflation adjusted measure of median household income produced annually by the census bureau it is based on survey data focuses just on money income and is pre tax from q1 2000 through q4 2017 real gdp per household rose 19 7 yet over this same period the aforementioned income series which is available only on an annual basis rose just 2 2 that s stagnation for sure and implies significantly worsening inequality however there are numerous other inflation adjusted measures of household income and wages that are based on hard data and are broader in scope including non money government support programs like medicaid food stamps and tax credits they are up much more over the same period for example real personal income per household is up 27 0 before taxes and 29 9 after taxes skeptics will instantly pounce on the fact that these are means not medians so they might be upwardly biased by the enormous incomes of the ultra rich i doubt that as evidenced by real personal consumption per household up 28 1 the rich don t eat much more than the rest of us my basic assumption is that there aren t enough of them often dubbed the 1 for a reason to bias the mean series i ve constructed for personal income and consumption 3 record real wages and compensation there can be no disputing the fact that real wages haven t been stagnating at all notwithstanding the assertions of the two senators who want to help workers from the start of 2000 through the end of 2017 real average hourly earnings rose 17 3 i am using the series that applies only to production and nonsupervisory workers who tend to be rich only if they win the lottery they account for roughly 80 of all workers there s more total real compensation which includes wages salaries and benefits per worker using the household measure of employment rose 19 5 from the start of 2000 through the end of 2017 and was at a record high last year as were all the other measures mentioned above the inequality debate a july 2016 working paper authored by a team of economists three from the bureau of economic analysis and one from the university of michigan created a median measure of personal income the economists found that it grew by 4 0 from 2000 to 2012 while the census median money income fell 6 2 that s certainly a significant difference the study came to the following significant conclusion we show that for the period 2000 2012 inequality using personal income is substantively lower than inequality measured using census bureau money income and the trends in both inequality and median income are different this demonstrates the importance of using a national accounts based measure of income when examining the relationships between inequality and growth this extraordinary statement completely debunks using census money income to measure not only income inequality but also the standard of living the data cited above strongly suggest that the standard of living of the average american household hasn t stagnated and has increased along with real gdp since 2000 if so then income inequality hasn t worsened much if at all since then that doesn t mean that there isn t any income inequality but rather that it is just as bad now as it was back then but no worse remember that inequality was an issue under president clinton who addressed it by capping cash compensation at 1 million for top execs in 1993 the bull market in stocks undoubtedly has worsened wealth inequality since it started in early 2009 however lots of americans have benefited from the bull market through their pension programs at work including 401 k plans and individual retirement accounts iras the latest data available from the investment company institute show that in 2016 about 55 million american workers were active 401 k participants the value of their 401 k funds was 5 6 trillion as of september 30 2018 the fed compiles quarterly data on the value of all iras which rose to a record 9 3 trillion during q2 2018 up 5 7 trillion since the start of the bull market room for improvement progressives like senators schumer and sanders want to reduce corporate cronyism i wholeheartedly agree with them on that and i have some ideas on how to do so including limiting the number of boards on which an individual may serve and compiling a crony scoreboard to keep track corporate cronyism may become a bigger problem in my opinion because shareholders are losing their influence over corporate managers and boards as a result of the outflows from equity mutual funds into equity etfs active managers exert more shareholder influence over corporate governance issues than do passively managed funds there is certainly room for improvement in corporate governance on the other hand i see no need for regulating buybacks most corporate managers are driven to make their companies as successful as possible as evidenced by record earnings both on a per share basis and in aggregate america s free market capitalism continues to boost the prosperity of most americans in my opinion without more help from the government finally let s recognize that income and wealth inequality are inevitable consequences of a system of free market capitalism the rich do tend to get richer especially when the rest of us also prosper along with them since they benefit from consumers with more purchasing power to buy what their companies produce socialism does create more equality but that s because it tends to generate less growth for the economy and less prosperity for most people take your pick

the window for developing countries to progress by relying on cheap workforces to drive export growth is closing according to the mckinsey global institute the think tank fears that structural shifts in global trade patterns will make it ever harder for poorer countries to pursue rapid catch up economic growth via industrialisation the model followed by virtually every nation to have reached developed status as well as the likes of china and vietnam that are part way through the same process for decades fostering labour intensive manufacturing for export was seen as the best strategy for low income countries to climb the economic ladder now the window of opportunity is narrowing said susan lund a partner at the mckinsey global institute i don t think the window has completely closed for this development path but it is closing and in 10 years from now it s going to be very small she added the advantage of having a large low wage workforce is eroding as a result countries that have only just started to pursue labour intensive manufacturing for export such as tanzania and ethiopia may need to ramp it up immediately before the window of opportunity slams shut the warning follows that of eric lueth global emerging markets economist at legal general investment management who said last month that a lot of countries are being left behind as they succumb to premature deindustrialisation mckinsey s research suggests that the importance of labour cost arbitrage is declining in the most labour intensive goods manufacturing sectors such as textiles and apparel furniture and toys areas where more than two thirds of income goes to labour most of which is low skilled it found that just 43 per cent of trade in textiles and apparel was based on labour cost arbitrage in 2017 defined as exports from countries whose gdp per capita is a fifth or less than that of the importing country compared with 55 per cent in 2009 as the first chart shows for furniture toys and other labour intensive goods there has been a decline from 43 per cent to 35 per cent over the same period ms lund said the erosion on the importance of labour cost arbitrage was a surprising finding but it sits very well with what we hear from companies on the ground she cited the example of lincoln electric an ohio based manufacturer of welding products which has operations in china but as it has adopted more automated production technology has opted to expand in ohio instead as it is very automated the labour costs are a small part ms lund said although there is still a wage differential the cost is basically the same in ohio similarly adidas the german sportswear company has redesigned its footwear to make production less labour intensive and opened high tech speedfactories encompassing 3d printing robotic arms and computerised knitting in the us and germany reversing the trend whereby footwear manufacturing was largely offshored to low wage producers such as china indonesia and vietnam labour costs are not as important what companies are focusing on is speed to market particularly in textiles and apparel in an era of fast fashion ms lund said it s a blow to developing countries reshoring work back to the west also allows companies to have closer relationships with their suppliers in order to collaborate on materials and production processes while integrating the work of multiple suppliers for just in time sequencing becomes less fraught as well with china also bringing more of its supply chains inside its borders the net impact is that the importance of international trade has fallen mckinsey calculated that trade intensity the ratio of gross exports to gross input rose rapidly from 1995 to 2007 when it peaked at 28 1 per cent it has since fallen back to 22 5 per cent in addition to this trade has become more regional the share of goods traded within the same region fell from 51 per cent in 2000 to 45 per cent in 2012 mgi said but has rebounded to 47 7 per cent led by asia and europe this reduces the scope for emerging countries to sell to the rich west the benefits of a large low cost workforce are also being eroded by the increasingly knowledge intensive nature of global value chains mckinsey said across all value chains capitalised spending on research and development and intangible assets such as brands software and intellectual property has risen from 5 4 per cent of revenue in 2000 to 13 1 per cent in 2016 it found this greater emphasis on knowledge and intangibles favours countries with highly skilled labour forces an incremental shift in the global economy away from physical goods to services is another headwind for emerging markets while goods still dominate with gross trade of 17 3tn in 2017 compared to 5 1tn for services the latter has grown 60 per cent faster over the past decade moreover mckinsey argued this understated the importance of services given they account for about a third of the value that goes into traded manufactured goods in areas such as r d sales and marketing finance and human resources again this favours developed countries which ran a combined 479bn trade surplus in services in 2017 double that of a decade earlier as the second chart illustrates ms lund argued that while the trends were problematic for emerging markets as a whole some countries have been able to find a profitable niche some such as costa rica india and the philippines have excelled at exporting services however even this may not be enough with much of their success coming in automatable services such as call centres so i don t think that s very sustainable ms lund said she believed these countries would need to move into solving more complex customer problems if they wanted to maintain market share some other countries notably vietnam have succeeded in increasing labour intensive exports even as they has become less important on a global basis the greatest difficulties though may be faced in africa and latin america ms lund argued given low levels of intra regional trend in those continents in a world where supply chains are increasingly regionalised their challenge is to create markets with more economies of scale she said in africa that needs to be centred on regional blocs eg a west africa bloc centred on nigeria and a southern one centred on south africa east africa has gone the furthest in terms of creating a tariff free union i think that is going to be a big part of the solution for africa that and getting their birth rate down because they still have a young and rapidly growing population in many countries and then your gdp growth has to be so much higher to get people out of poverty one glimmer of hope may be the progress some north african countries such as morocco are making in labour intensive manufacturing such as in automotive parts for the european market just as the original north american free trade agreement helped spur the growth of mexico bound supply chains in central american countries outside of the nafta bloc ms lund was hopeful that sub saharan african countries could one day become suppliers to north african manufacturers producing goods for the european market financial times

m advised embassy staff did not meet qbt or other staff in relation to the tender and embassy staff have met and corresponded with a whole range of travel providers to discuss the embassy s travel requirements labor s jim chalmers responds that dfat has documented hockey s request the prime minister is denying something of which there are reports of documents which exist from officials in the department of foreign affairs and trade that is a very serious matter morrison shrugs it aside always he s got better things to do than be accountable he simply repeats his facile clapped out canberra bubble mantra nobody outside the canberra bubble cares about dodgy dirty deals or wanton profligacy scomo goes os no not to china where mystery shrouds major chinese port dalian s decision to ban further imports of australian coal that would require leadership and independence from trump s us china bashing policy he pays a flying visit to new zealand his maternal grandfather sandy s homeland but he s careful not to outstay his welcome not every kiwi is thrilled to see him given the coalition s deportation policy and not all former colleagues love him in 1998 morrison was inaugural managing director of new zealand s office of tourism and sport a body offering advice to government where he reported to nz tourism minister murray mccully but was not universally popular hard man scomo as he was seen takes credit for the 100 pure nz campaign for which he contracted m c saatchi whose services he sought for his later controversial campaign at tourism australia australia where the bloody hell are you morrison and mccully clashed with the independent nz tourism board and a number of officials and board members resigned during his tenure morrison himself resigned in 2000 one year before his contract was up as with helloworld travel or with his termination from tourism australia he himself has never given a satisfactory explanation in 1999 the nz auditor general challenged morrison s handling of an independent review and found two payouts of staff in 2008 to be unlawful the auditor s report was critical of morrison s job performance in ways that are echoed by the australian national audit office anao nine years later which finds his management of tourism australia marred by non consultation making unilateral decisions not observing due process and restricting board access to information little appears to have changed since not everyone hates him tim fischer is a big fan as is martin ferguson but fran bailey tourism minister at the time observes of morrison i m sure he s learned how to work with people better these days his career has certainly had a few twists and turns in his quick trip across the ditch friday morrison cops an earful from kiwi pm jacinda ardern about all the aussies born in new zealand his government is repatriating even though most have no family in the land of the long white shroud it s another diplomatic triumph as he cops a mouthful from ardern the nz herald reports ardern didn t mince words she employed the strongest criticism yet of any new zealand prime minister or foreign minister about deportations of kiwi offenders the new zealand people have a dim view of the deportation of people who move to australia as children and have grown up there with often little or no lasting connection to here ardern s referring to 1 500 nz citizens deported since 2015 coalition immigration reforms grant the department of home affairs power to deport foreigners on nebulous good character last year 600 kiwis were deported on this criterion alone it can be a death sentence in the last three years at least four people have died in australian detention centres where kiwis are now the largest group before 2015 they were not even in the top ten or they die immediately following deportation fatalities may be higher neither nation keeps records of deaths 15 000 kiwi citizens will be deported in the next ten years morrison is not receptive to ardern s appeals she will not give up nobody cares scomo for all your nihilism your trumpista populism the week sees the canberra bubble burst by a series of sensational revelations top of the bill is the hyper reality melodrama of hockey owes me a rip roaring cigar chomping trough snouting show of cronyism and corruption which mark dreyfus dubs chum gate in which joe hockey s bestie andrew burnes helloworld travel company appears set up to win a billion dollar government contract not all contracts are open especially when the commonwealth seeks procurement on manus island officials use a limited tender meaning no other bidders they have to they tell senate estimates there are no other bidders no one good wants the work yet this is a side issue as the australian financial review afr investigation puts it the committee wants to know how paladin despite its lack of capacity expertise or track record in the sector appointed as the government s main service provider on the island becoming the recipient of contracts worth 423 million over 22 months yet journalists at the afr quote locals who contest the government s version and who suggest there were others who would have liked to tender for the contract greens senator nick mckim gives home affairs a serve the paladin contracts and the unexplained increases yet again raise serious questions about lack of probity and due diligence inside home affairs it s an absolute disgrace that a shonky operator like paladin is raking in the millions while comprehensively failing to provide even the most basic support for many hundreds of vulnerable refugees former ceo craig coleman broadly agrees with mckim three weeks before they gained the contract he alleges paladin was not well prepared to perform the role provided for under the proposal he puts his view in documents he has filed with a court as part of an employment dispute with paladin home affairs cannot of course offer any insight and any further comment would be inappropriate given that the firm is to appear before a judge later in the year yet more news does emerge of the shadowy paladin group s receipt of over a420 million over two years a security firm is paid 1600 per refugee per day to pay locals to watch over men on manus who pose little threat of escape at least that s the theory news comes this week from two manus detainees that paladin does nothing winner of the victorian premier s literary prize behrouz boochani who has been held on manus for six years reports what i am seeing on the ground is that paladin they are doing nothing he tells guardian australia in australia people ask this question now but this question for us is for years not only for paladin but all of the companies how do they spend this money it is a question for us not only paladin ihms pih paladin is part of a pattern where major offshore processing contracts are awarded in a limited tender process home affairs deputy secretary cheryl anne moy explains to a senate estimates committee this week that companies are reluctant to run our gulags where human beings are illegally detained indefinitely without charge with no other cause than they desperately needed to flee their country of origin by boat instead of being part of the sixty thousand or so who successfully fly in with qantas and other airlines border protection or punishment it s sadistic cruelty primarily the people who expressed some interest early on and then decided that they wouldn t tender gave us the reason that there was too much noise for their organisations they were international companies around regional processing too much noise try a reluctance to be part of a punitive illegal scheme to deny refugees human rights dutton s mob is conceding that it can t find competent contractors because no one good wants to work on manus time to close the camps bring the men to australia let some take up residence in australia but shut down manus the guardian reports major flaws in the work of pacific international hospital pih a png healthcare provider which receives 21 5 million for ten months service from the australian government to look after men we placed on manus six years ago despite its chairman png deputy pm being found guilty of misconduct in the use of public funds more alarming pih s expertise competence and treatment standards are a grave cause for concern amongst refugees remaining on manus coroner terry ryan confirmed their worst fears during his 2016 coronial inquest into the death of twenty four year old hamid kehazaei who died in september 2014 from a treatable leg infection his inquest found that pih staff did not understand that kehazaei was critically ill despite hearing the alarms from his life support machines pih staff failure to respond directly contributed to kehazaei s subsequent cardiac arrest equally disturbing however bureaucrats failed to book him on the next available flight to brisbane as ryan reports an urgent transfer request from a doctor had languished while an immigration official queried why medication could not be sent to the detention centre instead and then referred the request to a superior who did not read it until the next day as the coalition prepares to take asylum seekers to christmas island for treatment will it follow coroner ryan s eight recommendations these include proposing that home affairs enact a new written policy which puts the clinical needs of detainees first when medical transfers required the approval of australian immigration officials ryan s 140 page report also recommends that clinics treating asylum seekers offshore be accredited to a level equivalent to royal australian college of general practitioners racgp standards he recommends the department of home affairs also conduct annual audits of clinics in conjunction with the racgp happily for the morrison government which has sensibly shut down parliament paladin is likely to be eclipsed by china the elephant in the news room and the dark shadow over hmas chum bucket s chartroom is of course china which we learn this week bans ship loads of australian coal at dalian a north east port where ninety per cent of our iron ore goes ashore from its posturing it s clear no one in government knows why china should give us the coal shoulder but suddenly everyone can explain it all away alarmed relax sheesh it s a hole in only one end of our trade flagship worth around 58bn the coal trade is australia s largest export earner next to iron ore 57bn in 2018 we exported 89 million tonnes of coal to china worth 15 billion almost a quarter of our nation s total coal exports now they ve suddenly cooled off on us despite our you beaut free trade agreements stuck five years ago then it s not a ban but just a slowing up of the process of unloading while quality control checks are carried out then it s a chinese whisper joke you were saying coal not cow right china s foreign ministry spokesman geng shuang has a laugh at our expense yet in the china daily he upbraids scomo for alleging that a sophisticated state actor read china is behind the recent hack attacks both on parliamentary computers and those of major political parties china daily responds by calling scott morrison a conspiracy theorist scomo is rebuked for his trump like public accusations and for being a us lackey or at least rashly irresponsible this is not the first time that canberra s anxiety driven willingness to emulate washington has prompted it to lay the responsibility for alleged spying at beijing s door no matter whether he was assigning the malevolent acts to china or another country it is irresponsible of him to cast aspersions in this way ian verrender reports a chinese go slow on coal imports began months ago dozens of coal laden ships are queued off ports across china as delays extend beyond 40 days five harbours are under dalian customs control but phillip lowe governor of our politicised reserve bank which even cautioned the morrison government to avoid any regulatory response to the banking royal commission which might put the brakes on lending to home buyers and businesses is quick to point out that it s only a few months of our exports a drop in the national coal bucket really on the other hand reserve bankers are masters of understatement the measured anti inflammatory anodyne if it were to be the sign of a deterioration in the underlying political relationship between australia and china that would be much more concerning nothing like a passive subjunctive construction to sound the non alarmist alarm given coal from russia and indonesia is still welcome in china our finest political minds work feverishly overnight to assure us not to take the ban personally this type of thing happens all the time there s nothing to see here in brief no one has a clue what s going on and china isn t about to enlighten anyone if it were a shrewd move to slow down coal consumption then others would be subject to the same bans and caps other commentators including verrender see the bans as serious despite involving about ten per cent of our coal exports dalian s indefinite ban on australian coal imports marks a significant deterioration in sino australian trade relations as greg jericho notes the incident exposes the coalition s spin about its free trade agreement with china revealed beneath the hyperbole is the vacuous rhetoric and the hollow promise of the free trade breakthrough a major step in cementing closer economic relations with china that would be the catalyst for even further mutual gain between our two countries raved our then foreign minister julie bishop in 2014 jericho calls bulldust had bishop tarried after her valedictory on thursday someone might have asked her how it could have gone so wrong john always look on the bright side noddy birmingham an underwhelming former education minister turned trade minister exudes insight and reassurance telling an anxious nation that it s not an all out ban whew not yet unlike the latest case against indefinite detention on manus and nauru just delivered to the high court prominent refugee lawyers are preparing to prick the government s latest thought bubble the moving of sick refugees and asylum seekers to christmas island in addition two new legal actions will also be heard in the high court explains acu allan myers professor of law spencer zifcak a former president of liberty victoria class action cases which argue that the commonwealth has acted negligently breached its duty of care the lawyers will argue that the negligence is constituted by crimes against humanity the commonwealth criminal code 1995 criminalises certain crimes against humanity recognised in international law these include imprisonment or other severe deprivations of liberty severe deprivation of a person s rights under the international covenant on civil and political rights these include freedom from cruel inhuman or degrading treatment freedom from arbitrary arrest the right to take a case before a court if deprived of liberty the presumption of innocence freedom of expression and freedom from national racial or religious discrimination inhumane treatment i e treatment engaged in intentionally that causes great suffering serious injury to body or to mental or physical health the argument is that the commonwealth government has committed each of these crimes offshore as for christmas island human rights law centre executive director hugh de kretser tells nine newspapers sydney morning herald the legal basis for a challenge would be that the government had breached its duty of care by sending refugees and asylum seekers to a place where inadequate treatment was available national justice project s george newhouse concedes a legal challenge over christmas island which has inadequate medical facilities is more likely to succeed than a challenge for those in offshore detention on nauru or manus while scomo is busy rehearsing his kiwi charm offensive friday labor also fires a warning shot across the bow of the chum bucket and upstages him the opposition s immigration spokesman minister shayne neumann tells aap labor if elected will accept new zealand s generous offer to resettle refugees with appropriate conditions similar to those under the us arrangements and negotiate other third country resettlement options as a priority labor reaffirms its pledge to accept new zealand s offer a strategic policy announcement which wedges scott morrison a puppet of his right wing into defending an immoral illegal and unsustainable punitive indefinite offshore detention regime on the grounds that any change to it is not in australia s interest opinion polls and the coalition defeat in wentworth suggest he s increasingly out of touch with popular opinion sixty per cent of voters polled by getup last thursday support medevac bill reports the guardian australia yet the nation so often learns of government by snafu it may become inured to scandal and incompetence paladin alone or chum gate alone would be sufficient to bring other governments down now there s dinnerplate the morrison government must navigate reefs of hazards as scandals arise from as far away as manus island and as near as the plush executive suites of our big bean counters head offices with their billion dollar sydney harbour views dinnerplate involves ceos from the nation s big four accountancy firms ey kpmg deloitte and pwc meeting regularly for private dinners as labor s shadow assistant treasurer and former anu economics professor andrew leigh discovers naturally such gatherings lend themselves to admiring the view praising the catering and appreciating the wine list but leigh s curious to know what else is on the menu and has asked to accc to look into the meetings allegations of price fixing collusion over fees and monopolising markets such as hayne found among our banks are not easy to prove doubtless the bean counters are celebrating their colossal good fortune in being blessed with a coalition government which has been prepared to pay them 1 7 billion between 2013 and 2017 for their services dining together may have in no small way contributed to any or all of the big four looking after their other three mates a similar cosy mutual self help arrangement also appears to have been part of the helloworld travel pitch although all parties vociferously deny any allegations of impropriety joe hockey our ambassador to the us and occasional trump golfing partner a former treasurer who once defended a hike in the petrol excise on the basis that poor people either don t own

notes that a yesterday it was revealed the finance minister received free flights to singapore from helloworld which he booked by calling the ceo of this asx listed company directly just before it was awarded a multimillion dollar whole of government contract by the minister s own department b today it s been reported that us ambassador joe hockey who has a million dollar shareholding in helloworld helped a helloworld subsidiary lobby for the embassy s travel contract c the ceo of helloworld and one of its largest shareholders andrew burnes is a liberal party heavyweight and current liberal party treasurer with connections to a number of liberal party politicians d the finance minister told senate estimates yesterday that he had a close personal relationship with mr burnes e mr burnes was previously a colleague of the now prime minister during the prime minister s time at tourism australia f since being awarded government contracts the share price of helloworld has skyrocketed making shareholders like mr hockey and mr burnes rich and g this morning it was reported that the herald sun asked almost all of the 82 liberal mps in parliament whether they had received free travel from helloworld but only 14 said they had not and 2 therefore calls on the prime minister to investigate and report to the house how far this helloworld scandal reaches into his government the pm hunches over his papers gets christopher pyne to answer luckily scomo s unplugging the nation s parliament for six weeks the coalition s lost the remote no one s seen it since morrison lost wentworth

disgruntled former executive russell carstensen the production is every bit as good as tampa 2 0 tampa 2 0 is modelled on the false assumption that john howard won in 2001 by getting commandos to prevent the tampa a norwegian vessel from docking at christmas island to put ashore 433 refugees it had rescued from the water the popular fiction is that tampa robbed labor of an easy election win in reality as statistician adrian beaumont and analyst peter brent point out the polls were closing after labor s 57 43 lead in march to 52 48 in august when howard denied tampa permission to its human cargo and while the coalition may have gained a two point lead from tampa it gained five points from september 11 gaining a 55 45 lead which abated to a 51 49 win in november and hmas chum bucket the

the effects of tariffs trade treaty in peril governors doing it for themselves governors don t expect to become experts on foreign affairs but focusing on international relations has become an increasingly prominent part of the job description as the trump administration seeks to renegotiate trade deals with countries around the world governors have been stepping up their own efforts to promote their states abroad acting as salesmen and women for home state companies and trying to bring in foreign investment appearances by foreign leaders have become almost a standing feature of national governors association events at the nga s winter meeting in washington this weekend governors met with provincial counterparts and trade officials from canada mexico and japan if their companies want to grow and expand and hire more citizens governors have to help their companies sell around the world as well as attracting new companies in their state said gary locke a former washington governor who was commerce secretary under president barack obama locke now serves as honorary chair of pass usmca a coalition lobbying for congress to ratify the united states mexico canada agreement a treaty president trump negotiated last year to update the 1993 north american free trade agreement or nafta white house economic adviser larry kudlow told the state leaders gathered in washington that passage of usmca will bring billions of dollars in new investment to america and update nafta for the digital age this is a huge priority for the united states and our administration he said kudlow sought to assure governors that despite his america first reputation trump supports international trade the president s view on trade free fair and reciprocal he said as part of an nga panel many of his critics some including my conservative friends have argued that he s a protectionist i don t believe that to be the case kudlow who directs the national economic council said the administration s goal ultimately is three zeros zero tariffs zero subsidies and zero non tariff barriers he described the president s policy of imposing import tariffs on friends and foes alike as a negotiating tool that has forced other countries to the negotiating table but both republican and democratic governors expressed concern about the pain their farmers and manufacturers are now experiencing while also questioning the logic that putting up trade barriers is the way ultimately to eliminate them our trade with the canadians is a huge part of our economy in michigan democratic gov gretchen whitmer said that s why anytime we see policy being decided on social media as opposed to a really thought out forward looking plan it s troubling governors proselytize around the world for the goods and services produced in their states while assuring foreign companies seeking new locations that their workers infrastructure and supply chains can t be beat mexico is arizona s no 1 trading partner and it s not even close it s times four said gop gov doug ducey who has established a close relationship with claudia pavlovich governor of the neighboring mexican state of sonora ducey backs passage of usmca and described himself as happy to hear a fresh expression of the president s support for trade i love the aspirational goal of no tariffs no subsidies and no barriers he says that s the definition of fair and free trade and i m supportive of that but some other governors remain nervous about the administration s approach republican gov gary herbert of utah suggested to kudlow that it s counterintuitive if you want to get to zero south dakota has been devastated by the trade wars that are going on that state s gop gov kristi noem said friday at a conference sponsored by politico kudlow defended the idea of three zeros as a useful goal but conceded it might not be achieved during his lifetime america first is a trump phrase a trump watchword absolutely kudlow said but he would argue that america first does not mean america alone usmca would bring canada mexico and the u s closer to having tariff free trade in agriculture the new agreement would require that a greater share of parts used to make vehicles in north america must themselves be manufactured on the continent it would also raise some labor standards throughout the trading area it s vitally important that the members of congress act on this as soon as possible said george allen who served as governor of virginia in the 1990s whatever you think of nafta this is an improvement but marc garneau canada s transport minister pleaded with governors to talk with trump about removing tariffs and other barriers canada will begin its ratification process next month he described usmca as a good deal but recalled that the president said he would remove tariffs on canadian steel and aluminum if canada renegotiated its trade arrangements with the u s that hasn t happened at this point those tariffs are an unnecessary tax that is weighing down on both countries garneau said this will present us with real challenges as we begin the process of ratification i don t know if we can get there trade missions have long been an important part of any governor s schedule but governors have stepped up their efforts recently at least partially in response to trump administration policies negotiations between subnational levels of government are becoming more routine governors can open a lot of doors for companies overseas major corporations have huge sophisticated sales teams noted locke the former washington governor but smaller companies can often use a boost governors are really just helping introduce these exporting companies small and medium businesses farmers to additional opportunities he said that cachet of a mayor or governor can go a long way to helping those medium sized companies times may change and administrations may do more to promote trade or hinder it but regardless of what s happening in washington governors have to act as the primary advocates for their own states said penny pritzker another commerce secretary in the obama administration at the end of the day the federal government can t prefer one state over another in trying to attract foreign direct investment pritzker said the states are going to have to go out and market themselves and market their strengths
business leaders who were instrumental in passing the state s last gas tax increase are wary of gov tim walz s plan to fix crumbling roads and bridges by asking minnesotans to pay 20 cents more per gallon the state must spend significantly more on its transportation system chamber of commerce presidents labor leaders and representatives from the agricultural and trucking industries said but exactly how to pay for it remains a matter of intense debate when the minnesota business partnership meets with walz this week executive director charlie weaver said the group will likely tell walz they agree with his goal then they will detail their opposition to a series of new costs for businesses outlined in the governor s budget proposal let s talk about this payroll tax and 12 weeks paid leave weaver said and if we can arrive at an agreement around these other issues that are expensive and burdensome to business then we can have a productive discussion around the gas tax walz a democrat set out a spending plan last week that included a 70 percent increase in the gas tax igniting debate across industries about how to improve transportation without overwhelming taxpayers and businesses minnesota has the 28th highest gas tax in the nation at 28 6 cents per gallon according to the tax foundation walz s proposal would move the state to fourth highest bringing in billions of additional dollars over the next decade the governor repeatedly talked about raising the gas tax on the campaign trail and when he debuted his full budget plan he said it is an idea voters endorsed in october an 800 person poll by the star tribune and minnesota public radio found 56 percent of respondents supported a 10 cent gas tax increase to build and maintain roads and bridges the poll did not ask about 20 cents this is not a choice between having a gas tax or not walz said it is a choice between living in a state with the best and safest transportation system in the country or living in a state with crumbling roads and bridges that risk our safety and keep away businesses the state s roads earned a d plus in the latest american society of civil engineers report card five of the 100 worst truck bottlenecks in the nation were in minnesota according to the american transportation research institute frustrations are growing and momentum is building to fix those problems but this year is different from 2008 when there had been a two decade gap since the last gas tax increase minnesota chamber of commerce president doug loon said with the interstate 35w bridge collapse as a catalyst and a concerted push by powerful business groups a contingent of republican legislators broke ranks that year they joined democrats to override then gov tim pawlenty s gas tax veto and passed an 8½ cent increase that was phased in over a number of years this year republican legislative leaders remain resolute in their opposition to a gas tax increase there are other ways to pay for transportation needs said senate majority leader paul gazelka r nisswa republican legislators proposed shifting revenue from sales taxes on auto parts and repairs and devoting that to roads and bridges the tax dollars currently go to the general fund and are used for a variety of government programs if we continue to take from the general fund we cannot invest in our children s education walz said house minority leader kurt daudt r crown said he thinks minnesotans consider 20 cents extreme in his district an hour north of the metro people often commute to the twin cities for work and spend a lot on gas daudt said the gas tax is one of the most regressive taxes you can put in place he said it hurts low income people much more than high income people and it s also something that hurts greater minnesota much more than it hurts the metro brainerd lakes chamber of commerce president matt kilian echoed daudt s concern about the disproportionate impact on rural communities where people drive longer distances and don t have the option of taking transit the increase would also affect their local economy he said because if people have to pay more to reach cabin country they will spend less on dining and activities when they arrive with a surplus in the state s budget kilian said the governor should not be looking to taxpayers for additional infrastructure money several groups like the minnesota farm bureau are particularly opposed to a crucial piece of walz s plan indexing the gas tax to inflation so it would automatically grow over time it s disingenuous not to account for inflation walz said if the state does not keep up with inflationary costs the upkeep of roads and bridges will fall behind he said resulting in more gridlock and potential catastrophes any increases should happen in a transparent way not automatically minnesota farm bureau president kevin paap countered minnesota trucking association president john hausladen said the walz administration s ability to pass the increase will depend on whether it can show specifically where the money will go why it s needed and how people will benefit the gas tax increase is just one of the ways the governor wants to raise money for transportation his plan also increases the vehicle registration tax and the motor vehicle sales tax that people pay when buying a car those changes along with the gas tax would generate about 11 billion over a decade according to budget estimates walz also wants the state to borrow more money for transportation and in the metro area he proposed residents pay a one eighth of 1 cent sales tax specifically for buses and transit to offset the various transportation cost increases walz is seeking a tax credit for lower and middle income families over time improvements to the transportation system would save people time and money on gas and repairs said kris fredson campaigns director of the minnesota chapter of the laborers international union of north america the union is advocating for the 20 cent gas tax increase the average twin cities driver spends about 41 hours a year in traffic at an average cost to the driver of 1 332 per year the american society of civil engineers report found with the population projected to grow that will get worse transportation commissioner margaret anderson kelliher said it would take a 16 cent gas tax increase just to cover debt service and maintenance costs any new roads and bridges and ability to move more freely in the system comes above 16 cents so this is not a pie in the sky proposal said anderson kelliher who was house speaker in 2008 and instrumental in passing the last gas tax increase for many minnesotans the demand for a certain road improvement project is critical and personal hwy 14 in southern minnesota which needs to be fully expanded to four lanes is one of those walz said his neighbor died on that highway patrick baker vice president of greater mankato growth inc said hwy 14 is one of the reasons his organization has not taken a firm stance opposing the gas tax every day the hwy 14 project is delayed he said more people are put at risk there are some businesses that are willing to take on that additional cost to make sure we can keep moving forward as an economy baker said i will say all of the other things that are surrounding the budget related to the cost of doing business really have them concerned and i think is going to get in the way of finding some sort of compromise on transportation
the united states government with the support of latin american governments in countries like brazil colombia and chile escalated a regime change operation against venezuela by attempting to force the delivery of humanitarian aid opposition groups targeted three border bridges that venezuelan government forces had no trouble defending which was possibly the plan the spectacle of force deployed to block what much of the world viewed as legitimate aid carried immense propaganda value trucks carrying aid on the were set on fire on the francisco de paula santander bridge that connects the towns of cucuta colombia and urenas venezuela gave the opposition the kind of horrifying imagery it wanted the blazing trucks were immediately blamed on venezuela national guard forces masked thugs civilians killed by live rounds and the burning of trucks carrying badly needed food and medicine john bolton national security adviser to president donald trump tweeted this has been maduro s response to peaceful efforts to help venezuelans countries that still recognize maduro should take note of what they are endorsing but it was not immediately clear what happened to the trucks and hours later it was reported that molotov cocktails made by the opposition were thrown at the trucks the red cross did not support this particular delivery of aid because of its political agenda and yet someone affixed the red cross emblem to a truck that was later seen on fire we ve learned that there are some people not affiliated with the missions in colombia and venezuela that are wearing red cross emblems at colombia venezuela and brazil venezuela border the international federation of red cross and red crescent societies tweeted we urge them to stop doing this they might mean well but they risk jeopardizing our neutrality impartiality and independence andy rosati a journalist with bloomberg reported three government buses were hijacked by masked protesters they set a bus on fire as they attempted to break a barricade formed by soldiers in urena there were also masked men who fired rounds at demonstrators near a bridge in san antonio according to rosati national guardsmen tear gas on the crowds at same time people are taking shelter behind trees and door entries chilean photographer nicole kramm was severely injured when a venezuela tank was hijacked by two individuals the individuals exited the tank and were welcomed by leaders of the opposition by the end of the day only a few dozen members of the venezuela armed forces defected even though this was one of the key objectives of the opposition there are around 230 000 people in the military in venezuela but the gambit did result in the venezuela closing off the vast majority of its border crossings anatoly kurmanaev a new york times reporter stated even north korea has more active border crossings in january after elliott abrams was appointed u s special envoy for venezuela he spoke about pushing venezuela military officers to defy maduro our hope is that they will be able to persuade maduro or they will simply disobey orders to continue the starvation of the people of venezuela abrams said kevin whitaker the u s ambassador to colombia contended a rebellion would possibly lead to maduro s ouster an outcome that would do more than anything else to improve living conditions inside the country abrams ordered planes carrying humanitarian aid to shuttle weapons to the right wing contras in nicaragua in the 1980s when he was working for the state department in president ronald reagan s administration days before the opposition attempted to force the delivery of aid abrams traveled with the supplies that were transported by u s military aircraft from florida to colombia around 20 million worth of aid or nearly 200 metric tons of supplies were transported more than a week before the opposition attempted to provoke the maduro government by forcing the delivery of aid secretary of state mike pompeo shared a photograph of the tienditas bridge at colombia venezuela border it showed two shipping containers and a fuel tanker those pushing regime change suggested maduro had purposely blocked the bridge however as cbc news in canada acknowledged the bridge has never been open would that bridge even be used to bring the aid into venezuela from colombia if it weren t blocked cbc news asked neutrality impartiality independence humanity and doing no harm the maduro government has allowed international support to be given to civil society organizations in venezuela which fight hunger and address shortages of medicine this includes the united nations central emergency response fund cerf and the directorate general for european civil protection and humanitarian aid operations echo as well as the world health organization who through the pan american health organization paho and the united nations international children s emergency fund unicef a joint statement from the washington office on latin america signed by dozens of venezuela organizations and a handful of international groups declared it is noteworthy that many of these same organizations have maintained a distance from current efforts to bring aid over the colombia venezuela and brazil venezuela borders instead they have stressed that humanitarian responses must follow standard humanitarian and protection principles including neutrality impartiality independence humanity and doing no harm these groups have distinguished humanitarian aid from other activities of political ideological or military nature out of a concern for the wellbeing of those most deeply affected by venezuela s crisis in their operations they have insisted on a strict emphasis on human rights and rejection of the use of force the statement added over 900 tons of food and medicine were delivered last week at a venezuela port in la guaira the aid came from china cuba india and turkey russia also delivered 300 tons of medicine and medical supplies the maduro government does not fear these countries will destabilize and advance regime change against the country nonetheless senators kamala harris and bernie sanders both 2020 democratic presidential candidates came out in support of the aid provocation the people of venezuela are enduring a serious humanitarian crisis sanders stated the maduro government must put the needs of its people first allow humanitarian aid into the country and refrain from violence against protesters the u s must immediately condemn maduro s violence against his own people there is no excuse for this harris declared the venezuelan military and security forces must demonstrate restraint venezuelans deserve a free and fair election and a peaceful transition of power harris also pledged if elected president she would extend temporary protected status tps to venezuelans it s the right thing to do america must show moral leadership in this hemisphere seemingly ignoring how u s actions are partly responsible for a growing refugee crisis hillary clinton former democratic presidential nominee i urge nicolas maduro to allow humanitarian aid inside venezuela s borders peacefully people are in need of life saving medicines children are subsisting on one meal a day and a peaceful delivery of food and supplies is to the benefit of all clinton backed a coup in honduras in 2009 when she was head of the state department she denied it was illegal when she ran for president in 2016 and when she published a paperback edition of her book hard choices the section she wrote on the coup for the hardback edition was deleted usaid was involved in the cia backed coup in chile in a press release the u s agency for international development usaid announced the aid transported by the u s military contained food for an estimated 2 000 people for one month it included medicine that could help 40 000 people hygiene kits for 35 000 people food kits for 5 000 people biscuits with vitamins and minerals for 10 000 school children and nutritional products for 10 000 malnourished children the supplies would last anywhere from one to three months all of it would be distributed by the opposition which is led by juan guaido who declared himself president in january and was immediately recognized by the trump administration usaid has a history of acting as a front for cia operations international police services inc was a training school for thousands of foreign policemen and part of an even larger police program that the cia ran in cooperation with usaid according to lawless state by morton halperin jerry berman robert borosage and christine marwick salvador allende was elected president of chile in late 1970 president richard nixon was furious and ordered the cia to make the economy scream usaid was involved in destabilizing the country before and after allende s election by 1970 loans by financial institutions controlled or dominated by the united states aid the export import bank the inter american development bank the international monetary fund and the world bank had given chile the highest per capita foreign debt in the world with the knowledge and encouragement of the united states government companies including anaconda copper and itt contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to anti allende candidates allende was overthrown in a cia backed coup on september 11 1973 that resulted in allende s death and a military takeover where general augusto pinochet appointed himself president there are over 25 million people in venezuela and the sanctions imposed by the trump administration have cut the country off from the international financial world this more than anything will greatly fuel a humanitarian crisis oil sanctions are effectively an embargo against the country in the 1990s iraq faced u s backed sanctions from the united nations on their oil exports as well as restrictions on other foreign trade to many it was one of the decade s great crimes because the sanctions contributed to the deaths of 500 000 iraqi children trump has apparently wanted to go to war with venezuela since 2017 they have all that oil and they re right on our back door he once said according to former acting fbi director andrew mccabe
amazon announced thursday that it is backing out of plans to open a new headquarters in new york city blaming state and local politicians who had opposed our presence and will not work with us the retail giant announced in november it would build a campus in the long island city neighborhood of queens for 25 000 employees fueled by 3 billion in state and city incentives to amazon after much thought and deliberation we ve decided not to move forward with our plans to build a headquarters for amazon in long island city queens the company statement said many activists said the project would worsen congestion in the area and lead to gentrification and higher housing prices the company put the blame for its decision squarely on the shoulders of politicians who had objected to the development and been critical of city and state leaders for offering amazon huge tax subsidies for amazon the commitment to build a new headquarters requires positive collaborative relationships with state and local elected officials who will be supportive over the long term new york gov andrew cuomo a booster of the amazon deal expressed anger that a small group of politicians put their own narrow interests above their community the amazon decision will prove costly to the state s economic future and the best interests of the people of this state the governor said in a statement but city council speaker corey johnson aimed his ire at amazon saying new york rejects vulture capitalism i look forward to working with companies that understand that if you re willing to engage with new yorkers and work through challenging issues johnson said in a statement i hope this is the start of a conversation about vulture capitalism and where our tax dollars are best spent new york mayor bill de blasio also blasted the retailer and said other businesses will fill any void from its canceled plans instead of working with the community amazon threw away that opportunity we have the best talent in the world and every day we are growing a stronger and fairer economy for everyone the mayor said state sen michael gianaris a democrat who represents the long island city neighborhood where amazon would have been said the company s action speaks for itself today s behavior by amazon shows why they would have been a bad partner for new york in any event according to gianaris rather than seriously engage with the community they proposed to profoundly change amazon continued its effort to shake down governments to get its way and u s rep alexandria ocasio cortez a democrat whose district borders long island city celebrated amazon s withdrawal i think it s incredible she told reporters in washington d c it shows that everyday americans still have the power to organize and fight for their communities she discounted the potential loss of amazon s promised 25 000 jobs saying that taxpayers would have had too subsidize those jobs the city was paying for those jobs in its announcement last year that it was coming to queens amazon said it was also building hubs in northern virginia and nashville now it will apparently focus its growth there and in its other existing locations with no plans to replace the now defunct new york project we do not intend to reopen the hq2 search at this time we will proceed as planned in northern virginia and nashville and we will continue to hire and grow across our 17 corporate offices and tech hubs in the u s and canada the company said nashville mayor david briley quickly assured his constituents thursday that amazon s plans to open an operations center with 5 000 jobs are still in place with no connection to the new york decision similarly in virginia arlington county board chairman christian dorsey said nothing has changed after speaking with an amazon representative earlier today we have confirmed that we are moving forward as planned with amazon s upcoming headquarters in arlington dorsey said earlier this week siena college released findings of a poll that showed that a clear majority of new york state residents approved of the amazon deal 56 percent to 36 percent and residents of the five boroughs were in favor 58 percent to 35 percent there was clear support for this siena college research institute director don levy told nbc news on thursday it s always tough to guess how angry people will be and how it s going to last but i think it s going to last awhile cynthia nixon who ran unsuccessfully against new york gov andrew cuomo in last year s democratic primary hailed amazon s stunning reversal amen the actress turned politician tweeted the fight against amazon laid bare their union busting corporate welfare ice abetting practices and shows why we need to break up monopolies like amazon zephyr teachout who ran unsuccessfully for state attorney general last year and nixon both accused amazon of working with law enforcement to develop facial recognition technology that could gather information from customers without them knowing it now let s get a congressional hearing on amazon labor ice monopsony how and why to break up amazon teachout tweeted just after amazon s announcement i know some people ready to testify amazon s stock price closed at 1 622 65 a share down 1 06 percent correction feb 14 2019 4 17 p m et a previous version of this article misstated the

this commentary being written on thursday february 21 is about troubling developments in haiti and the constraints upon the caribbean community caricom countries that prohibit them from playing a meaningful role in averting further violence since the time of writing the feared escalation might have occurred the 13 independent states that along with haiti comprise caricom have a vested interest in events in that country not least amongst these interests is the right that caricom membership bestows on haitian nationals to enter caricom countries without visas already several caricom countries have experienced haitians remaining illegally after their allowable six month stay has expired if economic conditions in haiti worsen as a consequence of deadly protests that have been continuous since february 7 haitians will continue to seek refuge everywhere of the caricom countries given its nearness to haiti the bahamas will be the first and biggest destination for haitian refugees placing a further strain on that country s capacity to cope with what is now an ongoing and mounting problem in the aftermath of the present wave of violent street protests as a humanitarian gesture and to its credit the bahamas government implemented a temporary halt on all haitian deportations but foreign minister darren henfield has stressed that the halt is only temporary and he suggested that caricom will need to discuss how as a region it can help haiti with its economic calamities and population migration of course the challenges that haiti poses for caricom countries relate not only to economic decay and refugees they are also directly connected to resolving the conflicts within the country and the process of governance once good governance is not institutionalised in a transparent manner conflict will continue and so too will economic decline and migration the economic crisis is worsening by the day inflation reached 15 in january amid the depreciating haitian currency against the us dollar on february 16 in an effort to stem the rising tide of mass discontent of people whose per capita income is the lowest in the region at us 789 prime minister jean henry céant announced nine measures including a 30 reduction in the price of rice a 30 reduction in the budget of the prime minister s office abolition of unnecessary privileges of senior state officials and promises to discuss improving the minimum wage it is left to be seen whether these measures will lower the political temperature and cool the heat of the mass protests few believe they will caricom cannot sit by if confrontation and violence escalate in haiti it has a responsibility to the haitian people and a duty to the people of its own countries and those of the wider hemisphere to offer its good offices to mediate difficulties further if caricom does not act none of its member states nor haiti can justifiably complain if other nations seek to intervene particularly as several such states have had to carry the burden both of peace keeping and delivering humanitarian assistance for decades conscious of this obligation to haiti and to the hemisphere caricom as a group has clearly indicated its concerns to the haitian government at several levels and expressed its readiness to be helpful the current chair of the caricom heads of government prime minister timothy harris of st kitts nevis published a statement on february 12 in which he stressed that the community calls for calm and a cessation of the violence appealing to all involved to engage in constructive dialogue and to respect the constitution the rule of law and democratic processes so that issues can be resolved in a peaceful atmosphere and allow for the return to a state of normalcy but caricom efforts to engage haiti have not yielded a positive response and neither caricom as an organisation nor any of its member states can do more than that to make the haitian authorities aware of their willingness to help they cannot impose themselves upon haiti especially as they strictly adhere to the principle of non interference in the internal affairs of states in part the lack of response to caricom s approaches originates in the prejudiced view of haiti s political elite and business class that caricom countries are a group of small states without the economic resources or political clout to matter haitian authorities are investing their attention on bigger nations particularly the united states and france and to a lesser extent canada these latter three countries along with the special representative of the united nations secretary general brazil germany spain the european union and the special representative of the organisation of american states comprise what is called the core group a group that has been active in haitian internal affairs albeit to the irritation of political parties this group has also called on haitian society actors and primarily the country s leaders to engage in a constructive and inclusive dialogue in order to identify and implement realistic and lasting solutions to the political and economic crisis facing haiti essentially in this statement they have said nothing different from caricom but they have also called for all electoral laws including a budget to be adopted to facilitate elections that are constitutionally due in october 2019 no one would quarrel with the importance of elections which are more easily achievable though not easy than another equally significant observation by the core group that observation is the government must accelerate its structural reforms aimed at promoting better management of the state s resources improve the living conditions of the most vulnerable fight inequalities and foster a conducive investment climate to stimulate the productive sectors essential to catalysing the country s economic growth that is much more easily said than done for haiti has demonstrated a pattern of both internal political conflict and resistance to external intervention in its affairs helping it therefore is no simple task helping it to implement the reforms outlined by the core group is a mammoth undertaking despite all this caricom must continue to offer its hand to haiti to help resolve its internal disorder caricom countries owe that effort as much to the history of black liberation as to creating conditions that would stem the flow of haitian refugees sir ronald sanders is ambassador of antigua and barbuda to the united states and the organisation of american states he is also a

a very good weekend for u s china trump delays 200 billion tariff increase to stop trade war and plans mar a lago summit with president xi president donald trump delayed an upcoming tariff increase ahead of its march 1 deadline to stop a billion dollar trade war escalation with china i will be delaying the u s increase in tariffs he tweeted assuming both sides make additional progress we will be planning a summit for president xi and myself at mar a lago to conclude an agreement he added trump has threatened to escalate the trade war by raising the 10 percent tariffs he s placed on 200 billion of chinese goods to 25 percent president donald trump on sunday delayed an upcoming tariff increase to stop a billion dollar trade war escalation with china and said he and chinese president xi jinping would hold a summit at mar a lago to conclude an agreement between the two economic super powers trump announced his decision in a pair of tweets sunday after negotiations between chinese and u s officials continued throughout the weekend to come to an agreement ahead of the march 1 deadline i am pleased to report that the u s has made substantial progress in our trade talks with china on important structural issues including intellectual property protection technology transfer agriculture services currency and many other issues as a result of these very trump wrote he added productive talks i will be delaying the u s increase in tariffs now scheduled for march 1 assuming both sides make additional progress we will be planning a summit for president xi and myself at mar a lago to conclude an agreement a very good weekend for u s china president donald trump on sunday delayed an upcoming tariff increase to stop a billion dollar trade war escalation with china trump and xi held an expanded bilateral meeting at the mar a lago estate last april trump has threatened to escalate the trade war between the two countries by raising the 10 percent tariffs he s placed on 200 billion of chinese goods to 25 percent if a deal wasn t reached by march 1 but he said said on friday there was a very good chance the united states would strike a deal with china to end their trade war and that he was inclined to extend his march 1 deadline to reach an agreement u s and chinese negotiators had made progress and would continued last week s round of negotiations through the weekend trump met his top negotiators and their counterpart chinese vice premier liu he at the white house on friday i think that we both feel there s a very good chance a deal will happen trump said extending the deadline would mean trump would put on hold a scheduled tariff increase to 25 percent from 10 percent on 200 billion of chinese imports into the united states that would prevent a further escalation in a trade war that has already disrupted commerce in goods worth hundreds of billions of dollars slowed global economic growth and roiled markets trump and treasury secretary steven mnuchin said the two sides had reached an agreement on currency trump declined to provide details but u s officials have long expressed concerns that china s yuan is undervalued giving china a trade advantage and partly offsetting u s tariffs the president said he would probably meet china s president xi jinping in march in florida and the biggest decisions on the terms of the trade deal could come when they meet xi sent a letter to trump which an aide to liu read out at the briefing on friday xi called on negotiators to work hard to strike a deal that benefits both trump indicated a deal with china may extend beyond trade to encompass chinese telecommunications companies huawei technologies and zte corp the justice department has accused huawei of conspiring to violate u s sanctions on iran and of stealing robotic technology from t mobile us inc chinese peer zte was last year prevented from buying essential components from u s firms after pleading guilty to similar charges crippling its operations trump has demanded that china and other top trade partners take action to balance trade with the united states china has pledged to increase purchases of agricultural produce energy semiconductors and industrial goods to reduce its trade surplus china committed to buying an additional 10 million metric tons of u s soybeans on friday u s agriculture secretary sonny perdue said on twitter the commitments are a show of good faith by the chinese and indications of more good news to come perdue wrote china was the top buyer of u s soybeans before the trade war but beijing s retaliatory tariffs on u s soybeans slashed business that had been worth 12 billion annually the president has used mar a lago as a diplomatic meeting ground before and he hosted xi there in 2017 although his breach in protocol was said to frustrate the chinese when xi visited mar a lago in april 2017 trump upended weeks of international negotiations by asking for an immediate one on one meeting with the chinese president trump and xi at mar a logo in april 2017 first lady melania trump and president donald trump pose with chinese president xi jinping and his wife peng liyuan upon their arrival to the mar a lago estate in april 2016 trump s florida estate mar a lago got a minute he reportedly asked xi and took him for a walk across the grounds much to the frustration of the chinese delegation who were unhappy with change in the carefully choreographed plans trump also hosted prime minister shinzō abe of japan there in february of 2017 the two leaders fit in a round of golf after their talks trump and xi agreed to a 90 day truce in the trade war at their december meeting at the g20 in argentina and negotiators have been in talks since that time if trump does implement his threatened increase on chinese goods beijing could retaliate on american goods and that could result in the president going through with his threat to add tariffs on at least an additional 267 billion of chinese products thus far most americans haven t felt the effects of the trade war as staples such as food and clothes have not been affected the u s china trade hostilities increased after trump entered the white house weakening both economies shaking financial markets and clouding the outlook for global trade analysts have held out little hope the two countries can reach a comprehensive deal over the next month at the heart of the conflict is the u s demand that beijing stop taking predatory actions from intellectual theft to the forced handover of technology by u s companies in a drive to become a global power in such fields as robotics and electric cars the trump administration also complains that beijing unfairly subsidizes its own tech companies china has denied that it deploys any such tactics
spread the love finance minister mthuli ncube has dismissed united states economist and currency expert steven hanke s claims the country s inflation was much higher than the official figures presented by authorities hanke recently put zimbabwe s inflation at 290 percent presenting it as second highest in the world after venezuela on the contrary the zimbabwe national statistics agency recently put the country s inflation rate at 57 percent briefing guests at a reserve bank of zimbabwe monetary policy review breakfast meeting last friday ncube expressed doubt over the methodology being employed by hanke in determining the country s inflation figures coming to issues being raised by hanke one has to know that there are many ways to calculate inflation in zimbabwe we have a very constant way of using the household basket to calculate inflation and that basket our inflation rate year on year is what it is as published he said ncube added hanke is using something else like the replacement cost approach to calculate inflation which is why he is coming up with much higher figures he must not spend time quarrelling with us we hear him we know it figures are what they are and there is no need to fight because figures are what they are because of different methods to calculate inflation the minister said what he only respected from hanke s findings was the message that inflation was something to worry about and hence needed to be dealt with zimbabwe s economy has been going through turbulence due to failure by government to expand the national cake lack of a stable currency and political instability in the past hanke has come under fire for his advocacy of currency board systems particularly from local government officials in countries where he has worked as an adviser as well as from rival economists for example former bulgarian bureaucrat krasimir angarski who was tasked with the introduction of the currency board has contested the often repeated claim that hanke is the father of the bulgarian currency board and has added that hanke had no knowledge of the currency board law because angarski refused to provide him the manuscript he was working on in 1969 steve hanke began his academic career as a water resource economist in the johns hopkins department of geography and environmental engineering now the department of environmental health and engineering a department founded by famed sanitary engineer abel wolman at the time the department was known as the premier water resource engineering department in the country and was home to world renowned sanitary engineer john c geyer with whom hanke would frequently collaborate in 1981 hanke was appointed a senior economist with the president s council of economic advisers where his responsibilities included the reagan white house s water portfolio while at the cea hanke led a team that re wrote the federal government s principles and guidelines for water and land related resources implementation studies to include more rigorous benefit cost analysis requirements share this share twitter facebook email linkedin reddit pinterest whatsapp like this like loading
the us and china haven t yet agreed on the critical issue of enforcement in a proposed currency deal that would ensure beijing lives up to its promise to not depreciate the yuan four people familiar with the matter said steven mnuchin on friday touted the currency pact as the strongest ever though he offered no details following two days of high level talks in washington between us and chinese officials the discussions were extended into the weekend in search of a broad trade deal to prevent the us from increasing tariffs on chinese goods next week president donald trump has previously accused china of gaming its currency to gain a competitive advantage though his treasury department has repeatedly declined to name the asian nation a manipulator in its semi annual reports on foreign exchange markets still the us asked china to keep the value of its currency the yuan stable as part of trade negotiations between the world s two largest economies if successful that would neutralize any effort by beijing to devalue its currency and make its exports cheaper to help counter american tariffs people familiar with the ongoing talks said this week as part of the talks china has offered to buy more american goods such as agricultural products and energy in a bid to meet trump s demand to shrink the us trade deficit the two sides are also still haggling over much deeper reforms to china s economy including addressing the alleged theft of intellectual property from us companies operating in china us trade representative robert lighthizer who is leading talks for the white house said on friday that the negotiators have made progress on structural issues related to the chinese economy but still face obstacles we have major hurdles he added neither the treasury nor ustr responded immediately saturday to a request for comment on the currency negotiations trump has said he will need to finalize any trade deal directly with chinese president xi jinping mnuchin said this week that a leaders meeting for late march at trump s mar a lago resort in florida is being tentatively planned the success of the currency pledge hinges on what enforcement mechanism the two countries decide on for the entire agreement two of the people said lighthizer has said any deal with china needs to contain a strong enforcement mechanism to ensure long lasting changes to the trading relationship the white house has complained that beijing has failed to follow through on its pledges to carry out reforms under previous administrations two people familiar with the talks said an option under discussion to enforce the agreement is the possibility for the us to increase tariffs on chinese goods if beijing breaks its word currency moves have become part of the discussions over trade by the trump administration the us secured a currency pact in the new north american free trade agreement with mexico and canada and has said it will seek similar commitments in future trade deals china s yuan fell over 5 per cent in 2018 as trade tensions boiled over raising speculation that beijing was deliberately weakening its currency to offset the impact of tariffs the yuan has rebounded nearly 2 per cent year to date after sliding to a decade low against the dollar in late october

the u s and china haven t yet agreed on the critical issue of enforcement in a proposed currency deal that would ensure beijing lives up to its promise to not depreciate the yuan four people familiar with the matter said treasury secretary steven mnuchin on friday touted the currency pact as the strongest ever though he offered no details following two days of high level talks in washington between u s and chinese officials the discussions were extended into the weekend in search of a broad trade deal to prevent the u s from increasing tariffs on chinese goods next week president donald trump has previously accused china of gaming its currency to gain a competitive advantage though his treasury department has repeatedly declined to name the asian nation a manipulator in its semi annual reports on foreign exchange markets still the u s asked china to keep the value of its currency the yuan stable as part of trade negotiations between the world s two largest economies if successful that would neutralize any effort by beijing to devalue its currency and make its exports cheaper to help counter american tariffs people familiar with the ongoing talks said this week read how do lenders determine your personal loan eligibility as part of the talks china has offered to buy more american goods such as agricultural products and energy in a bid to meet trump s demand to shrink the u s trade deficit the two sides are also still haggling over much deeper reforms to china s economy including addressing the alleged theft of intellectual property from u s companies operating in china major hurdles u s trade representative robert lighthizer who is leading talks for the white house said on friday that the negotiators have made progress on structural issues related to the chinese economy but still face obstacles we have major hurdles he added neither the treasury nor ustr responded immediately saturday to a request for comment on the currency negotiations trump has said he will need to finalize any trade deal directly with chinese president xi jinping mnuchin said this week that a leaders meeting for late march at trump s mar a lago resort in florida is being tentatively planned the success of the currency pledge hinges on what enforcement mechanism the two countries decide on for the entire agreement two of the people said lighthizer has said any deal with china needs to contain a strong enforcement mechanism to ensure long lasting changes to the trading relationship the white house has complained that beijing has failed to follow through on its pledges to carry out reforms under previous administrations also read india vs australia t20 series 2019 when and where to watch 1st t20i live match live telecast live streaming two people familiar with the talks said an option under discussion to enforce the agreement is the possibility for the u s to increase tariffs on chinese goods if beijing breaks its word currency moves have become part of the discussions over trade by the trump administration the u s secured a currency pact in the new north american free trade agreement with mexico and canada and has said it will seek similar commitments in future trade deals china s yuan fell over 5 per cent in 2018 as trade tensions boiled over raising speculation that beijing was deliberately weakening its currency to offset the impact of tariffs the yuan has rebounded nearly 2 percent year to date after sliding to a decade low against the dollar in late october
with chinese help pakistan has succeeded in expanding its military industrial base which is also a core saudi initiative under vision 2030 saudi arabia has been one of the united states closest allies for years but some recent tiffs seem to have disrupted bilateral relations excessive regulations on nuclear technology transfer by the us apparently to protect the interests of its peerless partner israel were a factor here riyadh does not have a nuclear bomb and it is also a npt signatory however it has established a nuclear research center king abdullah city for atomic and renewable energy ka care in 2010 to meet the country s energy and water needs in an interview with us television last march crown prince muhammad bin salman mbs said that his country isn t interested in acquiring a nuclear bomb but if tehran develops such a weapon riyadh will follow suit recently us deputy energy secretary dan brouillette said that the us would not help saudi arabia to develop nuclear technology without guarantees that it would only be used for civilian purposes adding as you know this technology has a dual use and in the wrong hands it becomes a dangerous dangerous world former intelligence services chief and senior saudi diplomat prince turki al faisal strongly reacted to brouillette comments voicing that saudi arabia has options for nuclear technology other than the us the former ambassador to the us and uk uttered that the energy market is open we have france we have russia we have china we have our friends in pakistan and in other places as well so if they want to remove themselves from that market well that s up to them in a recent interview the prince also decried prime minister pm benjamin netanyahu for deceiving the israeli public by having them believe that palestine is a dead issue we don t need mr netanyahu to tell us the dangers that iran poses we see it on our grounds he added the saudi diplomatic assaults comes at a time when there is a growing conviction in washington defense circles that saudi arabia is pursuing a missile program with the help of china and pakistan cuing a major saudi policy shift towards the east and hinting at a potential divergence from the us speaking to the cnbc a former pentagon official michael rubin indicted that the whiplash policy changes in washington have had negative impact in riyadh saudi authorities are no longer going to be constrained by white house whispers the saudis are demonstrating that they can take matters into their own hands with chinese help pakistan has succeeded in expanding its military industrial base which is also a core saudi initiative under vision 2030 saudi arabia does not possess weapons of mass destruction either it however bought a limited quantity of ballistic missiles of chinese origin in 1988 more recently it is in discussions to procure medium range missiles from pakistan these missiles are capable of carrying nuclear warheads but no evidence was found that the saudis were interested in nuclear weapons saudi arabia has always been a friend in need for pakistan it is widely believed that riyadh has bankrolled the pakistan nuclear program the kingdom is the home of 2 5 million pakistani expatriates and is also the largest source of foreign remittances in pakistan pakistan has a long history of us sanctions economic fragility and balance of payments crises after sanctions were slapped on pakistan following nuclear tests in may 1998 riyadh immediately came to rescue pakistan s vulnerable economy and provided 50 000 barrels of oil a day free of cost it provided 1 5 billion in 2015 to shore up pakistan s foreign exchange reserves and again in 2018 saudi arabia was the first country to have pledged 3 billion already received on concessionary terms the recent investment of 20 billion is just the latest example of the unique deep and durable brotherly relations between the two countries unlike the us riyadh has never grilled pakistan with you re with us or against us type ultimatums in return for its recurrent support for pakistan saudi arabia expects islamabad to protect the kingdom in case it faces any threat to its national security pakistan has unvaryingly responded to the kingdom s requests by stationing its troops for the kingdom s security as riyadh is tailing an indigenous missile and defense program islamabad can be instrumental to help saudi arabia in realising in its ambitious plan taking advantage from its strong military ties with time tested friend beijing and at a time when saudi arabia is battered by washington s erratic policies china has already been saudi arabia s biggest trade partner since 2013 in 2017 bilateral trade between the two reached about 50 billion beijing has also welcomed riyadh s announcement to join cpec a vital economic and strategic project that will have significant consequences in the region in october trump warned saudi arabia s king salman that he would not last in power for two weeks without the backing of the us military saying king we re protecting you you might not be there for two weeks without us you have to pay for your military taking all the protective measures riyadh is now on a quest to find new partners particularly in the defense sector it has much to gain from pakistan s defense experiences after it was abandoned by the us with chinese help pakistan has succeeded in expanding its military industrial base which is also a core saudi initiative under vision 2030 this also leaves china with an enormous opportunity to gain greater access to the substantial middle east defense market capitalising on the deep routed saudi pak ties saudi arabia is repairing its ties with russia too in october 2017 king salman made his first ever visit to moscow and signed preliminary agreements for buying s 400 air missile defense systems kornet anti tank missile systems and other defense equipment the king s visit could have been facilitated by pakistan after islamabad decided to mend its bonds with moscow over us military sanctions in june 2015 pakistan s then army chief general raheel sharif visited the kremlin to initiate the process of thawing pak russo relations all these developments will have a long term global impacts since these regions contain the most emerging markets of the world under the given geo strategic circumstances the world could soon witness a new pak saudi sino russo strategic and economic bloc the author is working in a private organization as a market business analyst and is writes on domestic

grace shields center wears a personalized cap during the graduation ceremonies at university of pittsburgh at johnstown pa on saturday april 25 2015 as aaron seigh left and timi shiock right look on ap photo the tribune democrat thomas slusser read more debt valley is an occasional series looking at student loan debt in the philadelphia region every 28 seconds a student in america defaults on a college loan by the time you finish reading these next three paragraphs another young person will have slipped into default an event that destroys credit may delay marriage and children home and car purchases and even change the course of one s life despite a booming u s economy and historically low unemployment college graduates are defaulting on school debt at a rate exceeding 10 percent within the last three years but the white house says that over the coming decades more than 23 percent of undergraduates could default on loans issued this year and one well regarded economist recently pegged the ultimate default rate even higher at 40 percent as costs for graduate and undergraduate school climb skyward advertisement what s the wildest thing you ve done to pay off your student loan share your story with us at audience philly com and we may feature it in an upcoming article college debt has long been cyclical rising after recessions but in recent years college debt has been on a sustained upward trajectory even in good times forty four million americans have currently racked up 1 4 trillion in student loans tripling the total from 2005 education debt now surpasses credit card debt and car loans and trails only home mortgages more than eight million student borrowers are now in default the government says and up to 30 percent of borrowers are thought to be having problems repaying their loans the delaware valley represents a ground zero for america s student loan crisis as pennsylvania graduates rank no 1 in the nation for student debt load with an average 36 193 loan balance followed by delaware and new jersey at third and 12th respectively a recent study shows penn state one of the state s flagship universities ranks among the most expensive public colleges in the nation leaving a trail of indebted graduates especially from its satellite campuses two of the country s largest loan servicers navient and pheaa the pennsylvania higher education assistance agency are based in wilmington and harrisburg respectively both are routinely lambasted for bad customer service and are facing lawsuits from attorneys general and plaintiffs lawyers asserting that they steer borrowers into costly loans and fail to give them the financial relief they are legally entitled to decades ago students could discharge loans in bankruptcy but in 1984 congress exempted government student loans from bankruptcy and put similar restrictions on private loans in 2005 that means that student debt now cannot be excused except under dire circumstances like death and disability and if not repaid student loans keep growing from the interest creating a cancerous burden that can trap a person in poverty the student debt crisis has already begun curtailing the economic prospects of a generation causing delays in achieving career goals making charity donations and saving for retirement concludes a survey this month by the nonprofit student debt crisis when you put the word student in front of the word loan people think it s harmless or somehow it s not a real financial product nothing could be further from the truth said seth frotman former ombudsman for the consumer finance protection bureau who quit in protest over the trump administration s policies and is now fighting for student borrower protections when struggling borrowers fall victim to a rigged system we treat them like tax cheats and dead beat parents by bringing the full weight of government to bear driving them into poverty by garnishing wages and seizing benefits what follows is the first in an occasional series of articles describing a region where student debt holds far reaching consequences for individuals and the economy some highlights student debt is now spilling across generations some people in low or modest paying jobs are paying off their college loans even as their children chalk up similar debts the federal government can garnish wages including social security to collect on student loans as a result growing numbers of elderly recipients are having their social security checks garnished for loan repayments many government options to help defaulters aren t working the public service loan forgiveness program which can limit remaining debt for teachers nurses and others doing public service after 10 years is so broken that congress just mandated 350 million to fix it ninety eight percent of borrowers who applied for forgiveness since october 2017 have been rejected a federal audit showed for profit institutions have the worst results for student defaults a student loan is considered in default after a borrower stops making payments for about a year students who take out loans and fail to graduate may be most at risk they lack the cachet of a degree harming their chances for jobs all while their loans continue to grow life on hold much of the cost of students loans is invisible it s what does not happen that can be important young americans delay purchasing homes don t repair homes they ve already bought or never start small businesses they don t get married have children or save for retirement student debt has depressed home ownership among young americans pretty substantially said zachary bleemer research associate at the center for studies in higher education at the university of california berkeley he blamed the spectacular increase in the cost of attending universities for the debt thirty year olds are about 30 percent less likely to be homeowners than they were 15 years ago bleemer said bleemer pointed to broader ramifications for the housing industry if you re 28 and you are not buying a home then those who are 35 can t sell there is good reason to believe that student debt has moved up the chain to affect housing overall he said small business formation also may decline because of college debt as people go through life they take on debt to do things said brent ambrose a business professor at penn state but if you have used up part of that debt capacity you may not be able to borrow more to start a new business in a paper cited by government economists ambrose showed that above average student debt can dampen new business formation by 14 percent former students also can run up credit card debt and miss out on job opportunities while their loans keep growing said economist dubravka ritter at the philadelphia federal reserve it s a slow grind in terms of the repercussions she said ritter could have been talking about philadelphia resident nicole newman who graduated from the university of maryland in 2000 with an mba and 32 000 in student loans but then life intervened her internet marketing start up got swamped by the recession the best job she could get back then was with a nonprofit encouraging prospective entrepreneurs but she couldn t afford the loan payments as she raised a family today those loans after years of deferment or not paying them and now a monthly payment that doesn t cover the accruing interest have soared to 69 000 more than double her starting amount i feel like it was a booby trap newman 45 said of her education newman now has similar concerns about her daughter who is looking at colleges and has been offered a financial package from a pennsylvania institution with significant loans on both mother and daughter i don t want her 45 and 69 000 in debt she said that is just repeating the cycle loan service lawsuits though u s lawmakers have enacted repayment options and even loan forgiveness the administration of those programs has been rife with mismanagement critics say many student debtors are startled to discover that their loans continue to rise despite their monthly payments two of the biggest student loan servicers the groups that manage and collect monthly student loan payments are navient a publicly traded company and a little known state agency called pheaa which together service 47 percent of the nation s 1 4 trillion in student loans most student borrowers know them on their monthly statements as navient and fedloan other servicers include mohela and the recently merged great lakes nelnet in 2016 navient was prepared to pay 1 billion to settle a three year investigation by the consumer financial protection bureau over claims that the company misled borrowers and made other mistakes servicing federal loans according to the new york times but the settlement broke down after donald trump was elected president in late 2016 and the agency signaled it would loosen regulations for the industry the new york times reported several state attorneys general have since filed suits to press their own claims one federal suit by pennsylvania attorney general josh shapiro asserts that navient steered borrowers into predatory loans with high interest rates and costly origination fees it also incentivized its staff to push costlier loans that saddled borrowers with 4 billion in unnecessary interest the suit says a navient spokesperson disputes the allegations saying that its incentive program was misconstrued and that it will prevail in court get in touch are you a current or former employee at navient of the pennsylvania higher education assistance agency with a story to tell us of the student debt crisis contact us confidentially here in august 2017 the massachusetts attorney general filed similar charges against pheaa claiming that it has overcharged student borrowers and misprocessed loans saddling borrowers with additional debt pheaa has consistently shifted the consequences of the flaws in its servicing system and its processing failures onto the borrowers themselves the suit says pheaa spokesperson keith new denied the allegations and referred questions on its servicing to the education department which said it was working with fedloan servicing to improve customers experience and outcomes if anyone can get good results from loan servicers it s catherine martin a staff attorney with community legal services in north philadelphia martin deals with consumer debt issues she borrowed more than 100 000 to put herself through the university of virginia school of law and graduated in 2015 her servicer fedloan servicing run by pheaa consistently made mistakes she said and her loan record was plagued with errors every time i got on the phone with somebody they were disempowered to fix it she said fedloan mistakenly recalculated her monthly payment to 2 500 instead or about 10 times what it should have been or what she could afford based on her income based repayment plan she said martin documented making 17 phone calls over five months she said her barrage of calls has mostly fixed the problem though she still expects it will eventually cost her several extra thousand dollars on her ultimate repayment i am an attorney who actually is used to dealing with banks and municipalities on taxes and consumer collection agencies for consumer debts and i am struggling to get through this martin said i don t see how anybody deals with these problems empowered in an intergenerational aspect to the crisis adult student debt holders in low or modest paying jobs such as philadelphia police officers emts nurses public or charter school teachers are still paying off their school loans as their children enter college my kid will be out of college and i will still be paying my undergraduate loans back said danielle murray 40 a reading specialist at the gilbert spruance elementary school in philadelphia murray graduated with an undergraduate degree from temple university in 2002 and a master s in 2005 from holy family university with 32 000 in loans murray consolidated her debts about a decade ago under a 20 year repayment plan expecting that after 10 years of working in the philadelphia schools she would qualify for the public loan forgiveness program this erases federal student loans for individuals who work in lower pay high need jobs such as schoolteachers in poor areas but when she called her loan servicer about qualifying for the program that person said she was enrolled in the wrong program she needed to be part of an income based repayment program not a 20 year repayment program because of that she lost all her time toward earning forgiveness and had to start over her 32 000 in loans has declined to 20 406 after a decade of payments but now she will be paying her loans well into the 2020s her son will begin college in a few years i am going to try and get him through college without loans but it will be difficult she said nursing school dropout college dropouts may the hardest hit according to research from the university of pennsylvania they leave school with no degree but plenty of debt and sometimes disputes arise with the schools danielle infantino left drexel after two years and a debt balance of close to 60 000 after learning that she would have to pay an additional 17 000 for summer nursing classes drexel sent her an aid package for the year and a price then claimed it was a mistake it was quoted for only three quarters the second year of classes they had made the same mistake again we all knew that we had summer classes and they were supposed to be built into our financial aid package and i didn t have the financial aid to cover it infantino said other students took out loans quickly to cover the balance but infantino couldn t afford more debt infantino 24 left philadelphia this past summer moving back in with her mother in valley stream n y while working and applying to local nursing programs drexel spokesperson niki gianakaris responded to infantino s case four students enrolled in the program received 100 percent of their financial aid for the 2017 2018 academic year over three terms rather than four leaving them with little or no aid for the summer the university worked with students who reached out for additional assistance to cover expenses for the fourth term students who didn t pass the course weren t able to immediately retake it because both sections were already at capacity she said debt valley among publicly supported or flagship universities students who graduate from penn state temple and lincoln universities hold some of the highest debt in the nation helping make this region a veritable debt valley for college students those at satellite campuses did especially poorly penn state state shenango grads left school with 45 746 in debt while penn state hazleton grads left with 45 703 in debt and penn state harrisburg s average debt totaled 42 315 but penn state university park totaled 37 307 in debt according to lendedu com s latest data penn state spokesperson lisa marie powers said the university believed lendedu s methodology was flawed as it treated all penn state campuses as stand alone institutions from which students do not move their enrollment she added that students not only change their campuses in pursuing their academic careers but also may transition between part and full time during their studies and therefore require additional semesters to complete their degrees the skyrocketing cost of college education up nearly 400 percent in the last 30 years is the primary reason student debt has surpassed auto loan debt and credit card debt said ryan keene vice president of lending at the philadelphia area ardent credit union at the same time state funding for higher education has been unable to keep pace per student funding in pennsylvania fell more than 30 percent from 2008 to 2017 while the cost of tuition at public universities in the keystone state has risen 22 5 percent over the same time period he noted given all the pressures judith scott clayton associate professor at columbia university s teachers college estimates that we could reach up to 40 percent experiencing a default after 20 years public colleges with the highest average debt nineteen of the 25 public colleges with the highest average student debt per borrower are in pennsylvania or new jersey twelve of the schools on the list are part of the penn state university system staff graphic unquantifiable at least at this point is the psychic damage from student debt the stress the anxiety the time and energy that borrowers have to devote to get out of trouble she said the college debt system needs to be streamlined and simplified adds scott clayton so that students do not have to navigate this bureaucracy of paperwork meanwhile aarp the chief lobbying group for senior citizens has been pressuring the federal government to stop garnishing the social security benefits of older borrowers who defaulted on their loans one disturbing statistic from the government accountability office in 2014 3 percent of social security recipients had their benefits checks garnished for student loan repayments student debt among seniors has risen fourfold in the last decade currently 66 billion according to sage scholars we consider it a looming threat lori trawinski director of banking and finance at the aarp public policy institute told politico solutions the class of 2017 saw that average student debt per borrower ranged from a low of 18 425 in utah to a high of 36 193 in pennsylvania according to lendedu com mike brown of lendedu tracks student debt he graduated in 2016 from the university of delaware with a degree in history political science and roughly 30 000 in loans he pays about 300 a month on several federal loans at interest rates ranging from 3 15 percent to 4 4 percent once i graduated my mom said you re taking over your loans said the jersey city n j native his employer pays an additional 200 a month on his student loans for a total of 500 a month a benefit he calls amazing it s basically additional income more employers are offering millennials this workplace benefit a recent irs private letter ruling makes it easier for employers to help workers save while paying off student loans employers can now make 401 k contributions into accounts of employees who are also repaying student loans some universities are picking up the fight against student loan debt the university of pittsburgh this year has allocated 1 million to fund panthers forward aimed at reducing student loan debt for 5 000 toward federal student loan balances 150 seniors at pitt will be asked but not required to pay it forward via monthly contributions after they graduate pitt s tuition and board for arts and sciences students totals roughly 28 000 for in state and 41 000 for out of state students money the grads pay back will be reinvested to support current students and sustain the program full time students in good standing are eligible for panthers forward and must have received a federal loan to help finance their senior year it feels better it s students helping students and it eliminates more troubling aspects of student loans said pitt chancellor patrick gallagher the bulk of the student debt in the 1 4 trillion is from graduate and professional students and in the for profit college space gallagher said he noted that the default rate is highest for students who don t complete that s mostly for poor performing schools and some that are more predatory that s why there s been such a public policy outcry tim alexander vice president of the association of independent colleges and universities of pennsylvania is spearheading income share agreements isas a new model that reduces up front tuition costs in exchange for taking a set percentage of income after graduation purdue university s back a boiler program is perhaps best known but other schools including pennsylvania s lackawanna college and messiah college have income share programs to help implement this aicup is working with the education technology company vemo which partners directly with schools to help them design income share agreements start up businesses are also embracing technology to help younger americans and their parents navigate the student loan labyrinth newtown square based payfored last month launched a software program for financial planners to sort out the best options for paying back student loans it is the first student loan repayment tool that helps recent graduates married couples and engaged couples navigate their various student loan repayment and forgiveness options maintained founder fred amrein most people don t realize there are over 126 combinations of repayment options for a single person and a married couple what lengths have you gone to pay off your student loan we want to hear from you send your story to audience philly com and we may feature it in an article
by chris slee february 24 2019 links international journal of socialist renewal in 1949 the chinese communist party cp led by mao zedong came to power after more than 20 years of war they had fought against the reactionary chiang kai shek regime and against the japanese invasion of china for a time there was an alliance between the cp and chiang kai shek against japan but this ended when japan was defeated the cp based in rural areas won the support of the peasants through land reform and other progressive measures this enabled them to win the war despite us military aid to chiang kai shek initially the revolution was intended to be democratic not socialist those capitalists who had not been closely associated with chiang kai shek were allowed to continue in business but after the outbreak of the korean war in 1950 there was a change the party s policy became more radical workers were mobilised to investigate their employers looking for things like tax evasion theft of state property etc bosses were brought before mass meetings and confronted with accusations by their workers in october 1953 the cp stated that its policy was one of transition to socialism by 1956 nearly all capitalist property had been nationalised in the countryside agricultural cooperatives began to be formed later there was a push to create collective farms social gains the early years of the revolution brought big gains for the chinese people health and education were greatly improved prior to the revolution a large proportion of the people lived on the brink of starvation epidemics killed thousands every year while there were no reliable statistics one estimate of the average life expectancy in china was 28 years another estimate was 35 years by 1981 life expectancy had risen to 69 6 years for women and 67 0 for men massive campaigns of vaccination and public health education stepped up medical training and widely distributed health services virtually wiped out many diseases that were rampant in the past medical services were brought to rural areas which had not previously seen a doctor the number of doctors was rapidly expanded and rural people were trained as paramedics known as barefoot doctors who could provide a basic level of health care to their neighbours urban workers also benefited from the revolution in addition to the health and literacy programs they gained job security and other benefits such as housing supplied by their enterprise bureaucratic regime however the transition to socialism was hindered both by objective conditions including the backwardness of china and the pressures of imperialism and by the bureaucratic nature of the cp the state created by the revolution was a bureaucratised socialist state in 1956 the chinese government adopted a system of ranks for state employees that included 30 grades with the top grade receiving 28 times the pay of the bottom grade in addition to their salaries higher level party and state officials had special housing cars drivers personal servants meals travel etc the cp used repression against people who supported the revolution but disagreed with some of the government s policies in 1956 following khrushchev s speech denouncing stalin s reign of terror in the soviet union there was a brief period of relative freedom in china people were encouraged to voice their criticisms mao advanced the slogan let a hundred flowers bloom let a hundred schools of thought contend but in june 1957 there was a crackdown many of those who had spoken out were arrested or were sacked from their jobs in the cities and sent to the countryside this repression intimidated people from criticising mistaken policies of the communist party and the government this meant that mistakes were not corrected until they had become such big disasters that the leadership was forced to change course great leap forward one example was the so called great leap forward launched in 1958 this was an attempt by mao to force the pace of economic and social change with disastrous results the transition to cooperative and collective farming was supposed to be voluntary and was therefore expected to carried out gradually however the apparent success of the early cooperatives caused mao to call for the acceleration of the process this resulted in pressure being put on peasants to form collective farms before they were really convinced it was a good idea in 1958 collectivisation was taken a step further with the formation of the communes much larger collectives involving tens of thousands of people while peasants in some areas supported the policy in many other areas it was imposed from above at the same time the cp leadership issued calls for enormous increases in production workers and peasants were pushed to work at an excesssive pace transport and supply systems collapsed pressure on party and government officials to meet unrealistic targets led inevitably to false reporting newspapers reported stories of amazing increases in production the result of the great leap forward was a severe decline in agriculture causing the reappearance of famine and chaos in industry the great leap forward reflected mao s voluntarist mentality voluntarism is the idea that if we try hard enough we can do whatever we like regardless of objective conditions beginning in 1959 these policies were partially reversed the communes lost much of their importance smaller units became more important the peasants were allowed small private plots in some areas collectively owned land was contracted out to individual families china began to recover from the effects of the great leap forward however there was no public admission of mistakes nor public criticism of mao for his role in promoting the great leap forward the cult of mao was maintained two factions but within the leadership a factional struggle was beginning one faction headed by liu shaochi and deng xiaoping were moderates they wanted no more voluntarist adventures like the great leap forward they emphasised increasing production through material incentives the other faction headed by mao was still prone to voluntarism they wanted to revive some of the policies of the great leap forward period when the opportunity arose cultural revolution in 1966 the maoist faction launched the cultural revolution they made use of mao s prestige to mobilise youth to attack the wing of the bureaucracy that supported liu and deng mao and his supporters used radical sounding slogans to mobilise students against mao s opponents high school and university students formed groups of rebels or red guards many party leaders at all levels were subject to denunciation public humiliation and physical violence mao s faction tried to keep control of the movement directing it against those seen as mao s opponents but some red guard groups got out of control and began attacking mao s supporters as well some of mao s opponents were able to set up their own youth groups some groups seized arms and different groups began fighting each other the army was brought in to restore order mao had to bring back many of the old cadres who had been purged in order to get society functioning normally again thus the cultural revolution ended in an uneasy compromise right turn in foreign policy at this stage the united states government started putting out feelers to the chinese bureaucrats it was looking for a deal with china at the expense of third world national liberation struggles including vietnam and at the expense of the soviet union us secretary of state henry kissinger visited china in 1971 preparing the ground for us president richard nixon s visit the following year the us trade embargo on china was progressively eased china moved towards a de facto political alliance with us imperialism and adopted a generally reactionary foreign policy deng s return in 1976 mao died the maoists were defeated in the ensuing power struggle by 1978 deng xiaoping had become the real leader of china the pro imperialist foreign policy continued and even got worse in february 1979 chinese troops invaded vietnam the invasion occurred shortly after deng had visited the united states and it is reasonable to assume it was planned in collusion with the us government on march 1 the formal opening of full diplomatic relations between the us and the peoples republic of china occurred wang hui a left wing chinese academic later commented the only reason for this otherwise senseless attack on a small neighbour was deng s desire for a new relationship with the united states the invasion was offered as a political gift to washington and became china s entrance ticket to the world system the chinese troops met strong resistance and were soon forced to withdraw but only after causing substantial damage and loss of life chinese harassment of vietnam continued for a number of years china continued to support the forces of the former pol pot regime a genocidal regime which ruled cambodia between 1975 and 1979 and had been ousted by vietnamese troops market reforms deng introduced market reforms in the countryside the communes were broken up and land was contracted to individual peasant families who could sell surplus production on the free market foreign owned companies were allowed to establish joint ventures with chinese state and collective enterprises as the reform process went further some wholly foreign owned enterprises were established restrictions on the ability of chinese citizens to establish privately owned enterprises were progressively eased corruption spread as bureaucrats accumulated wealth for themselves and their relatives and cronies in the context of growing private ownership of the means of production many bureaucrats began to turn themselves into private owners of capital the beijing massacre but opposition to corruption and to the bureaucratic regime began to grow in april 1989 students protested in beijing s tian an men square they remained for more than a month and were joined by many non students the army was ordered to remove the protestors but the protestors talked to the soldiers and won many of them over workers joined the protests raising their own demands such as job security wages and control over their workplaces eventually the regime brought in new army units that used extreme violence to crush the movement a wave of repression followed capitalist restoration in my opinion the repression of the 1989 upsurge helped prepare the ground for capitalist restoration the increased repression helped break the resistance of workers to the attacks on their job security working conditions and welfare benefits some chinese intellectuals have made the link between the beijing massacre and the subsequent intensification of free market policies wang hui who participated in the tian an men square protests argued that the crackdown not only silenced calls for democracy it also ended public debate about inequality once the tanks had done their work the process of marketisation speeded up similarly li minqi another participant in the 1989 protests later said to unleash a full blown capitalism in china workers had to be deprived of the extensive social and economic rights they enjoyed after the 1949 revolution popular participation in the revolt did threaten to undermine the project of capitalist development but the failure of the movement ensured that for a long time the chinese working class would not be able to act as a collective political force the privatisation of industry proceeded very rapidly during the 1990s and continued more slowly thereafter the state sector s share of industrial production fell from 100 percent in 1978 to 37 5 in 1999 and 31 6 percent in 2004 thirty million workers were sacked from the state sector in the late 1990s corrupt managers enriched themselves while carrying out restructuring and privatisation whereas the sacked workers got minimal compensation transnational corporations increasingly used china as a base for producing goods for sale on the world market for example apple iphones are made in china today millions of chinese workers are ruthlessly exploited by local and foreign capital extremely long hours physical punishment fines and non payment of wages are amongst the abuses suffered by many chinese workers the most oppressed section of the working class are rural migrants working in urban areas according to australian national university academic anita chan writing in 2001 they are required to possess a temporary residential permit and are trapped if the employer takes it away from them their residential status is similar to foreign nationals living as guest workers they are not entitled to any of the benefits enjoyed by the local residents such as social welfare schooling the right to own property to bring their spouses or children with them or even any right to residency once their labor is no longer required they are supposed to go back to their place of origin since then there have been reforms enabling some migrant workers to become urban residents but migrant workers continue to be super exploited privatisation destroyed china s social welfare system a range of services such as health housing etc had been provided to workers via their workplace the loss of state and collective sector jobs meant the loss of these services the result of all these changes was a vast increase in economic inequality china has the second highest number of billionaires in the world after the united states in 2018 it had 373 billionaires not including those in hong kong macau or taiwan the state sector china s economy is now essentially capitalist as indicated by the privatisation of the bulk of the means of production and the conversion of labor power into a commodity workers can only survive by selling their labor power to an employer but the most extreme ideologues of neoliberalism both in china and elsewhere are not satisfied with the degree of privatisation that has occurred so far state owned enterprises remain dominant in certain strategic industrial sectors such as iron and steel and electricity and in the banking sector the neoliberals want more complete privatisation and unfettered access to all areas of the economy for local and foreign capital the chinese communist party has up to now resisted these pressures a strong state sector helps china maintain a degree of independence from the us and its allies it also helped china to recover from the effects of the 2008 global financial crisis the initial impact of the crisis was severe twenty million migrant workers lost their jobs in the export oriented manufacturing industries but the chinese government was able to stimulate the economy by ordering state owned enterprises to spend money and state owned banks to lend money this caused the resumption of rapid economic growth in 2009 government funded construction projects provided alternative work for many of those displaced from the factories the continued existence of a strong state sector does not make china socialist in the past before the rise of neoliberalism many capitalist countries have had a significant sector of state owned enterprises australian examples include the commonwealth bank telstra qantas etc we should also note that many enterprises in china that are called state owned actually have a mixture of state and private ownership popular resistance workers have been fighting back against the attacks on their job security living standards and working conditions there have been thousands of strikes and protests by chinese workers as well as numerous protests by peasants against land seizures by local governments and property developers there have also been many protests against pollution and environmental destruction as well as protests by ethnic minorities against discrimination workers struggles workers have taken action over the non payment of wages or social insurance contributions and the failure to pay the compensation prescribed by law after the termination of employment contracts they have demanded higher wages improved severance packages shorter working hours improved welfare benefits and reductions in workload some retired and laid off workers sought higher retirement payments other disputes arose over arbitrary changes to working conditions meals and housing allowances as well as demands for government investigations into management malpractice during the restructuring of state owned enterprises tactics used by the workers have included strikes blockades of roads bridges and railway lines sit downs at the factory gate protest marches and petitions the response of the authorities to such protests has been a combination of conciliation promises threats physical force and criminal sanctions against the leaders nevertheless the workers have often been successful in winning their demands peasant struggles under the market reforms collectively owned land was allocated to peasants on long term leases in theory this gave them security of tenure but in practice many people from peasant families have been forced to leave the land heavy taxes were imposed on peasants by local governments much of the tax revenue was siphoned off by corrupt local officials prices obtained by farmers from the sale of their crops were often insufficient to meet both their own expenses and the tax burden many farmers got into debt younger family members sought work in the cities to supplement family income in many cases local authorities have evicted peasants from the land so it could be handed over to property developers this has been a major cause of peasant rebellions ethnic conflict in areas inhabited by minority nationalities discontent often takes a nationalist form in tibet for example there have been numerous protests some peaceful others violent and demands have been raised for independence or autonomy tibetans feel that they are discriminated against language is a key issue mandarin chinese is the main language used in government and in the upper levels of the education system the tibetan language has a secondary status this puts tibetan speakers at a disadvantage in getting jobs the higher paid jobs are disproportionately held by han chinese in xinjiang province discontent amongst the uigurs has been met with severe repression hundreds of thousands of people are being held in detention centres rebuilding the social safety net prior to the market reforms people had job security and a basic social welfare system provided through the workplace which provided them with nurseries kindergartens schools healthcare pensions and funeral services as the market reforms deepened workplaces shed their responsibility for social welfare people lost pensions healthcare and welfare benefits and had to spend money buying them china s healthcare system became one of the most commercialised in the world individuals were expected to pay for their own health care but around the year 2000 the government began to rebuild the social safety net in areas such as health care education and pensions the government s share of health care spending began to increase a little after a long period of decline the government also began a drive to increase the proportion of the population covered by various health insurance schemes schemes for employees require contributions from both employers and workers labour legislation in 2007 three labor laws were adopted by the national peoples congress the labour contract law puts some restrictions on the right of employers to hire and fire and requires redundancy payments to be made after termination of a contract the labour arbitration law established a conciliation and arbitration system to rule on disputes between workers against their employers it was soon overwhelmed by complaints from workers leading to long delays in hearing cases the employment promotion law deals with issues of discrimination in employment according to the china labour bulletin the unprecedented wave of labour legislation in this period was a direct response to the pressure exerted by the workers movement over the previous decade a government committed to maintaining social order and harmony could no longer afford to ignore the strikes and protests staged by workers on an almost daily basis across the country what the government has not yet done however is to rigorously enforce its own laws or empower workers to safeguard their rights and interests on a collective basis china has one officially recognised trade union federation the all china federation of trade unions the acftu does not organise strikes it does sometimes challenge violations of china s labor laws by employers through legal channels but this is no substitute for a union that organises workers to fight for their rights foreign policy mao used radical anti imperialist rhetoric in the 1960s but swung to an openly pro imperialist foreign policy in the 1970s this policy was continued by deng xiaoping since then china has moved away from its close political alliance with us imperialism today china has good relations with the revolutionary governments of cuba and venezuela as well as with other third world governments such as iran that are in conflict with the us this does not mean that china s foreign policy is consistently progressive china supported the racist sri lankan government in its war against the tamil independence struggle china supplied arms to the government and gave it diplomatic support one motive for china s position was its desire to gain access to ports on china s trade routes across the indian ocean to the middle east and africa which are sources of oil and other raw materials for china s industry in march 2007 sri lanka signed an agreement with china for the construction of a port at hambantota on sri lanka s south coast is china imperialist there has been a rapid growth of chinese investments overseas much of this investment is aimed at supplying chinese industry with raw materials this is the case with chinese investments in mining in africa for example but it is now going beyond this for example chinese companies have been investing in ports in many european countries including greece germany belgium and the netherlands in australia china has bought the port of darwin china has been building big infrastructure projects in many countries these projects are usually financed by loans from china if the recipient government is unable to meet its repayments china takes ownership the port of hambantota in sri lanka which i mentioned before is an example of this in the past i have described china as a bourgeois nationalist regime meaning that it was capitalist but the government was relatively independent of the imperialist powers but now china is starting to look like an imperialist power itself it has big overseas investments it intervenes in conflicts in other countries for example supporting the sri lankan government against the tamils it has a military base in djibouti a small country in the horn of africa on the other hand foreign transnational corporations continue to use china as a base for production for the world market ruthlessly exploiting chinese workers in this respect china looks like a semi colony of western imperialism thus china combines imperialist and semi colonial features the need for socialism despite the partial reversal of some neoliberal policies china remains a highly unequal society where workers are ruthlessly exploited and lack job security the state represses the resistance of the workers to capitalist exploitation in my view it is a capitalist state the struggle for socialism will need to bring together workers students and other oppressed groups an example of such unity is the solidarity of university students with workers at jasic technologies who wanted to form a union and elect their representatives students joined the workers in protests and helped to publicise the case on the internet a number of workers and students were arrested this kind of solidarity if repeated on a much larger scale can help take china

advertisement advertisement on a sunny saturday morning in sana a the capital city of yemen i head to the al raqqas vegetable market as soon as i enter i am shocked by how small it has become over the past few years i am greeted from afar by a seller named walid who smiles and invites me over to his stall walid only has tomatoes potatoes and onions and he is keen on selling me some walid 18 tells me he has been working as a vegetable merchant for the past seven years in the two years he has spent in this market he has not seen many changes in people s purchasing power however the small quantities of vegetables in his stall indicate that business is not booming it is natural war has been ravaging yemen for nearly four years diesel and seasons are what affect the prices of vegetables walid told the media line when the prices of diesel are high vegetable prices increase when vegetables are in season their price decreases one basket of onions costs 12 while a basket of tomatoes costs 30 and a basket of potatoes is 20 walid elaborated each basket contains about 18 kilograms of vegetables and some families used to buy them in full or by the half however they do not do that anymore due to either a lack of electricity to power their refrigerator or a lack of money according to the united nations more than 10 million yemeni children are on the brink of starvation the yemeni civil war began in 2015 when iran backed houthi rebels unhappy with the transition of power from longtime authoritarian president ali abdullah saleh to his deputy abdrabbuh mansour hadi took over sana a and other areas of the country as the houthi movement rose in power saudi arabia and a coalition of mainly sunni arab states backed by the united states uk and france launched an offensive aimed at toppling the group and restoring president hadi to power while sana a has suffered economically from the years long fighting the port city of houthi held hodeidah once the entry point for the majority of yemen s commercial goods but blockaded by the saudi coalition for the past three years has been at the frontlines of clashes and subject to a number of major offensives before the war diesel fuel cost approximately yer 3 000 or 12 for 20 liters but has now tripled in price similarly 20 liters of gasoline used to cost 11 20 hitting a high of 100 before stabilizing at roughly 27 later i go to the al rowaishan roundabout in the capital s hadda area it is a busy afternoon with cars and motorbikes coming and going through the roundabout while vendors try to sell tissues cds flowers and water bottles to drivers i speak with 32 year old ammar al waddai who is working as a taxi bike driver even though he has a bachelor s degree in accounting i am not surprised many people driving taxi bikes or taxicabs are public sector employees who have not been paid their salary or private sector employees who lost their job due to the economic crisis brought on by the conflict waddai previously was employed by the mtn telecommunications company in aden living there with his wife and two children when the war reached the city he and his family left and resettled in the taiz governorate to the west he started looking for work yet the shadow of war engulfed that region as well and he was forced to leave once more we came to sana a due to the war and blockade in taiz waddai recounted to the media line i applied for work in several places but was not hired the only solution was to work on a motorbike i bought one through installments and started working with it i will keep this job until i find something within my field of study earning his livelihood is not without its struggles the problems i face in this line of work are the increasing prices of gasoline and too many inspections at checkpoints waddai noted fluctuations in gasoline prices make it difficult for taxi bike drivers to calculate their fares and the frequent fuel shortages in sana a only compound the problem now they want us to pay customs in order to get license plate numbers for security reasons waddai underlined we just don t have the liquidity for that the customs costs involved potentially reach 90 a price too high for taxi bike drivers who make as little as 6 a day after gasoline and bike rental fees to pay if they want the process to be over in a day most of the time they wait and it takes them as much as two weeks women have also been hit hard by the war especially single mothers like um suhail al jarmouzi i visit her in her newly established pastry shop near the sam mall near algeria street as soon as i enter i smell freshly baked goods including qafou a traditional yemeni bread made with lentils jarmouzi used to work as an office manager at an import export company however when the war came and the company closed she had to find another source of income we thought about what we could do jarmouzi related to the media line do we keep sitting in our homes and consuming whatever we have saved or start a project she consulted with her eldest son and former boss who all agreed on opening a bakery for traditional pastries and bread i went back to the default position for a woman which is homemaker jarmouzi emphasized we make the basic items and thank allah that we are still going even if slowly opening a business in sana a during a time of war is no easy feat not everything is readily available and the ever increasing exchange rate with the u s dollar makes many items expensive for instance cooking gas is a scarce commodity in sana a in order to regulate its price the authorities decided to distribute it through community leaders it is difficult for this business to cover all the expenses because sales are slow ingredients are not easily obtainable and i can barely afford to pay my employees jarmouzi explained the pastry shop owner currently has four girls helping her though she used to pay them salaries she now pays them on a daily basis due to business being slow i tried to market my products to supermarkets when i visited them later on i found out that they did not sell and became stale after that i limited the scope of my business to my own shop she said qualifying however that she expects the situation to improve i go to the general investment authority in sana a to meet the deputy chief khalid sharaf addine in order to speak about the status of the yemeni economy and how it has affected nearly everyone s lives in fact around three quarters of the country s population or some 28 million people are presently in need of humanitarian assistance due to the current aggression and blockade five million people are unemployed sharaf addine conveyed to the media line aggression is a term used by many who are opposed to saudi arabia s involvement in the war add to that another million in the public sector and another million in the private sector mainly in agriculture according to sharaf addine some seven million people across yemen were employed and provided for their families before the conflict erupted there is huge pressure on those who remain employed to provide for family members who cannot do so for themselves the dependency ratio before the aggression was 4 2 percent meaning that every working person supported at least 4 2 people he explained specifying that due to the war and the collapse of the economy that ratio has doubled meaning that every working person is now supporting 8 4 people this has caused a disaster for nutrition health and the standard of living in general for citizens in yemen nevertheless sharaf addine is optimistic about the economy and has figures to back it up things began to recover gradually in 2017 he stated and in 2018 we gave out investment licenses for 82 new projects with a combined capital that is a 9 5 increase over 2017 figures some economic analysts nevertheless argue that the scale of issues faced by yemen are difficult to measure owing to a thriving shadow economy aimed at countering soaring fuel prices the yemeni economy cannot be described as anything but an economy that is being controlled by the black market ahmed seed shammakh an economic analyst and the head of the financial and economic media studies institute told the media line therefore we can t apply any economic theory in terms of what is happening with regards to supply and demand in the country the yemeni central bank is completely disabled and the gap between expenses and revenues is huge shamakh continued yemen as a country used to depend on oil for about 85 of its public budget currently the country is relying on money transactions from yemenis who have immigrated abroad as well as international organizations and
