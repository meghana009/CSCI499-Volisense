budget 1986 nrm government on august 25 1986 the finance minister prof p s mulema presented his first budget since the take over of government by the national resistance army movement the rebels led by yoweri kaguta museveni overran kampala on january 26 1986 and museveni was sworn in as presidenty on january 29 1986 following is the full text of the 1986 87 budget speech delivered by prof p s mulema at parliament building in kampala over the weekend domestic production the economy of uganda has been troubled for the last 15 years by economic mis management during 1970 s it was not even possible to assess the extent of this mis management in statistical terms because the entire administrative system had almost ceased to function even when the military government was overthrown in 1979 the economy could not recover because of the in security that prevailed misallocation of national resources and lack of guidance and direction between 1972 and 1979 the economic condi tions forced ugandans to move from production to commerce and services where these were possible during this period there fore little production for ex port took place although pro duction of coffee continued somewhat because of the nature of the crop while other exports like cotton suf fered from substitution effect when people switched to pro duction of locally consumed commodities whose prices rose steadily in response to the declining value of the shilling this low level of pro duction both in agriculture and industry was reflected in the trends of gross domestic product it was however not possible to get reliable statistics such figures as we now have are rough estimates based on the few statistics available and lots of assump tions between 1978 and i960 was a further marked drop in gross domestic products as a result of the war that was taking place then and although gross domestic product recovered somewhat between 1980 and 1983 most of that recovery was accounted for by in creases in commerce and government services since even during that time production remained very low rough estimates indicate that real gross domestic pro duct declined by 14 percent between 1978 and 1980 and while there was a re cowry of about 17 per cent between 1980 and 1983 gross domestic product fur ther declined by 10 per cent between 1984 and 1985 during 1985 it is estimated that gross domestic product fell by 5 5 per cent the mone tary economy showed a de cline of 3 9 per cent during the same period while non monetary could have declined by up to 8 per cent it is not possible to get accurate figures for the non monetary economy in absence of detailed statistics the de cline in this sector could have been moderate or sub stantial but it can be assumed that as a result of massive smuggling that was going on along the borders the de cline in production in the peasant economy could have been more apparent than real government is making arrangements to have a crop census followed up with regular periodic reports compiled from down at the parish level to ensure better planning and forecasting in future because of political instability and the security which existed in 1985 it can reasonably be assumed that the output in both agriculture and manufacturing industries where these are in operation was not substantial certainly in the industrial sector the industries did not only lack funds to purchase raw materials and capital inputs but lacked working capital as well prices and monetary developments there have been very high increases in prices in this country between 1980 and now the reasons can be analysed in terms of supply and demand on the supply side the economy has faced problems in terms of the distribution of food and the production of manufactured items although uganda has the capacity to produce large quantities of commodities for export we have continued to face transport bottle necks and absence of appropriate marketing arrangements in the past fifteen years the problems have been aggravated by conditions of insecurity mainly created by the behaviour of governments in power themselves this made it difficult for food which could be produced in large quantities to reach the markets in the industrial sector production of goods was always too small to meet domestic demand the reasons for this are clear the industries were poorly managed lacked working capital and could not get sufficient foreign exchange for raw materials inputs and spare parts the situation was made worse by the financial programme approved by the obote government and supported by the international monetary fund that programme was principally aimed at management of demand without doing much about supply the industrial sector therefore either stagnated or some industries simply stopped operations because currency devaluation which was the principal monetary instrument in this programme made it possible for industries to operate since the cost of imported raw materials and spare parts progressively increased without corresponding increases in these industries working it capital while the financial programme adopted concentrated on imports and consumption this did not substantially affect the internal price levels because considerable quantities of the consumer goods imported were either smuggled out of the country or foreign currency approved for such goods was diverted to other purposes abroad the result was that consumer goods such as shoes bedsheets blankets clothes sugar soap and others remained in short supply and therefore attracted very high prices on the other hand the financial programme failed even in this respect not withstanding its main pre occupation with demand management the governments were not particularly disciplined and therefore expansion in money supply to finance unplanned and in many cases irregular government spending the government deficit therefore continued to widen and the resultant inflation was particularly damaging to the economy especially as it was financed by borrowing from the banking system and the bank of uganda in particular in addition to growing government deficits to finance consumption and services a large proportion of bank credit went to finance commercial activity and speculation even where production was possible credit to finance it was not available in banks because there were more profitable ventures in commerce and speculation for banks to finance the financial institutions therefore ignored agriculture and industry because it did not pay as well this government is determined to reverse the trend some of the measures that have already been taken to correct this unhealthy situation include the recent setting up of the rehabilitation of productive enterprises programme which with supporting foreign resources supplied by the united states government will specially finance agriculture and agro related industries before the end of the year another organisation to be known as uganda agricultural finance agency uafa will be set up with the single objective of financing agriculture government is also seriously considering increasing the capital of uganda development bank which is the national institution best suited to the financing needs of industry in the monetary field domestic credit increased sharply between 1980 and 1985 the acceleration declined somewhat between 1982 and 1984 but during the year 1984 85 total domestic credit increased 130 per cent from shs 85 billion to shs 195 2 billion this went hand in hand with government indebtedness to the banking system net claims on government increased 65 per cent between 1983 and 1984 from shs 40 5 billion to shs 66 9 billion and increased further to shs 108 8 billion by the end of 1985 this increase largely reflected government dependence on bank financing to cover the widening budgetary deficit bank credit to the private sector was also increasing during the same period but at a lower rate of growth although this credit to the private sector went mainly to finance commerce money defined as currency in circulation and bank deposits increased by 90 per cent over the year 1985 from shs 1115 billion to shs 211 3 billion while currency in circulation alone nearly doubled during the same period from shs 43 9 billion to shs 80 7 billion this large increase in currency in circulation naturally put a lot pf pressure on prices as these large increases were taking place during a period of low and declining production bank credit was also distributed in a manner that reflected the usual effects of inflation in an economy in agriculture for instance bank lending stood at shs 35 3 billion by the middle of 1985 and rose to shs 48 1 billion by the end of the year these fairly large increases in the agricultural area are largely explained by financing export crops and in particular coffee commercial bank credit to agriculture for purposes of production remained virtually non existent in a situation of inflation the attitude of commercial banks can be justified on purely financial grounds it was more rational for banks to finance sectors where credit was relatively more secure and where it could be recovered in a short period these were mainly commercial and services ventures the manufacturing sector received very little credit from banks especially as most of the industries were bogged down with legal problems stemming from ownership and other problems frequent devaluation of the shilling did not help either monetary policy the policy employed by the previous governments while aimed at establishing a relatively more acceptable exchange rate tor he shilling had the effect of undermining this very policy the exchange rate policy was used by the previous governments as an instrument to help in management of demand the idea was to devalue the shilling and thus make foreign currency more expensive in terms of uganda shilling and therefore reduce the demand for it management of demand can only succeed if first there is discipline in how money is spent not just in government but also in those institutions which are charged with the management of financial resources and where there is a mechanism for channeling resources into productive areas of the economy what went wrong in uganda was that budgetary discipline was lacking and those who advocated the monetary approach to the management of the economy depended on the market mechanism to orient the economy towards more production and less consumption that of course could not happen because of the internal contradictions inherent in the policy the government intends to maintain a fixed exchange rate in order to minimise inflation but will also take other measures that will help the economy to recover stably without high rates of inflation the government has therefore decided that the exchange rate be fixed at shs 1400 per us dollar with immediate effect the dual exchange rate regime is abolished interest rates ofcourse do play a monetary role as they do regulate the cost and availability of credit and where it goes they also can help in mobilising financial resources which could be used to achieve desired economic objectives in a situation of inflation however interest rates need to be substantially high in order attract people to save and also discourage some from speculation through reluctance to hold money or through hoarding and property dealings high rates of interest however can have very damaging effects on an economy they could discourage borrowing and in a situation like ours may have the effect of curtailing production since production forces the investors to tie money in projects for a relatively long period if the rates of interest are high such borrowing may appear rightly or wrongly unacceptable to producers the subject is therefore controversial it has therefore been decided that as soon as the national investment plan is approved and therefore the desired levels of investment in the various sectors are established interest rates policy will be reviewed financial institutions will be required to adjust their investment portfolios and ensure that predetermined proportions of their lending go to each sector of the economy at that juncture it will be possible to reduce interest rates applicable to productive sectors without at the same time discouraging lending institutions from lending to these low interest sectors the most significant development in the area of monetary policy to be undertaken during the current fiscal year is the currency reform which i announced earlier this year new currency notes are already being manufactured by our security printers the minting of new coins is also in progress for we shall definitely go back to the use of cents and shillings coins as valuable media of exchange the production of high security currency takes a longer time than most people appear to realise it is only this factor that is delaying the exercise trade and balance of payments the economic mismanagement of this country as experienced in the past has had the effect of narrowing our export base so much that at present the only export we can seriously talk about is coffee the country would probably have no export at the moment if coffee were not the type of crop can survive long periods of neglect even then the volume of coffee exports has been declining in the last ten years while other export crops like cotton and tea already show promising signs of recovery the country will not expect substantial earnings from these crops this year coffee exports amounted to 143 000 tonnes in1979 and declined to a level of 133 000 tonnes in 1984 and increased again somewhat to 151 500 tonnes in 1985 the decline in coffee production may however not reflect the true situation a lot of uganda coffee has systematically been smuggled out of the country by both individuals and it would appear official agencies cotton tea and tobacco continue to be exported but in quantities that do not demand any particular mention here in 1982 however maize appeared for the first time as one of uganda s exports which reached a level of 30 000 tonnes in 1983 and declined substantially in 1985 to a level of 9 800 tonnes unit prices of our exports continued to fluctuate from time to time in response to forces beyond the control of the developing world although international agreements under the international coffee organisation have helped a great deal in bringing about relative stability in coffee prices on the world market the value of uganda s total exports reached a level of us 380 million in 1985 nearly all these consist of earnings from coffee uganda s imports in 1983 1984 and 1985 were valued at us 428 million us 342 and us 264 million respectively this drop reflected the country s growing inability to raise enough currency to finance imports as well as political difficulties which existed during 1985 drawings from imf were getting exhausted by 1984 and because the financial programme with the fund was not renewed uganda s capacity to import was severely constrained the country experienced substantial trade deficits between 1980 and 1982 although by 1985 we had recorded a surplus in the trade balance largely because imports had been disrupted by political and military problems the country was experiencing on the capital account uganda utilised substantial capital and by 1983 we had recorded a substantial surplus of us 27 million this improvement reflected substantial use of borrowed resources particularly from the imf uganda therefore had relied largely on external financing to finance imports however repurchases from the imf that is to say repayment of our debt was already in excess of our drawings from the fund by up to us 10 million by 1984 thus marking the beginning of the balance of payments difficulties which the country faces at the present time the international economic scene on the international scene uganda has like other countries witnessed recent sharp decreases in oil prices this decline could have benefited the developing countries greatly however we do not control the oil market and have to rely on the operations of the commercial organisations which market that oil worldwide uganda has yet to get the full benefit of low oil prices while the effect of cheaper oil is expected to be positive and lead to higher rates of growth in the developed countries this cannot necessarily be said of developing nations the developing world is constantly faced with two major problems the first is the currency fluctuations which frequently affect the balance of payments positions and the second is fluctuations in prices of their exports in regard to this latter problem it is note worthy that over the last few months the price of coffee on the world markets has dropped by as much as a dollar per kilogramme this has considerably depressed our foreign earnings furthermore the developing world including uganda continues to be a net exporter of capital to the developed world this phenomenon continues even at this time these flows consist of transfer of capital by commercial undertakings and investors who operate in the developing world as well as flows on account of principal and interest on various credits raised in the developed countries producer prices for controlled commodities in may this year government announced substantial increases in the prices paid to farmers for controlled export crops it is the policy of this government to offer higher and higher prices for these commodities as a means of providing an incentive for greater production as well as redressing the imbalance between the rural and the urban sectors of the economy however because of the current condition in the international commodity markets it is impossible for government to review upwards the prices currently payable to producers as suggested above with regards to world prices for coffee government is only making an effort to maintain prices to the farmer at the level at which they are now price increases are therefore impossible in the circumstances however government will continue the policy of offering the best possible prices in the light of world market conditions the price for cotton in particular will be reviewed before the commencement of the coming season development programme the government is in the process of formulating an investment programme which will reflect the economic policies of nrm government the programme will not only focus its main attention on production but it will also put emphasis on developing an integrated economy so that the economy is oriented to produce as much as possible those commodities goods or equipment that will enable productive sectors especially industry and agriculture to support each other when industries begin to operate at higher capacities uganda should produce more of its basic needs within the country the investment programme is in the final stage of discussion and when it is published it will indicate broadly what ugandans plan to do for themselves and the nature of assistance they expect from financial organisations and friendly countries this budget cannot of course take into account the full and final recommendations of the investment programme although during this financial year certain projects in the programme may be started this will include the rehabilitation of our roads as well as some industrial projects which the government considers to be urgently required even before the investment plan is released the government is already implementing those policies that are fundamental to its economic policy uganda intends to depend on its own resources as much as possible in developing its economy in this connection we will primarily use our foreign currency to a pay for petroleum products as well as drugs both human and animals b purchase raw materials and capital inputs to produce those consumer goods which the people need as well as agricultural inputs to promote more production for local consumption and export c purchase capital goods and transport equipment the country cannot at the moment produce and d pay for consumer goods which our industries could produce but cannot now due mismanagement and neglect e pay for scholastic materials needed in our education institutions and f repay the country s external debts most which could have been avoided the government has also embarked on measures which are aimed at reducing demands on our foreign exchange resources we have already reached agreements with a number of countries under which we will exchange commodities or goods with each other so that the need for use of convertible currencies is reduced in this regard government is launching an export drive involving non traditional exports such as maize beans timber hides and skins simsim and soya beans government calls upon all persons to re double their efforts in the production of these commodities and guarantees a sure market to the producers at competitive prices in addition the government intends to restrict external borrowing to the financing of development projects where the capital investment is such that we cannot finance them from our own resources foreign investment the investment programme will make allowances for and encourage investment by investors abroad a law exists to protect such investment as well as give incentives to those who wish to invest in uganda the foreign investment protection act 1964 and the subsequent decree of 1977 give details of what the investors need to do before they start on their projects in uganda that law provides for a committee of senior officers who are supposed to examine the nature of the proposed investment and determine whether it is in line with the country s development objectives if the committee is satisfied it makes a recommendation to the minister of finance who signs a certificate of approved status thus allowing the investor the right to remit dividends and interest on any money he might have borrowed from abroad to finance project in the country it should be emphasized however that each project has to be discussed with the government on a case by case basis to ensure that its future operations are in line with the government s economic objectives and will produce those goods or services the country considers a priority departed asians property custodian board the government has already started on work relating to final resolution of issues relating to properties left behind by departed asians we are at the moment examining the law governing their sale or return to the former owners as it stands amendments to the law may be necessary new legislation may also be necessary say with regards to land tenure to provide for certain modes of sale and ownership that cannot be accommodated m the existing law a task force consisting of lawyers experts on urban affairs bankers and others is currently examining the necessary procedures and modalities to be followed their recommendations will be submitted to government for final decision after this process properties as shall be candidate for sale shall be valued and disposed of recommendations are also expected from the task force on the best ways of deploying and utilising the proceeds from these sales 1985 86 budgetary out turn the budgetary situation during the year 1985 86 was abnormally difficult the budgetary performance were more absurd than ever before the original estimates for recurrent expenditure for the financial year 1985 86 was shs 213 0 billion while development expenditure was estimated at shs 144 6 billion in the course of the year these figures were revised by supplementary estimates to shs 343 7 billion shs 170 6 billion for recurrent and development expenditure respectively giving total expenditure of shs 514 3 billion on the revenue side the original estimates for the financial year 1985 86 were shs 240 8 billion for the recurrent tax revenue and shs 73 1 billion for development revenue in that order the revised tax revenue estimates for the year are shs 276 6 billion and shs 125 8 billion for recurrent and development respectively making a total of shs 402 5 billion as against the original estimates of shs 314 0 billion the out turn for 1985 86 budget therefore gives an overall deficit of shs 104 6 billion many factors made it very difficult in some cases impossible to live within the original budgeted amounts and consequently necessitated revision of expenditure estimates by supplementary provisions the main factors were first government services which were not originally catered for in the budget namely provision of emergency relief for the people in the war ravaged areas especially luwero triangle arua moyo moroto and kotido implementation of government policy to provide free education in the luwero triangle arua moyo and the two districts of karamoja second increased salaries and wages due to either underestimation of police and prison requirements in the original budget or increase in the number of soldiers in ministry of defence in the course of the year and an upward revision of their salaries in the second half of the year and in addition government had to acquire new equipment and transport facilities for the army i e uniforms mattresses vehicles etc third the continued depreciation of the shilling which affected a number of payments made in foreign currency e g external loan servicing remittance to our missions abroad students allowances overseas overseas purchases and contributions to international organisations as well as travel abroad fourth internally the cost of maintenance and feeding of a soldiers and police and prisons personnel as well as inmates b students in secondary schools colleges and makerere university and c hospital patients and paramedics constantly increased fifth the rate of revenue collection was far less than the rate of expenditure as indicated by expenditure demand of ministries and departments details of the out turn of 1985 86 tax and development revenues and external grants and loans are in the financial statements and revenue estimates published today 1986 87 budget forecast the main policy objective of the 1985 86 budget will focus on financing and re habilitating government services that have been neglected as far as recurrent budget is concerned and repair of many state assets that have been damaged during the recent wars these include buildings in government institutions schools hospitals roads machinery etc as regards development budget the budget will also lay emphasis on providing means of livelihood to the population in the war affected areas under the ministry of rehabilitation in the 1986 87 budget the overall revenue including foreign grants among others are forecast to increase by about 90 per cent whereas the overall expenditure is expected to increase by about 119 per cent the total estimates of revenue published today in the financial statement is shs 777 8 billion tax revenue is estimated at shs 487 3 billion appropriation in aid is estimated at shs 16 8 billion development revenue is expected to be shs 273 7 billion from the following sources a dividends from government owned companies or companies in which government has shares shs 4 1 billion b ida i and ii and other projects accounts which should realise shs 56 5 billion c kenya compensation fund expected to contribute shs 40 6 billion d sale of buses proceeds should bring shs 4 4billion e external grant estimated to bring shs 72 3billion and f external loans proceeds should bring shs 95 8 billion the total estimates of expenditure is budgeted as shs 1 127 5 billion recurrent expenditure is estimated at shs 509 billion statutory recurrent is budgeted at shs 134 0 billion development expenditure is estimated at shs 474 1 billion statutory development is estimated at shs 9 8 billion the total revenue and the total expenditure give a deficit of shs 349 7 billion this is to be financed from borrowing from the banking system and also from non bank sources subject to government decision part of the proceeds from the sale of custodian board properties may be applied to the financing of this deficit most of the parastatal bodies continue to depend on government assistance for their operations government s proposed contribution to various parastatal bodies amounting to shs 22 7 billion is included under the ministry of finance development budget out of this amount shs 7 0 billion is to cater for partial capitalisation of the uganda airlines while shs 9 5 billion goes towards udc s share capital this government places a lot of emphasis on discipline within government and the way public funds are handled this emphasis is necessary because rehabilitation needs in this country at the moment are pressing many that is the reason why the budget deficit is so large the treasury will therefore place strict controls on use of funds by a releasing money to ministries for only real needs which should be properly documented b reducing the number and size of government delegations travelling abroad and in many cases request our embassies abroad to attend meetings where uganda will be required without sending officers from kampala c insisting on proper authority before purchases can be financed with public funds d ensuring that each ministry spends money in amounts not exceeding those provided in the budget to be authorised today as a result of high rates of inflation over the last ten years real wages and salaries are at the moment very low indeed at the lowest level the monthly wage is no even enough to buy a bunch of matoke or five kilogrammes of maize flour the government has therefore decided to increase the total wages bill of government by 50 per cent and provide for this increase in individual scales in such a way that the 50 per cent increase in total wages and salaries will range from token in creases at the top scale to more than 50 per cent increase at the bottom scale this will of course not bring significant relief to the workers as the prices will dill be high for all of them the government however intends to take further measures in the near future to bring about a happier balance between goods and services on the market and aggregate demand more meaningful salary increases will only be possible when our production levels and the tax base expand and when government has trimmed down the establishment where excessive staffing exists taxation proposals i now wish to turn to the taxation proposals these proposals have the following objectives i guaranteeing a constant continuous and adequate flow of revenue in the prevailing circumstances ii stimulating production the above objectives will be achieved through the following measures a revision of the various tax rates in order to bring them in line with the present rate of inflation some of these rates have been revised for over a decade now and are meaningless compared to the cost and importance of the services they are purportedly paid for b increasing the vigilance surveillance and therefore effectiveness of the tax administrators c a liberal application of fiscal policy to ensure flow of inputs in both the agricultural and industrial sectors at relatively low prices these measures will form the basis for long term tax policy objectives income tax the finance act 1982 changed the appellate system by replacing the local committees and the tribunal with the commissioner for appeals but since then it has not been possible to establish the new system the reason being the difficulty of identifying a person conversant with this new system in the meantime however objections have been piling up thus holding up the tax that should have been collected i should on the other hand emphasize that an appellate system is an integral part of effective tax administration and is instrumental in promoting compliance consequently to save time and to speed up resolution of disputes and therefore realise the revenue i propose to revert to the old system of the local committees and also do away with the tribunal in a free enterprise society it is the business sector which determines the level of investment increasing the rate of investment is important for capital formation and therefore the rate of economic growth to be able to increase savings and therefore the rate of investment i propose to reduce the rate of corporation tax applicable to industry and agriculture from 50 per cent to 40 per cent however in order for business to make an adequate contribution to the reconstruction effort i propose to raise the corporation tax applicable to commercial banks arid other financial institutions other than insurance companies from the present level of 50 per cent to 60 per cent the rate for insurance companies will remain at the current level i also propose to raise all other corporation tax outside industry and agriculture to 60 per cent presumptive income tax assessment popularly known as income tax deposits was introduced in 1976 since then it has been extended to various economic activities with a view to tapping all sources of incomes in its current circumstances the department of income tax is thin on the ground and constrained by transport and therefore unable to effectively reach every potential tax payer therefore as recommended in the uganda economy study report in the near future we shall have to depend increasingly on presumptive assessments to collect the revenue in order to increase the contribution of income tax lo total revenue i propose to double the current deposit rates applicable to commercial activity and adjust other appropriately the details will be found in the finance decree as a result of this measure i expect to realise shs 15 0 billion in the budget speech last year a new incentive scheme for commercial banks intended to encourage them to spread banking facilities to the rural areas was announced i e if any commercial bank opened i one branch it would be entitled to a reduction in income tax of 30 per cent ii if two branches 60 per cent iii if three branches 100 per cent it is now felt that this was too generous and commercial banks could use the scheme to continuously avoid payment of income tax starting with the year of income 1987 this rebate will be discontinued in the present financial circumstances alternative measures will be taken to ensure the expansion of bank networks these measures will become effective on january 1 1987 customs duty the only substantive amendment is in respect of section 117a 2 of the east african customs transfer management act in order to discourage the public to hold on to government revenue i propose that the interest rate payable on any outstanding tax be the ruling commercial bank lending rate applicable to commerce but in the course of administering the customs law certain measures were adopted administratively one such measure is the requirement for pre payment of taxes on imports i have carefully assessed the effect of pre payment on our imports and their prices and decided to do away with this requirement immediately it has already been announced import duty rates for petroleum products have gone up to super 100 per cent regular 100 per cent kerosene 50 per cent and the rate on diesel is 20 per cent these and the proposed sales tax rates result in the following pump prices super shs 1 100 per litre regular shs 1 000 per litre kerosene shs 750 per litre and diesel shs 500 per litre in case of beer import duty has gone up to 200 per cent the nrm government has demonstrated serious concern for the welfare of the people by ensuring that the little that there is is shared equitably in this case government can proudly state that with the assistance of the resistance committees sugar has reached every household at a manageable price but government is battling with the problem of ensuring the supply of essential commodities at reasonable prices on the one hand and the need to generate additional revenue in order to continue rendering services to the country on the other in order to generate additional revenue i propose to raise the import duty and sales tax on sugar to 30 per cent and 40 per cent respectively as a result of this proposal the retail price for sugar will be about shs 1 600 per kilogramme in addition there are technical amendments which will incorporate pta rates in our customs tariff streamline the tariffs in respect of motor vehicles to accommodate four wheel drive vehicles special liquid transport vehicles and dumpers streamline tariff rates where finished products are tax free and yet inputs to manufacture them locally are taxable or where both the components and the finished goods are liable to the same rate of duty as a result of these measures i expect to raise shs 37 0 billion sales tax with effect from midnight tonight the following rates of sales tax will apply 1 beer 30 per cent 2 cigarettes i kali 20 per cent ii others 30 per cent 3 petroleum products a super and regular 50 per cent b kerosene 30 per cert other technical amendments will be found in the finance decree as a result of these measures i estimate to raise shs 54 4 billion excise duty the following rates will be applicable from midnight to night i beer 50 percent ii cigarettes a kali 40 per cent b others 60 per cent since 1981 82 excise duty on sugar has been suspended because there was no local production i intend to continue with the suspension until local production starts but i propose to re impose excise duty at the rate of 30 per cent on uganda waragi i expect to raise shs 29 0 billion from these measures licences the present level of fees and licences charged under the traffic and road safety act 1970 neither reflects the cost of administration nor the importance of the service paid for i have therefore decided to substantially increase them so as to fully reflect these two the details of the increases will be found in the finance decree as a result of this measure i hope to real se shs 7 0 billion including sir 1 2 billion from commission on import licences hitherto collected by the advisory board of trade this measure takes immediate effect stamp duty the stamp duty rates were last revised in 1967 the developments in the economy since then have rendered them worthless yet the instruments for which stamp duty is paid are important to offer or guarantee legal security or protection to bring these rates up to date i have decided as follows 1 where a value can be ascertained the rate will be 5 per cent of the value of the instrument in respect of which stamp duty is levied 2 where this is not possible as in the case of an affidavit the present rate will be increased 300 times in partial reflection of the decline in the value of the shilling since then this measure again takes effect immediately airport tax with immediate effect i propose to raise the fee payable by a passenger leaving the country to us 10 per passenger this will bring our charge in line with other international airports in the neighbouring countries nonresidents will pay in dollars but residents will pay the equivalent in uganda shillings with immediate effect foreign registered vehicles entering uganda will be required to pay us 150 in hard currency i would also like to report that i am contemplating the introduction of a road user tax in order to make all road users contribute to the rehabilitation and maintenance of our roads besides raising adequate revenue necessary to minimise financing the budget by re sorting to ways and means advances from the bank of uganda i intend to use fiscal policy to encourage both investment and production the long term objective of this policy is to build a strong tax base so as to realise more revenue i shall therefore on a selective basis consider allowing the importation into uganda of industrial and agricultural inputs tax free the additional taxation measures i have outlined above are expected to realise additional revenue amounting to shs 148 9 billion other measures which will come into effect in the course of the fiscal year are the following i mulago hospital is to become a self accounting organisation this is intended to speed up disbursements to the hospital as well as payment to hospital suppliers and creditors ii similar arrangements being worked out in respect of makerere university iii a motor third party insurance law is currently being drafted to protect both road users and motorists iv it is proposed to set up a uganda re insurance corporation as a vehicle of development financing as well as an organ to assist the financing of budget deficits v ugandans who have legitimately earned income outside the country will in future be allowed to open external accounts in hard currencies arrangements are underway in the bank of uganda for the implementation of this decision vi in future all registered exporters of various commodities will be allowed to open external accounts in which they will be allowed to deposit 20 per cent of their external earnings in hard currencies finally vii in order to preserve foreign exchange and to reduce over invoicing all future cash imports shall be on a c f basis only the insurance to cover such imports shall be provided by uganda insurance companies under the

menafn jordan times london harvard university professor alberto alesina has returned to the debate on budget deficits austerity and growth back in 2010 alesina told european finance ministers that many even sharp reductions of budget deficits have been accompanied and immediately followed by sustained growth rather than recessions even in the very short run now with fellow economists carlo favero and francesco giavazzi alesina has written a new book entitled austerity when it works and when it doesn t which recently received a favourable review from his harvard colleague kenneth rogoff new book old tune the authors conclusion in a nutshell is that in certain cases the direct output cost of spending cuts is more than compensated for by increases in other components of aggregate demand the implication is that austerity cutting the budget deficit not expanding it may well be the right policy in a recession alesina s previous work in this area with silvia ardagna was criticised by the international monetary fund and other economists for its faulty econometrics and exaggerated conclusions and this new book which analyzes 200 multi year austerity plans carried out in 16 organisation for economic cooperation and development countries between 1976 and 2014 will also no doubt keep the number crunchers busy but that is not the main point correlation is not causation the association of fiscal retrenchment and economic growth tells us nothing about the underlying relationship between the two does shrinking the deficit cause economic growth or does growth cause the deficit to shrink all the econometrics in the world cannot prove that one caused the other or that both may not be the result of something else there are simply too many omitted variables that is other possible causes of either or both outcomes so called statistical proofs always start with a theory of causation to which the data are fitted to get the result the theorist wants alesina s theory rests on two conceptual pillars the main one is that if deficits persist businesses and consumers will expect higher taxes and will therefore invest and consume less spending cuts on the other hand signal lower taxes in the future and thus stimulate investment and consumption the second supplementary pillar is the assumption that rising public debt leads investors to expect a default this expectation forces up interest rates on government bonds leading to higher overall borrowing costs austerity by stopping the growth of debt can bring about a sizeable reduction in interest rates and thus enable increased investment this supplementary case cannot be regarded as a general rule if a country has its own central bank and issues its own currency the government can cause interest rates to be whatever it wants them to be by ordering the central bank to print money in this case low interest rates will be the result not of austerity but rather of monetary expansion and this of course is what has happened with quantitative easing in the united states the united kingdom and the eurozone interest rates have stayed at rock bottom for years as central banks have pumped hundreds of billions of dollars pounds and euros into their economies so we are left with alesina s main pillar a credible commitment to public spending cuts today will boost output by removing the expectation of higher taxes tomorrow the same argument explains why on alesina s view it is better to reduce the deficit by cutting spending than by raising taxes spending cuts address the problem of the automatic growth of entitlements and other spending programmes whereas tax increases do not alesina writes modern macroeconomics emphasises that people s decisions about what to do today are influenced by their expectations of what will happen in the future john maynard keynes too understood the crucial importance of expectations he is credited by john hicks with introducing the method of expectations into economics however keynes s expectational map was very different from alesina s his investors do not form their expectations by looking at the government s deficit and calculating what effect it will have on their future tax bills in fact they scarcely notice the deficit at all what they do notice is the size of their markets for keynes entrepreneurs decisions to create jobs depend on their expected income from increasing employment an economic downturn reduces their expected sales proceeds causing them to lay off workers a cut in government spending implies that they can expect still fewer sales causing them to lay off even more workers thus deepening the recession conversely a rise in government spending or tax cuts increases expectations of sales and so reverses the downturn for example if the demand for automobiles falls fewer will be sold and fewer workers will be employed in making them if the government increases its spending on public works this will not only employ more workers directly but also increase the demand for automobiles so the output of the economy grows by more than the government s extra spending thus reducing the deficit in very simple terms therefore we have two opposite theories of the appropriate fiscal policy in a slump keynes says an announced reduction in public spending signals to businesspeople that their incomes will be reduced because fewer people will be buying the goods and services they produce but alesina says that an announced reduction in public spending signals to businesspeople that they can expect lower taxes tomorrow and therefore will spend more today readers must decide which theory they find more plausible personally i much prefer the characterisation contained in the recent book austerity 12 myths exposed

prime minister shinzo abe today as part of his four day trip to japan in the post meeting joint press conference trump said he hoped to announce a trade deal with japan very soon he described trade imbalance with japan as unbelievable large he added they are brilliant business people brilliant negotiators and have put us in a tough spot but i think we will have a deal with japan earlier on before the meeting trump said trade wise i think we ll be announcing some things probably in august that will be very good for both countries we ll get the balance of trade i think straightened out rapidly abe said the two leaders had agreed to accelerate two way tarde talks earlier today the japanese government announced new rules to limit foreign ownership of high tech corporations effective august 1 the government said that the rule aims at preventing leakage of technology deemed important for national security or damage to defense output and technological foundation the new rule is believed to be targeted at china which was widely accused of the ip theft however there is no mention of specific countries or companies that will be affected by such foreign ownership restrictions thus based on the principle of reciprocity if japanese steel is security risks to the us american companies could be risks to japan too it s all up to bilateral relationship and interpretations trump to china we re not ready to make a deal tariffs could go up very substantially very easily at the press conference with abe trump said the us isn t ready to make a trade deal with china yet he added i think they probably wish they made the deal that they had on the table before they tried to renegotiate it and they would like to make a deal we re not ready to make a deal trump also threatened that tariffs on chinese goods could go up very very substantially very easily though i think sometime in the future china and the united states will absolutely have a great trade deal and we look forward to that trump said because i don t believe that china can continue to pay these really hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs i don t believe they can do that comments from china remained hard line over the weekend a commentary published by the official xinhua news agency accused the us of scapegoating china for its trade imbalance and domestic economic issues and the united states is

an obituary for the unacceptable face of capitalism may 28 2019 links international journal of socialist renewal on tuesday the world s third largest platinimum mining house lonmin will like die remembered as the exemplar of multinational corporate irresponsibility as a people s trial hosted by the marikana solidarity network gets underway outside carlton house terrace in london where lonmin s shareholders vote on a friendly takeover deal albeit with extremely dubious characteristics many critics are shaking their heads and fists at the extraordinary financial and political circumstances starting in 1909 the london and rhodesian mining and land company was a backwater mining house until it became one of the world s most predatory corporations the critical shift was lonrho s growth away from its origins in what is now harare during the 1962 93 leadership of roland walter fuhrhop a german who renamed himself tiny rowland and emigrated to england and then rhodesia by the early 1970s an unprecedented internal rebellion of directors against its flamboyant leader led to court proceedings that revealed much about lonrho s modus operandi as brian cloughly explained a british prime minister edward heath observed in 1973 that a businessman a truly horrible savage called tiny rowland represented the unpleasant and unacceptable face of capitalism the description was fitting because rowland was a perambulating piece of filth who had indulged in bribery tax dodging and the general range of ingenious whizz kid schemes designed to make viciously unscrupulous people rich and keep them that way the majority of that wealth was stripped from southern africa especially an area two hours drive from johannesburg in rustenburg s western platinum mines by the early 1970s they had become the most consistent source of rowland s profits in some years exceeding half the firm s earnings but by 2017 it became obvious that lonmin s ongoing bribery of political leaders especially in africa and its attacks on labour community especially women and the environment were self destructive on two grounds a legacy of hatred that spilled over into the political sphere reaching to the very top of south african politics and an exceptional devaluation of investor worth for what had become the world s third largest platinum corporation after implats and anglo american was suddenly and to many mercifully swallowed by a young five year old johannesburg based mining house sibanyestillwater the price for all of lonmin s london stock exchange shares offered in december 2017 was a measly 383 million which was at the time just a seventh of sibanye s share value at the time and a tiny fraction 1 4 percent of lonmin s 28 6 billion peak value a decade earlier but its owners were glad to accept even these few crumbs and indeed the final package of sibanye trade in shares was increased in april 2019 as platinum prices rose 11 percent in the four prior months shortly before shareholder approval would finalise the deal yet as journalist felix njini pointed out at the time while sibanye has boosted the share ratio it is offering to lonmin investors the value of the deal remains lower than when it was announced after the company s share price fell and it sold new equity earlier in april during the 2007 17 crash lonmin its management and especially its main south african investor and protector cyril ramaphosa together deserved their neo rowlandian reputations they sought profits at any cost even the irreparable soiling of their own nests to be sure last saturday ramaphosa was sworn in as south africa s president after his party won the may 8 election with a much reduced 58 percent of the national vote gaining a tick from only 30 percent of those who were eligible as apathy and disgust reduced voter participation to an unprecedented level that tradition of profits at any cost will continue in coming years under sibanye s notorious ceo neil froneman even in the crucial 2012 19 years when reform should have been possible there continued to be excruciating attacks on lonmin s workers the marikana community and the surrounding ecological systems of which the worst single incident was at the platinum mine two hours drive northwest of johannesburg on august 15 2012 ramaphosa emailed a request to the police minister regarding a week long wildcat strike at a marikana mine of which he owned more than 9 percent the terrible events that have unfolded cannot be described as a labour dispute they are plainly dastardly criminal and must be characterised as such there needs to be concomitant action to address this situation ramaphosa was referring to 4000 desperately underpaid miners and the violence they had suffered and meted out the prior week during which six workers two security guards and two policemen died in skirmishes neither lonmin officials nor its board s transformation committee leader ramaphosa wanted to negotiate the main union then representing the platinum workers the national union of mineworkers num which was courageously led by ramaphosa during the 1980s sided with management the day after his emails strikers began to peacefully depart the hillside where they gathered for the nearby shantytowns heading home for the weekend they were blocked by barbed wire hastily assembled by police and then 34 of the workers were shot dead and 78 wounded the police acted not dissimilarly to those of the pre 1994 apartheid era with a visceral hatred of the rebellious workers class had simply replaced race in the calculus since the police shooters were largely black including most of their commanders ramaphosa s role was especially unconscionable given his struggle history in the 2014 emmy award winning film miners shot down director rehad desai reveals the class loyalty u turn in 1987 in the midst of a legendary strike ramaphosa accused the liberal bourgeoisie of using fascistic methods thirty years later ramaphosa had become the main local investor in lonmin and within five years was a monster according to local activists he played a familiar role described by the workers lawyer dali mpofu at the heart of this was the toxic collusion between the sa police services and lonmin at a direct level at a much broader level it can be called a collusion between the state and capital in the sordid history of the mining industry in this country part of that history included the collaboration of so called tribal chiefs who were corrupt and were used by those oppressive governments to turn the self sufficient black african farmers into slave labour workers today we have a situation where those chiefs have been replaced by so called black economic empowerment partners of these mines and carrying on that torch of collusion collusion resisted but not defeated the post massacre period provides many lessons about how lonmin maintained its predatory approach and also how resistance was stymied notwithstanding a crescendo of labour unrest culminating in a five month strike across the platinum belt in 2014 summing up the overall lack of improvement at marikana three years after the massacre photojournalist greg marinovich explained the miners salaries have over the course of two long and deadly strikes been substantially increased and their lives have improved albeit not to the level that lonmin promised back in 2007 when brad mills told business day the money would create thriving and comfortably middle class communities around lonmin s projects given the horror of the massacre at marikana it is not surprising that the failure of the state municipalities and lonmin to provide dignified and reasonable living conditions has been sidelined but it is this squalid environment and the cynical disregard by those with the power to change it that provoked the miners to risk death in the first place and for the women here who are mostly shut out of formal employment possibilities life remains an unremitting grind despite the world bank s tagline working for a world free of poverty indeed although the marikana massacre s impact on ramaphosa lonmin and its victims was devastating that incident alone did not immediately destroy the firm for example in the way the london public relations firm bell pottinger was quickly dismembered due to its south african mistakes in mid 2017 instead the underlying dilemma that ultimately led to lonmin s death was the over accumulation of minerals capital on the world scale and the inability of lonmin to keep its cost structure sufficiently low to avoid a takeover froneman made clear that his main rationale in buying lonmin was to consolidate the firm s relatively cheaper smelting capacity at marikana for use by other firms although the return of electricity brownouts in 2018 and fast rising tariffs quickly diluted this benefit closure of lonmin mine shafts will accelerate and the social and labour plans will continue to be ignored already in 2016 lonmin s workforce shrunk dramatically from 40 000 to 33 000 employees with another 8000 workers fired in 2018 and 4100 in mid 2019 sibanye s takeover plan projected the firing of a further 12 600 lonmin workers within three years a subsequent price recovery of one metal palladium closely related to platinum rising from 826 ounce in september 2018 to a march 2019 high of 1601 ounce apparently slowed lonmin s retrenchment process but sibanye remained intent on lonmin labour rationalisation in general froneman s treatment of workers was seen as exceptionally careless even in a south african context with 24 mining fatalities at sibanye in 2018 alone that year froneman was awarded salary and benefits worth 3 8 million even though the entire firm s profits before interest taxes depreciation and amortisation were only 47 million but the troubles froneman brought upon himself at sibanye were prefigured by the marikana massacre the labour movement witnessed an extraordinary upsurge of shopfloor militancy in the subsequent weeks and the association of mineworkers and construction union amcu emerged so strong from the num s demise at lonmin that it waged a five month strike across the platinum belt in 2014 in the wake of the massacre lonmin was also the site of new frictions with two new advocacy groups from the surrounding community bapo ba mogale and the mining forum of south africa the two groups complained lonmin has circumvented compliance willfully and purposefully a practice they have mastered for years with intent to secure interests of capital at the expense of the disadvantaged and the poor they have a proven track record of presiding and surviving on hopelessness volatility death instability poverty and violence the massacre also humiliated a high profile lonmin financial supporter the world bank the bank s 2007 12 celebration of lonmin s so called strategic community investment at marikana attracted persistent complaints from a women s community group sikhala sonke we cry together supported by the wits university centre for applied legal studies cals another unnecessary casualty of marikana was the possibility of an ambitious state led mining policy since who could trust a state led first by jacob zuma and then ramaphosa to safeguard workers communities women and environments the then african national congress anc youth league leader julius malema raised the demand for mining nationalisation at a 2011 conference and as a result a party disciplinary committee led by ramaphosa expelled him and his comrades malema subsequently founded the economic freedom fighters eff party and won a growing share of the platinum belt s support in subsequent elections rising to a third of the voters residing in marikana s shacks and hostels in the 2019 election one of the eff members of parliament was a feisty sikhala sonke founder primrose sonti the massacre had shifted south african politics forever the state s response was to distract and defer from the deepest problems unveiled by the massacre wrongdoing was investigated by the 2012 15 farlam commission set up by zuma but the outcome was widely condemned as inadequate it is tempting to emphasise the negligence or malevolence of personalities judge ian farlam blamed maniacal police leadership lonmin chief executive ian farmer s salary was 236 times higher than the typical rock drill operator farmer s main executive replacement barnard mokwena was later unveiled as a state security agency operative in the structure agency dialectic it is these kinds of characters who make it easy to villainise lonmin and the state but even when structural forces are at work central personalities can be targeted for blame thus while lonmin was intent on illicit financial flows it was due to ramaphosa s strong support as leader of the incwala black empowerment partner firm according to lonmin s lawyer incwala for very many years refused to agree to changing what became a 100 million outflow to the bermuda tax haven justified as marketing expenses even after lonmin itself decided to end the tax dodge the state did nothing to punish this nor did it provide the reparations to massacred and injured mineworkers families that even farlam recommended were due for many years perhaps the most blatant case of state corporate collusion appeared in april 2019 when amcu was threatened with deregistration by the south african department of labour on grounds that it had not properly followed institutional procedures such as regular conventions that qualify it to be considered a trade union sibanye s froneman had just humbled amcu leader joseph mathunjwa in the gold sector strike and as platinum negotiations got underway even worse conflict was expected mathunjwa complained the registrar is inconsistent and unduly interfering in the affairs of amcu the inconsistency of the registrar when it comes to the deregistration of trade unions leaves a lot to be desired there are numerous examples of trade unions and trade union federations who have contravened many prescriptions including financial submissions they were never deregistered or threatened with cancellation of registration instead he chooses to focus on amcu this is clearly a political agenda even worse news for amcu followed two weeks later when a judge once known for his pro worker ideological bias dennis davis ruled against the union s last gasp attempt to save jobs by halting sibanye s takeover on grounds of lonmin s proximity to bankruptcy notwithstanding transient fluctuations in the price of platinum group metals and currency fluctuations lonmin s continued existence was in jeopardy and the number of job losses that sibanye and lonmin projected as a result of the merger was rational at best lonmin would continue to tread water that is if it was not placed into business rescue which if it occurred would hold significant risk for 32 000 jobs within days a reality check to davis misplaced pity for lonmin was offered by business day s ann crotty in december 2017 lonmin shareholders shell shocked by events dating from even before the marikana massacre of august 2012 must have been tempted to heave a huge sigh of relief when sibanye stillwater arrived on their doorstep with a share exchange offer as could be expected given that the sibanye stillwater team could smell fear and desperation from the lonmin camp the offer was cheeky it priced in all of lonmin s problems many of which looked near fatal but was remarkably snoep when it came to the assets which include a state of the art smelter and two refineries lonmin also has an assessed loss of 1 1bn extremely valuable for a profit generating entity lonmin has managed to survive through the depths of survived the platinum price weakness and now no longer requires rescuing indeed crotty quoted a leading mining analyst critical of the deal concerned about froneman s underpayment to lonmin s shareholders given how much the takeover target s fortunes had improved over the prior eighteen months if anything the all share acquisition by sibanye is increasingly looking like a disguised rights issue by sibanye to shore up its strained balance sheet and covenant ratios sensing the unease froneman quickly authorised a minor increase in the price and lonmin chief executive ben magara legally bound to favour the sibanye takeover downplayed any expectation that the rising profits he had just registered now merited a rethink of the deal our performance has been impacted by low morale and high management turnover instability and uncertainty due to the extended timeline to close the sibanye stillwater transaction caused by amcu on may 24 one of the most important south african financiers standard bank warned shareholders that they were being sold out by 460 million instead of 0 81 share the price should be 2 43 if assets such as the platinum producer s suspended k4 project spare processing capacity and a concentrator are factored in if more than 25 percent of the shareholders vote no the merger will fail the south african state s corruption riddled public investment commission with 29 percent ownership and thus power to block the sale has not stated how it will vote so a high degree of tension looms in london before tuesday s meeting resistance ebbs and flows from the local to global and back against mining capital the politicians and the state stood a variety of disparate organisations amcu sikhala sonke and cals the church based bench marks foundation which in 2017 had begun campaigning for divestment from lonmin a johannesburg based network of activists known as the marikana support campaign the eff and solidarity activists in britain and germany in addition to better wages and more community investment their main post massacre demands were that lonmin and the government publicly apologise pay survivors and widows reparations civil suits of more than 70 million have been filed and declare august 16 a national holiday with a monument at the site of the massacre other concrete grievances were regularly expressed by the marikana support campaign such as no action has been taken against lonmin directors despite a recommendation for them to be investigated for possible prosecution president zuma has sat on the findings of the claasen inquiry into riah phiyega in the meantime she has ended her contract and maintained all her benefits zuma consistently refused to meet these demands and instead promoted improvement of the living conditions of workers government failed to rapidly make mandated compensation payments to the workers and their families for widows and children s loss of support claims and for 275 unlawful arrest and detention claims by surviving workers in addition two other international solidarity campaigns continued to put pressure on lonmin prior to its death in london there are regular picketing film screenings and tours arranged by the marikana miners solidarity campaign targeting lonmin its institutional owners and its financiers london based asset management funds investec majedie schroders standard life and legal general who own 44 percent of the corporation a consortium of banks including lloyds hsbc and rbs are lonmin s biggest lenders two important activist groups there are the london mining network and the student movement decolonising environment and in germany the major platinum purchaser basf lonmin s largest single customer dating back three decades came under pressure from a plough back the fruits campaign of solidarity activists demanding that basf put pressure on lonmin to improve workplace and community conditions the firm resisted this secondary pressure but basf was in 2017 finally compelled to admit we note that the development of living conditions for lonmin workers is not progressing as quickly as one would expect or hope this is due to the fact that the situation in south africa is extremely multi faced and cannot be solved in the short term by one institution alone in 2018 a book edited by german and austrian campaigners business as usual after marikana deepened the critique of lonmin but so far notwithstanding the impressive international solidarity resolutions of the grievances have not been achieved by the disparate civil society strategies that followed marikana one was the demand for higher wages which the workers were gradually winning however the r12 500 month initially demanded in mid 2011 when it amounted to 1985 month had shrunk to just 870 month in mid 2019 due to currency devaluation from r6 3 to r14 4 in that period the r12 500 demand was only achieved in 2019 but inflation had eroded that sum by more than a third another strategy was genuine community development advocated most strongly by sikhala sonke women who in part attacked the world bank for its failures followed by further bapo ba mogale community grievances lonmin management repeatedly claimed to have spent more than 35 million on community housing since 2012 though conceded it had not met the promise of 5500 worker owned houses because of lack of demand since none of these campaigns for improvements at the point of production led by amcu or labour reproduction led by sikhala sonke have been satisfactorily achieved what can be learned from these shortcomings the 2012 19 era provided dispiriting lessons in power relations thanks to the fragmented single issue nature of the attacks on lonmin most of which will continue to apply in the sibanye era as well as several that require more attention to the 2012 conjuncture for the sake of facilitating the demand for reparations to transcend the silo politics the crucial strategic questions are what solidarity opportunities for future campaigning might emerge both within the debt ridden working class as it strives to survive on inadequate wages and against the rump of lonmin as captured by sibanye its purchasers basf and vw and its bankers especially the world bank indeed is nationalisation of the platinum reserves as well as the multinational corporate owned mining infrastructure feasible and desirable in a pre socialist neoliberal nationalist era in which the state continues to be run by cyril ramaphosa fighting for a nationalised platinum sector to prevent the reloading of marikana s various oppressions as appears certain today a much larger accounting of south africa s resource cursed mining sector must be made to recap the period since 2012 revealed at least half a dozen underlying curses at marikana as well as across what is termed the minerals energy complex political the obedience of politicians like ramaphosa and the state security apparatus to the predatory needs of multinational mining capital economic the tendency to overproduction intrinsic to the capitalist system especially in times of a commodity super cycle 2002 11 whose subsequent crash left lonmin vastly over exposed financial usurious microfinance borrowed by mineworkers leading to extreme borrower desperation by the time of the august 2012 strikes 150 million in dubious world bank development finance investment and chaotic corporate investment given lonmin s share price debacle gendered especially the stressed reproduction of labour and community by women in marikana s wretched nkaneng and wonderkop shack settlements environmental extreme degradation within fast growing peri urban slums nearby which minerals are dug and smelted using high carbon processes that also pollute local water soil and air and labour related platinum rock drill operators inadequate wages and deplorable working and residential conditions especially in comparison to mining executives ludicrously generous remuneration the durability of apartheid era migrancy itself a condition dividing workers from the area s traditional residents along familial ethnic and property related class lines intra union battles which split workers and generated some of the initial 2012 violence followed by further violence in 2017 including within amcu and ongoing mass retrenchments due to a failing automation strategy in future months and years can these forces find common cause the underlying principles of lonmin s various opponents often seem worlds apart according to samantha hargreaves of the women in mining ngo narrow male dominated trade union and worker interests mean that hope for a radical resolution lies in the struggles of women in places like wonderkop the challenge is linking these with mainly male worker struggles and environmentalist solidarity to challenge the extractivist model of development the social economic and environmental costs of which are principally borne by working class and peasant women it may well be in this context that both shopfloor and grassroots forces require assistance from institutions with larger agendas including political parties and even ngos challenging the broader economic agenda of transnational corporations for example in mid 2015 lonmin s tax avoidance was raised by aidc director brian ashley a leading amcu advisor as the aidc we will pursue a campaign for the company s licence to be revoked and for the state owned mining company to take over the company we need to hold these huge corporations to account you cannot have a company in a country that needs to be rebuilt sucking the resources dry at the same time the leftist eff party also demanded mine nationalisation and in the case of the massacre punishment including both jail for lonmin leaders and compensation the eff will institute a process of reparations against lonmin to demand reparations and payments of all the families of deceased mineworkers of r10 million then 1 1 million per family and r5 million 0 55 million per injured worker even the centre right democratic alliance party announced that it also supported forcing lonmin to compensate massacre victims families with lonmin unable to continue as a going concern much bigger questions about political strategy can be raised to think creatively about the options for lonmin via sibanye not only requires a revived debate about whether or not to take away the firm s mining license which indeed was threatened by pretoria in late 2016 due to lonmin s default on its social and labour plan or to nationalise it with or preferably without given such immense liabilities compensation to traditional overseas owners as the eff argue but setting aside the particular problems at marikana the disastrous recent period of mining capital s over accumulation and ruinous competition also compels much wider considerations on the need for new priorities that would radically change the corporate financing parameters now in place these might include developing a world platinum cartel centred in south africa establishing a genuinely green economic strategy to move the minerals energy complex away from its traditional roots in coal iron ore manganese gold and diamonds and not simply to hydrogen fuel cells for individualised electric vehicle production incorporating natural capital accounting into state and corporate decision making so that the true costs and benefits of mining can finally be understood in full cost accounting terms and ultimately ensuring a just transition to low carbon post extractivist economic activities that are especially friendly to women s needs within not just the sphere of production but also the reproduction of society as the aidc million climate jobs campaign advocates these are the kinds of strategic questions that can be raised not only thanks to injustices that continue at marikana but also because the specific problems of microfinance development finance and corporate finance confirm the power but also the overlapping interlocking vulnerabilities associated with lonmin s historic abuse of people and planet and sibanye s likely amplification of these however the vulnerabilities even huge mining corporations face have generated mainly the kinds of fragmented campaigns for reform discussed above as the limits of reformist strategies are reached in each of these it is still possible for much greater unity to be established between disparate groups of mining capital s victims since these victims soon include investors representing south africa s large civil service as well as financiers it will be up to the grassroots shop floor and environmental activists to ensure that an even more exploitative regime of extraction in the platinum belt does not emerge in coming years moreover so as to lessen vulnerability to volatile world capitalist markets it is long overdue for south africa with 88 percent of world reserves to join russian and zimbabwean authorities in a world platinum cartel about which formal discussions began in 2013 amid the first round of platinum gluts in the process a genuinely green strategy for the region should move the economy away from overdependence upon traditional coal iron ore manganese gold and diamonds exports and ensure a just transition to post extractivist economic activities in line with south africa s growing climate mitigation and adaptation imperatives as sikhala sonke and allies point out the latter should be especially friendly to women s needs within not just the sphere of production but also the reproduction of society as for the trade union that is most popular in marikana amcu mathunjwa has eloquently explained the workers concerns in these terms just surviving each day is a struggle that denies them the choice of engaging in issues of climate change and the ecological crisis caused by mining and the fossil fuel industry if we leave it to the market we will not get to the roots of the climate and environmental crisis and workers will be discarded in the existing mining and energy sectors we refuse to be made to act like ostriches there is a climate and ecological crisis we have a horrific jobs crisis we need solutions to both but we need a just transition where no worker loses his or her job without either being skilled and transferred to another industry or is compensated for the rest of their working life as workers we will not bear the brunt of a crisis we had nothing to do with except by virtue of the exploitation of our labour the consolidation of ramaphosa s power in the 2019 election thanks to a 58 percent vote four percent higher than his predecessor zuma had managed in the 2016 election and his promise that foreign direct investment would reach 100 billion within five years together confirmed how difficult the terrain would be for subaltern forces in coming years in the internal fissures facing the anc there was no progressive option for marikana given how weak the trade union and communist party rump supporters had become not to mention how ambivalent about the anti lonmin struggle they were given num s 2012 defeat there and amcu s rise froneman s anticipated closure of platinum shafts at lonmin marikana operations with the loss of 12 000 mineworker and the shift of the big smelter there into a site for sibanye s cheaper operations to process their ore will see the fading of any residual hope retained by workers and communities internecine violence between amcu and num rose to new heights in early 2019 at sibanye s gold mines but could get worse in the platinum fields as the latter union seeks to reclaim its old ground especially if the former is deregistered these are very similar tensions compared to the conditions that in mid 2012 confronted marikana s activists they faced the loaded weapons of lonmin and its police allies and didn t flinch will they do so again now that marikana s rulers are reloading patrick bond teaches political economy at the university of the witwatersrand in johannesburg for a full account including references

the us china trade war seems not to have caused much pain yet but after 117 consecutive months of economic expansion compared to an historical average of 48 months the us could soon find itself thrown back into a painful recession owing to disruptions caused by its own trade policy hong kong dashing hopes of a quick agreement on trade relations with china us president donald trump s administration has imposed punitive tariffs on another 200 billion of chinese goods now that the chinese government has responded with new tariffs on 60 billion of us products the united states is threatening tariffs targeting yet another 300 billion of chinese imports both sides are now digging in for a long fight largely because americans have yet to feel the pain of trump s policies china has understood trump s transactional style for some time but it only recently began to appreciate fully the significance of trump s america first doctrine which according to us state department policy director kiron skinner rests on four pillars national sovereignty reciprocity burden sharing and regional partnerships national sovereignty and reciprocity are standard features of any country s foreign policy they form the foundations of the 1648 peace of westphalia which recognized after the thirty years war that sovereign states have their own interests to defend and must engage with other states on a reciprocal basis but the trump administration often takes reciprocity too far weakening america s capacity to build and maintain partnerships regional or otherwise indeed under trump the us has undercut the interests of its closest allies for its own narrow benefit even threatening to impose broad tariffs on automobile and auto part imports from the european union japan and south korea claiming that they pose a national security threat in any case the active ingredient of the trump doctrine is burden sharing skinner interprets this narrowly focusing on the need for america s nato allies to increase their defense spending what she does not acknowledge is that the us is also forcing the rest of the world to share the burden of its unsustainable structural savings deficit the us consistently runs both a fiscal deficit with total expenditure of which defense comprised 14 8 in 2017 significantly exceeding its income and a current account deficit if those twin deficits run at a trend rate of over 3 of gdp per annum net us debt to the rest of the world currently at 40 of gdp will double in less than 24 years subscribe to ps digital subscribe to ps digital access every new ps commentary our entire on point suite of subscriber exclusive content including longer reads insider interviews big picture big question and say more and the full ps archive subscribe now the trump administration insists that the only deficit to worry about is the bilateral trade deficit with china but even if china bowed to us demands and eliminated the bilateral deficit america s imbalance of saving and investment would merely shift its external deficit like water in a squeezed balloon toward other surplus economies like the eu japan and south korea the targets of the threatened automotive tariffs for decades the us saving shortfall seemed like a problem to be managed not solved since the us started running structural deficits in the 1970s there has been a kind of global grand bargain on the topic the world willingly finances america s current account deficit in us dollars in exchange the us acts as a guarantor of free trade and global security the trump doctrine upends that bargain by weaponizing america s economic leverage including the us dollar it aims to force the world to uphold its end with no guarantee that the us will respond in kind this approach will end up costing virtually everyone beginning with american consumers with its trade war the trump administration is engaging in tax subterfuge historically governments have addressed their excessive debts with tax increases spending cuts higher inflation with negative real interest rates or in the case of the roman empire conquest of creditors it seems to be politically impossible for the us government to raise taxes domestically so the trump administration has found a workaround tariff increases end up serving effectively as consumption taxes but because they can be blamed on foreigners they are more palatable to the american public from trump s perspective the costs of this approach appear low with the us economy still growing stock markets at record highs and unemployment at record lows jpmorgan has estimated that the trade war s direct costs will amount to just 0 2 of gdp for the us 0 4 of gdp for china and 0 22 of gdp for the rest of the world through 2020 but today s prosperity hinges mainly on the temporary effects of budget busting tax cuts and quantitative easing by the us federal reserve which expanded its balance sheet by 3 6 trillion from 2007 to 2017 it has since reduced that total by 391 billion historically low interest rates and liquidity inflated asset bubbles financed the fiscal deficit and enabled the household sector to deleverage it was thanks largely to qe that us net wealth increased by 33 6 trillion from 2010 to 2018 that wealth was not however shared equally on the contrary the qe centered approach has deepened domestic inequality for example every time the s p 500 has dipped over the last decade corporate share buybacks amounting to 5 trillion from 2008 to 2018 provided a cushion this was technically good for growth the s p 500 index rose by a total of 319 from its 2009 trough to its march 2019 peak but trump s trade war is threatening even those narrowly shared and for the fed costly gains for the top 25 s p companies with a combined market capitalization exceeding 20 trillion just under one third of revenues come from china and taiwan weighted average meaning that tariffs on chinese imports will hit profits tech giants that depend on chips components and software sales to china amounting to 20 65 of total revenue will face particularly high costs as will us shoe importers the trade war seems not to have caused much pain yet because financial markets assume perhaps wrongly that central banks will bail them out with more qe but after 117 consecutive months of economic expansion compared to an historical average of 48

pakistan has a long standing relationship with imf signing 22 plans starting from its first deal on dec 28 1958 until the recent one on 13th may 2019 the international monetary fund or imf is an international organization which is headquartered in washington d c and honed memberships from 189 countries around the globe the purpose of imf is to provide monetary stability and cooperation foster international trade create employment opportunities reduce poverty and create sustainable economic growth around the world the three main functions that imf provides for its members includes economic surveillance lending and capacity building economic surveillance entails the monitoring of changing economic and financial policies of its 189 member countries lending includes providing loans to member countries facing some degree of economic crises and capacity building refers to the help provided in building new economic policies and institutions and training people of the member countries the imf lending programs can thereby be divided into two sub categories depending on the economic condition and need of the hour of member countries these includes the lending through gra general resource account and lending through prgt poverty reduction growth trust lending through gra general resource account is the kind of program which is appropriate for not so poor economies and wealthy countries which are temporarily facing economic crisis on the other hand lending through prgt poverty reduction growth trust is a program which is ideal for economies that are not so poor and poor but at a relatively low interest rate to reduce poverty under the two loan plans imf offers 10programs through its prgt and gra pakistan has been a recipient of loans under four programs out of these ten categories it is important to note that not all 21 of these agreements are stand by agreements sbas or what we call the bail outs in fact pakistan has entered into 12 stand by agreements sbas up until now the remaining nine agreements are those that fall under the category of prgt or imf programs that aim to counter poverty introduce structural reforms divert domestic economic crisis or hedge smaller economies against the risk of a global financial crisis a stand by agreements or sbas are short to medium term loan arrangements with a payback period of 3 5 and 5 years therefore sbas fall under the general resource account which as described before are not only created for poor economies unlike programs under the poverty reduction growth trust the writer is master trainer advisor at pitac lahore if we study the past trends of the imf and pakistan deals it is interesting to note that the length of the payback period and principal borrowed amount has been increasing over the time for instance only one year contacts were signed in the era beginning from 1958 until 1977 furthermore the seven agreements signed in this period were also bailouts or stand by agreements only consequently if we look at the era beginning from 1980 until 1995 all seven programs were between 1 2 years of payback lastly in the era beginning from 1997 until 2013 the pml n made six arrangements with the imf costing a whopping 6 4 billion in loans with a three year return plan for all except one of these plans currently the agreement signed on 13may 2019 is our 13th arrangement with the imf to ask for a bailout and this event marks the 22nd loan that pakistan will be taking from the imf in an interview with the media pakistan s new finance minister abdul hafeez shaikh said that we have reached an agreement with the imf staff for 6bn for the next three years there will be adjustments involved but we will try to make certain that the extent of pain on low income people is minimal the finance minister also insured that pakistan may receive more funding s by the world bank and asian development bank worth us 2 3 billion approximately such a move will send positive signals to investors he also said that the conditions imposed by imf are not only beneficial for pakistan s economy but also essential for its survival it is expected that inflation in pakistan will continue to touch new heights considering the tough conditions the new imf plan will impose on the pakistani government these conditions includes reducing the budget deficit by 0 6 of gdp by the end of next fiscal year this will require the government to reduce its spending and increase revenue by us 6 billion in new taxes decrease in subsidies by us 1 billion as well as nationalization of state owned businesses the stock market is still reeling from the shock and investor confidence have not been restored yet with the fall of 816 b pts just after the imf announcement has arrived moreover with imf s condition to review pakistan s counter terrorism report and money laundering it has stepped into the domain of intervening with our foreign policy for the very first time the effects of this imf plan will be felt immediately after the government announces the budget next month in its own statement to the public imf said that pakistan is facing a challenging economic environment with lacklustre growth elevated inflation high indebtedness and a weak external position in order to conclude it is important to understand that economic challenges pakistan faces is due to its history of poor economic policies therefore imf will work with pakistan in creating better macroeconomic policy and structural reforms which will improve public financing and reduction in government indebtedness however for imf bailout package to work out we need to focus on the domestic policies and regulations so that local investors confidence takes up the boost to help in uplifting the difficult economic situation the writer is master trainer advisor at pitac lahore

as president donald trump continues his state visit to japan amid a worsening trade war with china he could well be thinking back to a previous economic spat between washington and an asian economic powerhouse in the 1980s japan was the big bad its economy was booming the second largest in the world and many in the united states feared they were about to be overtaken articles were published warning of the japanning of america or an economic pearl harbor as japanese businesses bought us companies and landmarks lawmakers and commentators warned of a growing trade deficit between the two countries and complained of japanese firms stealing us intellectual property and taking advantage of unfair trade deals in an interview with the morton downey jr show in 1989 trump himself complained that japan had systematically sucked the blood out of america sucked the blood out it s a huge problem and it s a problem that s going to get worse trump said of the us japan trade balance and they re laughing at us by then however change was already happening and far from overtaking the united states japan was about to fall far behind trade war after president ronald reagan took office in 1981 the

of cars it exported to the united states panic over japanese trade power grew and lawmakers on both sides demanded action in approving a bill calling for tough trade reprisals against japan robert packwood then republican head of the senate s finance committee promised to give tokyo an eye for an eye that is all they understand during a 1985 finance committee hearing democratic sen max baucus

devaluing the us dollar against the japanese yen and the german deutsche mark this was a boon for the united states leading to an increase in exports and a lowering of its trade deficit with many western european countries yet the plaza accord wasn t the end of us action against japan in 1987 washington imposed 100 tariffs on 300 million worth of japanese imports effectively blocking them from the american market things quickly turned sour for tokyo as the yen increased in value japanese products became more and more expensive and countries turned away from the one time export powerhouse efforts by the country s central bank to keep the yen s value low sparked a stock price bubble the collapse of which helped push the country into recession and a lost decade japan s export and gdp growth essentially halted in the first half of 1986 economists joshua felman and daniel leigh wrote in a report for the international monetary fund they concluded that while the plaza accord did not cause japan s economic downturn by itself it did trigger a series of events compounded by poor decisions in tokyo which led to the collapse competing lessons some of trump s first forays into politics involved railing against japan during the 1980s and early 1990s during that time he started calling for the use of tariffs as a trade weapon while he has not referenced the historical us japan relationship during the recent china conflict washington s success against tokyo could influence his thinking on how to handle beijing one of his key advisers on trade robert lighthizer also took part in japan negotiations in the 1980s in 2011 as trump flirted with a presidential run lighthizer praised his skepticism toward pure free trade dogma the icon of modern conservatism ronald reagan imposed quotas on imported steel protected harley davidson from japanese competition restrained imports of semiconductors and automobiles and took myriad similar steps to keep american industry strong he wrote yet while lighthizer and trump may take positive lessons from the 1980s trade war beijing is also paying attention and china s leaders have no intention of copying japan s mistakes in an editorial last year china s xinhua state news agency warned that japan was seriously hurt by its improper response to the plaza accord and us trade pressure it blamed the us for scapegoating japan for problems in the domestic economy adding a strong protectionist sentiment was the direct driving force behind the plaza accord this has been a common theme in state media coverage of the trade war that the us is seeking to blame beijing for matters outside its control repeating history of course 2019 is not 1985 and china is not japan beijing is far stronger both economically and politically than tokyo was in the 1980s with japan dependent on the united states for national security and less willing to risk washington s ire japan was an easy target for us bashing after the second world war japan has been both politically and economically dependent on the us resulting in limited bargaining power to counteract the us analysts alicia garcia herrero and kohei iwahara wrote last week china is in a better position to resist us pressure the risk in this instance isn t of a failure to learn from history but that both parties could take the wrong lessons trump and lighthizer having cut their teeth in the battles against tokyo could assume that a similarly aggressive policy will prompt beijing to bend to their demands chinese negotiators have already learned what happens when you push back against trump with trade talks collapsing this month after beijing reportedly attempted to alter the deal at the last minute the failure of those talks led to an immediate escalation in tensions with new tariffs imposed by both sides this could be blamed on beijing s late changes but equally on washington s unwillingness to negotiate at the same time china s interpretation of the 1980s could also lead it to make missteps on thursday foreign ministry spokesman lu kang said any mutually beneficial deal must be based on mutual respect equality and win win outcomes but as many observers have noted what china s leaders regard as win win often means a win on its terms and a desire to avoid repeating japan s mistakes could result in beijing refusing to take a minor loss that could ultimately lead to a better overall agreement japan is currently celebrating the beginning of the reiwa era under a new emperor a time to wipe the slate clean and start again us and chinese trade negotiators might be better off copying that lesson than those of the 1980s
by robert romano on may 10 the south china morning post published a report will china use its us 1 2 trillion of us debt as firepower to fight the trade war speculating that china might have potential leverage against the u s after president donald trump levied 25 percent tariffs on a total of now 250 billion of chinese goods but that s all it is speculation nothing more china is in no danger of dumping its treasuries holdings and even if it were it would gain no trade advantage from doing so why you ask because they re a paper dragon for starters if you look at the 16 2 trillion public treasuries market excluding the 5 8 trillion the u s government holds china has about 1 13 trillion of that or about 7 percent of the total the south china morning post s karen yeung warns china could strike back by dumping its vast holdings of us government debt flooding the market with treasuries would push down u s bond prices and cause the yields to spike that would make it more costly for us companies and consumers to borrow in turn depressing america s economic growth so if beijing were to start dumping treasuries flooding the open market interest rates for the bonds they were dumping might increase but just temporarily because to sell they d have to have willing buyers and right now there are plenty of those in fact fearful of the breakdown of trade talks with the u s by china investors are fleeing equities and buying none other than u s treasuries which is driving down interest rates in addition one must also factor in potential actions by central banks to perhaps purchase any bonds that were being dumped even if treasuries markets could not fully absorb the temporary glut in that context both markets and the federal reserve and allied central banks in the uk japan and elsewhere would likely be able to smooth over any impact of china or anyone else dumping bonds so kind of like daffy duck eating the gunpowder and swallowing the match it s a neat trick but china will only be able to do it once moreover dumping treasuries would actually erase china s ability to use treasuries purchases to manipulate exchange rates the way that works is not by dumping treasuries but buying dollars and dumping their own currency in bulk usually with a horde of foreign exchange reserves and using the dollars to purchase treasuries the manipulating country issue domestic securities or raise interest rates during this process to domestic inflation this makes the country s exports to the u s cheaper and helps boost global market share on our side it acts as a tariff since it increases the price of china s imports when it does this yes big purchases of treasuries do tend to push interest rates for our bonds down and with lower interest rates the dollar tends to be cheaper on a price basis because of the manipulation relative to the yuan it remains more expensive after this process here china has an additional advantage in this regard with its ability to set the fixed exchange rate so when it wants to manipulate it can devalue the yuan buy dollars with it and buy treasuries with those and repeat the cycle it s quite ingenious and is one of the reasons why china and other exporters have such large sums of treasuries to date again it makes its exports to the u s cheaper and just one more non tariff barrier that makes it more difficult for the u s to ship goods there since the process also makes imports more expensive that is why president donald trump should not only tell china to bring it on when it comes to dumping treasuries he might also consider having the u s treasury label china a currency manipulator and bar it from purchasing any more treasuries after all china needs to keep buying treasuries to exert its trade advantage without treasuries to fall back on the yuan could appreciate vis a vis the dollar even with the fixed exchange rate dumping treasuries is often viewed as a potential retaliatory move by china but the only way it might hurt would be if doing so would set off a sovereign debt style crisis with high interest rates and low demand but that is extremely unlikely to occur even if the initial aftermath was painful even without china u s paper is still very much in demand what china would lose in the process would be its manufacturing market share to other countries that could use the new available stockpile of treasuries on the market to devalue their own currencies and compete with china for goods shipments to the u s in other words markets are resilient and should be more than able to offset any interest rate impact on china dumping treasuries and in the meantime beijing would gain no advantage in doing so it s not leverage it s suicide they can stop buying paper or we could block them from buying more paper we don t need china to buy u s debt someone else will it s no skin off our nose robert romano is the vice president of public policy at americans for limited government you can read more of his articles at

the results from the european parliamentary elections confirmed a strong showing for nigel farage s brexit party which topped the vote share with 32 per cent the conservative party was the big loser coming fifth and with just 9 per cent of the votes conservative leadership hopefuls have pounced on the election result suggesting that the electorate wants brexit to be delivered it seems that conservative candidates will campaign to take the uk out of the eu without a deal unless the eu makes substantial concessions in order to appeal to the mainly eurosceptic party membership which will decide the next leader mr catril said this makes new elections a growing risk if the new conservative leader makes it clear they are willing to leave without a deal there are likely to be sufficient

bank should be tougher and keep rates where they are and tell us to do our jobs writes elmer funke kupper advertisement nab outlook on rates rba governor lowe has signalled lower interest rates will be considered at the june board meeting also suggesting the bank might cut rates twice given its forecasts are based a 1 per cent cash rate this supports our view that the rba will cut in june and august with the risk of additional stimulus by early 2020 research suggests that two rate cuts will boost growth by about 0 25 0 4pp over 1 2 years although lower inflation expectations make this task more difficult for the rba the rba will be helped by looming personal income tax cuts and a relaxation of prudential regulations on mortgages the tax cuts could boost growth by up to 0 3 per cent of gdp allowing for some leakage to imports although some households may use the funds to pay down debt the planned abolition of the 7 per cent floor in calculating the serviceability of mortgages enhances the effectiveness of rate cuts and allows some borrowers to take out larger loans but the governor downplayed its significance given most borrowers do not take the maximum mortgage offered by lenders along with two rate cuts this additional support has already been factored into the rba s forecasts with the rba concluding that it will still take until mid 2020 for inflation to finally return to the bottom of the 2 3 per cent target band this suggests to us that the reserve bank may still deliver additional stimulus particularly when we think the economy will continue to

one of the reasons that most economists of the 1920s did not recognize the existence of an inflationary problem was the widespread adoption of a stable price level as the goal and criterion for monetary policy the extent to which the federal reserve authorities were guided by a desire to keep the price level stable has been a matter of considerable controversy far less controversial is the fact that more and more economists came to consider a stable price level as the major goal of monetary policy the fact that general prices were more or less stable during the 1920s told most economists that there was no inflationary threat and therefore the events of the great depression caught them completely unaware actually bank credit expansion creates its mischievous effects by distorting price relations and by raising and altering prices compared to what they would have been without the expansion statistically therefore we can only identify the increase in money supply a simple fact we cannot prove inflation by pointing to price increases we can only approximate explanations of complex price movements by engaging in a comprehensive economic history of an era a task which is beyond the scope of this study suffice it to say here that the stability of wholesale prices in the 1920s was the result of monetary inflation offset by increased productivity which lowered costs of production and increased the supply of goods but this offset was only statistical it did not eliminate the boom bust cycle it only obscured it the economists who emphasized the importance of a stable price level were thus especially deceived for they should have concentrated on what was happening to the supply of money consequently the economists who raised an alarm over inflation in the 1920s were largely the qualitativists they were written off as hopelessly old fashioned by the newer economists who realized the overriding importance of the quantitative in monetary affairs the trouble did not lie with particular credit on particular markets such as stock or real estate the boom in the stock and real estate markets reflected mises s trade cycle a disproportionate boom in the prices of titles to capital goods caused by the increase in money supply attendant upon bank credit expansion the stability of the price level in the 1920s is demonstrated by the bureau of labor statistics index of wholesale prices which fell to 93 4 100 1926 in june 1921 rose slightly to a peak of 104 5 in november 1925 and then fell back to 95 2 by june 1929 the price level in short rose slightly until 1925 and fell slightly thereafter consumer price indices also behaved in a similar manner on the other hand the snyder index of the general price level which includes all types of prices real estate stocks rents and wage rates as well as wholesale prices rose considerably during the period from 158 in 1922 1913 100 to 179 in 1929 a rise of 13 percent stability was therefore achieved only in consumer and wholesale prices but these were and still are the fields considered especially important by most economic writers within the overall aggregate of wholesale prices foods and farm products rose over the period while metals fuel chemicals and home furnishings fell considerably that the boom was largely felt in the capital goods industries can be seen by a the quadrupling of stock prices over the period and by b the fact that durable goods and iron and steel production each increased by about 160 percent while the production of non durable goods largely consumer goods increased by only 60 percent in fact production of such consumer items as manufactured foods and textile products increased by only 48 percent and 36 percent respectively from 1921 to 1929 another illustration of mises s theory was that wages were bid up far more in the capital goods industries overbidding of wage rates and other costs is a distinctive feature of mises s analysis of capital goods industries in the boom average hourly earnings according to the conference board index rose in selected manufacturing industries from 52 in july 1921 to 59 in 1929 a 12 percent increase among this group wage rates in consumer goods industries such as boots and shoes remained constant they rose 6 percent in furniture less than 3 percent in meat packing and 8 percent in hardware manufacturing on the other hand in such capital goods industries as machines and machine tools wage rates rose by 12 percent and by 19 percent in lumber 22 percent in chemicals and 25 percent in iron and steel federal reserve credit expansion then whether so intended or not managed to keep the price level stable in the face of an increased productivity that would in a free and unhampered market have led to falling prices and a spread of increased living standards to everyone in the population the inflation distorted the production structure and led to the ensuing depression adjustment period it also prevented the whole populace from enjoying the fruits of progress in lower prices and insured that only those enjoying higher monetary wages and incomes could benefit from the increased productivity there is much evidence for the charge of phillips mcmanus and nelson that the end result of what was probably the greatest price level stabilization experiment in history proved to be simply the greatest depression benjamin strong was apparently converted to a stable price level philosophy during 1922 on january 11 1925 strong privately wrote that it was my belief and i thought it was shared by all others in the federal reserve system that our whole policy in the future as in the past would be directed toward the stability of prices so far as it was possible for us to influence prices when asked in the stabilization hearings of 1927 whether the federal reserve board could stabilize the price level to a greater extent than in the past by open market operations and other control devices governor strong answered i personally think that the administration of the federal reserve system since the reaction of 1921 has been just as nearly directed as reasonable human wisdom could direct it toward that very object it appears that governor strong had a major hand in early 1928 in drafting the bill by representative james g strong of kansas no relation to compel the federal reserve system to promote a stable price level governor strong was ill by this time and out of control of the system but he wrote the final draft of the bill along with representative strong in the company of the congressman and professor john r commons one of the leading theoreticians of a stable price level strong discussed the bill with members of the federal reserve board when the board disapproved strong felt bound in his public statements to go along with them we must further note that carl snyder a loyal and almost worshipful follower of governor strong and head of the statistical department of the federal reserve bank of new york was a leading advocate of monetary and credit control by the federal reserve to stabilize the price level certainly the leading british economists of the day firmly believed that the federal reserve was deliberately and successfully stabilizing the price level john maynard keynes hailed the successful management of the dollar by the federal reserve board from 1923 to 1928 as a triumph for currency management d h robertson concluded in 1929 that a monetary policy consciously aimed at keeping the general price level approximately stable has apparently been followed with some success by the federal reserve board in the united states since 1922 whereas keynes continued to hail the reserve s policy a few years after the depression began robertson became critical looking back the great american stabilization of 1922 1929 was really a vast attempt to destabilize the value of money in terms of human effort by means of a colossal program of investment which succeeded for a surprisingly long period but which no human ingenuity could have managed to direct indefinitely on sound and balanced lines the siren song of a stable price level had lured leading politicians to say nothing of economists as early as 1911 it was then that professor irving fisher launched his career as head of the stable money movement in the united states he quickly gained the adherence of leading statesmen and economists to a plan for an international commission to study the money and price problem supporters included president william howard taft secretary of war henry stimson secretary of the treasury franklin macveagh governor woodrow wilson gifford pinchot seven senators and economists alfred marshall francis edgeworth and john maynard keynes in england president taft sent a special message to congress in february 1912 urging an appropriation for such an international conference the message was written by fisher in collaboration with assistant secretary of state huntington wilson a convert to stable money the senate passed the bill but it died in the house woodrow wilson expressed interest in the plan but dropped the idea in the press of other matters in the spring of 1918 a committee on the purchasing power of money of the american economic association endorsed the principle of stabilization though encountering banker opposition to his stable money doctrine led notably by a barton hepburn of the chase national bank fisher began organizing the stable money league at the end of 1920 and established the league at the end of may 1921 at the beginning of our inflationary era newton d baker secretary of war under wilson and professor james harvey rogers of cornell were two of the early organizers other prominent politicians and economists who played leading roles in the stable money league were professor jeremiah w jenks its first president henry a wallace editor of wallace s farmer and later secretary of agriculture john g winant later governor of new hampshire professor john r commons its second president george eastman of the eastman kodak family lyman j gage formerly secretary of the treasury samuel gompers president of the american federation of labor senator carter glass of virginia thomas r marshall vice president of the united states under wilson representative oscar w underwood malcolm c rorty and economists arthur twining hadley leonard p ayres william t foster david friday edwin w kemmerer wesley c mitchell warren m persons h parker willis allyn a young and carl snyder the ideal of a stable price level is relatively innocuous during a price rise when it can aid sound money advocates in trying to check the boom but it is highly mischievous when prices are tending to sag and the stabilizationists call for inflation and yet stabilization is always a more popular rallying cry when prices are falling the stable money league was founded in 1920 1921 when prices were falling during a depression soon prices began to rise and some conservatives began to see in the stable money movement a useful check against extreme inflationists as a result the league changed its name to the national monetary association in 1923 and its officers continued as before with professor commons as president by 1925 the price level had reached its peak and begun to sag and consequently the conservatives abandoned their support of the organization which again changed its name to the stable money association successive presidents of the new association were h parker willis john e rovensky executive vice president of the bank of america professor kemmerer and uncle frederic w delano other eminent leaders in the stable money association were professor willford i king president nicholas murray butler of columbia university john w davis democratic candidate for president in 1924 charles g dawes director of the bureau of the budget under harding and vice president under coolidge william green president of the american federation of labor charles evans hughes secretary of state until 1925 otto h kahn investment banker frank o lowden former republican governor of illinois elihu root former secretary of state and senator james h rand jr norman thomas of the socialist party paul m warburg and owen d young enlisting from abroad came charles rist of the bank of france eduard benes of czechoslovakia max lazard of france emile moreau of the bank of france louis rothschild of austria and sir arthur balfour sir henry strakosch lord melchett and sir josiah stamp of great britain serving as honorary vice presidents of the association were the presidents of the following organizations the american association for labor legislation american bar association american farm bureau federation american farm economic association american statistical association brotherhood of railroad trainmen national association of credit men national consumers league national education association american council on education united mine workers of america the national grange the chicago association of commerce the merchants association of new york and bankers associations in 43 states and the district of columbia executive director and operating head of the association with such formidable backing was norman lombard brought in by fisher in 1926 the association spread its gospel far and wide it was helped by the publicity given to thomas edison and henry ford s proposal for a commodity dollar in 1922 and 1923 other prominent stabilizationists in this period were professors george f warren and frank pearson of cornell royal meeker hudson b hastings alvin hansen and lionel d edie in europe in addition to the above mentioned advocates of stable money included professor arthur c pigou ralph g hawtrey j r bellerby r a lehfeldt g m lewis sir arthur salter knut wicksell gustav cassel arthur kitson sir frederick soddy f w pethick lawrence reginald mckenna sir basil blackett and john maynard keynes keynes was particularly influential in his propaganda for a managed currency and a stabilized price level as set forth in his tract on monetary reform published in 1923 ralph hawtrey proved to be one of the evil geniuses of the 1920s an influential economist in a land where economists have shaped policy far more influentially than in the united states hawtrey director of financial studies at the british treasury advocated international credit control by central banks to achieve a stable price level as early as 1913 in 1919 hawtrey was one of the first to call for the adoption of a gold exchange standard by european countries tying it in with international central bank cooperation hawtrey was one of the prime european trumpeters of the prowess of governor benjamin strong writing in 1932 at a time when robertson had come to realize the evils of stabilization hawtrey declared the american experiment in stabilization from 1922 to 1928 showed that an early treatment could check a tendency either to inflation or to depression the american experiment was a great advance upon the practice of the nineteenth century when the trade cycle was accepted passively when governor strong died hawtrey called the event a disaster for the world finally hawtrey was the main inspiration for the stabilization resolutions of the genoa conference of 1922 it was inevitable that this host of fashionable opinion should be translated into legislative pressure if not legislative action rep t alan goldsborough of maryland introduced a bill to stabilize the purchasing power of money in may 1922 essentially professor fisher s proposal fed to goldsborough by former vice president marshall witnesses for the bill were professors fisher rogers king and kemmerer but the bill was not reported out of committee in early 1924 goldsborough tried again and representative o b burtness of north dakota introduced another stabilization bill neither was reported out of committee the next major effort was a bill by rep james g strong of kansas introduced in january 1926 under the urging of veteran stabilizationist george h shibley who had been promoting the cause of stable prices since 1896 rather than the earlier fisher proposal for a compensated dollar to manipulate the price level the strong bill would have compelled the federal reserve system to act directly to stabilize the price level hearings were held from march 1926 until february 1927 testifying for the bill were shibley fisher lombard dr william t foster rogers bellerby and commons commons rep strong and governor strong then rewrote the bill as indicated above and hearings were held on the second strong bill in the spring of 1928 the high point of testimony for the second strong bill was that of sweden s professor gustav cassel whose eminence packed the congressional hearing room cassel had been promoting stabilization since 1903 the advice of this sage was that the government employ neither qualitative nor quantitative measures to check the boom since these would lower the general price level in a series of american lectures cassel also urged lower fed reserve ratios as well as worldwide central bank cooperation to stabilize the price level the strong bill met the fate of its predecessors and never left the committee but the pressure exerted at the various hearings for these bills as well as the weight of opinion and the views of governor strong served to push the federal reserve authorities into trying to manipulate credit for purposes of price stabilization international pressure strengthened the drive for a stable price level official action began with the genoa conference in the spring of 1922 this conference was called by the league of nations at the initiative of premier lloyd george who in turn was inspired by the dominant figure of montagu norman the financial commission of the conference adopted a set of resolutions which as fisher puts it have for years served as the potent armory for the advocates of stable money all over the world the resolutions urged international central bank collaboration to stabilize the world price level and also suggested a gold exchange standard on the financial commission were such stabilizationist stalwarts as sir basil blackett professor cassel dr vissering and sir henry strakosch the league of nations indeed was quickly taken over by the stabilizationists the financial committee of the league was largely inspired and run by governor montagu norman working through two close associates sir otto niemeyer and sir henry strakosch sir henry was as we have indicated a prominent stabilizationist furthermore norman s chief adviser in international affairs sir charles s addis was also an ardent stablizationist in 1921 a joint committee on economic crises was formed by the general labour conference the international labour office ilo of the league of nations and the financial committee of the league on this joint committee were three leading stabilizationists albert thomas henri fuss and major j r bellerby in 1923 thomas s report warned that a fall in the price level almost invariably causes unemployment henri fuss of the ilo propagandized for stable price levels in the international labour review in 1926 the joint committee met in june 1925 to affirm the principles of the genoa conference in the meanwhile two private international organizations the international association for labour legislation and the international association on unemployment held a joint international congress on social policy at prague in october 1924 the congress called for the general adoption of the principles of the genoa conference by stabilizing the general price level the international association for social progress adopted a report at its vienna meeting in september 1928 prepared by stabilizationist max lazard of the investment banking house of lazard frères in paris calling for price level stability the ilo followed suit in june 1929 terming falling prices a cause of unemployment and finally the economic consultative committee of the league endorsed the genoa principles in the summer of 1928 just as professors cassel and commons wanted no credit restraint at all in 1928 and 1929 so representative louis t mcfadden powerful chairman of the house banking and currency committee exerted a similar though more powerful brand of pressure on the federal reserve authorities on february 7 1929 the day after the federal reserve board s letter to the federal reserve banks warning about stock market speculation representative mcfadden himself warned the house against an adverse business reaction from this move he pointed out that there had been no rise in the commodity price level so how could there be any danger of inflation the fed he warned skittishly should not concern itself with the stock market or security loans lest it produce a general slump tighter money would make capital financing difficult and coupled with the resulting loss of confidence would precipitate a depression in fact mcfadden declared that the fed should be prepared to ease money rates as soon as any fall in prices or employment might appear other influential voices raised against any credit restriction were those of w t foster and waddill catchings leading stabilizationists and well known for their underconsumptionist theories catchings was a prominent investment banker of goldman sachs and co and iron and steel magnate and both men were close to the hoover administration as we shall see their plan for curing unemployment was adopted at one time by hoover in april 1929 foster and catchings warned that any credit restriction would lower the price level and hurt business the bull market they assured the public along with fisher commons and the rest was grounded on a sure foundation of american confidence and growth and the bull speculators of course echoed the cry that everyone should invest in america anyone who criticized the boom was considered to be unpatriotic and selling america short cassel was typical of european opinion in insisting on even greater inflationary moves by the federal reserve system sir ralph hawtrey visiting at harvard during 1928 1929 spread the gospel of price level stabilization to his american audience influential british labourite philip snowden urged in 1927 that the united states join in a world plan for price stabilization to prevent a prolonged price decline the london statist and the nation london both bemoaned the federal reserve deflation perhaps most extreme was a wildly inflationist article by the respected economist professor allyn a young an american then teaching at the university of london young in january 1929 warned about the secular downward price trend and urged all central banks not to hoard gold to abandon their high gold reserve ratio fetish and to inflate to a fare thee well central banks of the world he declared appear to be afraid of prosperity so long as they are they will exert a retarding influence upon the growth of production in an age of folly professor young s article was perhaps the crowning pièce de résistance much more censurable than the superficially more glaring errors of such economists as irving fisher and charles a dice on the alleged new era prosperity of the stock market merely to extrapolate present stock market conditions is after all not nearly as reprehensible as considering deflation the main threat in the midst of a rampantly inflationary era but such was the logical conclusion of the stabilizationist position we may conclude that the federal reserve authorities in promulgating their inflationary policies were motivated not only by the desire to help british inflation and to subsidize farmers but were also guided or rather misguided by the fashionable economic theory of a stable price level as the goal of monetary manipulation this article is excerpted from america s great depression part 2 chapter 6 theory and inflation economists and the lure of a stable price level 1963 2008

reading time 5 minutes brazil s central bank raised eyebrows in december when it lowered its target interest rate to 7 percent that s high by global standards and about average for other major emerging markets but it was a milestone for latin america s biggest economy 7 percent is the lowest key interest rate in brazil s history that brazil s all time lowest interest rate is so high shows just how off kilter the country s credit markets have become the costs for brazilian consumers and small businesses to take out loans are among the highest in the world at 51 percent per year brazil s lending rate is almost 20 percent more than in its crisis prone neighbor argentina brazilians pay off credit cards at around 290 annual percentage rate or apr personal loans average 130 apr source for all figures world bank and central bank news in economics if the price of a service is unusually high it s because of inadequate supply in brazil commercial banks simply do not dole out enough credit to consumers or businesses there are four major reasons why tackling them is key to lowering costs and breaking the logjam regulation brazil s central bank bcb takes an extraordinarily heavy handed approach to regulating the banking industry for a simple reason to avoid financial crises the last financial crisis in brazil happened in the mid 1990s when the bcb was forced to rescue the financial system lending approximately 20 billion to 43 banks since then financial system stability has been the key goal of the bank regardless of the cost to credit access and economic growth today given the bcb s hyper prudent approach a financial crisis should be the least of brazilians worries the main tool to keep financial markets in check is the required reserves ratio the amount that commercial banks are required to put aside in case their clients decide to retrieve their money at a moment s notice in the euro zone this ratio is around 2 percent although banks usually hold voluntary reserves as well in brazil the bcb sets the rate at 45 percent the result is that much less money is available for lending even time deposits which cannot be withdrawn before a set maturity date include reserve requirements of more than 33 percent other regulatory indicators paint a similar picture for example the liquidity coverage ratio a measure of how much short term assets banks have available in the event of a crisis in brazil is 224 percent whereas the global average is 100 percent all of this increases costs for consumers granted too little regulation is also a bad thing see the u s financial crisis but brazil needs to find a better balance for consumers and small businesses in order to grow subsidies brazil s central bank also has a long history of directing credit to favored sectors banks are obliged to funnel 34 percent of short term deposits to the agricultural sector and 2 percent to microcredit for savings deposits 65 percent has to go to mortgage lending the main development bank bndes lends more than the world bank this creates distortions in which the favored sectors benefit since banks are forced to lend to them instead of creating credit for all legal framework while in the u s legislation makes it difficult for consumers to sue banks in brazil the rules and judicial practices heavily favor individuals over companies on the one hand this means that consumers rarely face repossession of goods and services and are protected from personal bankruptcies on the other hand most people lack access to credit creditor rights are also quite weak in brazil even in comparison to other emerging markets officials have taken some steps to address this issue the senate recently approved an opt out credit bureau that may reduce the information asymmetry between banks and clients but this is just one step on the road to a legal framework that facilitates lending more is required to make the legal risks of lending worth taking for banks incentives and innovation unfortunately there is little incentive for brazilian banks or entrepreneurs to test new financial products in the market the bcb keeps the brazilian financial system mostly insulated from the rest of the world which limits innovation and encourages collusive behavior whenever a new company breaks in and tries to address one of the multitude of failures in the credit market it is usually scooped by one of the large banks one example being the recent purchase of xp investimentos by itaú the size of brazil s five largest banks almost doubled in the 21st century fewer competitors leads to less competition and less need to pursue new ideas a look at another emerging market economy can be instructive in this regard in china consumers need only their smartphones in order to take out a loan they can borrow and trade on apps while fintechs innovative financial technology companies with new solutions for financial markets are flourishing in brazil the bcb wants to allow such companies but on its own terms otávio damaso the director of the bcb recently told reuters that new regulations would pave the way for the development of credit fintechs within a secure judicial framework in the end though private commercial banks don t supply much credit because it is not particularly lucrative for them to do so their protection from competition allows banks to keep revenue coming in without lending too much news about bank profits reaching new highs is common but most of those profits come from fees insurance and other financial services not from lending ideas for reform in spite of all the obstacles credit as a percentage of gdp has grown in brazil throughout the 21st century it is now about average for its level of development even though most of the growth came from state owned banks credit remains expensive or in the hands of a privileged few brazil is in desperate need of unlocking its credit market for small and medium sized companies for credit to go up and interest rates to go down in a healthy manner the country should enact market reforms to find an equilibrium between prudence and efficiency stability should continue to be the main driver but the bcb should move from its extreme preoccupation with stability to a larger mix of innovation and efficiency it should greatly reduce directed credit lower the required ratio incentivize competition allow a flexible regulatory framework for fintechs and move forward with the positive credit bureau and other similar measures these would go a long way in lowering personal loan rates to double digits and allowing small companies to take on debt to grow and generate jobs such measures would also help lower the double digit unemployment rate and jumpstart sustainable economic growth

republicans and conservatives have repeatedly complained that obamacare amounts to the government takeover of the u s health care system the only problem is it isn t true it s fair to say that obamacare was a meaningful expansion of the role of the federal government in health care but the real government takeover of u s health care took place in 1965 when lbj signed into law the amendments to the social security act enacted by bipartisan majorities in congress that created medicare and medicaid advertisement advertisement today more than 115 million americans one third of the population are enrolled in socialized single payer government run health insurance in america de facto single payer programs include medicare 38 million enrollees in its single payer form medicaid 62 million enrollees the children s health insurance program 7 million the veterans health administration 9 million and other programs of that 115 million obamacare has contributed only 12 million through its expansion of medicaid about 8 million people receive subsidies to participate in obamacare s private insurance exchanges which for all their flaws are not single payer systems all this to say that socialized medicine and single payer health insurance are hardly as foreign to america as conservatives tend to believe i m not going to cut medicare donald trump promised when campaigning for president it s not an accident that bernie sanders and his compatriots call their plan medicare for all they do so because medicare is the most popular single payer health care program in the country without reform single payer will only become more popular conservatives and republicans are eager to talk about the push for single payer because it represents favorable political ground obviously if you like your plan screw you is a sub optimal strategy for democrats in 2020 advertisement advertisement it would be however a colossal mistake for conservatives to kick up their heels and enjoy this moment if they embrace the status quo and do nothing to address the real problems with the high and rising cost of american health care the popularity of socialized health insurance will only grow stronger nowhere is this more apparent than among the 159 million americans who get their health insurance through their employers while the employer based system deploys private insurers it is far removed from an actual market for health insurance because few workers have the opportunity to choose their own coverage with their own money employers enjoy controlling their workers health benefits because doing so makes it harder for employees to take their coverage with them if they leave because of this desire by employers to use health benefits as a retention tool and because workers lack a clear picture of how much is coming out of their paycheck to pay for health coverage the cost of employer sponsored insurance is rising faster than the cost of other u s health insurance programs hospitals for example take advantage of their regional monopoly power to charge those with employer based coverage 2 4 times more than what they charge those on medicare for the same services deductibles for employer based coverage have tripled in the last ten years increasing the frustration that workers have with private insurers advertisement advertisement that s why polls are showing increasing support for government run health insurance among republicans an april poll for the associated press asked 1 108 americans whether they would favor the creation of a new government health insurance plan that they could buy instead of private coverage republicans favored the idea 44 32 voters overall supported the proposal 53 17 with democrats in support by a margin of 65 8 if republicans stick their heads in the sand over time socialized health insurance will become more popular not less pragmatic democrats have developed alternatives to berniecare that deploy public options such as the one described in the ap poll that offer workers a lower cost alternative to private employer based coverage public option government run insurance has lower premiums than employer based coverage because it pays medicare or medicaid reimbursement rates to hospitals instead of the wildly inflated employer based rates in 2010 democrats tried to enact a public option through regular order requiring 60 votes in the senate they won only 58 next time around they will try enacting a public option through reconciliation which will require only a simple 50 vote majority the congressional budget office will score public option based plans unlike berniecare as reducing the deficit because their lower premiums will lead to lower levels of tax subsidies for employer based coverage and obamacare based private insurance conservative misconceptions about health reform the good news is that there are ways to roll back the socialist tide but first conservatives have to overcome three misconceptions they have about the state of health care policy in america advertisement advertisement the first is that obamacare is the most important component of government run health care as we discussed above it s at best a distant third far behind medicare and medicaid the second is that there is no legitimate role for the federal government in helping americans afford health insurance in fact it s the federal government that created the problem of runaway health care inflation by preserving world war ii era wage controls in the form of excluding employer sponsored coverage from taxation and later by building medicare on top of the employer system the federal government made this mess and the federal government is the only institution with the power to fix it the third misconception is the most important that the only way to achieve universal health insurance coverage is by further expanding the role of government in health care americans enjoy universal smartphones universal cable tv and today nearly universal employment for those who seek it conservatives understand that each of these achievements took place not because of an expansion of government but because of a reduction of it free enterprise innovation is the reason that so many things are universal in our economy and scarce in socialist ones advertisement advertisement so why is it that so many of us have accepted the left wing narrative that the only path to universal health insurance is through more government when we would never accept that narrative about any other sector of the economy in the art of war sun tzu famously observed that every battle is won or lost before it is ever fought conservatives have preemptively lost the war on health care because they are fighting on the terrain of the left that the only way to universally affordable coverage is through government control since the public is understandably concerned with the affordability of health insurance and health care conservatives who equate affordability with big government are destined to lose on policy politics or both affordable health care for every generation there is a different way forward for conservatives one that embraces the goal of ensuring that health insurance is affordable for every american and not just those living today but also those from the generations to come the ones who will inherit our health care entitlement fueled 21 trillion federal debt advertisement advertisement the first thing to understand about american health care is that almost every american with health insurance gets some sort of federal subsidy the poorest of the poor get subsidized coverage through medicaid the disabled get subsidized coverage through medicaid and medicare everyone with employer based coverage gets a subsidy through the tax code a benefit that is far more generous to wealthy bankers and law firm partners than it is to cashiers or truck drivers warren buffett who is worth 84 billion gets taxpayer subsidized health insurance because he is over 65 and eligible for medicare basically the federal government subsidizes coverage for everyone except for a category of the working poor those who don t get insurance through their employer but earn too much to benefit from obamacare s subsidies in a sense this is the opposite of the system we ought to have one in which those who work hard and play by the rules but still struggle to afford coverage are the ones we strive most to help imagine an america in which the only people whose health insurance we subsidized were those who could otherwise not afford it the poor the sick the vulnerable and working americans in lower tax brackets not only would such a system be fairer but it would be far less expensive even if we did nothing else to improve our health care system a rebalancing of insurance subsidies could reduce the federal deficit by hundreds of billions of dollars a year of course such a transition could not be achieved overnight for political and other reasons but we can move substantially in that direction by introducing gradual reforms whose value compounds over time advertisement advertisement contrary to conventional wisdom many luminaries of the conservative movement have embraced universal coverage ronald reagan in the 1964 republican national convention speech that launched him to stardom said that no one in this country should be denied medical care for lack of funds in another contemporaneous speech he said that any person in the united states who requires medical attention and cannot provide for himself should have it provided for him milton friedman in a 2001 essay for the public interest endorsed providing every family in the united states with catastrophic insurance i e a major medical policy with a high deductible friedrich hayek in the road to serfdom wrote nor is there any reason why the state should not assist the individuals in providing for those common hazards of life against which because of their uncertainty few individuals can make adequate provision in the case of sickness and accident where in short we deal with genuinely insurable risks there is no incompatibility in principle between the state providing greater security in this way and the preservation of individual freedom while reagan supported universal coverage he opposed medicare because it was compulsory health insurance through a government bureau for people who don t need it or who have even a few million dollars tucked away on the reagan model we can gradually introduce more means testing into medicare so that middle class taxpayers are not forced to subsidize coverage for the wealthiest americans people who should have saved enough on their own to buy insurance in their golden years reducing how much we subsidize health insurance especially for the wealthy will not only balance the budget it will also slow the growth of health care inflation because 75 years of massive government subsidies are the biggest driver of higher health care prices much as federal subsidies for mortgage interest have artificially driven up the price of housing advertisement advertisement choice and competition will lower health care prices and that gets us to the fundamental problem with american health care it is far too expensive despite obamacare and in many cases because of it 25 million legal u s residents remain uninsured tens of millions more have private coverage but struggle to afford it and find that rising health insurance premiums are reducing their disposable income here again just as choice and competition make products and services less expensive in the rest of the economy they can do so in health care we must substantially expand americans freedom to choose their own health insurance both in public and private programs the freedom to choose is not just a fundamental economic principle it is also the strongest moral argument against single payer health care which would abolish private health care choices and replace them with a bureaucratically determined one size fits all government run insurance agency advertisement advertisement but this doesn t mean that america s private health insurance system lives up to that principle today few workers with employer sponsored insurance are able to choose their own plans instead those plans are foisted upon them by corporate bureaucrats whose interests do not always align with those of their workers the trump administration is finalizing a rule enabling forward thinking companies to change this by allowing them to fund tax advantaged health reimbursement accounts that workers can use to buy the coverage they want on the open market we can build on that rule by requiring that newly incorporated businesses use that approach to sponsor coverage in that way we preserve traditional arrangements for existing employers but modernize employer sponsored coverage for the workers of the future similarly we should gradually convert the medicaid program from its current single payer form into one in which enrollees receive tax credits to buy private insurance and we should strengthen medicare advantage the market based form of medicare whose consumer driven structure has incentivized insurers to offer broader benefits lower out of pocket costs and better health outcomes than traditional medicare does on average medicare advantage hmos deliver the traditional medicare benefit for 93 cents on the dollar leaving plans room to offer seniors these additional benefits at a still competitive price it s not uncommon at left leaning health policy conferences to hear experts softly complain that single payer medicare is no longer competitive with medicare advantage naturally senator sanders and his friends are offended by this when obamacare was enacted the medicare actuary predicted that ma enrollment would get cut in half because obamacare partly paid for its subsidies to the uninsured by cutting payments to medicare advantage plans instead enrollment in medicare advantage has more than doubled within ten years under current law it s possible that there will be more people enrolled in medicare advantage than in single payer medicare even if we do nothing but we can do more today americans who turn 65 and don t choose their own medicare plan are defaulted into medicare s single payer program instead their default enrollment should be into a private medicare advantage plan with the ability to opt out into the single payer program if they want it other subtle tweaks such as competitive bidding can accelerate price competition among private plans in medicare lowering costs for seniors and taxpayers alike finally freedom of choice doesn t just apply to insurance it also applies to health care goods and services as we discussed above throughout the u s health care system government has incentivized the rise of monopolies that exploit their market power to charge egregious prices to patients and taxpayers this is especially true in two of the largest components of u s health care spending hospitals and pharmaceuticals president trump has exhibited genuine leadership in tackling monopoly power among drug companies he and congressional republicans need to do the same for hospitals more competition will lead to lower health care prices which in turn will make both private health insurance and public insurance programs more affordable the new conservative health care leaders so to sum up we can make health care affordable for every generation both those living today and those yet to come if we do three things first we have to end welfare for the rich and refocus health care subsidies on those who truly need the help second we have to expand the freedom to choose customized private health insurance plans both in the employer sponsored system and in public programs like medicare and medicaid third we have restore competition to the provision of health care so that hospital monopolies drug monopolies and the like have an incentive to reduce prices and improve quality more competition lower costs and fewer subsidies this is the only market based approach to health reform that can gain broad public support and get enacted by congress the good news is that a number of young enterprising congressional republicans have taken up that mantle representative jim banks of indiana has introduced the hospital competition act of 2019 which would restore competition to highly consolidated hospital markets representative mark meadows n c chairman of the house freedom caucus has introduced an antitrust exemption for insurers leveling the playing field between monopoly drug manufacturers and fragmented health insurers most impressively representative bruce westerman ark a third term congressman has produced the fair care act of 2019 which is designed to increase the number of americans with health insurance while lowering federal spending all three of these bills draw from work we ve done at my think tank the foundation for research on equal opportunity more bills are coming they won t be reheated leftovers of the old repeal and replace effort because our health care problems are far bigger than obamacare in health care we will win the fight against socialist health care if we believe in our own principles if we believe that free enterprise can do for health insurance what it has done for smartphones automobiles and wheat as friedrich hayek observed so many years ago there is no conflict between universal coverage and free enterprise there s only a conflict between those who don t know what free enterprise can achieve and those who do more from national review

staff writer telegram gazette at last count china held slightly more than 1 trillion in u s treasury securities one fear has been that should china and the united states engage in an economic war as they clearly are now those dollars could become a weapon against us the chinese would sell dollars in foreign exchange markets raising u s interest rates and perhaps triggering a serious american recession that might spread elsewhere is this possible well yes but it s a long shot let s see how a dollar dump might work china would sell a huge portion of its treasury stake this in turn would reduce the price of treasuries which like stocks are traded on the open market and raise their interest rates consider a simplified example to see how this works assume a 1 000 bond with a 5 interest rate it guarantees a payment of 50 a year but if the bond s price has fallen to 800 that same promised 50 produces an interest rate of 6 25 higher interest rates would then percolate through the u s economy affecting consumer and business spending if the reaction were powerful a recession might result spending would weaken unemployment would rise confidence would fall china s dumping of treasuries would escalate the economic conflict between the two countries it would signal a second fundamental break with the post world war ii global economic system the first being trump s aggressive use of tariffs but two practical caveats arise first the chinese might be victims of their own policies a global recession would reduce exports compounding the effect of the 25 u s tariffs on 200 billion of chinese exports the dollar s exchange rate might fall while china s renminbi might rise the shift in exchange rates would weaken china s competitive position china s sale of some u s treasuries would also reduce the value of the treasuries that aren t sold why would the chinese inflict these costs on themselves good question selling treasuries is perhaps the least potent weapon in its arsenal of potential retaliatory strikes against u s trade sanctions says economist eswar prasad of cornell university he doubts that china will do it the second caveat is the opposite of the first it is that china might sell lots of treasuries and very little would happen interest rates would hardly budge already china s current account surplus a broad measure of trade has been shrinking and this implies that china is accumulating fewer dollars than before but that hasn t sent interest rates soaring they remain historically low the rate on 10 year treasuries is less than 2 5 one explanation is that the world seems to have a huge appetite for u s treasury securities which are called safe assets by financial experts this means that despite all of america s economic and political problems investors don t believe the united states would default on its government debt treasuries are a good place to leave idle funds the various possible consequences have led many observers to doubt that china would deliberately try to undermine the u s treasury market this is how capital economics a forecasting firm judged the prospects wouldn t be sensible if such a fire sale drove up their yields china would lose money on its remaining holdings it might also lead to greater instability in emerging financial markets this includes china which the authorities there want to avoid david smick editor of the international economy magazine echoes this appraisal dumping treasuries poses too many risks including a global recession it s a declaration of war not just against the united states but the world he says i don t think the chinese are going to do that whatever happens the china story is undergoing significant revision not so long ago its economy was growing at a rate of 10 a year now that s slipped to about 6 and many economists expect it to decline further derek scissors of the american enterprise institute thinks it could drop to 4 5 this year and as low as 1 to 2 within a decade there are many obstacles to faster growth debt is one although it spurred growth in the past borrowing in china has now reached levels that look increasingly unsustainable from 2005 to 2018 loans to chinese nonfinancial corporations went from 112 of gdp to 152 of gdp reports the institute of international finance an industry research and advocacy group the resolution of this struggle is unclear but if nothing else the collision between the trump administration and beijing heralds a new era in u s china relations both countries are caught in contradiction being in conflict and dependent on each other at the same time robert j samuelson is a columnist for the washington post writers group

menafn daily forex the results of the european elections the brexit trajectory after may s resignation and the continuation of us chinese trade tensions are all likely to support stronger gains for gold and stabilize prices at around 1 287 an ounce at the time of writing the analysis with gains for the third day in a row the abandonment of the us dollar slightly gave the price of an ounce of gold the opportunity to move higher and after losses pushed the price of the metal to move towards the support level of 1269 an ounce the recent downward movement in the price of the ounce of gold was confirmed after the announcement of the us federal reserve meeting s minutes which confirmed the desire of some bank members to raise the us interest rate which supported the gains of the us dollar and will not strengthen the upward correction without testing the psychological peak at 1300 and getting established on top of that the us dollar was second only to the japanese yen in gaining as a safe haven as the us china trade war recently intensified in general the absence of a final and formal agreement that ends the trade dispute between the united states and china will continue to be a factor contributing to stronger gold price gains and establishing above the psychological peak of 1 300 will increase purchases and test stronger bullish levels trump s recent comments which bear the prospect of reconciling with china after raising tariffs on their products have eased investors concerns and have contributed to a halt in gold price gains the federal reserve board kept the interest rate unchanged as expected and indicated it was unlikely to raise or lower interest rates in the coming months amid signs of renewed economic health while at the same time inflation was still unusually low the bank s policy statement highlighted its continued failure to raise the annual inflation rate to at least 2 the statement may have raised expectations that a change in the next fed interest rate is a rate cut to stimulate inflation or growth technically if gold prices stabilized today below 1300 it will increase the bearish momentum and the nearest support levels will be 1273 1265 and 1258 respectively which support the strength of the bearish trend while at the same time levels can be bought for close targets on the upside the nearest levels of gold resistance are currently 1286 1300 and 1312 respectively we still prefer to buy gold from every bearish bounce in terms of economic data the yellow metal will all focus on the us dollar level gold will also be affected by investors risk appetite gold is one of the most important safe havens
yan zhang usa today the united states has the upper hand in its escalating tariff battle with china china s exports to america are almost four times the u s shipments to china but china has other weapons against its nemesis besides further tariffs nearly half of u s companies doing business in china said they ve experienced non tariff retaliation from china since the u s first imposed duties last july according to a survey this month by the american chamber of commerce in china the group represents more than 900 american companies operating in china increased regulatory enforcement greater inspection of u s shipments preferential treatment with respect to procurement etc can cause significant losses to u s businesses says thomas prusa an economics professor at rutgers university most observers underestimate the leverage china has with these other tools of trade policy car deal fiat chrysler and renault talk of linking businesses is heating up report says the billionaire cheapskate i don t buy wallets or go to a barber here s my billionaire s guide to saving money the question of how else china can strike back at the u s is increasingly debated as the u s begins preparing tariffs on the remaining 300 billion or so in chinese imports a move that would add to existing u s duties on 250 billion in imports from china the u s by contrast exports just 120 billion in goods to china here are five possible steps china could take to hurt the u s economy beyond more tariffs stop buying american products china could renege on its promises to buy an additional 10 million tons of u s agricultural products that would prolong the pain for american farmers beset by lower sales to china and falling prices trump s trade war is turning the world s most productive farming sector into a giant welfare state as u s farmers will apparently receive for a second consecutive year massive government subsidies in order to stay in business prusa says china is also threatening to stop funding a 43 billion natural gas project in alaska according to the south china morning post a daily newspaper based in hong kong slow down customs clearances the customs process has become increasingly more stringent and tougher for many foreign companies over time says john larkin president of larkin trade international a consulting firm specializing in trade compliance in china nearly 20 of american companies have experienced slower customs checks in china the latest survey of american chamber of commerce in china shows ford s imported vehicles were held up at chinese ports last year in an apparent trade war related tactic china also delayed imports of u s fruits and nuts in may 2018 american businesses and farmers already dealing with higher tariffs will face more trouble if the goodsget stuck at china s ports again sell its u s treasury holdings china is the biggest holder of u s government debt in march china sold the largest amount of treasurys in almost 2 1 2 years according to the treasury department china s total stake was 1 12 trillion in march a growing number of analysts are raising the prospect that china may invoke its nuclear option selling its holdings or reducing its current purchases which could push up u s long term interest rates but this could hurt china too as higher rates will push down the price dampening the value of the country s treasury portfolio let the renminbi slide vs dollar another card china could play is letting its currency slide in value against the dollar making its goods cheaper abroad and offsetting american tariffs when the u s tariffs were 10 it was more likely for the exchange rate to absorb the impact without causing great collateral damage prusa says however it is implausible for the exchange rate to fully offset the impact of 25 tariffs a falling renminbi would also make u s products more expensive in china compounding the effect of chinese tariffs on u s exports slowing license other approvals for u s firms china also could set up tougher inspections of u s companies in china in areas like taxes firefighting equipment and environmental certificates slow down business license approvals and encourage chinese consumers to boycott american products the chinese domestic market will be much bigger than the u s market soon says mauro guillen a professor of international management at the wharton school target and tariffs the retailer has plans to limit higher prices higher prices lost jobs how the trade war with china could hit you china s state media defiant message about trade war with u s on social media site china of course could also slap more tariffs on u s goods but the deeper point is that tariffs are just one policy china can use prusa says china has other ways to respond

payments for the people introductory remarks by benoît cœuré member of the executive board of the ecb and chair of the cpmi at the high level meeting on financial inclusion basel 27 may 2019 introduction thank you agustín for the kind words of welcome and for hosting this fifth high level meeting on financial inclusion thanks also for your continuing support of the committee on payments and market infrastructures cpmi i am honoured to be co hosting this meeting with queen máxima of the netherlands her majesty is here today in her capacity as the united nations secretary general s special advocate for inclusive finance for development unsgsa you will also know queen máxima as an honorary patron of the g20 s global partnership for financial inclusion by lending her voice to raise global awareness of the importance of financial inclusion in the fight against poverty and gender inequality her majesty is an extremely effective advocate of universal access to affordable effective and safe financial services we are genuinely grateful for your support today we are bringing together the united nations the global standard setting bodies and a range of other international organisations central banks and non governmental organisations to discuss financial inclusion before we turn to the agenda allow me to reflect briefly on financial inclusion and payments drawing on the work of the cpmi payments and financial inclusion milton friedman once said that inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon in a similar vein i would argue that financial inclusion is always and everywhere a payments phenomenon at least in the early stages payments are the lifeblood of any economy think about the basic needs that we pay for on a daily basis food transportation healthcare and clothing to name but a few paul volcker once famously asked how many financial innovations have been as important to the individual as the automatic teller machine so financial inclusion starts with payments it is the gateway to other financial services such as savings accounts credit or insurance that allow individuals to invest and protect their income against risks the distinguished role of payments has guided the work of the world bank and the cpmi three years ago we published a report on payment aspects of financial inclusion affectionately known as pafi to help countries expand access to payment services the pafi principles outline concrete actions that countries can take including i providing basic accounts at little or no cost ii stepping up efforts to increase financial literacy and iii leveraging large volume payment programmes such as government payments by adopting electronic payment services in the meantime the pafi framework has been adopted as the analytical underpinning for designing and implementing country level actions under the world bank s universal financial access 2020 agenda by the end of last year the pafi framework had been used as a tool to critically analyse the degree of access to payment services and transaction accounts and their usage in about a dozen countries in addition many countries have used the framework to undertake a self assessment of the financial infrastructure in their country as we mark the pafi report s third anniversary it seems like a good time to review the progress made in expanding access to payment services since 2011 more than one billion adults have gained access to basic transaction accounts that is accounts with a financial institution or a mobile money service provider much of this gain can be attributed to the greater use of new technologies including smartphones and the internet which enable services to be provided using digital channels instead of through bricks and mortar operations such electronic channels support the efficient and low cost delivery of services even in remote areas and open up markets to new providers yet as of 2017 around 30 of the adult population worldwide still lacked access to payment services while financial exclusion is also an issue in some advanced economies it affects a majority of adults in africa and south america only seven african countries have achieved a 60 penetration rate in many african countries less than half the population has access to basic payment services unfortunately but not surprisingly the lack of access to an account disproportionately affects low income households and women financial exclusion of this type threatens the cohesion of societies it is often part of a much wider social exclusion faced by individuals who lack access to education insurance or healthcare and those who do own an account often face large transaction costs particlarly in cross border payments take remittances as an example the world bank estimates that almost usd 530 billion in remittances were sent last year more than three times the amount of official development assistance sent to the receiving countries evidence shows that foreign workers from low and middle income countries sending funds home face an average cost of about usd 14 for a usd 200 payment in other words cross border payments still tend to be notably slower more expensive and more opaque than domestic payments no wonder then that many turn to what i call shadow payments such as informal networks or unregulated cryptocurrency platforms that lack proper cyber security basic risk management legal certainty or consumer protection new swift data that the cpmi is publishing today provides further evidence that access to safe and cost effective cross border payments is not improving it shows that the correspondent banking network has shrunk by 20 over the past seven years and has become more concentrated as a result taking pafi forward broader access to payment systems is therefore crucial the pafi report notes a number of potential barriers to providing transaction accounts from high fees low income levels and poor financial literacy to economic and labour informality many of these issues remain today and are also a problem for emerging fintech solutions many fintech solutions for example require a smart phone such requirements add to the cost of the solution and automatically exclude certain populations those with low income levels or limited technical aptitude these remaining obstacles clearly illustrate that we need to continue our efforts that s why in late 2018 the cpmi and the world bank embarked on the next stage of our journey on the road to ensuring universal access to transaction accounts the pafi task force will be focusing on the following three topics first we are reviewing the lessons learned from applying the pafi framework we will look at how pafi is being implemented the challenges involved and recent developments in payments that need more detailed guidance such as emerging fintech solutions and we will build on previous cpmi work on fast payments correspondent banking cross border payments and digital currencies and see how this could broaden access to existing and new payment services second we will develop a toolkit to facilitate the application of the pafi guiding principles and key actions for consideration this work stream will aim to provide more detailed guidance on how to approach specific issues in practice and possibly also on the interpretation of some of the guiding principles and the accompanying key actions for consideration we hope that a practical toolkit to promote financial inclusion will inspire public and private sector organisations in interested countries to do more and last but not least we are also developing a framework for measuring the effectiveness of financial inclusion efforts from a payments perspective this will allow us to measure progress more accurately the framework will provide guidance on a set of indicators together with the underlying methodology that can be developed by each country to measure the effectiveness over time of its financial inclusion efforts we believe that helping countries to assess the progress they are making will allow them to better target their financial inclusion policies as you can see this is quite an ambitious work programme we have also set ourselves an ambitious timeline we aim to finish the pafi work in the first half of next year and in addition to the work being done by the pafi task force the cpmi is also supporting the financial inclusion global initiative which is a three year programme led by the world bank group the international telecommunications union the cpmi and the bill melinda gates foundation its objective is to provide targeted technical assistance to china egypt and mexico to increase acceptance of electronic payments extend the use of digital identification for financial services and enhance payment system security infrastructure and technology conclusion financial inclusion starts with payments and with this i would like to conclude it has therefore been and remains a key objective for the cpmi thanks also to the support of queen máxima significant progress has been made in recent years with a number of innovative solutions helping to increase access to payment services for underserved populations around the world however a significant number of people across the globe still lack the means to make fast secure and trustworthy payments lack of access to basic payment services risks feeding wider social exclusion and supporting the rise of potentially unsafe shadow payments that do not offer legal certainty or sound credit and liquidity risk management to protect consumers and to spread the benefits of financial inclusion more widely we need to continue our work in close cooperation with all stakeholders so that everyone and not just a portion of the population enjoys access to basic payment services ultimately this work will not only benefit those who become financially included it will also foster social cohesion and support economic prosperity more broadly thank you
for all the talk of modern monetary theory representing a brave new frontier it is easy to forget that the united states has gone down this road before when the us federal reserve financed the war effort in the 1940s then as now the question is not about government debt but about the debt s purpose and justification alexandria virginia in a recent project syndicate commentary james k galbraith of the university of texas at austin defends modern monetary theory and corrects some misunderstandings about the relationships among mmt federal deficits and central bank independence but galbraith does not explore what is perhaps the most important issue of all the political conditions needed to implement mmt effectively mmt owes its newfound relevance to the fact that deflation rather than inflation is becoming central banks main concern for a high debt high deficit economy like the united states deflation is an especially serious threat because it delays consumption and increases debtor anxiety consumers forego major purchases on the assumption that future prices will be lower homeowners with mortgages cut back their spending when they see home prices falling and the equity in their homes declining these cutbacks worry the federal reserve because they add to deflationary pressures and could trigger deeper spending cuts stock market declines and widespread deleveraging the fed s inability so far to reach its 2 target for annual inflation suggests that it lacks the means to overcome persistent disinflationary forces in the economy these forces include increased us market concentration which diminishes aggregate demand by weakening employee bargaining power and increasing income inequality population aging inadequate investment in infrastructure and climate change abatement and technology driven labor displacement making matters worse us political gridlock assures continued commitment to economically exhausted strategies such as tax cuts for the rich at the expense of investment in education and other sources of long term growth these conditions cry out for significant changes in us government spending and tax policies mmt is seen as a way to accomplish the needed changes it holds that a government can spend as much as it wants if it borrows in its own currency and its central bank can buy as much of the government s debt as necessary as long as doing so doesn t generate unacceptably high inflation both tax cut advocates and supporters of public investment find little not to like mmt has been roundly criticized by economists across the political spectrum from kenneth rogoff and lawrence h summers of harvard university to paul krugman of the city university of new york all contend that it is a political argument masquerading as economic theory but galbraith and ray dalio of bridgewater associates see mmt differently dalio argues that mmt is real and more to the point it is an inevitable policy step in historically recurring debt cycle downturns in his book principles for navigating big debt crises dalio documents the steps that central banks have historically taken when faced with a booming economy that suddenly crumples under the weight of debt the first step monetary policy 1 or mp1 is to cut overnight official rates to stimulate credit and investment expansion the second mp2 is to buy government debt quantitative easing to support asset prices and prevent uncontrollable waves of deleveraging if mp1 and mp2 are insufficient to halt a downturn central banks take step three mmt which dalio calls mp3 and proceed to finance the spending priorities that political leaders deem most essential the priorities can range from financing major national projects to helicopter money transfers directly to consumers

national emergency political unity and prompt action are essential unity requires a strong consensus on what should be financed speed requires the existence of a trusted institution to direct the spending in the early 1940s when the us entered world war ii and winning the war became the government s top priority the fed entered full mp3 mode it not only set short and long term rates for treasury bonds but also bought as much government debt as necessary to finance the war effort mp3 was possible because the war united the country politically and gave the roosevelt administration near authoritarian rule over the economy the core weakness of mp3 mmt advocacy is the absence of an explanation of how to achieve political unity on what to finance and how this absence is inexcusable total us debt as a share of gdp is approaching levels associated with past financial meltdowns and that doesn t even account for the hidden debts associated with infrastructure maintenance rising sea levels and unfunded pensions for the reasons dalio lays out a us debt crisis requiring some form of mp3 is all but inevitable the crucial question that any effort to achieve political unity must answer is what constitutes justifiable spending alexander hamilton america s first secretary of the treasury offered an answer in 1781 a national debt he wrote if it is not excessive will be to us a national blessing a government s debt is excessive if it cannot be repaid because its proceeds were spent in ways that did not increase national wealth enough to do so debt resulting from tax cuts that are spent on mega yachts would almost certainly be excessive debt incurred to improve educational outcomes maintain essential infrastructure or address climate change would probably not be accordingly it will be easier to achieve political unity if mp3 proceeds are spent on priorities such as education infrastructure or climate the political test for justifying mp3 financed government spending is clear will future generations judge that the borrowing was not excessive most americans born well after wwii would say that the debt incurred to win that war was justified as was the debt that financed the construction of the interstate highway system which literally paved the way for stronger growth as the 1930s and 1940s show mp3 is a natural component of government responses to major debt downturns and the political crises they trigger we know much more about what contributes to economic growth and sustainability than we did in the first half of the twentieth century to speed recovery from the next downturn we need to identify now the types of spending that will contribute most to sustainable recovery and that in hindsight will be viewed as most justified by future americans we need also to design the institutions that will direct the spending these are the keys to building the political unity that mmt requires to know what to finance and how future americans can show us the way we need only put ourselves in their shoes

for fdi prem watsa the three ds demographics de globalisation and debt are dragging global growth lower saidauthor global money manager in an interview withofthe opposition has to think very hard about this and find out who is the figure who can stand up to modi and offer any opposition it is clearly not rahul gandhi says sharmaedited excerpts someone once told me that the best time to understand indian elections is after the results have been counted in all my election trips this was the 28th election trip i do not think i have ever been this surprised by surprise i mean most of us sort of knew that modi was coming back as prime minister but the conventional wisdom was that he would fall somewhat short of the number in terms of he would get even when you and i had a conversation a week or so ago about this before the exit polls came out we thought that he would be like a few seats short and discussed who could be the allies that he would need so what is really surprising about this is that this has ended up being a wave election without 99 of the people who have been covering this on the ground detecting or feeling that wave that for me has been the staggering development as far as this election is concerned and that is something which i think is a big difference compare to let us say 2014 in 2014 when we were on the road it was pretty clear that this is a landslide for modi the seats were more than he got but you could make out it is a wave election even in up in 2017 when we went in a couple of days of travelling to uttar pradesh we knew that this was heading for a big sort of win for the bjp and the modi factor this time it has really surprised us in terms of what has happened and when i look back at it there is only one explanation that holds good here as to what has caused this swing of 6 to 7 in favour of the bjp and this is that the first time voters have voted for him overwhelmingly they typically tend to side with the bjp but what they have done this time is just matching it up with some of the data that i have seen and some of the anecdotal evidence in our conversations on the road that they have voted for him overwhelmingly that has appended many rule of indian politics including looking at things like caste incumbency the kind of stuff that i have been used to looking at for the last 25 years as far as indian democracy is concerned i still make the conclusion that it is thriving despite all the criticism we have had of evms this is a true mandate and we saw after the results that even the opposition handled it with maturity despite some of the fears which were raised basically indian democracy is doing really well what it means for indian democracy is that obviously any healthy democracy as even the bjp would admit need some sort of a strong opposition and the fault line is very clear when it comes to national elections especially the young voters that we spoke about are voting for elections in a much more presidential format now that is not something which used to happen so much in the past for example as i mentioned in my book that in 2004 the gap in popularity between vajpayee and sonia gandhi was even greater in favour of vajpayee than it was between modi and rahul gandhi at the early part of this year this is of course before balakot happened but it sort of told you that what was going on now what has happened is really remarkable which is that in this election despite the fact that rahul gandhi may not have trailed modi as much as between vajpayee and sonia gandhi in 2004 rahul gandhi has been obliterated by the modi machine and this tells you about the changing nature of indian politics that at a national level it is getting more presidential never before in indian electoral history have we had an instance where a state votes in a landslide in the assembly election and then goes on to vote in a landslide exactly the other way in the general election in a space of six months and that is what has happened in chhattisgarh and somewhat similar in rajasthan and madhya pradesh that just tells you about how the indian democracy is evolving at the national level it is turning a bit more presidential and modi is the ideal figure to capitalise on that in terms of the values that he embodies somebody who has seen maybe spoken to voters about what is that they speak about modi they say that he is really hard working he works 18 to 20 hours a day mehanti hai hardworking that is the kind of phases that you hear for him imandar hai he is honest which basically is saying that no matter what charges are levelled against him he is perceived as honest partly because he is unattached he is not associated with any family so it is hard to pin any sort of corruption charge to someone like that who is seen to be working for the country and not really doing anything in terms of helping the family as is typical of so many dynasties in this country and of course at a time when you feel that the country is under siege because of what has happened against pakistan you need a strong leader those are the attributes that are really working in modi s favour and anyway the young people are beginning to think of elections in more presidential terms now the opposition has to think very hard about this and find out who is the figure who can stand up to modi and offer any opposition it is clearly not rahul gandhi you cannot keep putting the same person out when he keeps getting rebuked by the people like on all our election travels i have never really heard anyone tell me that oh we will vote for rahul gandhi they may say we may vote for the congress i do not hear people saying we will vote for rahul gandhi but when it comes to modi obviously you heard many people who may even have negative things to say like we heard in uttar pradesh against the chief minister or against the bjp even and the local candidate but they will still tell you we will vote for modi that is the really big difference between modi and the others at present there is absolutely sort of no way that you could have done much different in this campaign if you were to have a new campaign now then the issue is that it has to be about an alternative personality who stands up to modi and rahul gandhi is not the man for that the question is whom unfortunately we just cannot see the right person as a document in my book when we first met priyanka gandhi back in 2004 she seemed to have a lot of the right traits she was connecting very well with the people much more eloquent fluent in hindi more comfortable on the stage when we saw her just now when we campaigning in rae bareli she does not seem to have that sort of novelty value and it just seemed as if india had moved on a bit where just charisma could do something but at this stage it is very hard to see who else apart from her on the other side but in the absence of that now we are back to really an era where this is going to be modi versus modi that the only way that you can think or sketch out a scenario where if modi by any chance loses five years from now it will be entirely due to him because i do not see who is going to be challenger who comes up in such a strong way in the next few years unless some magical thing happens and priyanka or someone else is able to build that aura to take him on i really feel we need much greater devolution to the states in terms of the power and this is where that it will be great to see some change as far as prime minister modi is concerned in his second term when we used to meet modi when he was chief minister of gujarat back in 2007 he would speak to us a lot about states having more power he bristled at having to go to the planning commission and having to tell them about how much funds the state needs and the delhi centric way of policy making he did not like a lot of that and he kept telling us that the only way india can do well is if more power is transferred to the states and that is what i would like to see him do in the second term which is make decision making less centralised give more power to the states and you end up getting better decision making for example you cannot have a national literacy movement when you have states in the south like kerala where literacy rates are already 100 similarly the population policy or something has to be very different because in the south there is a very different demographic profile compared to many states in the north more devolution to the states is what i would like mr modi to do in the second term and this is where he could take a leaf out of both indian and global history he should really think about the second term as his legacy term this is the term for which he is going to be remembered in the history books rather than think about how to win a third term because as we know the longer a leader stays in office historically the efficacy goes down and the energy comes down it is difficult to sustain this momentum particularly for someone like mr modi because already people talk about him as extremely hardworking it is very hard to sustain this momentum as we have been recommending that the campaign times need to be shortened or at least the various elections need to be clubbed together partly the reason he is saying that is because it is so much up to him to keep lifting the party and he has to be in campaign mode far too much even in the state assembly elections even though he is not such a big factor in those compared to the national elections so he should look at the second term as about legacy for which he will be remembered rather than thinking about a third term right so a lot of this has to do with setting the architecture right for the states to start competing a lot more with each other for funds and also for a lot of the policy making including things like labour laws and even land laws a lot of the decision making has to be done at the state level and the bjp governments in the state levels need to start showing this as a model in terms of reforms in terms of what they need to do the decision making devolving to the states is one big step that i would say can be done of course i would aspire for things like privatisation as i have long argued that we have no business in this country for the public sector to be so large as it is every country needs a public sector but the fact that two thirds of our banking sector is still controlled by public sector banks is at least twice as high as any other emerging markets on average that needs to be corrected government needs to reduce the stake but in a meaningful way in which the nature of some of these banks change because we know that what has happened in europe like a big reason for the differential in the economic recovery between europe and the us is because while the european banking sector is still impaired the banking sector in the us was sort of resuscitated much more quickly following the global financial crisis of 2008 you cannot have an economy that grows rapidly if the banking system is impaired and i do not think that just throwing more good money after bad is going to solve that problem so a very fundamental approach about the banking system and how to reduce the government s involvement of the public sector should be a very high priority i said this also at the beginning of the nda 1 and nothing much happened about it so i do not want to go on about recommendations but in terms of that would be the single biggest positive surprise to me if something fundamental was done in that space i can hope so but as i said that we can be proven wrong about this i just want to see the first steps when mr modi first came to power in 2014 i wrote an op ed at that point in time for the wall street journal saying that this could be india s reagan moment hoping for the fact that that he would give indians more economic freedom which the socialist leaders in the past such as gandhis had not done and that there might be greater focus on minimum government maximum governance kind of slogans there is no business of government being in businesses those were the slogans that were personally echoing with me but he changed because he probably sensed that in india to win elections you need more than that and therefore by the end of the term as we know including in the last budget that was presented it was really about a slew of more schemes rather than anything else now for the second term he has a bit of a different challenge which is that the global economy is weakening currently and that is spilling over into the indian economy as well there is only that much that you can keep attention on as you talk on things like nationalism and other topics if the economy is going to remain weak what helped him in the first term was the fact that inflation was very low inflation in this country has always been an incumbent killer going back to the narasimha rao election in 1996 when everyone thought that he is such a great reformer he would get re elected and but one big thing which undermined him back then was double digit inflation i think it also really hurt rajiv gandhi people forget that after bofors high inflation was the big factor behind rajiv gandhi s defeat in 1989 as well and it was something which really hurt the upa 2 as well so keeping a focus on low inflation is very important and to his credit he did that in the first term but in the second term one has to acknowledge at least privately if not publicly that we do have a jobs problem in the country we do have an economic slowdown which is underway when you have so many high frequency indicators sitting at multi year lows and i think that it is going to be very hard to keep the people s focus on other issues if the economy really begins to bite oh absolutely because in any new government the maximum political capital they have as you know is in the first few months and after that the political capital begins to vanish because even if you look at the first term of the nda whatever sort of major reforms had to be put in motion a lot of that was done in the first year most people think that ever since that barb was made about a suit boot ki sarkar the government sort of began to slow down on its reform promises and that was done about a year after the government was in power so the first budget which is presented typically in early july is going to be a very important signal it was not that important last time because last time there was too little time and it was really the february 2015 budget which gave you the idea about where the government was headed but this time the july budget given the fact that this is a continuation of an existing government will be extremely important and many people will be watching very closely i would say that it is about how this government interprets the mandate the disappointment will be that the government thinks we need not listen to all those people who have been advising us to carry out reforms because we just won and these guys did not even know that we were going to win so big my counter to that is that every successful second term government changes course the governments which do not succeed in the second term and face the second term curse typically do so because they get complacent and do not change the course so that would be the disappointment the positive surprise would be as i said that expectations are not that high and if the government starts off with a bang by saying that mr modi really thinks that i have to think about my legacy is enough when in campaign mode you can deny issues like slowdown or jobs and other sort of issues but the moment you are governing you basically get back to making realistic assessment of that and you say i really need to change the fundamental architecture of what is going on out here so that the indian economy is truly set on a fast track that would surprise us it is pretty clear in terms of which way we could be surprised and which way we could be disappointed and my note of like only caution here is the fact that the indian stock market if you look at it the performance in the first term of the modi government was exactly in line with what i would expect of first term governments the research i have done on this show is that typically in the first term of a new government in emerging markets the stock market of the new leader tends to outperform other emerging markets by roughly 20 percentage points and that is about what india did in dollar terms during mr modi s first term compared to other emerging markets there are far fewer instances of leaders completing a second term but when they do the stock market typically does not outperform other emerging markets and india s valuations today are already at the higher end on a relative basis compared to other emerging markets so that is the note of caution on expectations in the stock market but in general for economic growth rates india remains relatively high compared to the other emerging markets yes keep your expectations in check we will all be happier in terms of both people have spoken about the bankruptcy code people have spoken about gst and the fact that the negative effect of demonetisation begins to trail off that could be the upside and some of the shocks like demonetisation was a self inflicted shock or gst which had to be done but it takes a long time for things to get sorted out i still remember going to malaysia in the summer of 2017 and when i met the finance minister he told me that india is carrying out gst i would just caution that it took us two years in a country like malaysia for sorting out the problems with gst so india should be prepared for something like that given that this it is a larger more complex country some of the negative effects of demonetisation and gst have begun to fade away and we have begun to see that the upside of things like gst could be positive in the next few months or even years but there are lots of other things which need to be cleaned up like the fact that the government s borrowing programme is still quite heavy the revenues coming in are still falling short or what the government would ideally like or had budgeted for it is really still a very tight environment but it seems like earnings growth has bottomed out and at least for this year all expectations are that of all other emerging markets earnings growth will be the highest in india although we tend to start every year saying the same thing every decade there is some theme which captures the imagination of the world and this decade has been clearly america s decade the american stock market has tripled in value whereas emerging markets in dollar terms their total returns have been zero so that has been a really tough environment but last decade was exactly the opposite the american stock market in dollar terms went nowhere it was zero return in fact and emerging markets had doubled and tripled in value because it was the era of brics and other emerging markets my peak america thesis is not necessarily about the fact that the american stock market contracts i agree that you got a sharp correction in the american stock market and the rest of the world goes down with it but it is the fact that the relative returns in the rest of the world should be better in the coming decade that is what the peak america theme is about now whether we end up having a period where if america goes through a recession like 2000 2001 and then we get the transition to the rest of the world that for me is a subject of debate but peak america is about peak performance relative to the rest of the world rather than just about the american stock market collapsing because that is not going to be good for the rest of the world at least in the short to medium term this has been america s decade like never before america today is a financial superpower like never before 55 of the world s market capitalisation is america even though its economic size is 25 it is a huge gap similarly just look at the strength of the dollar and how the american policy making now is able to use that dollar as a weapon for sanctions as we with oil or even in cases of russia venezuela the dollar is so powerful that the american s can really impose sanctions and cripple financial systems of other countries if they want to because you cannot do any transactions in the world today without using the us dollar as a financial superpower this is as powerful as america has ever been and maybe this is just mean reversion theory but i think that in the next decade this power is bound to ebb and so that is what peak america for me is all about we are basically in a slow and fat world and what i mean by that is the fact that global growth everywhere is slower it is not what it used to be the american economic expansion even in the global economy currently are in the midst of close to being in the midst of the longest expansion in history that is the good news problem with the growth everywhere is slower for the reasons that you have identified i call them the three ds demographics de globalisation and debt those are the three ds which are dragging global growth lower this population change argument is something which is underappreciated even in india the population growth rates which typically account for half of the economic growth rates historically has slowed down everywhere there are more than 40 countries in the world today where the working age population is actually contracting including in china even in india the population growth rate is something we keep complaining about but the growth rates have dramatically slowed down in the last few years so you have lower population growth rate we have a lot of debt which will be built up with this heady financial deregulation that took place in the 1980s 1990s and the last decade but ever since we had the global financial crisis of 2008 people have become much more debt averse in general except some pockets like china which keep on building up debt and de globalisation and de globalisation now is happening on all five fronts like i have spoken de globalisation in terms of global trade volumes are contracting for the first time in decades global capital flows have slowed down global migrant flows have also slowed down and increasingly what we are seeing is that even digital flows between countries may begin to slowdown because you have countries like us and china who are very keen to keep their ecosystems interdependent of each other that is the big thing about this trade war that is turning more and more towards tech and targeting the tech companies the era of de globalisation is here to stay no but as i mentioned in the book that fanboy moment for rajiv gandhi ended rather quickly when i grew up like i documented in the book i also wrote in new york times about it a few days ago to talk about the fact that when i went and met them in 2002 trying to persuade them and why you needed to give india or have more of an agenda for economic freedom for india rather than political freedom which have already helped india i got radio silence from them i think i have been systematically disappointed after that in fact given that experience i never had a one on one meeting with them ever again i have only met them as part of the groups that i travel in so that sort of disillusionment the fact that they do not believe in the kind of economic ideology that i have which is much more about giving people economic freedom sort of changed my mind about that pretty quickly at least when i met sonia and rahul in 2002 which is what you document now the issues about priyanka we thought that she was a very effective campaigner but i do not know if that moment has passed for her and certainly the entry this time in this election was badly timed and nobody really knows what the real thinking was on economic issues as i said the journey is fascinating there is no other country in which i would go and do such election trips because i somewhat understand and i am very interested in the social fabric of this country but as far as having any association with anyone s concerned i long gave up on that no matter what advice i give to anybody it is going to fall on deaf ears so i am happy being an observer and seeing this journey of india and also getting surprised you know it is a country i thought i knew really well and then you get an election result like we got this week and then all of a sudden i began to think that hey there is something about this country which is changing which i do not know enough about there is a new young india which is coming up where they are thinking much more in presidential terms and not in the way like in the last 25 years for me the fascinating thing about elections so it is not like markets at the end of the day we had always trying to predict the future and we are systematically getting surprised along the way but as long as my hit rate is 60 or something like that i will think i am still being able to understand something nothing really i have always thought that the indian stock market is a steady performer as we have discussed in the past there is no other country in the world where we find so many good companies like we find in india this is something which is controversial because it is so easy to pan the kind of businesses that we have in india but i have data to back this up if you look at the number of good companies in india which i define as companies which are able to regularly or systematically deliver earnings growth of 15 or roe of 15 the highest number of companies i find are in india in terms of companies with the relatively decent market cap of a billion dollars or more so india will always in my eyes remain a steady outperformer the trajectory will change a bit at times expectations get too high and we get disappointed and similarly when there is too much doom and gloom we know that but this path of steady outperformance as far as india is concerned carries on now my ultimate dream is that india grows like china which is you get 9 10 type growth rates i just do not feel that we have the sort of social fabric to try and experiment with those kind of large scale reforms to get growth rates of 9 or 10 in this country the heterogeneity of this country is such which makes it very difficult to try and push that kind of top down reforms which is possible in a very homogenous country like china or other east asian confucianism kind of societies as india outperforms other emerging markets there should be a slight caution that we are at the high end of that outperformance both in valuations and price terms but a steady performance for this market is something i have always believed in and therefore like always allocated a large amount of capital to this country as i said that we have to wait a lot longer for passing any judgment on this because like the second term is what i am looking to see as to what he really does in the first term like as i said my expectations were more of rage 14 58 and we ended up sort of getting more policies at least on economic front which felt more left of centre or so so i think the second term is how i you know wait to see how it 15 10 because that is really when the legacy of leaders is shaped it is not in the first term it is always in the second term as they end up getting re elected so let us see how the second term really shapes up to be but i think that for me this has been a book of love because it has been about india the first two books were global if i were to write a next book it possibly be back to being global i am fascinated with the topic of deglobalisation and what that is doing and how we are seeing the rise of nationalism as a national fallout of that i think it is both sort of betting the process of deglobalisation and it is also a fallout of that so that is what i am like very keen to do and as far as prime minister modi is concerned i think that what we need at this point in time for me and this is really important is that there has been a lot of bitterness a lot of polarisation you know people either love him or people hate him i think at this stage we need to sort of have a six month honeymoon period where we just wait and see as to how he emerges in the second term and i am hoping that rather than these kind of labels like divider in chief he emerges more as uniter in chief in the second term that is the hope i have for both india and mr modi

because the european zone in particular has been threatened by and troubled by the trade concerns on the back of that we also had those european elections so there s a lot of political instability in

spread the love an article posted by climateliabilitynews org hearing glosses over carbon tax proposal s liability waiver explains the grand bargain being set forth in a proposal from the climate leadership council a carbon tax dividend plan is now being supported by big corporations polluters and fossil fuel companies which would seem to be a miraculous change in sentiment but the fine print discloses that the deal includes a liability waiver exempting fossil fuels companies from federal state climate tort lawsuits the carbon tax is on the low end for social cost of carbon calculations at 40 ton so as a value proposition it s not as big of a concession as the benefit they are seeking in the tort immunization they would get a huge relief in exchange for a pittance as if that weren t enough it also asks for a rollback of most greenhouse gas regulations what it calls regulatory simplification so this proposal is grossly skewed in favor of fossil fuels although most u s taxpayers would benefit from monthly dividend payments none of the proceeds would help cities and states pay for the astronomical costs of climate mitigation and adaptation kathrin sears supervisor for marin county considers the permanent legal immunity provision a fossil fuel funded trojan horse marin along with san mateo county city of imperial beach ca sued 37 companies in 2017 seeking compensation for climate damages letting oil gas and coal companies off the hook means taxpayers from marin to miami will have to pay tens of billions of dollars in order to protect our communities from the climate change related costs and damages those companies knowingly caused sears said clc published a statement on 1 17 19 in the wall street journal advocating for a carbon tax dividend policy signed by more than 3 500 economists which in itself is an indisputably impressive display of consensus the statement did not directly cite the clc s baker schultz plan clc founder ted halstead has characterized the baker schultz plan as bipartisan that may possibly be true if an exhaustive review were conducted of the partisan positions of all these economists which was not included but if evaluated against the partisan positions of the founders that is clearly not the case the founding members are not bipartisan in any real sense founding members of the climate leadership council include oil giants exxon bp shell and total p g j j pepsico excelon it names numerous republican and conservative luminaries including former fed chairmen ben bernanke janet yellen five former cabinet members steven chu christine todd whitman and larry summers george schultz james baker former nyc mayor michael bloomberg former chairman of reagan s national economic council martin feldstein harvard economics professor greg mankiw steven hawking ceo of the largest hedge fund ray dalio you could perhaps say that steven chu steven hawking and larry summers were representative non republicans supporting clc s claim of bipartisanship but i suspect chu hawking as scientists were just happy to be part of something that seems positive perhaps don t really appreciate the liability part of the equation so they are really more non partisan than democrat however the same could not be said for larry summers who is much more akin to a republican than a dem he has a long history of working for elite interests in how he advised obama as treasury secretary on the economic counsel and as president of harvard not divesting from fossil fuels either for the endowments or in refusing donations from fossil fuel companies everyone else on the clc list are all dyed in the wool ff advocates couldn t fairly be described as having any real interest in environmentalist concerns however most surprising was inclusion in this clc list of founders of the environmental organization the nature conservancy i would have thought with a name like that there would be an appreciation for enormity of the imf s enumeration of implicit subsidies from externalities totaling 5tr per year which has appeared in more than just an obscure ngo report but also in the popular press fossil fuel subsidies cost u s more than defense budget imf report rolling stone litigation is one path to validate these expert assessments of aggregated costs that have been avoided externalized by fossil fuel enterprises and hence can be seen as subsidies and as the basis for damage claims in these litigated climate tort cases this is why if they ever result in an award they will be much bigger than the tobacco settlements and will result in a ripple effect through the universe of fossil fuel asset valuations this would empower the esg shareholder activists fighting with exxon over climate disclosures which if they appraised the value of their assets in the ground for a value after the financial earthquake of such a tort damage award their asset values would be at risk for a precipitous decline which is the very risk disclosure that exxon is refusing to make they would prefer to continue to cultivate illegitimate doubt by sponsoring climate denialist experts and by supporting diversionary carbon tax proposals does nature conservancy understand this that establishing values for damage claims through litigation will validate the imf s method that includes health costs climate catastrophe costs property damage from rising sea level fires surely they understand that preventing the success of this demonstration will be obviated if blanket liability waivers are legislated surely they understand that the only way for a long term wind down of a fossil fuel based economy is to 1 devalue the assets in the ground 2 reduce demand by shifting to renewable supply that 3 imposing litigated damages is the leverage that will catalyze these changes right indeed they do which makes sense once you see who is on their board and realize that this entity is a fossil fuel captive board of directors larry fink is ceo they got the guy who runs the largest asset management company in the known universe blackrock which as 5tr in assets under management on the one hand larry fink has expressed publicly in his famous letter the need to broaden corporate responsibility away from rank corporatist shareholder supremacism use language about considering other stakeholders which for most would mean customers labor environment sounding very progressive on the same page as elizabeth warren s accountable capitalism but larry noticeably omits consideration of the commons as having status as a stakeholder focusing on the workers generational wealth transfers etc sitting on the nature conservancy board and agreeing to accept ff liability waivers means that whatever dilute expressions of environmental concern he has ever made from his perch atop that 5tr aum is mere greenwash tokenism bill frist former republican senate majority leader i don t think could be trusted to be taking a stand against ffs if medical costs were considered a damage item he really has never been an advocate for enhancing widening public medical coverage rather his legislative legacy was just a typical conservative obsessive focus on anti abortion legislation and a mission to narrow public benefits and continue their commitment to structuring upward wealth transfers joseph gleberman comes from pritzker a private equity firm with zero environmental investments and the site discloses only various oil gas interests various lumber farming interests tobacco really not likely to have high esg ratings why is he even on this board same answer or maybe he s the expert in appreciating the threat from his front row seat in the tobacco litigation shona brown from google aggressive environmentally themselves but not really advocates for eliminating externalities more about gaming them harry hagey former ceo of dodge cox a mutual fund nothing particularly environmental here andrew liveris former ceo of dow chemical this doesn t even need any research to see that this is obvious evidence that tnc intended to include foxes in this chickenhouse jack m ceo of alibaba who knows if he cares about anything he s just a big asian investor douglas petno ceo commercial banking jpmorgan the greenest thing jp morgan is doing is bundling solar backed securities definitely not in the business of taking a stand for imposing liability for externalities jpm is more about tokenism opportunism than carbon transition vincent ryan ceo of schooner capital says his expertise is in alternative energy industries but looking at schooner s portfolio there wasn t one single company that had anything to do with alternative energy so that s misleading bloomberg says he served at changingworlds which is an arts org he founded iron mountain which is a data storage firm director of cablevision there is a brief reference to an ambiguous title national hydro and arch mobile comm for which there are no google returns stokes the imagination to wonder how a hydro firm a telecom could be under one roof his claim to have expertise in alt energy is completely unsubstantiated maybe he reads a lot like me moses tsang ceo of ap capital holdings references one fund under private equity that includes clean energy along with electronics tech food bev so clean energy is incidental yin wu china capital group bloomberg does say it is invested in new energy environmental protection along with info tech fintech bio med media so maybe an environmentalist barely meg whitman i do not see how she could claim to be an environmentalist nothing in her history supports that she has been in tech in electoral flaps is now in private equity is ceo of quibi as startup mobile media company she is not on this board because of her environmentalism but because of her lack of it buried in this throng of non environmentalists are a few token representatives who have devoted more than a couple minutes to the issues thomas tierney bridgespan group consulting for non profits but its spawn of bain capital quacks vaguely about impact investing vague goal of social change at least mentions public health but looks like it may just be a pretense for pe to dump tax deductible donations so this belongs back up in the 1st group mark tercek he s the ceo of tnc wonder if larry fink knows maybe fink is the titular head tercek the operational head he was at goldman sachs for 24 yrs was tapped to develop the firm s environmental strategy and to lead its environmental markets group cuomo appointed him to serve on the 2100 commission after superstorm sandy to plan more resilient infrastructure he sits on many other boards frances ulmer us arctic research commission sally jewell former sec of interior under obama nancy knowlton chair marine science smithsonian museum nat history craig mccaw ceo eagle river a firm that manages a portfolio of hydro plants so the ratio is 5 13 of actual environmentalists to life long dedicated corporatists with either zero or antipathy to environmental concerns wonder how the voting went when the issue of liability waivers came up the mission statement sounds good they focus on nature based solutions nbs meaning reforestation grasslands wetlands sustainable land management land trusts all good congruent with a progressive agenda that would include desert greening halophytes crops sea grasses mangroves farming soils regeneration etc but the other prong of their policy advocacy is pairing this with carbon offsets which has so far been anything but revolutionary a transition mechanism leading into carbon taxes which is another transition mechanism it is a tactic that advocates of more progressive carbon tax policies with a higher social cost of carbon have had to accept as a negotiated political alternative for decades now which is not to say carbon offset programs like rggi for example have not had some success and effectiveness but they cannot be said to have closed the emissions gap appreciably in part because adoption has been limited again because of the effectiveness of fossil fuel lobbying in opposition tnc has posted a huge repository of downloadable papers their domain name is deceptively close to nature com the prestigious science journal one such paper makes a solid case for nature based solutions and undoubtedly many of the other papers also have merit nbs will be an important part of the overall solution the clc s economic attack dog is gregory mankiw who argues in favor of a carbon tax based on pigou consumption tax model tries to downplay the imf s 5tr subsidy accounting but nattering for shifting costs of a carbon tax to consumers obscures the point of the imf s radical analysis which is to make visible the scale invisibility of this subsidy to confront the fact that the planetary system itself is making this invisible economic assumption manifest as a thermal behemoth the clc s approach is very business friendly but there are two kinds of business friendly that should be distinguished one is the path that supports a more libertarian free market corporatist dominance perspective which is a massive disinformation project since the very scale of both explicit and implicit subsidies constitutes evidence that these market adherents are beneficiaries of a market unfairly skewed to their advantage the other is the kind of advocacy seen from rocky mountain institute its affiliates which has contended for decades that aggressive conservation transition to renewables should be pursued because a failure to do so has a big downside to profitability b that renewable entrepreneurship has a huge upside potential will be a boon not a burden rmi s posture is different than the much more dilute advocacy from nature conservancy which is oriented to protecting existing capital enterprise structures from the burdens of re internalized externalities and the potential for huge stranding of fossil fuel assets rmi may not overtly advocate like the nation or jacobin for nationalization but neither would i expect to see rmi advocate against climate liability litigation in favor of liability waivers that last step supporting waivers constitutes an admission by tnc that they are a ff captive despite posing a very convincing presence as an environmental activist organization from their mission statement published papers what is the alternative to clc s approach several excellent pieces comparing carbon proposals place it into context david roberts has posted excellent overviews about pricing the social cost of carbon in a 2012 piece in grist making the case that a low priced carbon tax is essentially a conservative project that to be effective the price must be significantly higher than 50 ton and as updated in his 2018 piece in vox where he notes that some researchers believe that the true social cost of carbon may be much higher than today s estimates as high as 250 ton in the us according to a study at cambridge university even an aggressive social cost of carbon policy although a step in the right direction would barely scratch the surface of these subsidies in aggregate it has been argued that a policy bias favoring these implied fossil fuel subsidies skews the entire spectrum of asset yields an oecd study role of pension funds in financing green growth initiatives 2011 contended that renewable projects are mispriced due to adequately pricing carbon externalities which depresses the relative returns resulting in lower yields for renewable assets to the extent the oecd premise is correct that the yield environment is distorted by implicit subsidies for fossil fuels coal nat gas for nuclear in the form of structurally embedded externalities a reasonable conclusion is that policies which re externalize these costs could contribute to enhancing the competitiveness of yield from renewables this would do more to affect the global economy and capital flows than a carbon tax ever could i covered this in a roadmap for a green new deal article from last year green bond yields would likely outcompete yields for ff related bond issuances if the defacto put benefit derived from these externalized costs were challenged then the discussion would not be restrictively framed 2 dimensionally as mankiw would have it to just slicing up the pie of carbon tax revenues leveling the playing field is laudable but if the very baseline economy itself is effectively owned by fossil fuel interests by dollar denominated fossil fuel assets and the industry in turn politically owns all the regulatory bodies that could ostensibly have the publicly conferred power to stand against their dominance how else could this begin to happen except perhaps in the courts the other possibility would entail re framing the social contract at the same level of abstraction that is necessary to argue that concentrated wealth is really just a concession that could be taken back or that slaves as assets could be granted the liberty to run free that is how deep this rut in our thinking is and it took arguably 100 years after the civil war past the hayes bargain eviscerating reconstruction 80 years of jim crow all the way to fdr in wwii johnson s civil rights act in 64 to shift perspectives on a slave economy we don t have 100 years to alter the social contract that allows big corporate interests to dictate fossil fuel pollution policy the truly revolutionary path would be nationalization most disruptive most aggressively modeled on an environmental fdr new deal industrialization plan so far the two best articles i ve seen elaborating this are the policy weapon climate activists need nation a plan to nationalize fossil fuel companies jacobin as high level idealistic abstraction nationalization is up there with universal basic income a green industrialization social justice plan re empowering labor unions putting anti trust corporate fraud prosecutions on steroids imposing a mandatory disclosure requirement for beneficial ownership to recover the 32tr laundered away in nested shell corporations climate liability litigation is going to be the place where these damage claims are entertained a home base for this information is climate liability news and david roberts again weighs in with one of the most comprehensive surveys of current climate litigation eight us cities five counties and one state are suing some of the world s largest fossil fuel companies for selling products that contribute to global warming while misleading the public about their harms in parallel 21 young people are trying to suspend fossil fuel development as part of their high profile climate rights case juliana v united states against the government the case is currently awaiting a hearing at the ninth us circuit court of appeals lawsuits by the cities of san francisco and oakland are pursuing a legal theory of public nuisance they were consolidated by district court judge alsup who then dismissed the claim saying the problem deserves a solution on a more vast scale than can be supplied by a district judge or jury in a public nuisance case suggested that the harms of fossil fuels might have to be balanced against the benefits they yield to civilization alsup also requested a tutorial on climate change science the defendants bp chevron exxon mobil shell and conocophillips agreed that humanity is causing changes to the global climate and did not dispute the science another theory being pursued is a civil rights claim arguing that the us government knowingly undertook policies that contributed to climate change by leasing public lands providing supportive public policy if one of these cases finally hit it would have a bigger impact than the tobacco settlement because the damage claims would be larger if relying on the imf data for health costs from ff pollution data from catastrophic insurance payments are offered as credible basis as the actuarial foundation for establishing that the scope of the public damages would an award be based on negligence or would it also include a punitive award based on demonstration of an intentional mass tort would the evidence of corporate lobbying to obtain preferential policy treatment be allowed in as evidence of an intentional act is the intentional concealment campaign by all the oil majors exxon shell bp etc that has been widely publicized by investigative journalists at insideclimatenews org sufficiently egregious to justify a punitive multiplier to the negligence claims is it a defense to say that public accepted their campaign misinformation that the legislature collaborated with their misinformation campaign by agreeing to perpetuate permissive policies that a campaign of deception bribery cannot be challenged because it is so pervasive that it constitutes a defacto american business as usual that it is too big to fail reinsurers are monitoring all this and if there were to be a singular moment of success the risk exposure for re internalizing all these health claims and property claims would far exceed the capacity of existing liability insurance coverage there would likely be denials of coverage because the risks would not have been underwritten prior to the legal award so all the liability risks would have to be re priced which would add a huge operating expense but there would likely also be a substantial amount of exposure simply left uncovered with no recourse for indemnification there would be similarities to what has happened in the nuclear power industry which is allowed to operate with coverage limits far below the actual losses that would be incurred by a major nuclear catastrophe without these kind of concessions and legal immunities the nuclear power industry would not likely have developed to the extent that it has even if a blanket liability waiver is not obtained the model offered by the nuclear industry shows that much the same effect can be achieved in socializing risks by simply placing caps on liability rather than take the litigation risks to zero they would be taken down to 10 on the dollar interestingly the costs for d o liability coverage is rising as the exposure to executives for climate related decisions this is a positive sign that there is less sympathy for the idea that these decision makers are not necessarily too big to jail an influence campaign for mitch mcconnell to bury the conversation with a liability waiver for fossil fuels in exchange for a republican advocated carbon tax dividend program would be a bread circuses conciliation it would have an even bigger adverse environmental effect than the cheney halliburton waiver allowing for concealment of fracking chemicals had on precipitating the boom in gas fracking it would accelerate not suppress taking ff s out of the ground if we can stipulate that this point is obvious then nature conservancy is being willfully ignorant but more likely complicit other litigation being pursued by state attorneys general in ny ma ca they allege that it is fraud upon the shareholders in failing to fully disclose the risks of a potential write down of the value of the reserves in the ground due to either a policy driven imposition of a carbon budget or a market driven fade in demand or a combination that failure in disclosure of a risk to the value of the shares constitutes a securities fraud that is referable to the sec it is in effect an esg focused enforcement on disclosure alone but does not include reference to the deliberate propaganda fraud but if these cases were to be won and some kind of preliminary damage claim established the next level of litigation which would be against the intentional propaganda fraud would have a better likelihood of success most of the oil majors are having protracted legal battles with activist shareholder groups over these disclosure issues that is why the ff majors are advocating for relief offering a pittance of a carbon tax as a weak show of good faith after decades of bad faith leading to multiple wars now a threat of global climate catastrophe they want a blanket waiver from litigation to head off a potential blizzard of further litigation which could escalate rapidly if there were a few adverse outcomes if there were a few multi billion dollar damage awards there would initially be a modest impact on their earnings reports but the next round of litigation could more credibly be forecast to scale to a tipping point a run on the bank would froth up in the form of a rush of class action cases to capture the remaining profitability before they founder altogether momentum of capitulation would escalate as the worst case scenario of stranded assets on a colossal scale would begin to materialize the previously remote possibility nationalization would begin to emerge appear eminently more reasonable a substantial drop in share price of the largest 500 ff companies including transnationals with sufficient market contacts to establish jurisdiction would open the door to nationalization framed either as a bargain or as a bail out this would be the only scenario in which an orderly build down of the ff industry and a scale up of renewable energy with the scope of a green new deal industrialization plan could foreseeably occur as long as the broad ff industry exists in the current framework as private property assets rather than treated as a public asset there will continue to be resistance to concerted climate action at the pace necessary the attitude is on display in the propaganda on the website of the largest industry association american petroleum institute on the utter disinterest by russian state fossil fuel firms like rosneft and even the relatively forward looking shell with its forecasts that it will still be winding down its fossil fuel operations in 2070 bottom line policy on a liability waiver is the choke point the battle of thermopylae for the future of energy the fossil fuel industry is pulling all its available propaganda and influence levers to get the kind of immunity it desperately needs but the environmentalist litigants have facts and public sentiment behind them and need one major success in the courts to trigger a cascade of consequences that would open up a far more hopeful pathway for planetary survival
vedanta resources ltd is learning the hard way that when it comes to zambia s copper mining industry history tends to repeat itself fifty years ago zambia s first post independence leader kenneth kaunda nationalized mines owned by anglo american plc and roan selection trust to rally his political supporters now populist president edgar lungu is taking legal steps to take over the operations of vedanta s konkola copper mines alleging the unit lied about expansion plans and cheated on taxes with zambia mired in a debt crisis that s made its dollar bonds and currency among the worst performers in the world this year lungu s attack on vedanta is a useful distraction from the nation s economic woes while copper prices are well below historical highs the metal has more than tripled since 2000 resource nationalism tends to peak exceptionally when there is a perception that commodity prices are high and countries feel they are not getting the benefit said claude baissac the head of johannesburg based risk consultancy eunomix business economics ltd president lungu is undermining the gains of the 2000s zambia isn t alone in pursuing resource nationalism in neighboring tanzania president john magufuli has spearheaded an aggressive drive targeting gold mining companies staff of acacia mining plc have been arrested and the government has threatened to fine the company 190 billion vedanta s request for a meeting with lungu has been rebuffed the intervention by state owned zccm investments holdings plc to have konkola liquidated is lawful orderly and under the due process the president s spokesman said vedanta said in a statement that it was a long standing loyal investor spending more than 3 billion in zambia vedanta has asked the lusaka high court if it can join the case in support of its subsidiary news diggers reported citing court documents for the government which gets almost all its income from copper history suggests the cost could be even greater between 1970 and 2010 zambia lost 45 billion in potential income from copper eunomix said in a report kaunda s nationalization drive didn t end well by 1999 copper production had fallen 65 from 769 000 tons 30 years earlier anglo bought the country s biggest mines back after companies including top producer codelco declined to invest just over two years later with copper prices at a 14 year low anglo handed the mines back and they were sold to vedanta in 2004 for 48 million since then companies including first quantum minerals ltd glencore plc and barrick gold corp have invested in mines driving production up to almost 858 000 metric tons in 2018 making zambia the second biggest producer in africa after lungu s government announced tax increases last year the zambia chamber of mines said more than half the country s copper operations would become unprofitable with 27 900 jobs at risk still not everyone is unhappy with lungu s move to take over the assets of konkola labor unions have praised the decision which has also struck a chord with many citizens in a country where per capita income is below 1 350 a year vedanta and its peers strong arm the zambian state at every opportunity allegedly under reporting their earnings in official accounting while threatening massive layoffs and unviability at any mention of a tax increase mathews muyembe chairman of the copperbelt branch of business lobby group the economic association of zambia said in an editorial in south africa s business day newspaper enough is enough this is one move that is supported across the political spectrum for mumbai based vedanta the impact would be minimal with its zambian unit accounting for just 1 8 of pretax earnings in the financial year ending march 2018 it would be a small blip on the balance sheet said sanjiv bhasin executive vice president at iifl securities ltd in mumbai for zambia any further economic downturn could be catastrophic external debt tripled to 10 1 billion over the five years to the end of 2018 with interest charges ballooning its dollar bond yields have climbed to almost 20 this year the highest except for venezuela which is in default the kwacha has slumped 13 against the dollar and the international monetary fund s forecast for 2 3 economic growth this year is the slowest in 21 years how do we run resource rich countries baissac said zambia is a particular example of a country that has not managed to do this source bloomberg

multiple economists are looking warily towards canada s housing market this spring where a decade of market boom and inflated costs is ebbing in what some experts to believe to be a risk level on par with those of the financial crisis ten years ago in a report released in april the international monetary fund released the global financial stability report a comprehensive diagnostic on the economic status both in the united states and worldwide the study found that american and canadian housing markets have exchanged places from ten years ago while the united states market seems to have evened out with lower household debt and home prices better aligned with income levels the canadian market seems to have done the opposite costs in vancouver have more than doubled in the past ten years and the imf reported that valuations in popular cities such as hamilton toronto and vancouver are over inflated the report stated that due to a heavy increase in foreign investment many housing markets worldwide are becoming less stable while long term investment strategies can be stabilizing for an economy such as apartment building or multinational construction firms purchase of individual homes can be detrimental to the housing market especially when done to maintain an active portfolio strategy according to the imf report money from foreigners buying individual homes seem s to be associated with higher house prices in the short term and more downside risks to house prices in the medium term in advanced economies provincial governments have been trying to combat the increasingly pressing issue introducing foreign buyers taxes in an attempt to reduce instances of overvaluation another strategy recommended by report was to implement government regulations which would minimize the risk put upon home buyers canada s bank regulator did just that when it introduced a mortgage stress test which requires borrowers to qualify for a mortgage rate two percent higher than the one they are being offered by the bank the regulation essentially reduced the maximum amount home buyers are allowed to borrow by around twenty percent this stress test has become quite frustrating for the canadian residential real estate industry with multiple industry groups stating that it s shutting out many buyers from the markets the test is still in place however and in its march budget plan the canadian federal government instead honed in on a new first time home buyers incentive program planned to roll out this fall the incentive will subsidize first home purchased up to ten percent after qualifying for down payments mortgages will be lower than they otherwise would be and the amount paid by the canada mortgage and housing corporation won t have to be paid back until the sale of the home so what does all of this mean for home sellers for those planning to sell their home many put in months adapting and renovating their homes in order to prepare them to sell and the last thing they want to consider is not putting their house on the market fortunately although economists are wary of housing trends projections for the year still maintain that demand will increase during a period of market instability some economists believe the market will lull as new home buyers wait for the incentive program to kick in but general projections have overall markets either stagnating or continuing to rise

nearly five years have passed since president barack obama restored diplomatic relations with cuba and began relaxing the u s policy of unilateral sanctions now the trump administration is doubling down on a failed strategy of hostility reducing engagement with cuba and returning to the 1996 helms burton law one of the most repudiated pieces of trade legislation in the world trump s decision to restore the grip of cold war era policy to the strait of florida caters not to the interests of the cuban people but to a small group of voters between little havana and doral the new little caracas in south florida on april 17 national security advisor john bolton announced in a speech in miami that the u s would be fully implementing chapters iii and iv of the 1996 helms burton law which allows u s citizens to file claims against cuba s trading and investment partners for properties nationalized following the revolution 60 years ago bolton salted his red meat speech with new restrictions on u s non family related travel and remittances sent to cuba present in the audience were veterans of the defeated 2506 brigade a group of exiles who invaded cuba in 1961 after receiving cia training in guatemala reparations for exiles over citizens in need under chapter iii of the helms law american courts will be open to hear any claims for lost properties by cubans who became american citizens before 1996 after january 1 1959 the former cuban economic and political elites seem poised to try to claim all of these properties except the one for the responsibility of mismanaging a country to the point of revolution the implementation of this chapter has profound implications for cuba s national reconciliation and how cubans may perceive washington in the future cuban americans who lost their properties as result of revolutionary nationalizations were at the time cuban nationals living under cuban jurisdiction and sovereignty the logical venue for these cubans to seek remedy for the alleged injustice committed against them is in cuban courts no matter what one thinks about the priorities for reparations for cuban injustices it is difficult to argue that u s courts are the proper place for solving these issues it is not the united states government s responsibility or place to force the current or any future cuban government to prioritize compensating cuban right wing exiles over demands for other reparations such as for slavery or any of the many other abuses committed in cuban history before or after 1959 such meddling in issues of exclusive cuban sovereignty will not sit well in cuban politics and will feed anti american nationalist resentment whether cubans would like to use their own resources to compensate wealthy exiles should not be an imposition of the united states government this isn t the first time that u s policy has pressured a latin american government to put appeasing exiles over its own governance in post revolutionary nicaragua in 1994 senator jesse helms imposed a hold on legislation for u s aid with consequences for the government of violeta barrios de chamorro a significant portion of u s economic aid to nicaragua for development purposes went to compensating anti sandinistas who had lost property or investments under the revolution rather than towards poverty alleviation efforts bolton s support for tightening helms burton to allow similar claims for cuban exiles is similarly misguided unilateral sanctions will not work in cuba because other countries will not stop trading and investing if there is a profit to make after 60 years of conflict and hard sanctions the cuban communist regime has survived outmaneuvering every u s president who imposed or implemented sanctions since the eisenhower era even though the u s is a much more powerful country than cuba it is still unable to impose its preferences on its weaker neighbor cuba has demonstrated time and time again that despite this asymmetric power they are well versed in strategies to delegitimize the u s s position as wayne smith the american diplomat who closed the u s embassy in havana in 1961 and later returned to cuba as chief of the special interests section 1978 1982 once wrote cuba seems to have the same effect on american administrations that the full moon once had on werewolves bolton s april 17 speech in florida is simply the same howling it only makes sense as a policy towards florida not towards cuba under chapters iii and iv of the helms law right wing cuban americans are trying to internationalize the u s embargo against cuba at all costs they have brought legal claims against u s canadian and european union citizens and companies trump s catering to these interests by returning to this logic is detrimental to u s interests in cuba and latin america and to cuba itself for a number of reasons cuba in transition first this decision ignores cuba s current moment most cubans are eagerly looking to their first post castro president miguel díaz canel to address the critical challenges of reforming the country especially its economy while the new president has maintained a clear distance from the most audacious reforms he is aware that the cuban communist party s rule is not sustainable without a wider opening of the economy to private business and foreign investment or improving relations with reform oriented civil society and diaspora groups at this critical moment trump s aggressiveness will distract the cuban public debate from cuba s internal situation and create an opportunity for the communist party to rally the population and its various elites old and new pro market or pro state owned corporations pro or against regulation behind the patriotic flag the more the trump administration tries to asphyxiate cuba the harder the cuban government will impose political discipline in its ranks and within cuban civil society in contrast in the wake of obama s rapprochement a wide spectrum of autonomous publications emerged although this expansion of the public sphere does not amount to democratization and did not result from u s policy a friendly international environment may have played a constructive role in influencing their development patriotic segments of civil society such as the catholic church the majority of intellectuals lgbtq activists and other groups will condemn u s policy towards cuba those who do not close ranks with the government against foreign aggression will appear aligned with what cuban national hero and poet jose martí called the scrambled and brutal north not a good position to be in cuban politics isolated with just one foot out of prison sanctions for sanctions sake most of trump s latin america team do not understand how political asymmetry works in international affairs hard power is tremendously important in state to state relations particularly in war but in many cases the stronger cannot impose its preferences on the weaker side small countries have agency and well known repertoires of asymmetric strategies that erode and deteriorate the stronger country s position without achieving domination relations between the world s major powers are indeed very important but sustainable leadership relies also on constructive relationships with small countries wasting political economic and social capital on mismanaged and unnecessary conflicts not only alienates allies but also pushes neutral and potential non aligned countries into the arms of rival great powers leadership different from domination is about attracting others to operate and think within one s own agenda that is the role of effective diplomacy trump s return to sanctions will neither empower any relevant actor in cuba s politics nor change the cuban government s behavior cubans of almost every political persuasion will see vice president pence s announcement that the united states will sanction oil shipments from venezuela to cuba as sanctions for the sake of sanctions a means to create scarcity desperation and chaos in the island obviously the cuban people will suffer if venezuela is forced to reduce the amount shipped daily to cuba by some 20 000 to 50 000 barrels but such sanctions will not peel off cuba from the bolivarian alliance and would in fact encourage more security cooperation with maduro and strengthen havana s alignment with moscow and beijing trump s new sanctions against cuba replicate the same problems that the embargo has represented since the 1970s first the united states is alone geopolitically in its desire to double down on the cuban embargo second because the sanctions cater to domestic interests bolton s speech repeated unrealistic expectations about imposing american diktat to third countries and provoking the fall of maduro in venezuela ortega in nicaragua and díaz canel in cuba third limiting travel to the island and capping remittances will mainly harm cuba s emerging private sector providing new incentives for mass migration to the united states cubans who are anticipating a sharp economic downturn are traveling to mexico and central america and headed north to the u s border the announcement of sanctions may spark catharsis in some segments of the cuban and venezuelan diasporas in south florida but history has proven that foreign policy for retribution therapy at the service of traumatized exile groups is not very effective a policy towards cuba should be well a policy towards cuba for those passive opponents of communism within the cuban government coalition it is doubtful that these sanctions will create a wedge between development oriented nationalists and control oriented communists in terms of those cubans who openly oppose communism the sanctions will not diminish their isolation from most cubans but will certainly increase their internal divisions over how to interact with the united states consequences for business and international law reinforcing sanctions and threatening litigation over property claims will also make companies wary of doing business in cuba this could include the u s companies that began to explore business possibilities with cuba at the end of the obama administration and farmers who sought an opening to a substantive market mixing u s legitimate compensation claims on properties that were u s owned at the time of nationalization with claims by cuban citizens who lost their properties and became u s citizens later makes a difficult problem intractable cuba will never agree to pay for acts that were taken under its jurisdiction after 1959 between parties that were cubans in cuban territory even the eisenhower government recognized the cuban government s prerogative to nationalize some properties that had been owned by corrupt members of the batista regime when congress first debated the helms burton bill in the late 90s the u s state department warned legislators that the sanctions would provoke clashes with other u s allies doing business in cuba for example in international institutions such as the wto under helms burton regulations the united states has sanctioned french german and canadian companies for participating in commerce and investment transactions with cuba that are plainly legal in their own countries and under international law economists and experts have warned repeatedly that the abuse of sanctions by the united states using the primacy of the dollar creates incentives for other actors to seek mechanisms to protect themselves from this financial vulnerability indeed after the announcement on the application of chapters iii and iv european commissioners for foreign relations and trade federica mogherini and cecilia maelstrom announced the eu s intention to take the united states to the legal panel of the world trade organization wto the eu and canada also released a statement affirming that they consider the extraterritorial application of unilateral cuba related measures contrary to international law we are determined to work together to protect the interests of our companies in the context of the wto and by banning the enforcement or recognition of foreign judgments based on title iii both in the eu and canada our respective laws allow any us claims to be followed by counter claims in european and canadian courts so the us decision to allow suits against foreign companies can only lead to an unnecessary spiral of legal actions trump s officials like secretary of state pompeo and national security advisor bolton are indulging themselves in a 19th century geopolitical time warp pontificating about the monroe doctrine while creating conflicts with ottawa and mexico city and disregarding its allies positions on cuba policy meanwhile russia and china are deploying a 21st century approach to cuba and latin america every area in which trade and investment in cuba appears to be profitable is an open space for russian and china s technology and data driven impulses unleashing the illegal extraterritoriality of helms burton law now will only add to the allies resentment of and skepticism against the u s capability to act as a leader beyond the short term pressures of its domestic politics it also provides ammunition to rival powers to denounce u s double standards why should russia or china or iran obey international law or un resolutions if the united states so flagrantly violates them plus trump s sanctions will hamper also multilateral cooperation with cuba such as the medical collaboration established by the obama administration against the ebola pandemics in west africa in 2013 and 2014 an environment of hostility does not help foster any kind of constructive cooperation non family travel ban finally bolton s announcements in miami included a ban on non family travel to cuba and a limit on family remittances the amount of money sent by cuban americans to their relatives in the island limiting cuban american remittances is a prime example of double standards where the united states dictate that the cuban government curtails its involvement in the personal lives of citizens while trying to regulate how cubans living in the united states spend the money they earn u s taxpayers money will be spent on monitoring and persecuting people who only want to spend what belongs to them and travel to cuba trump s prohibition of non family travel to cuba also privileges cuban americans over other american citizens including cuban descendant u s citizens who fall into a second class citizen category when it comes to travel rights cuban american legislators who cannot convince their constituencies to not travel to cuba have pushed a compromise on the trump administration that would bar other u s citizens from going to cuba while avoiding the backlash they will get in miami if the government repeats former president bush s mistakes of limiting cuban americans travel to cuba more than 300 000 cuban americans travel to cuba each year and will continue doing so it is ironic that average cubans who live under a communist one party regime which washington has deemed a closed society have been allowed by their government to travel to the united states without limitation since october 2013 while u s citizens living under a liberal democracy are barred from traveling freely to cuba most cubans would like to change many dimensions of their country but not with a u s run transition but with their own timing priorities and sovereignty the united states best contribution to cuban democratization is to respect cuba s and other countries sovereignty and practice the freedoms it preaches dr arturo lopez levy is visiting assistant professor of international

the bank of canada is set to leave interest rates unchanged at 1 75 investors will look for hints for the next change in interest rates the bank s opinions on interest rates the recent jobs report and comments on trade will play a key role trading the canadian dollar has not been easy of late as the data provided substantial surprises in both directions triggering significant volatility but no clear direction the bank of canada s upcoming decision may finally set a course for the loonie the boc used to have a hawkish bias clearly saying they would raise interest rates to stay ahead of inflation that has gradually changed as economic growth slowed down the ottawa based institution first said that the economy may grow faster with a rise in inflation and then followed by all but removing its intention to raise rates they said there is increased uncertainty about the timing of future rate increases these words sent the canadian dollar lower with usd cad jumping above 1 3500 how will usd cad react to may s rate decision the three factors to watch are 1 a new bias on interest rates the bank may decide not to mention increases but rather state that current policy is appropriate and will likely stay so for the time being such language would indicate a full shift to neutral monetary policy and could weigh on the loonie another option is to maintain the current language unchanged a move that could be considered hawkish in current conditions of meager expansion both options have an equal chance an unlikely possibility would be a minor hawkish shift by just removing the adjective increased from the phrase above markets could perceive it as hawkish and send the loonie higher the bias depends on the boc s concerns about inflation data for april shows a significant slowdown of the core consumer price index to 1 5 year over year the us federal reserve has described the slowdown in price development as transitory does the boc share the same views regarding canadian inflation if so the bank will likely leave rates unchanged if not expect a downgrade 2 what does it think about employment it would not be an exaggeration to call the recent jobs data a blockbuster the economy gained now less than 106 5k positions around nine times the early expectations the unemployment rate dropped to 5 7 a healthy level moreover the leap in the labor market is the highest on record but not the first substantial surprise in recent months the economy saw considerable gains also in november 2018 as well as january and february this year economic theory suggests that a robust jobs market eventually pushes prices higher as more people have additional disposable income to spend thus causing prices to increase that has yet to happen but the boc may want to preempt price rises with a rate hike if the bank hints that the jobs boom will probably lead to higher wage and inflation growth the canadian dollar may rise on the other hand if the boc says there is still slack in the economy the loonie may lean lower 3 talking about trade there have been two significant developments around international trade since the last meeting the us and china were getting closer to striking a trade accord until relations broke down in early may talks between the world s largest economies broke down shortly after and worsening the mood in markets the c a risk currency dropped alongside stocks the boc mentions significant developments in its rate decisions if poloz and his peers express concern over the dispute clash and its implications on canada the canadian dollar may suffer and if they shrug it off as just another consideration out of many the loonie has room to rise another trade dispute is directly related to canada the us slapped tariffs on steel and aluminum in mid 2018 despite signing a comprehensive trade agreement the usmca the us has maintained its duties only recently has the administration in washington announced that it will remove the levies canada does not import a vast amount of these metals it is nonetheless a trust building move if the boc acknowledges the importance of this tariffs relief as a substantial boost for the economy it may push the local currency higher however if poloz and his peers add it to a long list and play it down the loonie will not receive any help conclusion the boc is set to leave its interest rate unchanged but any changing in the wording is set to have a significant impact on the canadian dollar three factors are of high importance the interest rate bias based on inflation the bank s analysis of the job market and its views on trade

visitors look at a model of beidou china s global navigation system at the 20th china beijing international high tech expo china has to upgrade its productivity and its technology this is the only way it can escape the middle income trap over the next 10 years trade issues pale in importance compared to the need to maintain good economic political and people to people relations between china and the united states most of the economic concerns are short term and relatively small but the china us relationship will shape the state of the world for decades i m an american living in china and married to a chinese woman so i have a strong interest in and love for both countries the deterioration in economic relations over the last 10 years or so frightens me let s look at what is important and what s not according to a recent study by the san francisco federal reserve bank imports from china constitute only 1 76 percent of us consumer spending on the other side china s trade with the us amounts to less than 5 percent or 4 5 trillion yuan around 660 billion of its gdp around 90 trillion yuan in 2018 these numbers are not tiny but they are also not large enough to affect the lives of most people much however limited groups of workers and companies are directly affected a principal goal of both governments is to protect low skilled industrial workers the us administration is trying to restore the kinds of factory jobs that once gave working class people a shot at middle income lifestyle and china is aiming to protect the jobs of factory workers in its export industries but any protection of those low skilled jobs will have to be short term and transitional in both countries us wages have long been too high to allow industries based primarily on low wages to locate there only the artificial separation of work forces in india china and the former soviet union from western markets allowed those jobs to exist from the 1940s to the 1970s in china incomes and wages have risen sharply so a business based on low wage labor will no longer work here either the only long term solution for both countries is to upgrade to higher value added manufacturing and service jobs the two countries should be focused on how to manage this transition since world war ii the us has had a history of allowing developing nations easy access to its markets but then restricted this access when a country became more advanced from 1945 until about 1970 west european countries especially germany had easy access to us markets and the us did not require access to the european market european currencies were strongly undervalued from the us point of view this was okay when european producers were small and technologically inferior but by 1970 the europeans had caught up so the nixon administration responded by removing the tie between the dollar and gold effectively devaluing the dollar similarly the japanese enjoyed easy unreciprocated access to us market from the 1950s through the 1970s the japanese yen was strongly undervalued at about 300 yen to the dollar compared to about 100 today but by the 1980s japanese companies had become highly competitive with us companies so the us insisted on a rapid upward revaluation of the yen and imposed quotas on the imports of japanese cars into the us in some ways the current us position in the trade negotiations is similar to those it had earlier with its western allies over the last 20 years the chinese and american economies have become strongly intertwined according to the gravity model of trade countries trade primarily with their near neighbors for example canada and mexico are traditionally major trading partners with the us it is unusual for two such distant nations as the us and china to be each other s leading trading partners part of the transition over the coming decade will be a partial separation of the two economies and a diversification of supply chains america will re emphasize trade within north america and china will increase trade with the belt and road economies americans need to realize that china has to upgrade its productivity and its technology this is the only way it can escape the middle income trap over the next 10 years this upgrading is driven primarily by chinese firms competing in china s highly competitive markets senior leaders of tech companies tell me that the chinese tech market is much more competitive than silicon valley is many americans stress the roles of state owned enterprises and government r d or investment subsidies but these factors are small compared to the role of china s competitive entrepreneurial firms american strategic thinkers often write about four instruments of national power diplomatic military informational and economic some uses of economic influence are positive for instance the us marshall plan after world war ii or china s belt and road initiative today link people and economies together for mutual benefit of course other uses of the economic instruments of power are negative such as sanctions and tariffs sometimes sanctions serve a good purpose for example the reagan administration s sanctions against south africa in the 1980s helped bring about the end of apartheid but those are rare cases more often the negative use of economic power will cause long lasting animosities but will not have the desired long term goal europe and china will be highly motivated to develop financial systems and technological capabilities that are not subject to us control there are definitely some influential people in the current and past us administrations who write a lot about stopping the rise of china as a peer competitor in my view this is just silly the world is not the same as it was in 1990 the chinese economy already exceeds the size of the us economy on a purchasing power parity local price adjusted basis and will soon exceed it in terms of measured gdp the two countries will always be partly rivals in business and international politics but they don t have to be hostile rivals hundreds of thousands of influential chinese know the us firsthand they have seen both its good sides and its bad sides but few americans have any real idea of life in china my perception from living in beijing and visiting many other cities in china is that there s not much difference in the daily life in the two countries with some advantages in china and others in the us western media coverage almost invariably focuses on negative aspects of life in china a 2013 study by the reuters institute at oxford university analyzed stories in new york times bbc and economist magazine the study concluded that coverage of china is narrowly focused looks mostly at negative issues such as corruption or pollution and gives only minimal coverage to important issues such as social change culture or science and technology this just adds to the possibility that animosities could build up between peoples on tuesday president trump described the trade dispute as a little squabble in the midst of a good relationship in terms of long term economics he is right but winston churchill said history is just one damn thing after another the only really important goal is to be sure that the relationship between china and the us does not become one of those things from a hard headed realist point of view the disputes between the us and china look small and short term compared to the real interests we share in common

the bank of canada is set to leave interest rates unchanged at 1 75 investors will look for hints for the next change in interest rates the bank s opinions on interest rates the recent jobs report and comments on trade will play a key role trading the canadian dollar has not been easy of late as the data provided substantial surprises in both directions triggering significant volatility but no clear direction the bank of canada s upcoming decision may finally set a course for the loonie the boc used to have a hawkish bias clearly saying they would raise interest rates to stay ahead of inflation that has gradually changed as economic growth slowed down the ottawa based institution first said that the economy may grow faster with a rise in inflation and then followed by all but removing its intention to raise rates they said there is increased uncertainty about the timing of future rate increases these words sent the canadian dollar lower with usd cad jumping above 1 3500 how will usd cad react to may s rate decision the three factors to watch are 1 a new bias on interest rates the bank may decide not to mention increases but rather state that current policy is appropriate and will likely stay so for the time being such language would indicate a full shift to neutral monetary policy and could weigh on the loonie another option is to maintain the current language unchanged a move that could be considered hawkish in current conditions of meager expansion both options have an equal chance an unlikely possibility would be a minor hawkish shift by just removing the adjective increased from the phrase above markets could perceive it as hawkish and send the loonie higher the bias depends on the boc s concerns about inflation data for april shows a significant slowdown of the core consumer price index to 1 5 year over year the us federal reserve has described the slowdown in price development as transitory does the boc share the same views regarding canadian inflation if so the bank will likely leave rates unchanged if not expect a downgrade 2 what does it think about employment it would not be an exaggeration to call the recent jobs data a blockbuster the economy gained now less than 106 5k positions around nine times the early expectations the unemployment rate dropped to 5 7 a healthy level moreover the leap in the labor market is the highest on record but not the first substantial surprise in recent months the economy saw considerable gains also in november 2018 as well as january and february this year economic theory suggests that a robust jobs market eventually pushes prices higher as more people have additional disposable income to spend thus causing prices to increase that has yet to happen but the boc may want to preempt price rises with a rate hike if the bank hints that the jobs boom will probably lead to higher wage and inflation growth the canadian dollar may rise on the other hand if the boc says there is still slack in the economy the loonie may lean lower 3 talking about trade there have been two significant developments around international trade since the last meeting the us and china were getting closer to striking a trade accord until relations broke down in early may talks between the world s largest economies broke down shortly after and worsening the mood in markets the c a risk currency dropped alongside stocks the boc mentions significant developments in its rate decisions if poloz and his peers express concern over the dispute clash and its implications on canada the canadian dollar may suffer and if they shrug it off as just another consideration out of many the loonie has room to rise another trade dispute is directly related to canada the us slapped tariffs on steel and aluminum in mid 2018 despite signing a comprehensive trade agreement the usmca the us has maintained its duties only recently has the administration in washington announced that it will remove the levies canada does not import a vast amount of these metals it is nonetheless a trust building move if the boc acknowledges the importance of this tariffs relief as a substantial boost for the economy it may push the local currency higher however if poloz and his peers add it to a long list and play it down the loonie will not receive any help conclusion the boc is set to leave its interest rate unchanged but any changing in the wording is set to have a significant impact on the canadian dollar three factors are of high importance the interest rate bias based on inflation the bank s analysis of the job market and its views on trade

the philippines stellar economic growth has been the talk of the world s investors and financial leaders for the past several years as the country powers through insurmountable odds growing at a solid rate of 6 2 in 2018 despite mounting inflation interest rates and a depreciating peso it remains to be seen whether such growth can be sustainable in the long term many challenges await the country s economic future from tensions in global trade talks of the us federal reserve raising interest rates to a worldwide economic downtrend one such risk involves the philippines current dependence on coal fired power plants for energy as power consumption continues to rise on pace with economic expansion relying too much on coal in the long term puts the philippines subject to its fluctuating prices and over dependence on a single fuel source in addition to its negative effects on the environment and to health it is clear that a more sustainable source of energy is needed to power the country s future development a cleaner cheaper and more reliable alternative that can even help the economy in the long term is natural gas here s how many developed nations are shifting to natural gas the demand for natural gas has been steadily growing across the globe currently it supplies 22 of the energy used worldwide making up nearly a quarter of electricity generation in countries like the united states china and the middle east in the us natural gas has taken the place of coal in terms of power production energy produced by coal has dropped by 44 866 terawatt hours compared to natural gas up 45 or 400 twh for many countries natural gas is simply cheaper globally the price of electricity has been rising over the past few years in line with coal prices rising to as much as 120 per metric ton in 2018 in fact the institute for energy economics and financial analysis ieefa said in a report in 2017 that the unpredictability of the coal market will drive higher electricity prices and will threaten the industrial strategy of the philippines excessive reliance on imported coal is one of the main reasons the philippines has the highest electricity prices in the association of southeast asian nations asean region sarah ahmed an ieefa energy finance analyst said in the philippines the generation charge of natural gas has been cheaper than oil and coal plants contracted with meralco over the past few years the country has plenty of reasons to reduce its reliance on coal in a recent report the ieefa said that rapidly declining costs and technological advances in renewable energy liquefied natural gas lng energy efficiency and storage are creating an enormous opportunity for greater use of cheaper electricity generation domestic alternatives to imported coal and diesel in the philippines shifting to natural gas allows the philippines to save money especially as the government continues to promote infrastructure development in areas outside metro manila natural gas is readily available first gen corporation which owns four of the five commercially active natural gas plants in the country currently sources its natural gas from the country s malampaya gas field with proven reserves of about 2 7 trillion cubic feet of natural gas reserves and 85 million barrels of condensate located some 3 000 meters below sea level according to data from the department of energy the malampaya gas field is the biggest commercial gas discovery in the philippines to date in fact the country has been using natural gas for almost 20 years dating back to 2001 the malampaya gas field produces 146 billion cubic feet of gas per year first gen s four natural gas fired power plants the 1000 mw santa rita the 500 mw san lorenzo as well as the 97 mw avion peaking and 420 mw san gabriel power plants have added significantly to first gen s portfolio of power assets since their commercial operations globally gas is also very abundant and is traded around the world in the form of lng the philippines can also gain access to lng once the infrastructure to receive it and turn it back to gas is developed making the transition to natural gas will not only address the country s rising energy needs but also reduce its dependence on coal natural gas is reliable compared to coal fired power plants natural gas plants take no time at all to start up and generate electricity avion one of first gen s gas plants can typically reach full load up to 50 times faster than coal fired power plants this efficiency is crucial in the near future especially when emerging cities like cebu or clark drastically increase the country s overall power consumption moreover the country aims to increase its dependence on renewable energy which while clean and increasingly competitive can sometimes be intermittent given that battery storage is still ways away power supply would be impacted by times that re sources are intermittent for instance solar panels wouldn t generate electricity when there isn t enough sunlight the speed and flexibility of natural gas enable it to adjust its output and cater to the needed demand when these occurrences of intermittency happen having a stable power supply that can be relied on at a moment s notice can contribute significantly to the growth of not only these emerging cities but the whole country as well burning natural gas emits far less carbon than oil or coal the union of concerned scientists which works with more than 20 000 scientists and technical experts across the united states including physicists ecologists engineers public health professionals economists and energy analysts had this to say about natural gas on its website natural gas emits 50 to 60 less carbon dioxide when combusted in a new efficient natural gas power plant compared with emissions from a typical new coal plant because it is the cleanest among the fossil fuels natural gas can play a crucial role in lowering the philippines carbon emissions carbon dioxide co2 is one of the major greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change which in turn causes more frequent natural disasters like super typhoons and drought as well as causing sea levels to rise the enormous economic impact of climate change has already wreaked havoc in the philippines in the form of super typhoons like ondoy and yolanda these catastrophic typhoons have caused billions of pesos worth of damages in the country and they are likely to continue if climate change isn t mitigated in 2018 first gen s gas plants helped avoid 8 million tons of co2 emissions this is equivalent to removing 1 7 million cars from the road in terms of avoided emissions making natural gas the more sustainable energy source for the future natural gas is better for your health hammering home why natural gas is better than other more conventional sources of energy it also produces negligible amounts of sulfur mercury and particulates when burned citing data from the u s government the union of concerned scientists noted that for every 10 000 u s homes powered with natural gas instead of coal an estimated 1 900 tons of nox 3 900 tons of so2 and 5 200 tons of particulates are avoided in emissions each year reductions in these emissions translate into public health benefits as these pollutants have been linked with problems such as asthma bronchitis lung cancer and heart disease in the philippines where one of the biggest drivers of economic growth is the abundance of skilled human workers the importance of a healthy population cannot be overstated two of the leading causes of death in the country are heart and lung diseases lowering the emissions of harmful pollutants in the atmosphere may translate to a population that lives longer and adds more towards the country s development contributing to safer air as well as being a cheaper cleaner and a more reliable source of energy natural gas has the potential to change the philippines into a more progressive and more developed nation clearly switching to natural gas is the next step in the country s path towards progress

breaking above the key resistance level of 335 a key long term resistance is at 362 which is holding for now the stock can revisit this hurdle in the near term a strong break and a decisive close above 362 will boost the momentum and take sbi up to 390 and 395 in the short term but a pull back from 362 can drag it lower to 345 and 335 in such a scenario a sideways move between 335 and 362 can be seen for some time as long as the stock remains above 335 the bias will be bullish for it to breach 362 and rally to 390 395 only a break below 335 will turn the outlook to negative in that case there is a strong likelihood of the stock filling the gap formed last week a break below 335 can drag it lower to 325 and 320 a further fall below 320 looks less probable as fresh buyers are likely to emerge at lower levels and limit the downside itc 290 15 itc was volatile last week it surged about 3 per cent after the outcome of the exit polls but the stock witnessed a strong sell off after the election results and gave off all the gains made during the week technically the resistance at 310 is continuing to hold well a key support is near the current levels at 287 a bounce to 297 in the near term cannot be ruled out but itc has to rise past 297 to ease the downside pressure which looks less probable the bias on the chart is negative and itc looks vulnerable to break below 287 and decline to 280 and 275 the region between 280 and 275 is a strong long termsupport which can halt the fall a decisive bounce from this support zone will signal the beginning of a fresh leg of a long term uptrend such an upward reversal from the 280 275 support region will have the potential to take itc higher to 330 335 over the long term as such a fall to 280 or 275 will be a good opportunity to buy this stock from a long term perspective infosys 709 45 infosys fell 2 per cent last week the stock has been struggling to rise past the 21 week moving average resistance at 727 85 over the last few weeks this signals lack of strength and increases the possibility of the stock breaking below the crucial support level of 700 a break below 700 can take it lower to 690 688 a bounce from 688 can trigger a corrective rally to 710 and 715 but the upside could be capped an eventual break below 688 will then increase the likelihood of the stock extending its down move to 675 and 670 the region around 670 is a crucial long term support for the stock as such the price action around this support will need a close watch to get a cue on the next move a break below 670 seems unlikely this will see the stock tumbling to 650 640 or even lower levels over the medium term on the other hand an upward reversal from 670 will ease the downside pressure in such a scenario infosys can bounce back to 700 and 715 levels ril 1 336 8 ril opened with a wide gap up and surged 10 per cent intra week however the stock reversed lower from its high of 1 392 giving back some of the gains and closed 5 6 per cent higher for the week the surge above 1 300 has now negated the chances of the expected fall to 1 200 as long as the stock sustains above 1 300 the outlook will be positive to see a rally to 1 400 and 1 430 in the short term however a strong rise past 1 430 is needed for ril to gain fresh momentum and rally to new highs the targets above 1 430 are 1 485 and 1 500 inability to breach 1 430 can drag the stock lower to 1 350 and 1 300 levels once again in such a scenario ril can remain range bound between 1 300 and 1 430 a breakout on either side of 1 300 or 1 430 will then determine the next move the stock will come under pressure if it declines below 1 300 in such a scenario it can fall to 1 280 and 1 250 it will also bring back the bearish outlook for the stock to test 1 200 tata steel 483 5 tata steel has been range bounce between 455 and 495 over the last couple of weeks the 200 week moving average support at 458 has been continuing to hold well while the stock remains above this support a corrective rally to 500 510 is possible in the near term but a rally beyond 510 is unlikely as the indicators on the chart remains bearish the 21 day moving average has crossed below the 100 day moving average this is a negative signal indicating that the upside could be limited as such tata steel is likely to reverse lower from the 500 510 resistance region and fall to test the crucial support level of 445 a strong break below 445 can drag it to 425 it will also keep the overall downtrend intact a further break below 425 will then increase the likelihood of the stock tumbling to 400 over the medium term the 400 is a crucial support the writer is a chief research analyst at kshitij consultancy services 9 00 am index outlook the sensex and the nifty registered new highs last week

china set to cash in on new african free trade agreement op ed by chris devonshire ellis the african continental free trade agreement afcfta will boost china s african continental trade ties one of the world s most valuable and largest free trade agreement will kick in on may 30 yet it is one that has gathered little mention in mainstream media the african continental free trade agreement afctfa the afctfa is the single largest fta realized since the coming together of the world trade organization but the lack of attention paid to it is an indication that despite globalization trade that matters is perceived as being conducted solely by the united states china has been a major broker in the deal using its diplomatic political and trade clout to harness an agreement that includes 52 out of 55 african countries only benin eritrea and nigeria have not joined the afctfa covers an area worth over us 3 trillion in gdp and eliminates tariffs on 90 percent of goods traded across the continent over 1 2 billion african consumers will be impacted by the agreement nigeria which is africa s largest country in gdp terms is currently out of the deal based on concerns raised by the manufacturing association of nigeria which views the afcfta as having a negative impact on its members nigeria does have a separate free trade agreement with china but that has been viewed as less than positive as chinese manufacturers began dumping cheap and poorly made products on the nigerian market after its signing in 2010 china has been pushing low end manufacturing out of china and into lower cost southeast asian markets such as vietnam the philippines and indonesia yet these destinations too are slowly becoming more expensive with vietnam now being close to capacity in terms of manufacturing facilities available in hanoi and ho chi minh city the future writing is on the horizon low cost manufacturing over the next decade will start heading to africa and china still needs to buy cheap and reliably produced goods that goes hand in hand with the african resources that china is already committing to buy and the belt and road initiative is very much part of this infrastructure is continuing to be put in place with china being at the forefront of energy telecommunications and transport projects throughout the continent that has been going on for the past ten years when i visited kenya back in 2012 the chinese built nairobi to mombasa railway line was already being engineered the chinese have also built numerous presidential palaces in various african nations including the african union hq in addis ababa china s needs also fit in with those of a collective africa it has not gone unnoticed that parts of intra african trade infrastructure are so poor that certain african countries sell more products to the eu than they do to their neighbors afctfa will along with chinese built infrastructure boost africa s manufacturing capacity and africa has and will continue to have a large labor force although organizing and management skills are still very much required afctfa will usher in a shift from agriculture based labor which currently takes 50 percent of the continent s labor to industry which is currently five times more productive in gdp terms yet lacks manpower some nations will suffer short term pain to get through that transition there is still ongoing work to get this free trade behemoth to fly although the tariff reductions have been agreed to again certain nations will suffer an immediate impact as these kick in most notably in burkina faso ghana malawi and zimbabwe however competition policy and ip issues have already been agreed to meaning that it is largely up to african entrepreneurs and businessmen to bite the bullet and get on with adjusting to a common market instead of concentrating on purely their own national commerce that appears to be a growth trend too with iata forecasting that africa represents the second fastest annual growth market in the world in passenger aviation at 4 6 percent per annum by 2037 africa will see an additional 200 million passengers for a total market of 334 million passengers that s second only to asia and guess who will want to build the airport capacity supporting infrastructure and supply the aircraft still to come in the short term development of the afctfa though are issues including tariff schedules rules of origin and some specific arrangements on trade in services however participating countries are expected to submit negotiated market access offers import tariff commitments by january next year while agreement already exists to liberalize 97 percent of all tariff lines accounting for over 90 percent of intra african trade in a manner similar to that adopted by asean the time frame for tariff liberalization in afctfa is five years or 10 for least developed countries the rules of origin legislation is expected to be finalized next month with protocols on investment intellectual property rights and competition policy to be put in place by june next year china for its part has already been making efforts to develop free trade development zones in africa one example is the expansion of the well known in china tianjin economic development area teda which has essentially reached full capacity in tianjin yet branched out to establish a subsidiary in egypt the teda is continuing to grow into a total area of 7 23 km2 in egypt s suez canal economic zone sczone just east of the capital cairo they are not alone russia has done the same teda s business model this time around will be slightly different instead of attracting foreign investors to tianjin they are now focusing on bringing chinese investors to africa one is the chinese fiberglass manufacturer jushi which has helped egypt become one of the largest fiberglass producers and exporters in the world other free trade development areas are certain to sprout up across the african continent professor waleed gab allah of cairo university s financial and economic departments has been quoted in xinhua as forecasting a 50 percent increase in chinese exports to the afcfta countries when the agreement comes into force the african free trade agreement will encourage more chinese companies to work and invest in egypt s economic zone to benefit from the suez canal passage to africa with reduced tariffs he said on a pan african scale the economic impact of afcfta will be significant according to the african development bank removing tariffs on intra african trade will boost net income at the continental level by us 2 8 billion per annum removing the ad valorem tariff equivalents of non tariff barriers on goods and services would result in a 1 25 percent increase in net real income or us 37 billion while implementation of the wto s trade facilitation agreement tfa would boost benefits even further with an estimated aggregate real income gain of 3 5 percent or some us100 billion in terms of the impact on trade the afcfta stands to boost intra regional trade within regional economic communities by 14 6 percent while intra african trade would increase by around 107 percent further the implementation of the tfa would grow intra african trade by an additional further 51 percent these are significant figures however the afcfta is not just a deal to benefit the chinese although the structuring and timing of the agreement has all the hallmarks of chinese organizational skills international businesses from all over the world can benefit by establishing an african subsidiary china also has double tax treaties with a number of african nations algeria botswana egypt ethiopia mauritius nigeria uganda seychelles south africa sudan tunisia zambia and zimbabwe although southeast asia will continue to be a rapidly growing region for trade and commerce as africa develops via the new afcfta it will start to become competitive i predict that within the next five years we will start to see the beginning of moves made by foreign businesses who originally began their overseas manufacturing expansion for cost reasons to china continue the journey to southeast asia then head across to africa the afcfta has just bought that a massive step further into reality

athens greece voters punished the ruling syriza party for broken promises in sunday s european parliament election the conservative new democracy party s nine point lead over syriza was so devastating greek prime minister alexis tsipras announced a snap general election that is expected to be held at the end of june four months early the result is not up to par with our expectations tsipras said the greek leader was referring to more than 1bn worth of handouts he had announced three weeks before in the form of a halving of sales tax in supermarkets and restaurants and a bonus pension voters were seemingly not impressed by the measures tsipras handouts acted as a boomerang says nikolaos nikolaidis a lawyer with good connections inside the conservative party if you look at how pensioners voted the bonus pension was more of an annoyance it reminded them of all that had been taken away in previous years it was also announced just before the election and was clearly connected to it greece lost a quarter of its economic output during its eight year depression unemployment peaked at 28 percent in 2013 and remains at 19 percent economists record it as the worst contraction of any developed economy since world war ii and although a recovery did begin under syriza it has been weak the economy grew by less than two percent in 2018 a performance it is set to repeat this year i see conditions in the market when you cut people s pensions and squeeze them economically i see a fall in sales fishmonger thanasis kazlaris told al jazeera as he shovelled whitebait into a paper cone for a customer the taxes don t help sales tax had gone up a lot in the same central athens market chicken farmer angelos mavroeidis was unsurprised by the result i haven t gone to university i ve only done high school there are economists who know these things better something has to happen we have to have an economy like america s like australia s like britain s these aren t things that have to be reinvented he said last year s prespes agreement whereby greece recognised its northern neighbour as north macedonia also undercut syriza s popularity because it recognised a macedonian language and ethnicity in the northern greek provinces of macedonia thessaly and epirus new democracy won simultaneous elections for regional prefects in the first round a series of unfortunate events when greeks first elected syriza in january 2015 the party promised to end austerity and rip up greece s onerous agreements with its creditors instead it agreed to a third bailout loan which carried further cuts to pensions and higher taxes syriza which following the agreement called and won snap elections in september 2015 managed the economy with high taxes and high surpluses it was able to keep up payments to its creditors who are chiefly its eurozone partners and regain market trust graduating from greece s eight year fiscal adjustment programme last year but this came at the cost of low growth and stubbornly high unemployment rates the result was a complete reversal of the european elections in 2014 when the ruling conservatives saw syriza surge almost four points in front of them now as then the eu elections have acted as a weathervane showing who is likely to come to power next 190526233212988 taking into account the policies they have been implementing for four years did pretty well says panos polyzoidis a political observer and analyst they have not vanished as other parties have vanished polyzoidis was referring to the river a centre right reformist party as well as the centre union a populist party and the nationalist independent greeks party syriza s erstwhile coalition partner none won any seats in this election and are unlikely to survive the next general election new democracy s high score of 33 2 percent of the vote suggests it might yet energise a greater voter base in the coming month it would need about 40 percent to rule outright without a coalition partner this will be a springboard for new democracy polyzoidis says it could build on that spectacular victory and possibly even flirt with an absolute parliamentary majority nikolaidis agrees what made the difference was that new democracy pulled voters from other parties and especially syriza he says fifteen percent of syriza s 2015 voters went to new democracy and i don t think it has exhausted the potential there new democracy leader kyriakos mitsotakis has promised a restart of the economy he says he will lower tax on businesses from 29 percent to 20 percent in two years and lower income tax on farmers from 22 percent to 10 percent he also says he will seek to create 700 000 new jobs in five years and has pledged to bring home at least half a million of the 860 000 skilled workers who according to the hellenic statistical service have left the country since 2009 the whole scenario of lowering taxes and social security contributions and increasing wages that is all founded on the assumption that the economy will achieve an annual growth rate of four percent says polyzoidis personally i see that as difficult mitsotakis s economic plan largely hinges on a key promise to negotiate a new deal with greece s creditors that would allow him to spend less on repaying external debt and keep more money in the economy for reinvestment envisioning a secure extrovert and prosperous greece last september mitsotakis said all the other countries that underwent crises have made it some like portugal spain and cyprus are growing at three or four percent he said others like ireland and romania at six or seven percent what do they have that we don t nothing we can t do too if we decide to do it and make the effort

modern monetary disasters los angeles modern monetary theory mmt a seemingly new approach to economic policy has become a hot topic gaining support from leading us progressives such as presidential candidate bernie sanders and democratic representative alexandria ocasio cortez but mmt enthusiasts should heed lessons learned in latin america where policies based on similar ideas inevitably ended in economic catastrophe фото depositphotos com andrewlozovyi according to mmt s supporters the us federal reserve should print large amounts of money to finance massive public infrastructure projects along with a job guarantee program aimed at ensuring full employment a major increase in public sector debt mmt backers claim does not represent a danger for a country that can borrow in its own currency as the united states can this unconventional view has been criticized by keynesians and monetarists alike many respected academic economists including paul krugman kenneth rogoff and larry summers say that mmt makes little sense in response mmt supporters argue that the theory s critics do not fully understand how a modern monetary economy works according to influential mmt advocates such as stephanie kelton governments in countries with their own national currency such as the us do not face hard budget constraints because they can simply print more money to finance higher expenditures assessing the merits of mmt is difficult for two reasons for starters its supporters have not provided a unified detailed description of how the model is meant to work as krugman recently wrote mmt backers tend to be unclear about what exactly their differences with conventional views are and also have a strong habit of dismissing out of hand any attempt to make sense of what they re saying in addition mmt supporters have offered hardly any inkling of how the policy might function in practice especially in the medium and long term yet the approach is not unprecedented mmt or some version of it has been tried in several latin american countries including chile argentina brazil ecuador nicaragua peru and venezuela all had their own currency at the time moreover their governments almost all of which were populist relied on arguments similar to those used by today s mmt supporters to justify huge increases in public expenditure financed by the central bank and all of these experiments led to runaway inflation huge currency devaluations and precipitous declines in real wages four episodes in particular are instructive chile under president salvador allende s socialist regime from 1970 to 1973 peru during president alan garcía s first administration 1985 1990 argentina under presidents néstor kirchner and cristina fernández de kirchner from 2003 to 2015 and venezuela since 1999 under presidents hugo chávez and nicolás maduro in all four cases a similar pattern emerged after the authorities created money to finance very large fiscal deficits an economic boom immediately followed wages increased helped by substantial minimum wage hikes and unemployment declined soon however bottlenecks appeared and prices skyrocketed in some cases at hyperinflationary rates inflation reached 500 in chile in 1973 some 7 000 in peru in 1990 and is expected to be almost ten million percent in venezuela this year in argentina meanwhile inflation was more subdued but still very high averaging 40 in 2015 the authorities responded by imposing price and wage controls and stiff protectionist policies but the controls did not work and output and employment eventually collapsed worse still in three of these four countries inflation adjusted wages fell sharply during the mmt type experiment in the periods in question real wages declined by 39 in chile 41 in peru and by more than 50 in venezuela hurting the poor and the middle class in each case the central bank was controlled by politicians with predictable results in chile the money supply grew by 360 in 1973 alone helping to finance a budget deficit equivalent to an astonishing 24 of gdp in peru in 1989 money growth was 7 000 and the fiscal deficit exceeded 10 of gdp in argentina in 2015 the deficit was 6 of gdp with the annual rate of money creation surpassing 40 and venezuela currently has a deficit of 32 of gdp with the money supply estimated to be growing at an annual rate of more than 1 000 as inflation increased in these countries people greatly reduced their holdings of domestic money but because governments required taxes to be paid in local currency it did not completely disappear instead the speed at which money changed hands what economists call velocity of circulation increased dramatically no one wanted to be holding paper money that lost 20 or more of its value every month when the demand for money collapses the effects of money growth on inflation are amplified and a vicious circle develops one serious consequence is that the currency depreciates rapidly in international markets mmt supporters conveniently ignore the simple fact that demand for local money declines drastically when its value tumbles yet this is perhaps one of the theory s biggest weaknesses and one that makes it extremely risky for any country to implement the experience of latin america should serve as a clear warning for today s mmt enthusiasts in a variety of countries and at very different times fiscal expansions that were financed by printing money resulted in an uncontrollable loss of economic stability economic policy ideas are often as dangerous in practice as they are flawed in theory mmt may be a case in point sebastián edwards is professor of international economics at ucla s anderson graduate school of management his latest book isamerican default the untold

all amounts expressed in u s dollars santo domingo dominican republic may 27 2019 globe newswire the proposed expansion of pueblo viejo already one of the world s tier one1 gold mines includes an expansion of the mine s processing plant and tailings capacity with an estimated initial capital investment of more than a billion dollars 100 basis and the potential to extend the life of the mine into the 2030s and beyond2 barrick expects to complete a feasibility study for the expansion project during 2020 the proposed capital investment would more than double the contribution the mine has already made to the dominican republic barrick gold corporation s president and chief executive officer mark bristow speaking at a local media briefing here today said the proposed investment was further evidence of the joint venture partners long term commitment to the social and economic development of the dominican republic we look forward to continue making a significant and growing contribution to our communities and other stakeholders and to unlocking the enormous value of its mineral potential while addressing the historical third party environmental issues he said barrick manages the mine which is a joint venture with newmont goldcorp bristow noted that the joint venture partners had already invested 5 2 billion in pueblo viejo which represents almost 20 of the total foreign direct investment in the dominican republic over the past 10 years direct cash taxes paid by the mine amounted to 1 6 billion which represents 57 of the cash distributions compared to 43 earned by the joint venture partners since 2013 the mine has accounted for 30 of the country s exports and generated a net added value of 5 7 billion and a total net added value of 8 5 billion equal to 2 of the dominican gross domestic product some 96 of the mine s employees are dominicans and this has also had a significant impact on the lives of the more than 90 000 people in neighboring communities who have benefited from its community upliftment programs it has also promoted the development of the local economy spending more than 123 million with local contractors and suppliers over the past six years bristow said we look forward to building on what we have already achieved here and to continue creating value for all our stakeholders notably the government and people of the

a tier one gold asset is a mine with a stated life in excess of 10 years with 2017 production of at least 500 000 ounces of gold and 2017 total cash cost per ounce within the bottom half of wood mackenzie s cost curve tools excluding state owned and privately owned mines for purposes of determining tier one gold assets total cash cost per ounce is based on data from wood mackenzie as of august 31 2018 except in respect of barrick s mines where barrick may rely on its internal data which is more current and reliable the wood mackenzie calculation of total cash cost per ounce may not be identical to the manner in which barrick calculates comparable measures total cash cost per ounce is a non gaap financial performance measure with no standardized meaning under ifrs and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers total cash cost per ounce should not be considered by investors as an alternative to operating profit net profit attributable to shareholders or to other ifrs measures barrick believes that total cash cost per ounce is a useful indicator for investors and management of a mining company s performance as it provides an indication of a company s profitability and efficiency the trends in cash costs as the company s operations mature and a benchmark of performance to allow for comparison against other companies wood mackenzie is

oficial mixta maría inmaculada filed an action for injunctive relief against alejandro lopez franco mayor of the municipality of zambrano bolívar arguing that her rights to life and education were being threatened the petitioner was elected student representative by her peers at the above mentioned school and in such capacity she sees to it that the rights and duties of her fellow students and teachers are respected and observed petitioner claimed in her complaint i consider that our dignity as humans and the integrity of the institution i belong to and which together with all members of the educational community we have strived to preserve have been stepped on we do not feel safe and we live under the constant strain of knowing that we are serving as human shields for the police headquarters which are located right behind our building and my friends and i often worry that a confrontation could break out during school hours if this happened what would we do therefore osuna montes requested that the judge order the municipal government to move the police headquarters to a new site the evidence contained in the case file includes a document indicating that it is hereby noted that in the toilets and the school playground the windows have no protection the classrooms used by the 1st and 4th grade of the primary level as well as the school s playground are situated immediately adjacent to the street where the police headquarters are located there is a street separating the wall at the rear end of the school compound from the police station and the police inspectorate by 6 50 meters the school occupies a full block three barricades have been set up in the street leading to the police headquarters using bags and barrels filled with sand the first barricade which was built at the corner is at a distance of 3 71 meters from the school wall the other one is in the middle of the street in front of the police inspectorate while the third barricade is located on the other corner on a diagonal line from the school at approximately 3 10 meters documents signed by the which state that 1 reports by the 3rd naval infantry battalion indicate that approximately 300 farc guerrillas were stationed in farms in the area surrounding the municipality of córdoba tetón and that one of their main objectives is to take over the zambrano municipality 2 according to intelligence reports the zambrano police station is one of the military objectives pursued by the caribbean block of the farc made up of fronts 35 and 37 of that guerrilla group statement by the acting headmistress of escuela maría inmaculada in which she states the following we the teachers and parents of the students at escuela maría inmaculada have met with previous city mayors to discuss the fact that school premises were often used to accommodate members of the army when they were sent to our city during the periods when the school was used to house these officers children would not attend classes in early august this year after the guerrilla took over córdoba the day after that it is really dangerous that the school is at such short distance from the police headquarters given the current state of public order children teachers and the institution are at risk because in case god forbid of a takeover by the guerrilla they would be affected in the first place because we are 4 or 5 meters away from the police headquarters question could you specify how you think public order has been disturbed in the municipality of zambrano bolívar answer the day after the guerrilla took over the municipality of córdoba ms maida one of the teachers was at a meeting with the secretary of education and other school headmasters they wanted to suspend classes on august 5 and 6 due to the state of public order while they were at this meeting rumors spread that zambrano had been taken over and this created a climate of chaos some mothers rushed to the school to fetch their children and others were upset because their children had been allowed to go home just a moment before the truth is that the teachers in the morning shift got too scared and desperate when they heard the rumors about the attack in zambrano question is there anything else you would like to add correct or change in this statement answer at present we are finishing the afternoon shift earlier than usual before 6 p m because we are a bit scared and we are always the last to hear about the status of public order statement by the minor who brought the action for injunctive relief i feel that teachers rush the classes and finish earlier than planned because they say that the guerrilla will come to the school i think that both students and teachers are worried because the school is right next to the zambrano police station question tell us if any event lately has made you feel unsafe or worried as a result of your proximity to the police headquarters answer the school has always been right next to the police station and we did not have any problems before but now we are constantly scared because the guerrilla took over córdoba bolívar and there were confrontations with the police the following day we saw police officers from here from zambrano running and riding their motorbikes around the school they were carrying guns and they said that members of the guerrilla were going to enter the school and suddenly all the mothers came to fetch their children in tears frightened by the rumors that the guerrilla would storm the building the streets were full of people and we feared for our lives statement by the head of the educational center who claimed that classes had been disrupted due to the status of public order she said that she had repeatedly requested the city s mayor to stop using the school building to accommodate members of the army but that the mayor had dismissed her requests 3 the rights of children to life personal integrity and to a full and adequate physical and psychological development and education the state s role in preserving those rights the prevalence of the rights of minors constitutional protections and enforcement of international humanitarian law to cope with actual threats to prevailing rights reasonable restrictions on the duty of solidarity the protection of rights requires an enforceable court order this time the court has been asked to establish whether the fundamental rights of these children in particular the rights to life personal integrity to a full and adequate physical and psychological development and the right to education have been violated or threatened by the municipal government s response to repeated requests to move to a new site the police headquarters adjacent to the school that is home to the petitioning minor and her classmates and teachers there is in principle an apparent tension between the fundamental rights of children articles 11 12 44 and 67 of the political constitution of colombia which under the constitution should prevail over the rights of others on the one hand and people s duty to act in accordance with the principle of social solidarity to respect the legitimately constituted authorities in their efforts to maintain national independence and integrity and to strive toward the achievement and maintenance of peace on the other art 95 of the p c the undoubted visible and demonstrated presence of an armed conflict in the area recent events proving that there are constant guerrilla attacks directed primarily against police stations and headquarters other evidence presented by the state s security forces and the testimony to that effect indicate that there is not just a theoretical possibility of risk or fear but an actual and serious threat to the 264 children who every day attend this school which is not just near the police station but right next to it in the case of children even though in principle they must act with solidarity or better still should be educated in the principles of solidarity and the demands of social coexistence it must be established on a case by case basis if given their position of unique vulnerability and defenselessness they have the capacity and the obligation to tolerate all situations or perform all actions that are required from them regardless of their present circumstances and the dangers to their fundamental rights in particular their right to life therefore if we take into account that due to their physical and psychological conditions and their total lack of experience they cannot defend themselves from attacks in the same way as an adult especially attacks as serious as those discussed here one cannot reasonably expect a minor to run the risk of losing his or her life even more so when the risk can be avoided or reduced this is one of the most important responsibilities of society as provided inter alia by article 44 of the constitution the duty of solidarity of minors cannot be interpreted to imply that they should tolerate that the environment where they receive education becomes a battle field and that they get caught in the crossfire if we understand that infants because of their defenseless state are mere victims and cannot be expected to become heroes in the context of armed combat however in this decision and in line with its previous rulings the court has examined in particular the actual evident and undeniable risk faced by the children in this case and has assessed the need to provide effective protection to them based on factual considerations rather than theoretical classifications of what constitutes or not a military target in light of the political constitution 264 children are clearly at a grave risk of death or injury that could be prevented and the existing dangers which have been proven to this court emanate from the guerrilla s unilateral decision not always consistent with academic classifications which may consider as they have done in the past that the police forces a civilian armed body are a military target this factual situation cannot be ignored by the judge hearing the constitutional protection action or by government and police authorities past experiences clearly indicate and this is undeniable that when guerrilla groups launch attacks against municipalities they often and almost invariably target police stations and other public buildings in the first place hence the risk posed by the specific circumstances of this case particularly taking into account many official reports that speak categorically about the possibility of a guerrilla takeover the peculiarity that the school was built immediately next to the police premises and the fact that the school has been used as barracks to house military and police personnel is so serious that it amounts to a threat as defined in article 86 of the constitution and which has been previously examined by this court a threat to a fundamental constitutional right can take many forms it may relate to the specific circumstances in which an individual exercises such right to the existence of positive and unmistakable signs indicating an individual s intention to act in a way that violates the right in question or to a challenge attempted crime that affects the right at issue directly it may also consist of unintentional acts whose characteristics persuade the judge before whom an action for relief has been brought that should he fail to issue an order to enjoin such conduct the right in question would be violated it may likewise be caused by an authority s failure to act which over time could give rise to or enhance a risk and it may also result from the existence of an unconstitutional rule an authorization or an order which if applied would constitute per se a violation or denial of fundamental rights in the latter case article 86 of the constitution mandates that such unconstitutional order or authorization should not apply to the case at issue in accordance with article 4 of the constitution provided that the principle of incompatibility between the two provisions is met constitutional court fifth constitutional review chamber decision t 349 of august 27 1993 in the instant case it should be underscored that on certain occasions police and army officers have stayed overnight in the school premises aggravating in this way the risk to children s health life and integrity as a result an order will be issued to enjoin them from doing so in the future having analyzed all the evidence submitted in the course of the proceedings the court understands that there is a high probability that the zambrano municipality will be taken over by the guerrilla group that operates in that part of the country s territory as can be inferred from intelligence reports therefore there is a real and impending threat to the lives of the local residents particularly those in the proximity of the police station and there is no justification for the fact that those who are closest to the police station are no other than the students of the above mentioned school this is further aggravated by the disruption of the educational process which has caused fear among children and has resulted in high drop out rates as demonstrated by the evidence provided in this respect the court finds that an unreasonable burden has been placed on the students of the school in the municipality of zambrano and that the duty of solidarity which also falls on minors is limited by their capacity to assume such obligation forcing children to occupy a facility which is in immediate proximity to the police station and as a result is highly exposed to attacks that fall under the guerrilla s classification of armed conflict would be a manifestly disproportionate measure which violates the right to equality and threatens the right to life and education also this openly contradicts article 44 of the political constitution which provides that the rights of children have priority over the rights of others it must be emphasized that international humanitarian law requires that children be protected from the horrors of the war it should be recalled that protocol ii to the geneva conventions with a view to protecting civilians and children from attacks encourages the temporary evacuation of children from an area in which hostilities are taking place to a safer area taking into account the special relevance of the fundamental rights of children that the duty of solidarity should reasonably and proportionally meet the limits imposed by prevailing fundamental rights that there are constitutional provisions which expressly protect minors in areas of armed conflict and that it must not be overlooked that one of the main goals of the state is precisely to protect the lives of its members and this is also the paramount and necessary purpose of political organization this court considers it appropriate to require the municipal mayor in collaboration and coordination with the relevant authorities at the departmental and national levels especially the ministries of finance and public credit education and national defense to adopt all necessary budgetary and administrative measures to transfer without delay the educational institution escuela oficial mixta maría inmaculada in the zambrano municipality to an area where the risk is lower or otherwise to move the police headquarters to a different site that is still within the territory of the municipality but where a potential guerrilla attack would not likely result in the horrendous killing of children and given that for practical reasons this judgment may not be executed immediately the court understands that in view of the circumstances of the case and in order to ensure the observance of the fundamental rights at issue it is both viable and necessary to grant temporary injunctive relief to reduce the risk that threatens the lives of these children therefore the court understands that the city s mayor should prevent members of the state security forces from entering the school premises to conduct practices trainings or to mount weapons ammunition or deploy armed personnel as this would increase the danger to the student community also the educational community should be instructed on how to manage an emergency evacuation situation and on the mechanisms to protect the lives of its members in addition this court finds striking that the appellate court has only formally safeguarded the petitioner s rights and has failed to issue a specific order for their protection in this regard it is worth noting that the action for injunctive relief acción de tutela is a protection established to safeguard rights that have been threatened and to guarantee their effectiveness art 2 and that the constitution explicitly states that art 86 the protection will consist of an order enjoining others to act or refrain from acting the lower court s decision is hereby supplemented and the municipal mayor is ordered in collaboration and coordination with the relevant authorities at the departmental and national levels especially the ministries of finance and public credit education and national defense to adopt without delay all necessary budgetary and administrative measures to transfer as soon as possible the educational institution escuela oficial mixta maría inmaculada in the zambrano municipality to an area where the risk is lower or otherwise to move the police headquarters to a different site that is still within the territory of the municipality but where the minors attending the school could be effectively protected in the meantime before the execution of this judgment is completed the mayor shall prevent members of the state s security forces from occupying the premises of the educational institution escuela oficial mixta maría inmaculada and conducting shooting practices or training in the use of firearms ammunition and explosives likewise the educational community shall be instructed on how to manage an emergency evacuation situation as well as on the mechanisms to protect the lives of its members wilson pinzón v the mayor of la calera constitutional court 2001 petitioner files a writ of protection on behalf of his minor son who attends the nursery school jardín infantil departamental la calera he states that this educational institution is situated one block from a police station and a military base of the colombian army the police station is opposite the military base petitioner says that the municipality was taken over by guerrillas on july 19th 1994 when the police station was completely destroyed by an attack with firearms on july 27th 1999 a second guerrilla attack was launched and residents fled with their children to more remote locations in order to avoid danger the following day the petitioner requested the mayor of the municipality to move the police station to a more appropriate and less residential location outside the urban zone the mayor responded to those requests stating that this issue was not under his purview and that securing the lives of individuals was not a responsibility of the municipal government but of the military forces that the property which housed the police station did not belong to the municipality and that no objections had been raised when the police station was relocated in response the petitioner pointed out that public deed no 182 dated march 8th 1996 proved that the police station is located in a property owned by the municipality he added that while residents did not object when the police station was inaugurated in a residential area their opinion was never sought the petitioner also expressed concern over the statements made on television by the farc spokesman raúl reyes who recommended colombian authorities to locate police stations outside the urban areas of municipalities as the members of such organization had been instructed to attack police stations findings of the chamber 2 1 the state has an obligation under the constitution to protect the rights and the lives of individuals description of duties of the police forces article 2 paragraph 1 of the constitution establishes that the essential purpose of the state is to guarantee the effective enjoyment of the rights enshrined therein in turn article 11 provides that the fundamental right to life may not be violated also in its second paragraph article 2 lists the purposes for which authorities have been instituted including in the first place the obligation to protect the lives of individuals in order to achieve those purposes the constituent assembly deemed it necessary to organize a public force art 216 made up by the military and the police the police force is created as a civilian organization within the sphere of the national government its primary purpose is to maintain the conditions necessary for the exercise of rights and freedoms and to ensure that the inhabitants of colombia live in peace however although the constitution conceives the police as a civilian institution with preventive functions as opposed to the military forces in the current socio political situation in colombia characterized by widespread instability and violence this classification does not always portray the reality or allow the police to perform the service it is expected to provide therefore in previous cases the colombian constitutional court has recognized that the police force is in a grey area halfway between the military and the civilian spheres s a result of the current state of affairs of the colombian conflict the police force may not be classified as an entirely civilian institution from a legal standpoint because in certain regions of the country instability has grown to the point that police officers and their workplaces are often chosen as military targets by the guerrillas 2 2 people s solidarity is a necessary condition for an adequate police service clearly in order to live together individuals must fulfill certain social responsibilities this duty of solidarity in terms of the service provided by the police justifies imposing certain burdens on private individuals insofar as the location of police stations is part of a strategic plan to allow authorities to make the most of available resources and provide an effective service for everyone 2 3 limits on the duty of solidarity however the duty of solidarity does not require private individuals to indiscriminately take any risk which could undermine their rights in such case the state would abdicate its role as guarantor of those rights suggesting that no oversight of administrative measures is possible because their purpose is legitimate on the contrary the fact that the state is subject to the rule of law also means that the mechanisms by which it pursues its constitutional goals should be monitored the problem does not lie in determining when the principle of general interest should prevail over any consideration of subjective rights instead the extent of the duty of solidarity should be defined to establish what can be reasonably expected from private individuals when the service provided by the police poses a risk to the population the prevalence of the general interest is not a constitutional rule with a single legal consequence but rather a principle that as such may be taken into consideration the burdens that a government may place on private individuals by virtue of the prevalence of the general interest are enforceable insofar as the private interest infringed is incompatible with the needs of the service even though private individuals must accept certain burdens required for the provision of any public service the state has an obligation to minimize inherent risks so that individuals do not bear an unnecessarily heavy burden this is particularly true in cases where the risk threatens people s lives and physical integrity claiming that life and other rights can be guaranteed by policing alone is not enough those responsible for the administration of the police service should take all necessary actions to minimize the risks involved and at the same time bring the needs of the service more closely in line with a fair distribution of public burdens in all cases even when the needs of the service may not be harmonized with subjective rights or interests burdens should be necessary reasonable and proportionate a burden will be necessary if the measure at issue is required for an appropriate provision of the service of course the government has significant latitude in this regard as it usually has the information and resources to identify the needs for the service and the means available to provide it reasonability should be the defining criterion for weighing the legal interest pursued or protected against the legal interest undermined by the burden needless to say this assessment should be made taking into account the hierarchy established in the constitution the proportionality assessment seeks to guarantee that the burden does not impinge too much on the rights expectations and other interests of those who bear it in other words only the sacrifice that is strictly necessary should be made to achieve the objective the most important aim of international humanitarian law is the protection of civilians in times of conflict based on two fundamental principles the principle of distinction between combatants and civilians and the principle of proportionality with these principles in mind under the current state of affairs in the country the police forces both in practice and in law occupy a grey area halfway between the civilian and the military sectors it is an armed state force involved in counterinsurgency activities and as such its members can be classified as combatants therefore on the understanding that the police are part of the combatant population and that despite the risks to civilians resulting from ongoing attacks against this armed force the state cannot renege on its obligation to fulfill this role we can only conclude that the state must take actions to minimize such risk in other words strictly military operations as well as all other activities conducted by state armed forces should only pose the minimum possible risk to the civilian population on this point article 13 of additional protocol ii to the geneva conventions of 1949 establishes the minimum protection provisions for the civilian population and to guarantee this protection affirms the principle of distinction between civilians and combatants article 13 protection of the civilian population 1 the civilian population and individual civilians shall enjoy general protection against the dangers arising from military operations to give effect to this protection the following rules shall be observed in all circumstances 2 the civilian population as such as well as individual civilians shall not be the object of attack acts or threats of violence the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population are prohibited 3 civilians shall enjoy the protection afforded by this part unless and for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities as part of the protection of civilians against the dangers arising from military operations covered under subsection 1 of this article the state should take specific measures to guarantee that the risk posed to civilians is the minimum necessary to ensure an effective performance by the police forces the notions of efficiency and risk are variables that should be assessed based on the second principle that we mentioned the principle of proportionality taking into account such principle the need to establish police stations in accessible locations from where services can be provided to the whole population should not entail an excessive risk for those who live in the vicinity 2 7 concluding observations with the above considerations in mind we can conclude that in these cases the admissibility of actions is conditioned on a sufficient showing that the threat represents an imminent risk to the life and personal integrity of an individual or group because of the current scale of historic guerilla attacks in a certain geographical location and the specific circumstances of the person requesting the injunction however failure to establish the existence or imminent occurrence of a risk within the term of the action does not mean that the risk is not real even when the judge acts with the utmost diligence and performs all necessary tests to establish the seriousness of the risk the constitutional term may turn out to be insufficient as the analysis of all elements involved can often exceed the investigative capacity of the judge and therefore impinge on their capacity to offer protection however administrative authorities and in particular entities responsible for intelligence activities and safeguarding the security of individuals have the necessary means and infrastructure to establish whether a guerrilla attack is imminent and the degree of exposure of those who live in the vicinity of police stations irrespective of the admissibility or inadmissibility of the action executive authorities should assess these risk situations in many of the country s municipalities and take such measures as may be necessary to minimize the threat only efficient and sufficient planning prevention and correction efforts can guarantee the effective enjoyment of the rights to life and personal integrity in the context of a climate of widespread violence that pervades many parts of the country in such cases the prompt and responsive actions of the judge would be inadequate to deal with the scope and nature of the issue of insecurity 3 the case in question in the proceedings before this court the guerrillas have launched attacks against police stations which left several police officers and civilians injured and caused significant structural damage in addition according to the report by the ministry of defense both municipalities are of strategic interest to the guerrillas and there is presence of several farc fronts or blocs this situation was further compounded by the statements that one guerrilla commander made on television claiming that police stations were targets of guerrilla attacks and should be relocated these events underscore that at present police stations in la calera are potential targets of farc attacks and the means by which such attacks are carried out pose a significant risk to the buildings and the lives and personal integrity of the population in the vicinity taking into consideration the particular circumstances of the petitioners seeking protection this differential analysis rests on a question of fact i e the defenselessness of minors in nursery schools and a question of constitutional law resulting from the prevalence of the rights of children over those of other people the prevalence of the rights of children also means in turn that the legal interest to be protected by sacrificing these rights should be of a superior constitutional value only then can protection be denied at the same time to the extent that the threat does not pose an imminent risk to the life or physical integrity of the children whose protection is sought by the action the decision to grant protection may not be grounded in the prevalence of those rights he evacuation and in general the effective protection of approximately 330 minors who attend the two nursery schools in the area near the police station in the municipality of la calera will not be possible in the event of an attack even if appropriate preventive measures are taken to conduct an evacuation or safeguard the children the headmasters of the institution do not have the necessary tools to protect their lives and minors are under no obligation to bear the burden of such a great risk to the extent that a group of minors in a school or nursery are not capable of coping with the risk of a guerrilla attack and considering also that the professors and headmasters have no means to protect them either the probability of a guerrilla attack represents an imminent threat to the defenseless children who attend a nursery located near a police station in addition because the rights of children are involved and these rights have prevalence over the rights of other people the level of protection should be greater article 44 of the constitution recognizes the duty of the state to provide special protection to children from all forms of physical violence in this way public administration can only be released from the obligation to provide special protection when it can prove conclusively that such protection may compromise a legal interest of higher constitutional value than the rights of children for the reasons stated this court affirms the decisions rendered on september 12 2000 which granted the protection requested order from commander general of the military forces 2010 considering international humanitarian law norms it is considered a clear violation of the principle of distinction and the principle of precaution in attacks and therefore a serious fault the fact that a commander occupies or allows the occupation by his troops of a good of private nature or of public use such as the housing where the civilian population lives and public institutions such as education establishments communal rooms which causes an imminent risk to minors protection this affects in a sensible manner the way in which minors rights are granted and respected the general command of the armed forces and the military commanders have repeated on various occasions through different directives the prohibition of the occupation of the buildings mentioned above warning about the serious danger that teachers and children may face who go daily to exercise their right to education for this reason commanders at all levels are responsible for the application of issued orders and instructions and the control of the actions taken by their subordinates since the use of civilian and public property has historically triggered other accusations against troops such as forced displacement theft indiscriminate attacks and both physical and verbal abuse against minors who are subject to special protection against such accusations it is required to undertake disciplinary investigations where possible and to carry out monitoring in order to avoid a repetition of the behavior in operation areas côte d ivoire child protection training module 2017 the armed forces of côte d ivoire have integrated modules on the rights and protection of children into trainings provided in military schools academies and training centers the training now includes a specific module on prohibiting occupation of schools and training institutions the training is established in the four military regions of côte d ivoire and provided by a child protection cell which is staffed with trained military personnel croatia science and higher education act 2003 article 55

the necessary protection education and care for children affected by armed conflict tensions or civil unrest this provision also applies to the child displaced as a result of a natural disaster or a

criminal and disciplinary sanctions recruitment and use of children attacks against schools requisition of schools for military purposes destruction of school facilities denmark military manual 2016 the protection of children and youth also implies a certain respect for the right of children to education etc even in areas of conflict it is necessary therefore to exercise restraint with respect to the military use of children s institutions including day care facilities schools and orphanages this also applies in situations in which the international legal basis including allows for the evacuation of such institutions for use by international military forces the principle of distinction is not merely a requirement to distinguish between military objectives and civilian objects when conducting an attack the principle is also intended to ensure that the parties to the conflict help facilitate the distinction for the adversary against this background parties to the conflict must endeavour to remove civilians and civilian objects from the vicinity of military objectives and take other precautions to protect the civilian population against the dangers resulting from military operations the rules are designed to provide a framework for armed conflicts in international law which to the extent feasible spares the civilian population and civilian objects including schools and hospitals and which contributes to maintaining the basis for the continuation of civil society in the states that are parties to the conflict also after the conflict has ended in this context restraint should be exercised in using schools and other educational institutions in support of danish military operations the reason for such special consideration of schools etc is that the military use of schools has severe consequences not only in that it immediately endangers the lives of children and youths who are present in and near such schools but also in regard to the longer term consequences for the education of school children the locating of military objectives among the civilian population does not deprive the population of its civilian character and protection but it may violate the obligations under customary international law to avoid locating military objectives in or near densely populated areas of the locating of civilians at military objectives in 2012 syrian

police is being evacuated from the present camping ground and that this affect the law and order situation this is not so by all means let the police force even be increased to double strength no one has any objection to this but what is being complained of is that the police has occupied the building of the school with the result that the children are not being sent to school where the police has occupied the classrooms this is depriving the children of education the correct perspective would be that the police may remain within the district but the schools should not be closed for the reason that the classrooms have been converted into barracks why should this happen this is depriving a generation and a class of children from education to which they have a right paschim medinipur bhumij kalyan samiti v west bengal high court at calcutta 2009 mr roy the learned advocate general appearing on behalf of the state respondents informs this court that in fact 22 schools in the district of west midnapore were requisitioned for the purpose of accommodating the police forces deployed there to cope with the abnormal situation prevailing mr roy further submits that out of 22 schools the possessions of 10 schools have already been returned to the school authorities and other two schools namely goaltore boys high school and goaltore girls school will be vacated within 2nd december 2009 in such circumstances we dispose of this writ application by directing the state respondents to deliver back the possession of the 10 remaining schools positively within 30th december 2009 he cost of consumption of the electricity in those schools by the police personnel will be borne out by the state government in no time it is needless to mention that the mid day meal should immediately start in those schools where the possession has already been handed over to the school authorities and in respect of other schools it should resume immediately after the handing over of possession of those schools national commission for protection of child rights protection of children s rights in areas of civil unrest 2010 schools should never be used as temporary shelters by security forces the is of the view that use of schools by police or security forces violates the spirit and letter of the act 2009 because it actively disrupts access to education and makes schools vulnerable to attacks the home ministry should ensure that its directives against this are implemented district magistrates must never offer schools to police and security personnel and must enquire promptly into complaints that they are being used in this way the army or police personnel in their turn must not use schools to set up camps or checkpoints on the contrary they should be directed to actively protect educational facilities exploitation of children in orphanages v india supreme court of india 2010 2011 the deputy commissioner of n c hills should ensure that the schools hostels and children home complex presently occupied by the armed security forces are vacated within a month s time and it should be ensured that the school buildings and hostels are not allowed to be occupied by the armed or security forces in future for whatsoever purpose the ministry of h r d government of india is directed to submit a list of schools and hostels district wise collected from the state governments union of territories administrations which are currently occupied by the armed security forces in the north eastern states duly indicating the date from which or duration for which such schools and hostels have been occupied by the security forces the ministry of home affairs is directed to ensure that the paramilitary forces vacate the school and hostel buildings occupied by them and submit an action taken report to this court as well as ncpc within two months from today the ministry shall file a proper affidavit in this matter on the next date of hearing of this writ petition state of jharkhand so far as the state of jharkhand is concerned it is admitted that out of a total number of 47 locations where security forces have been housed in schools and hostels only 26 of them have been vacated by the security forces rest of them still continue to be in occupation of the security forces in the circumstances there shall be a direction directing the state of jharkhand to forthwith take appropriate steps and vacate the security forces from the school buildings hostels etc within two months from today the state of jharkhand is directed to file its compliance report the state of jharkhand is further directed to submit a detailed affidavit as to whether those buildings stated to have been vacated by the security forces have already been handed over to the concerned department and whether the schools are actually being run in those buildings there shall be a similar direction for all the states where the school buildings hostels etc were under the occupation of security forces state of tripura so far as the state of tripura is concerned it is admitted that still 16 school buildings hostels etc continue to be under the occupation of the security forces and the state requires six months further time to vacate them we are not inclined to grant time as prayed for by the state there shall be a similar direction directing the state of tripura to vacate the security forces from the school buildings hostels etc in their occupation within two months from today the state government shall file the compliance report nandini sundar v chhattisgarh supreme court of india 2011 so far as the school buildings educational institutions and hostels occupied by the security forces in the state of chhattisgarh is concerned it is stated that effective steps are being taken for vacating those buildings and the process had already begun there shall be a direction to the union of india and the state of chhattisgarh to ensure that the security forces vacate all the educational institutions school buildings and hostels within a period of four months from today there shall be an order accordingly it is necessary to note here that this court had to intercede and order the government of chhattisgarh to get the security forces to vacate the schools and hostels that they had occupied and even after such orders many schools and hostels still remain in the possession and occupancy of the security forces such is the degree of degeneration of life and society facts speak for themselves i the issue of schools and hostels in various districts of chhattisgarh being occupied by various security forces in a manner that precludes the proper education of students of such schools with respect to the issue of the schools and hostels occupied by the security forces it may be noted that the state of chhattisgarh had categorically denied that any schools hospitals ashrams and anganwadis were continuing to be occupied by security forces and in fact all such facilities had been vacated however during the course of the hearings before this bench it has turned out that the facts asserted in the earlier affidavit were erroneous and that in fact a large number of schools had continued to be occupied by security forces it was only upon the intervention and directions of this court did the state of chhattisgarh begin the process of releasing the schools and hostels from the occupation by the security forces that process is in fact still on going we express our reservations at the manner in which the state of chhattisgarh has conducted itself in the instant proceedings before us it was because of the earlier submissions made to this court that schools hospitals ashrams and anganwadis have already been vacated this court had passed earlier orders with respect to other aspects of the recommendations of the nhrc and did not address itself to the issue of occupancy by security forces of such infrastructure and public facilities that are necessary and vital for public welfare a separate affidavit has been filed by the state of chhattisgarh seeking an extension of time to comply with the directions of this court this is because a large number of schools and hostels still continue to be occupied by the security forces we will deal with the said matter separately a second interlocutory application has also been filed on behalf of the state of chhattisgarh for extension of time to vacate the school buildings educational institutions and hostels occupied by the security forces in chhattisgarh upon hearing learned counsel for the respective parties we also allow the same the state of chhattisgarh is given a further period of two months to vacate the said premises while extending the period we also make it clear that no further extension of time should be prayed for on behalf of the state of chhattisgarh for the aforesaid purpose iraq ezidkhan protection forces commitment to respect humanitarian norms 2018 we commit to the following

might change its status from civilian to military or vice versa for example if an anti aircraft battery is positioned on the roof of a school or if a sniper takes up a position on the minaret of a mosque the protection provided for the facility by the virtue of it being civilian target is no longer valid and the attacker is permitted to attack it the legal responsibility for the deaths of civilians in such a case is that of the side that made unreasonable use of a civilian target rather than on the side who attacked this target in the case of incidents in which there is a doubt as to whether the target changed its status from civilian to military the additional protocols determine that it should be assumed that it is not a military target unless proven otherwise

the results of the european elections the brexit trajectory after may s resignation and the continuation of us chinese trade tensions are all likely to support stronger gains for gold and stabilize prices at around 1 287 an ounce at the time of writing the analysis with gains for the third day in a row the abandonment of the us dollar slightly gave the price of an ounce of gold the opportunity to move higher and after losses pushed the price of the metal to move towards the support level of 1269 an ounce the recent downward movement in the price of the ounce of gold was confirmed after the announcement of the us federal reserve meeting s minutes which confirmed the desire of some bank members to raise the us interest rate which supported the gains of the us dollar and will not strengthen the upward correction without testing the psychological peak at 1300 and getting established on top of that the us dollar was second only to the japanese yen in gaining as a safe haven as the us china trade war recently intensified in general the absence of a final and formal agreement that ends the trade dispute between the united states and china will continue to be a factor contributing to stronger gold price gains and establishing above the psychological peak of 1 300 will increase purchases and test stronger bullish levels trump s recent comments which bear the prospect of reconciling with china after raising tariffs on their products have eased investors concerns and have contributed to a halt in gold price gains the federal reserve board kept the interest rate unchanged as expected and indicated it was unlikely to raise or lower interest rates in the coming months amid signs of renewed economic health while at the same time inflation was still unusually low the bank s policy statement highlighted its continued failure to raise the annual inflation rate to at least 2 the statement may have raised expectations that a change in the next fed interest rate is a rate cut to stimulate inflation or growth technically if gold prices stabilized today below 1300 it will increase the bearish momentum and the nearest support levels will be 1273 1265 and 1258 respectively which support the strength of the bearish trend while at the same time levels can be bought for close targets on the upside the nearest levels of gold resistance are currently 1286 1300 and 1312 respectively we still prefer to buy gold from every bearish bounce in terms of economic data the yellow metal will all focus on the us dollar level gold will also be affected by investors risk appetite gold is one of the most important safe havens

says its managing director people do not need banks but they need banking microsoft founder bill gates said 30 years ago and it appears he was on to something seeing the latest innovations in financial services for instance many banking needs can be met from one s mobile phone people no longer need to make the journey to a bank branch for them apple has launched a credit card with goldman sachs two months ago and facebook is proposing a payments service to let users buy tickets and settle bills also technology and e commerce giants like alibaba and tencent have moved into the financial services space as they seek to strengthen their customer centric propositions and services though late local city bank a 36 year old lender has taken to this new wave of digital transformation with gusto young adults and millennials are least interested in the traditional branch led banking model they are more comfortable with banking from their smartphones we want to be largely a virtual bank in three years even marginal people residing in a remote place should get banking services through qr code point of sales terminals and biometric devices mashrur arefin managing director and chief executive officer of city bank told the daily star in an interview recently city has a plan to become a digital bank that will operate online with no addition of physical branches it also wants to run its lending programme through digital financial services dfs which will subsequently decrease operational costs regulatory support will be required from both the central bank and the government as the traditional kyc know your client will have to be changed to implement the dfs model we have already approached the regulator for the required support to roll out the service we want to be a bank of the people and for that we must go for digital expansion city has already introduced a small and micro finance division seven months ago as part of its plan to restructure its balance sheet to balance the reliance with corporate and other traditional lending products at present corporates account for two thirds of its current loan exposure so far the small and micro finance banking division has given out tk 630 crore in loans to 5 500 clients with an average lending size of tk 7 lakh the bank has gone to 40 new districts to distribute the loans which were earlier untapped for the lender said arefin who joined city 12 years ago and was promoted to the bank s top post in january a bank with nearly four decades of existence cannot survive with just 16 lakh customers in a country that has over 16 crore population he said adding that city should have 2 crore clients by now but that will not happen easily unless the banks build a collaboration with payments service providers and telecommunications companies said arefin who previously worked in a number of foreign and local banks including anz grindlays standard chartered american express citibank and eastern bank subsequently he urged bangladesh bank to broker such inter industry collaboration agent banking will be another major focus of city to mobilise low cost deposits and disburse small loans to remote areas of the country about tk 1 5 lakh crore still remains outside the banking sector as per arefin s estimates international finance corporation the world bank group s private sector arm holds a 5 percent stake in city and has been giving all out support to materialise the bank s ambitions to reach out to the unbanked population by way of the dfs model some 15 consultants of the ifc are now working with the management of the bank to create new financial products and ideas he said recently the bank has launched city alo a product for women with a tagline coffee conversation banking which also aims at millennials as a specific new segment arefin also touched upon a number of issues confronting the banking sector ranging from banks default loans to liquidity crisis high operating expenses inefficiency and rising deposit costs bad debt is one of major problems for the banks as the default loans would be nearly 15 percent of the total outstanding loans if written off figure is taken into account he said the banking sector s non performing loans reached tk 93 370 crore and written off loans about tk 40 000 crore at the end of december last year banks should take prompt measures to bring down their npls as it has a major role behind the ongoing liquidity crunch in the banking sector arefin said the banks facing liquidity crisis have to count high interest to enjoy interbank funds in the absence of a vibrant call money market all the banks together are facing a liquidity shortfall of about tk 3 000 crore he noted at the time of this interview which by now has seen certain improvement the interest rate on the call money market ranges from 4 50 to 5 percent but the banks that enjoy strong liquidity base are now reluctant to provide funds through this overnight money market arefin also talked about the cash strapped banks which are now forced to take funds from others in the form of placement that comes with interest rates of 8 12 percent he said repo repurchase agreement is the only option for banks to get funds cheaply from the central bank but the interest rate on the tool is now 6 percent again much higher than the call money rate besides deposit from the government agencies has not been distributed to all lenders evenly he said so all these factors are contributing to a higher interest rate on lending the interest rates on the government s savings scheme should be in line with other interest rates he said arefin also pointed out that the cost income ratio of banks which is now more than 50 percent is not viable and sustainable banks should decrease their cost income ratio to 40 45 percent to make their businesses sustainable arefin said as part of its efforts to lower its cost income ratio city has planned to run branches and manage manpower very judiciously also the bank will go for low cost deposits such as current and savings accounts he said the banker feels that bangladesh is going through a lot of trading activities instead of industrial activities pushing the exchange rate and foreign currency reserves to a perilous position political stability is there now it is our responsibility to help ongoing and emerging businesses in the country a career banker arefin is also a successful writer recently his first novel august abchaya has hit the market and has gone on to become a bestseller he has also translated stories of franz kafka and homer s iliad in bangla

gbp cad forecast update 3 after a wobbly start to the session the pound to canadian dollar exchange rate climbed as a risk averse market tone weighed on the loonie offsetting brexit related concerns at the time of writing sterling was last seen trading at ca 1 70785 up 0 19 from the daily open in the fx space the usd is narrowly mixed but intraday but trends suggest a risk off undertone with the jpy out performing and the cad under performing wrote scotiabank s chief fx strateigst shaun osborne adding the market tone is dominating however the outlook for relative central bank policy remains supportive and we remain cad bulls into wednesday s boc policy decision and thursday s economic progress report speech from boc sr dep gov wilkins the bank of canada s may monetary policy review and subsequent rate statement and rate decision are due wednesday 1500 gmt while the boc lagged the fed in calling time on further rate hikes in contrast to the fed the boc have retained a tightening bias any shift towards a more dovish stance will likely weigh on the cad while the reaffirmation of a tightening bias will likely lend the loonie support meanwhile the gbp s gains in the cross were by and large the exceptions with the uk muted versus the majority of major peers as speculation swirled around who will succeed theresa may as prime minister given the strong turnout for the brexit party in european elections analysts are in consensus that the most likely candidate to take the tory leadership will be of the hard line breixteer camp as it stands boris johnson and jeremy hunt are the current favourites according to bookmaker odds and conservativehome respectively we think the election results which saw conservative voters defect to the brexit party en masse makes it likely that leadership pm hopefuls will have to adopt a hard line on the brexit issue to win support of the party members wrote scotiabank s osborne adding sterling seems set for a bumpy ride in the next few weeks gbp cad update the uk pound remained subdued against the canadian dollar into tuesday s session with sterling last seen trading at ca 1 70339 marginally down from the session open monday saw gbp cad downside continue as market relief following may s decision to resign was replaced with concerns over who will succeed her as pm and the implications thereof on brexit with a eurosceptic the most likely candidate to take the helm markets are bracing for higher perceived no deal brexit odds advertisement tuesday holds little in the way of key data releases but with brexit chaos continuing news headlines will continue to provide directional cues wednesday will see the bank of canada s boc latest policy releases with scotiabank analysts predicting a mildly hawkish hold from policymakers while the boc tends to lag the fed a break from the trend with boc policymakers failing to follow their us counterparts deeper into dove territory could provide some extra support for the already best performing g 10 currency in the year to date gbp cad update reversing early session gains the british pound to canadian dollar exchange rate fell on monday with sterling last seen trading at ca 1 70271 down 0 33 the move lower comes as persistent brexit uncertainty continues to occlude the economic outlook for the uk most recently the decision by pm may to resign under considerable pressure has left potential successors scrambling to succeed her as it stands the bookie and party favourite appears to be prominent brexiter boris johnson while a stronger leader should be able to break the brexit impasse given the likelihood of a euro sceptic prime minister taking the reigns the chances of a no deal brexit are also higher meanwhile for the loonie oil prices fell towards the end of last week as officials from us and china continued to stoke the flames of trade uncertainty with brent bcousd falling below and failing to retake the 70 per barrel level and dragging the cad with it moving forward brexit is likely to remain the key driver for the cross with data taking a back seat nevertheless tuesday s inflation report hearings could hold some potential to impact markets with bank of

markets respond favourably on renewed hopes of a break in the political deadlock between the two major parties as news of the new and improved brexit deal settled in however mps became increasingly critical of its new aspect saying that the withdrawal bill would not succeed through parliament clipping some of the pound s gains philip hammond the chancellor of the exchequer warned of a contingency of hard brexiteers who were attempting to hijack the referendum for their own ends leaving some sterling traders feeling jittery jeremy corbyn showed increasing resistance against may s new deal saying we won t back a repackaged version of the same old deal and it s clear that this weak and disintegrating government is unable deliver on its own commitments friday saw the announcement of theresa may s official resignation as conservative party leader as of 7 june which provided some relief for sterling as the brexit deadlock was challenged by the opportunity of a new leader nevertheless this was quickly followed by heightened political uncertainty relating to both the leadership role and the future plans for brexit which had now been essentially dashed with may s earlier than expected resignation cad gbp exchange rate loonie eases as us canada trade relations improve the canadian dollar began the week steadily with monday being a bank holiday in canada for victoria day monday nevertheless saw canada lift its retaliatory tariffs on us goods following trump s steel trade war canadian finance minister bill morneau commented the removal of tariffs and countermeasures is a true win win for everyone involved and great news for canadian and american workers for our communities and our economies however by wednesday the loonie was provided some uplift on some encouraging retail sales figures for march which rose to 1 1 against the consensus of 1 0 the retail sales excluding auto sales also rose above forecast to 1 7 cad however had many of its gains cut by ongoing us china trade tensions and with the canadian economy particularly reliant on global trade this left many loonie traders remaining cautious throughout the week thursday meanwhile saw the publication of the canadian wholesale sales figures for march which shot up above the forecast 0 9 to 1 4 providing some relief for the struggling canadian economy gbp cad outlook brexit leadership to remain in focus monday will see uk markets closed for the spring bank holiday tuesday meanwhile will see the uk inflation report hearings and with any dovish comments about the economy this could see the gbp cad exchange rate sink wednesday will see the bank of canada s interest rate decision which is due to remain static at 1 75 these will be followed by the canadian current

london it was a stark warning about the risks ahead for the global economy even by the forthright standards of the boss of the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd the world economy is in a dangerous place angel gurria said as the oecd announced its latest lower forecasts for growth on may 21 the source of his worry the mounting trade tensions between the united states and china which could hit the rest of the world much harder than they have to date let s avoid complacency at all costs mr gurria said clearly the biggest threat is through the escalation of trade restriction measures and this is happening as we speak this clear and present danger could easily have knock on effects with much of the world economy still recovering from the after effects of the global financial crisis a decade ago us president donald trump caused alarm when he raised tariffs on 200 billion worth of goods from china on may 10 prompting beijing to say it would hit back with its own higher duties trade tensions are the main reason that growth in the global economy will weaken to 3 2 percent this year the slowest pace in three years and down from rates of about 5 percent before the financial crisis a decade ago the oecd said the world economy is expected to pick up slowly next year but only if washington and china drop their latest tariff moves the impact could be a lot more severe if mr trump follows through on his latest threat to hit a further 300 billion of chinese imports with tariffs and china retaliates again that kind of tariff escalation plus the associated rise in uncertainty about a broadening of the trade war could lop about 0 7 off the world economy by 2021 2022 oecd said that would be equivalent to about 600 billion or the loss of the economy of argentina but the knock on effects might not stop there a full blown trade war combined with an ensuing debt crisis in china and a shift away from exports to drive its economy could cause a two percent hit to china s economy in turn knocking global growth further the oecd said to be sure that kind of worst case scenario may well be averted given the stakes for the united states and china mr trump and chinese president xi jinping are due to meet at a group of 20 leaders summit in japan on june 28 29 other g20 nations will be urging them to step back from the fight chief among them germany and japan two export power houses which have much to lose from a long trade war for now the effect of the trade tensions is being felt mostly among manufacturers by contrast consumers buoyed by low unemployment and weak inflation in many of the world s rich economies have shown little sign of alarm at the row between washington and beijing but over the longer term a protracted trade war is likely to drag down the consumer economy too global trade should normally grow at double the pace of the world economy but is expected to lag it in 2019 boding ill for investment by companies the oecd said that investment would normally drive productivity growth which is key for long term prosperity and is urgently needed living standards for many workers in rich countries remain lower than before the financial crisis of 2008 09 the frustration with lower living standards is widely seen as one of the main factors behind the rise of populist politics including trump s presidential election victory in 2016 to put it bluntly this cannot be the new normal said laurence boone the oecd s chief economist we cannot accept an economy that doesn t raise people s living standards reuters
