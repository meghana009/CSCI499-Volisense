clash of cultures investment vs speculation investor business magnate philanthropist founder ceo vanguard group 1929 2019 no amount of observations of white swans can allow the inference that all swans are white but the observation of a single black swan is sufficient to refute that conclusion david hume scottish enlightment philosopher historian economist and essayist 1711 1776 first it is an outlier as it lies outside the realm of regular expectations because nothing in the past can convincingly point to its possibility nassim nicholas taleb the black swan the impact of the highly improbable essayist scholar statistician former trader risk analyst b 1960 black swans attributing sudden and often catastrophic events to such a beautiful bird seems grossly unfair but panics manias crashes and collapses are like a thunderstorm on a sunny summer afternoon they are unpredictable and usually have severe and widespread consequences yet we largely ignore their possibility but they happen with frequency just because we haven t had a big one recently doesn t mean that one couldn t hit us at any time it is nearly impossible to list all of the black swan events that have taken place in history but they date back to ancient times and include both natural and financial disasters some change the course of history and set the course for eventual financial economic and societal collapse think of the arrival of the europeans in north and south america starting in the 16th century over two centuries later the native populations of north and south america had been decimated by 90 and their societies were either gone completely or subjugated by the europeans even into the 20th century the europeans continued to subjugate the native populations from a financial standpoint a few black swan events stand out in ancient times with one in particular having far reaching consequences in 64 ad the emperor nero debased gold silver and copper coinage this acted as an indirect tax on roman savers sparking inflation and contributing to the impoverishment of many particularly in the lower classes what is important here is that the devaluation tactic was used repeatedly by other roman emperors over the next three centuries leading to the decline and collapse of the roman empire nero s debasement of roman coinage was not expected but such was the power of emperors in the roman empire debasement of money is a theme that has played itself out time and time again the chinese were the first to use paper money dating back to the tang dynasty 618 907 ad but looking back it was probably no surprise that the ability to print money led to hyperinflation over a long period of time and through many chinese dynasties by 1455 the chinese stopped using paper money but by then it was too late china retreated into a long period of isolation that left them weak and vulnerable with the arrival of the europeans that got underway in the 16th century and peaked in the 19th century the modern world has seen its share of black swans on the theme of debasement of money the closing of the gold window and the uncoupling of gold to the u s dollar in august 1971 by president richard nixon would have to be considered a black swan event it led to the debasement of the u s dollar and set in motion a money and credit explosion that continues today as well the former regime of generally fixed rates for currencies centered around gold and the u s dollar saw currencies set to float around the u s dollar as the world s reserve currency nixon as nero since 1971 u s debt levels have grown from 1 8 trillion in 1971 to over 73 trillion today a gain of roughly 3 950 to put that in perspective the dji has gone up before reinvestment of dividends roughly 2 750 gold on the other hand has increased by over 3 600 monetary and credit growth since 1971 has been unprecedented since august 1971 the financial world has been shaken by a series of financial crisis most of which could be considered as black swan events although some would be what one would call a grey swan event each crisis has been more severe then the previous one think of them as a series of financial earthquakes of varying size as with nero s decision to debase the currency of the day nixon s decision to debase the u s dollar by ending its connection with gold lingers with us today the full effects of this decision remain to be seen after all it took another four hundred years to complete the collapse of the roman empire after nero s reign the roman empire went through a series of civil wars before the emperor vespasian restored order the roman empire s period of pax romana lasted roughly from the reign of augustus 27 ce to marcus aurelius 180 ad after that the empire degenerated into a series of civil wars ever changing emperors currency debasement and wars on the frontier that continued to the end there were sporadic periods of stability however financial stability never returned we have identified 17 financial crises of consequence that have occurred since 1971 the financial crisis of 1973 1974 technically this one was triggered by another black swan event the oil crisis of 1973 one could also say it was augmented by the political crisis with the collapse of the nixon presidency the oil crisis had not only short term effects on global politics and the global economy but it has had many long term effects as well the dow jones industrials dji fell 45 from january 1973 to december 1974 the latin american debt crisis of 1982 as the world economy slipped into recession in the early 1980s as a result of high inflation latin american countries such as mexico argentina and brazil were unable to pay back their debts they had gorged on debt in the 1970s and the world s international banks were only too happy to lend to them as the crisis deepened their currencies collapsed and the interest required to service their debt largely denominated in u s dollars soared it took years to sort out the collapse and the effects lingered in the latin american countries for years after while the stock market suffered the decline was not as steep as the one seen in 1973 1974 the final low was made in august 1982 on an inflation adjusted basis however the stock market had fallen almost 73 from its 1966 high before making its final bottom in august 1982 the savings and loans crisis of the late 1980s thanks to deregulation savings and loans institutions went on a lending spree trouble was they lent long and funded short as interest rates rose many became insolvent accounting gimmickry as a result of deregulation often helped hide the growing collapse but what was really going on was a huge ponzi like scheme in the end some 700 savings and loans companies collapsed and a global recession followed in the early 1990s the junk bond crash of 1989 the financing of takeover deals and mergers in the late 1980s led to the issuance of billions of dollars of junk bonds to finance the deals the collapse of the 6 75 billion ual takeover in 1989 was considered a key trigger in the collapse of the market the junk bond collapse left a path of destruction leading to the bankruptcy of drexel burnham lambert a large investment dealer drexel was the lehman brothers of its day the collapse also contributed to the recession of the early 1990s once again the fed was required to flood the financial system with liquidity to prevent a wider collapse the stock market crash of october 1987 a true black swan event the dow jones industrials dji fell 508 points or 23 program trading had become an in thing helping to exacerbate the crash the event led to the introduction of circuit breakers and also set in motion the fed flooding the financial system with liquidity to prevent a potentially bigger collapse while the event itself was short lived and by the early 1990s the stock market was on its way to record highs the effects of the crash lingered for years the japanese financial crisis of 1991 the japanese stock market and real estate bubble of the 1980s burst in 1991 as the boj hiked interest rates to quell the speculation the result was a collapse in the japanese real estate market as prices fell as much as 60 and a collapse in the stock market that eventually took it down 80 by 2003 the stock market and real estate collapse sparked a financial crisis as banks became technically bankrupt while the japanese government kept them artificially alive giving rise to the phrase zombie banks the result was a prolonged economic recession that became known as japan s lost decade the effects linger today despite years of the boj keeping interest rates artificially low and the injection of huge amounts of liquidity into the financial system the stock market remains down 45 from its 1991 peak the mexican peso crisis of 1994 this was also known as the tequila crisis the crisis was triggered by president ernesto zedillo reversing a policy of tight currency controls that had been in place it was exacerbated by the lending of huge amounts of money at below market rates to spur economic growth a rebellion in the southern state of chiapas helped push the mexican peso into a free fall losing 50 in a week the u s government had to step in with a 50 billion loan but the impact was felt across latin america as bond yields soared and debt defaults grew once again the fed had to step in to prevent a wider crisis as the collapse threatened u s and other global markets as well the stock market languished throughout 1994 but there was no major collapse the asian financial crisis of 1997 and 1998 it all started with the collapse of the thai bhat in july 1997 like the latin american debt crisis of the 1980s thailand and other asian tigers had overextended themselves in foreign loans that they couldn t pay as their currencies crashed the crisis soon spread to south korea hong kong indonesia laos and malaysia this one required a bail out by the imf a year later the crisis repeated itself only this time it was led by russia it led to the collapse of long term capital management ltcm a large hedge fund led by john meriwether and featuring myron scholes of black scholes fame the collapse of ltcm not only sparked a mini stock market crash but the fed once again had to come to the rescue to prevent a meltdown of the financial system ltcm s ties into the financial world were huge and its collapse could have triggered more collapses between the two collapses international indices suffered far more than those in the u s and canada with some falling 60 or more the bursting of the dot com bubble in 2000 2002 technology and internet stocks soared in the late 1990s on a wave of easy money provided by the fed from the 1998 crisis people became millionaires overnight and obscure technology companies soared to unheard of levels the fact that hardly any of them made money was beside the point but the bubble burst as all bubbles do and the collapse was a spectacular as the rise the nasdaq fell 78 by 2002 almost equalling the collapse of the dji in 1929 1932 when it fell 89 many companies went bust and disappeared names like pets com and boo com may have been the esoteric names that went bust but it was the big companies such as worldcom global crossing nortel networks and enron that became synonymous with the collapse 9 11 this was a true black swan event as planes hit the twin towers of new york s world trade center and later the pentagon on the morning of september 11 2001 it triggered a shutdown of the stock exchanges when they opened they were down by only about 12 but an estimated 1 4 trillion was wiped out in the five days the exchanges were closed its lasting effect was the triggering of ongoing wars in afghanistan iraq libya syria and elsewhere these wars have cost the u s an estimated 2 5 trillion an amount that is still growing the 9 11 event also left failed states in its wake the global financial crisis of 2007 2009 as with other crises the fed and central banks around the world flooded the financial system with liquidity and lowered interest rates after the dot com collapse this helped trigger the housing bubble the crisis started with the bursting of the sub prime mortgage market and the collapse of a couple of hedge funds at ny investment dealer bear stearns it eventually led to one of the biggest collapses in history when ny investment dealer lehman brothers collapsed in september 2008 throwing 25 000 out of work lehman brothers was saddled with 619 billion in debt stock markets globally collapsed and the fed and other central banks were forced again to come to the rescue with the greatest bail out in history the stock market collapse was the worst seen since the great depression wiping over 10 trillion out of global equity markets the dji fell 55 the collapse was so severe that without the help of the fed and u s treasury along with the boe the boj and the ecb rescue packages the global financial system could have collapsed interest rates were reduced to zero and eventually in the eurozone and japan sub zero housing markets collapsed not only in the u s but in a number of other countries as well the effects of the 2008 financial collapse linger with us today in the end its causes were not fully addressed thus setting the stage for another financial crisis at some point the european sovereign debt crisis in 2011 in many respects this crisis was an aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis high debt countries in the eurozone like greece portugal spain and ireland were severely hurt by the 2008 financial crisis germany was unable or unwilling to fund these countries out of their debt a collapse of these countries including some leaving the eurozone could have triggered a global financial crisis comparable to the 2008 collapse this time it was the ecb who were forced to come to the rescue with loans sub zero interest rates and effective bail outs to prevent a collapse the eurozone has been in a state of almost permanent recession ever since and the debt crisis lingers now encompassing larger countries such as italy the gold crash of 2013 gold had enjoyed a strong 10 year run to the upside rising from roughly us 250 in 2001 to a peak of over us 1 900 by september 2011 the rescue of the global economy in 2008 and again with the euro crisis of 2011 had led to the feeling that the worst was over many felt gold had in the end been in a speculative bubble after trading in a range between 1 500 and 1 800 through 2012 the collapse got underway in the morning of april 12 2013 when someone offered 400 metric tonnes of gold for sale on the open prior to that both germany and venezuela had requested repatriation of their gold from the fed and the boff when germany was told it would take seven years to deliver their gold an uneasy sense developed that there was a bullion bank in trouble when the dust cleared gold had fallen to us 1 045 by december 2015 a loss of 46 from the top gold stocks suffered even more with many falling 80 or more many junior exploration companies fell over 90 gold remains down today roughly 32 from the 2011 top black monday china august 2015 with cheap money readily available a stock market bubble developed in china the shanghai index ssec had soared 180 from 2013 to 2015 while that wasn t as much as it had soared from 2005 to 2007 it was still a significant bubble that developed as with so many other crises chinese companies had borrowed extensively to finance the speculation the trigger was an unexpected devaluation of the yuan leading to a stock market crash on august 8 2015 when the exchanges fell about 10 three weeks later they were down 30 one of the prime reasons for the devaluation of the yuan was the collapse of oil prices in 2014 the oil price collapse was triggered by a global glut of oil aided by the shale oil boom in the u s global trade withered as result negatively impacting china s manufacturing exports oil prices fell roughly 77 between 2013 and 2016 the chinese tried to balance the situation by devaluing the yuan but that sparked a debt crisis because much of the borrowing by companies was in u s dollars thus making it more expensive for them to repay their loans the chinese crisis coupled with the end of quantitative easing qe the collapse in oil prices and culminating in brexit sparked a stock market collapse that saw the dji fall roughly 15 from may 2015 to february 2016 considering all the turmoil the stock market decline in north american markets was actually fairly muted brexit june 2016 this one is ongoing and could be leading to an economic disaster for the united kingdom and even the eu if a hard brexit occurs at the end of march 2019 the latest attempt to get a deal through the u k parliament has failed in the aftermath of the unexpected result in june 2016 a black swan event the pound sterling plunged to a 31 year low against the u s dollar as noted the long term economic impact of brexit remains undetermined as this is an ongoing event the u k could now be seeking an extension but they need the approval of the eu the bursting of the cryptocurrency market december 2017 bitcoin and the cryptocurrencies had become the new in thing bitcoin had soared over 19 000 into 2017 rising from around 100 in 2013 to a peak of 19 891 in december 2017 other cryptocurrencies rose even more the bubble was being compared to tulip mania of 1637 however not even tulip prices rose that fast people who got in early became over night millionaires even billionaires the number of cryptocurrencies being offered soared the bubble burst when the cboe and the cme offered the listing of bitcoin futures thus allowing investors to short bitcoin on a large scale today bitcoin sits down 80 from its peak and many cryptocurrencies are down over 90 while others just disappeared regulators are circling the cryptocurrency market and many crypto exchanges have crashed leaving investors with nothing the bursting of the cryptocurrency market was one of the most spectacular in history the trump tariffs crisis of 2018 the imposition of tariffs by the trump administration got underway in january 2018 it may have started with solar panels and washing machines but it quickly spread impacting many countries including canada mexico and the eu the tariffs spread later to china countries retaliated the stock market was shaken and fell 12 from january to april 2018 the second round of tariffs shook the markets more as they collapsed to upwards of 20 from october to december 2018 the tariffs wars are ongoing and the u s and china remain in negotiation but given the uncertainty of the trump administration things could go from working towards a solution to a collapse very quickly left out of this are natural disasters that have occurred many of which have had longer lasting effects the great indian ocean earthquake of 2004 resulted in a massive tsunami causing only 15 billion in damage but killing an estimated 220 thousand the earthquake had the energy of 23 000 hiroshima type atomic bombs another notable disaster was the fukushima nuclear disaster of 2011 that was also triggered by an earthquake and tsunami these two were the most notable but the world may only be beginning to see the effects of the disasters triggered by global warming as hurricanes become more intense and destructive and killer heat waves become normal during the summer the heat waves have triggered thousands of deaths and huge destructive forest fires and droughts the potential for earthquakes to hit large population centres particularly in the ring of fire that includes the west coast of canada and the u s is a constant concern the destruction of a major u s city from either a hurricane or earthquake would have wide ranging financial and societal effects given the growing severity of events from global warming the long term financial and societal effects are still unknown it is difficult to predict where the next financial crisis will come from the history since 1971 suggests a financial crash or crisis occurs roughly every 2 6 years since the 2008 financial crisis we have seen at least five although none of them have been on the scale of what happened in 2008 since the crises got underway starting with the financial crisis of 1973 1974 the fed and the central banks have generally led the way in bailing out the financial system given the massive levels of global debt the world is facing estimated at 250 trillion up 100 trillion since 2008 an unexpected event could spark another financial crash on the scale of 2008 except this time the fed and the world s central banks are handicapped in bailing out the financial system they are running out of bullets in its place the eu the u s canada and japan have put in place bail in legislation what that means is that depositors and bond holders of the banks are at risk of being turned into stock owners stock that might have little or no value trying to identify where the next unexpected black swan might come from is difficult we cite the following a banking crisis in the eu triggered by either the brexit or the collapse of the italian banking system a collapse in the united kingdom and the eu could quickly spread into a global financial crisis the eu earlier faced a crisis over greece spain and others italy is one of the world s largest economies and a banking collapse and default there would have global repercussions many cite the potential for the collapse of deutsche bank the world s 15th largest bank as a possible trigger the german government is trying to engineer a merger between deutsche bank and commerzbank germany s 2nd largest bank to strengthen the two the latest brexit deal has been rejected by the u k parliament now what a hard brexit a vote to delay a second referendum that would today see the brexit vote of 2016 reversed the collapse of the may government or something else all together a collapse of the shadow banking system in china like the latin american crisis and the asian financial crisis chinese companies are heavily indebted in u s dollars as the chinese economy slows a debt collapse could be triggered it could be one that pboc can t fully control a collapse in china could quickly spread globally triggering a potential larger financial collapse china s real estate market would also collapse a u s state and local governments debt crisis could have far reaching effects u s states and municipalities have debt totalling 3 1 trillion the most severe debt problems are in states such as california illinois and new jersey add in the growing debt problems with student loans and car loans and we could find ourselves in another bear stearns moment when some fund is shut down because their asset base has collapsed a debt crisis could spread to a still shaky banking system despite shoring up of capital from the 2008 financial crisis the u s deficit is also sharply rising now exceeding 1 trillion annually as the debts of war pile up attempts to cut medicare medicaid or social security could trigger a severe backlash there is also the question of underfunded pension funds estimated to be at least 6 3 trillion and unfunded liabilities of medicare and social security totalling at least 123 trillion finally there are dozens of u s corporations leveraged up many of them currently barely investment grade downturns could quickly turn them into junk bonds and funds would have to dump them as the economy slows a debt laden country is highly vulnerable to a financial collapse can an outbreak of war be a black swan the start of ww1 triggered the closure of stock exchanges in europe which led to the closure of the nyse while initially stock prices fell they quickly found a bottom in november 2014 1915 was the best one year stock market in dji history rallying largely on the back of the manufacturing boom created by the war after topping in november 1916 the stock markets panicked again when the u s entered the war by december 1917 the dji was down over 40 stock markets fell when ww2 broke out in september 1939 the bombing of pearl harbour sparked a panic and the final bottom wasn t seen until april 1942 with the dji down 40 war can spark a stock market crisis the hot spots are india pakistan iran venezuela and north korea we don t pretend to know where the next financial crisis will come from or how it will unfold if the talks between china and the u s fail that might be a trigger china is slowing down and like debt crises in the past their companies are overextended in u s dollar denominated loans another sudden devaluation of the yuan by china could also trigger a financial collapse although they probably learned their lesson in 2015 the 2008 financial crisis started small when some hedge funds failed in july 2007 the sudden failure of a large hedge fund now could trigger a wider collapse the trouble is the central banks ammunition to combat a financial crisis has been severely compromised in the last financial crisis the fed s balance sheet exploded to over 4 trillion from 800 billion now they have been trying to pay down that huge overburdened balance sheet one that has its share of debt that is highly doubtful we also note that the fed is technically bankrupt as financial statements showed that losses in their value of their bonds was 66 5 billion the fed s capital is only 39 billion in a slowing economy they have had to now announce they will slow down or stop their paydown of the balance sheet what message does that send the reality is with 250 trillion of debt outstanding in the world the global financial system is on a hair trigger that could be set on fire at any time the global economy is starting to slow down and when that happens the skeletons usually come out of the closet the fact that it hasn t happened is meaningless because when it does happen a month from now six months from now or a year or more from now the financial devastation could be worse than 2008 we are but one black swan event away from a unknown financial collapse markets and trends gains losses trends close dec 31 18 close mar 15 19 week ytd daily short

to new 52 week highs lows source www stockcharts com wither the s p 500 will it break out or rollover and fall this past week the s p 500 gained 2 9 other indices were also up the dow jones industrials dji was up 1 6 the dow jones transportations djt gained 1 9 while the nasdaq jumped a healthy 3 8 the small cap russell 2000 was up 2 1 elsewhere the tsx composite gained 0 9 while the junior tsx venture exchange cdnx was up 1 6 all indices continue to be up over 10 on the year internationally the london ftse 100 seems to ignore brexit gaining 1 9 on the continent the paris cac 40 was up 3 3 and the german dax gained 2 0 in asia china s shanghai index ssec was up 1 8 while the tokyo nikkei dow tkn jumped 1 2 success all around keeping the bulls alive and well in 2019 but the s p 500 is at a key point either we break higher here or we fail 2 825 was considered our breakout point the high this week was at 2 830 why 2 825 the fibonacci 76 4 retracement of the entire down move from the high in october to the low in december is actually at 2 800 but 2 825 represented a resistance line from the small tops in october and november that tied to the recent high seen on march 4 2019 at 2 817 so we used 2 825 as a reasonable breakout point that could point to a run to 3 300 for the s p 500 a breakout over the fibonacci 76 4 point is considered by technical analysts to be the point where going above it suggests new highs the s p 500 saw a new high this past week but as we show later not everyone joined the new high party the nasdaq did but the dji the djt and the russell 2000 did not a divergence well it is confirmed a divergence if they fail to make new highs new highs by all the indices confirms the uptrend some have pointed to a potential head and shoulders bottom on the s p 500 as well on the other indices but it is an ill formed one a good one would see more backing and filling the so called right shoulder had only one shallow thrust to the downside the left shoulder made two solid thrusts to the downside before breaking down the left shoulder also made two solid thrusts to the upside that failed so the h s theory is somewhat questionable if it is a h s it also points to a potential target of 3 300 we note that the macd indicator has turned down the rally this past week has not turned the macd up instead its fast moving moving average is now only testing its slow moving moving average a failure we call a kiss and run meaning the fast moving ma kisses the slow moving ma and then returns to the direction it was going in which in this case is down the breakdown point is at 2 700 source www stockcharts com despite the dji not making new highs along with the s p 500 we note that both the s p 500 and the dji enjoyed strong volume on friday s up move djt and nasdaq volume also perked up could this be the sign that the stock markets are about to burst to the upside we have talked in the past about a panic run to the upside while the upswing would definitely be exciting it would also be one fraught with danger a breakout of the indices to the upside could spark a buying panic if that were to happen then the odds are that once the market tops a sharp downturn would follow enjoy the run if it happens but don t forget to exit here is the djt it is lagging the dji by a considerable margin the djt is down roughly 11 12 from its high while the dji is only currently off roughly 4 the classic divergence of the averages not confirming each other would be to see the dji run to new all time highs but the djt fail to make new all time highs watch this one carefully the djt is a solid sign of the state of the economy given its heavy leaning in airlines railways trucking and transportation services at least the djt doesn t have boeing ba nyse to drag it down the dji is being held back currently by the poor performance of boeing source www stockcharts com it is probably no surprise that the nasdaq is once again being led by the faangs the nasdaq now appears to be breaking out suggesting a move to new all time highs for the record this year aapl is leading up 26 0 nflx is up 21 5 and surprisingly fb is up 20 3 although it pulled back this week because of its problems related to the shooting in new zealand lagging are goog up 10 6 and amzn up 8 7 all continue to be pointed to the upside save for fb dipping this past week source www stockcharts com that nyse advance decline line continues to fascinate and suggest higher prices for the stock indices the advance decline remains in record territory and made new highs again this past week it all suggests that the indices should catch up and eventually make new all time highs as long as the market believes that the u s china will kiss and make up that earnings while slowing are still pretty darn good that the economy may be slowing but the powell put sits behind it and that the political noise in the background remains just noise then the markets should continue to rise we have some divergence signals at this point but they could resolve themselves soon source www stockcharts com the mcclellan summation index remains in bull territory the thrust to the upside was more powerful than the one seen in march 2016 that suggests to us that the market could continue its move to the upside a move that in many ways doesn t make any sense but we have seen that picture before the run up of the nasdaq in late 1999 early 2000 never made any sense either and we know how that one ended source www stockcharts com if the nyse advance decline is soaring to new all time highs then the nasdaq advance decline is not it s nowhere near its old highs a potential significant divergence what would be a perfect divergence is the nasdaq making new all time highs but the nasdaq advance decline not making all time highs keep an eye on this one source www stockcharts com we couldn t resist here is boeing ba nyse boeing gapped down on very high volume it has shown little sign that it is about to rise to fill that gap the rsi never went under 30 to suggest the potential for a bottom odds are high that this stock is going to go lower possibly back to its start in 2019 just under 300 00 the workers who make those planes are naturally on pins and needles as to their future source www stockcharts com u s treasuries are responding to weak data that has been released in the past week we note from last week s economic releases continued weakness in the retail sector growing weakness in the housing market weakness in durable goods continued low inflation and continued soft pedalling from the fed with yields on the 10 year u s falling this past week to 2 59 odds are favourable that the yield could drop below the earlier 2019 benchmark at 2 56 recession watch spread source www stockcharts com the recession watch spread of the 10 year u s treasury note minus the 2 year u s treasury note appears to have resumed its downtrend the 2 10 spread fell to 16 bp from 17 bp the previous week the spread is still nowhere near falling under zero and even if it does it has in the past needed at least six months under zero before a recession hit a breakdown under 14 bp could suggest a decline to 7 bp source www stockcharts com the u s dollar continued to rise because of ongoing weakness in other countries as china slows and the eu and japan continue to stumble the safe haven default is the u s dollar this is despite signs of growing weakness in the u s economy it is not so much the weakness in the u s economy but that other countries are experiencing even more weakness as well trade talks continue with china and there has been nothing that has come out of that could shake markets the u k remains in a mess because of brexit but the pound sterling and the ftse 100 are hanging in the us index fell 1 3 this past week as the euro gained 0 8 the pound sterling was actually up 2 0 while the canadian gained 0 7 the japanese yen was off a small 0 1 the question is which way is this us index going to go the previous week it looked like it was about to take off but it faltered after the poor job numbers of the previous week the weak economic numbers this past week didn t help nor did powell s dovish tone it s all making the current pattern very confusing on one hand it could take off towards 100 and on the other it could start a collapse the us index starts to break down under 95 50 that s not that far away a bigger breakdown gets under way under 94 50 as to the upside only new highs would suggest that we could run to 100 it still looks like a top but we confess that run to new highs at 97 67 confused us as it suggested new highs ahead we are not ruling it out until it breaks under 95 50 then it is highly unlikely that new highs will follow source www stockcharts com brexit brexit brexit that s all you hear out of the u k it dominates them one pundit referred to the u k as dead men walking or the walking dead this is a country that can t figure itself out and is divided against itself leavers vs remainers but i find that chart of the pound sterling rather compelling it doesn t look to us like a chart that suggests the pound sterling is about to bust to the downside granted all bets could be off if the pound busts under 127 once again that could suggest new lows ahead best hope for it right now given all of the confusion created in the u k is that the pound sterling continues its waffling in this potential bottom pattern but we know that northern ireland is not very happy nor is scotland referendums to leave are there as well the best they can hope for right now is an extension but for what purpose and will the eu grant them the extension they truly are the walking dead source www stockcharts com gold managed to rally this past week as it closed over 1 300 once again we continue to believe that this is a b wave that could take gold up to around 1 320 or 1 330 we d be surprised at new highs above 1 350 gold gained a small 0 3 this past week but silver slipped 0 2 platinum was up jumping 1 7 while palladium continues its remarkable run up just under 2 0 although for once it didn t make a new high copper gained up 0 7 after this rebound rally is over we suspect gold will fall to complete the correction of the run from 1 167 to 1 350 downside targets remain at 1 250 once this correction is over with a low possibly in may but no later than june gold should then run and take out 1 350 and the major resistance at 1 370 and move to 1 400 and higher key of course remains the u s dollar but as we note in our us index commentary we continue to believe that the us index is poised to break down there are many things that could spark this including a political crisis in the u s or a breakdown in the china u s trade talks we couldn t help but notice that gold sentiment hit 90 at the recent highs that high sentiment is often a signal that a top could be forming the other extreme is a drop in sentiment to 5 to 10 currently sentiment is still in the 60 range source www cotpricecharts com the commercial cot continues to be supportive of gold as it rose to 39 this past week from 37 two weeks ago it was 32 long open interest took a big jump up just over 36 000 contracts but short open interest also rose up almost 31 000 contracts the two offset each other but the gain in the longs was enough to push the commercial cot higher no surprise the large speculators cot hedge funds managed futures etc fell to 62 from 64 and down from 70 just a couple of weeks ago we note as well that the cot is now completely caught up from the craze of the shutdown two months ago the commercial cot is positive but it is a weak positive ergo our thoughts for gold to rise to maybe 1 320 or 1 330 but not make new highs above 1 350 source www stockcharts com as we noted silver slipped a small 0 2 this past week silver appears to be in a nice bull channel we will see if it can hold that channel even as gold might move lower a breakdown under 15 would change that scenario and silver could fall to the 14 60 range technically it made what could be seen as a double top at 16 20 and 16 19 if so the breakdown under 15 44 suggested the potential to fall to 14 45 currently the low is 14 98 but if that goes then 14 45 becomes a possibility only new highs would break this mildly bearish scenario however in the interim silver should follow gold higher at least for the short term new highs above 15 55 could suggest a move towards 16 once again but a more likely target zone is between 15 70 and 15 80 source www cotpricecharts com like the gold commercial cot the silver commercial cot gives some mild encouragement for higher prices the commercial cot rose to 37 this past week up from 36 the previous week but note the rise was accomplished in a negative manner long open interest fell just over 1 000 contracts but short open interest fell roughly 7 000 contracts the large speculators cot fell to 61 from 63 but we note there that short open interest rose just under 5 000 contracts while long open interest was off only about 300 contracts we consider the silver cot to be mildly bullish but the fact that both long and short open interest fell makes us cautious source www stockcharts com like gold the gold stocks are backing off from their recent highs we note now that the tsx gold index may have made a small double top at 201 22 and 199 25 if so the neckline is at 185 and a breakdown under that level could suggest a decline to around 170 we note there is considerable ma support in the 176 to 180 zone but if we are going through a corrective period the likelihood is a decline through that level we don t believe we ll see a major breakdown but the potential of the double top is ominous at least for the short term chart of the week source www stockcharts com opec vs nopec it seems that a war is breaking out between the u s and opec what is nopec well nopec is a piece of legislation being proposed that would allow the u s government to sue the opec cartel opec through suhail mohammed al mazrouei the uae s oil minister has told u s financiers that if the nopec bill goes through the cartel would get members to raise their production to the max russia is also willing to join opec a sharp increase in production would cause a glut of oil on the market and crash prices now here is the rub u s shale producers are on shaky grounds they leveraged themselves and a sharp drop in oil prices could cause them to go bankrupt the shale producers had a very difficult time when wti oil crashed from 110 to 26 between 2013 and 2015 final low was in early 2016 since then oil prices recovered hitting a high of about 77 this past year shale producers were relieved and so were their backers the banks but now oil prices are threatening to collapse again part of the reason for the recent drop was fear of this nopec bill consumers will love lower prices and so will trump since he has always campaigned and tweeted about the evils of the opec cartel members of the oil and gas industry are against the bill opec has crashed prices before notably in 1985 1986 1998 1999 and the most recent one in 2013 2015 this chart looks ugly wti oil is at weekly resistance between 59 and 62 after that sharp drop from 77 to 42 this rally looks like a bounce back this looks like an a wave down a b wave up with a c wave down to come the c wave targets could be around 25 but it could go even lower beware the shale producers and their lenders if that happens technical scoop charts and commentary

how the shilling has defied economics to remain strong against the dollar among other major currencies remains a mystery that has baffled many it has confounded economics who were pessimistic that the local unit would weaken even as kenya faces huge dollar debt payments and in the analogy of mangoes which are in plenty this season their huge supply has driven down prices even those who would not necessarily want mangoes are tempted to blend their juice the forces of demand and supply in the market also explain the prices of currencies few dollars in the market call for one to use more shillings to buy the greenback the standard unit used in the global export and import market so when the shilling strengthened to 99 units per dollar this year analysts quickly tried to understand why the forces of demand and supply had changed had a mango season suddenly crept up on us without having noticed this happened at a time when most currencies were losing ground against the greenback making the shilling the unique and odd one out that was outperforming peers including other better currencies the shilling has been so rigid to the extent that monumental events that occurred in the country seemed not to bother it the two significant events recently the dusit d2 attack in riverside nairobi and the questioning of finance cabinet secretary henry rotich by anti graft sleuths have had little or no effect on kenya s invulnerable currency in fact at the time of the terror attack on an upmarket shopping complex the kenyan shilling actually gained against the dollar despite the attack on dusit hotel complex the shilling traded at 101 7 against the dollar analysts say the currency will stay put even when global growth dims as talk of recession troubling the global economy increases when cs rotich was extensively grilled for four consecutive days over the arror and kimwarer dams scandal it was widely expected that the uncertainty surrounding his tenure in light of the latest corruption scandal to rock the jubilee government would send jitters in the market as well as the performance of the shilling but in the days trading investors gained sh181 million in paper wealth as stock market capitalisation moved up cautiously to sh2 301 trillion riding on banking shares which moved 54 9 per cent of the day s traded value as focus shifted to the announcement of full year results the shilling also remained stable with commercial banks quoting the local currency at 100 per dollar and forecast to strengthen due to inflows from horticulture exports and remittances the summoning of treasury boss came at a time when cs rotich was more worried about the country s spiraling debt as the country faces over sh200 billion maturing foreign currency loans with refinancing having a direct impact on the status of the shilling the steady rise in foreign inflows into the country combined with weaker demand for the dollar on account of suppressed manufacturing sector imports is expected to continue supporting the shilling s performance in the short term apex capital researcher harisson gitau said however increased borrowing a weakening manufacturing sector coupled with instability in global financial markets remain key threats to the shilling the currency market is mainly affected by imports and exports if you import more you need more dollars which becomes expensive if you export more you earn more dollars you do not have to go looking for them and dollars become cheap so did import export trade change drastically and earn the country extra dollars to offset demand for the american forex cut flowers according to cbk data dollars from exporting tea was 1 407 billion sh140 billion in the 12 months to november 2018 up from 1 398 billion sh139 billion in 2016 horticulture was up from sh82 billion 819 million in 2017 to 96 6 billion 966 million by the end of last year comprising of cut flowers sh113 16 billion fruits sh12 83 billion and vegetables sh 27 68 billion however coffee earnings declined from sh23 5 billion 235 million to sh23 1 billion 231 million during the same period the cut flower export still remains the largest horticulture earner contributing 74 per cent of the total fresh produce annual earnings fruits at eight per cent and vegetables at 18 per cent chief executive officer of fresh produce exporters association of kenya hosea machuki said despite insisting on liberal policies that allows the market forces to determine the price of the shilling kenya s central bank governors are often under implicit pressure to keep the currency strong in november 2011 a parliamentary committee even proposed the removal of prof njuguna ndung u from the cbk when the shilling plummeted from about sh75 to sh107 against the us dollar when cbk governor patrick njoroge inherited the shilling the market tested him tumbling the shilling towards this psychological mark only to have him arrest the fall and orchestrate market discipline that has kept the shilling stable to date analysts have ruled out that there was a magic export that had suddenly helped kenya earn more dollars and that such a monumental export shift still hangs on the hope of exporting the much hyped turkana crude oil the only explanation would be that if the inverse is true we are importing fewer products hence we do not need to buy dollars therefore lower demand some analysts concurred noting that lower export demand may actually explain the strengthening of the shilling we saw significant inflows over the valentine season horticulture has been the main driver supporting forex in the last couple of months said jibran qureishi economist for east africa at stanbic bank on the demand side there is not too much dollar demand it has been quite in the import market front importers are not capitalising on lower spot prices to build reserves the stability has encouraged a lot of calm so importers are not worried of shocks down the road he said bernard kiarie of african alliance said lower import demand oil prices and higher inflows have helped prop up the shilling as the macros have been very good however cbk monthly data seems to suggest the opposite showing that imports by december 2018 had actually gone up from sh1 6 trillion 15 9 billion to sh 1 63 trillion 16 3 billion only food imports declined from sh220 billion 2 2 billion to sh170 000 1 7 billion transport machinery by sh8 1 billion 81 million and machinery from sh300 billion 3 billion to sh290 billion 2 9 billion petroleum on the other hand shot up from sh260 billion 2 6 billion to sh340 billion 3 4 billion chemical imports were up by 23 5 billion 235 million and manufactured goods went up from sh 250 billion 2 5 billion to sh290 billion 2 9 billion indeed kenya as a net importer country was actually buying more goods than last year which means demand for the dollar should have caused the shilling to move in the opposite direction it has been suggested that other than exports diaspora dollars from kenyan living abroad may be the surprise culprit apexafrica capital research said kenya s current account deficit shows the import export gap narrowed further in january as receipts from agriculture tourism and diaspora remittances outpaced import growth the central bank of kenya cbk data shows that the deficit as a percentage of gdp stood at 4 6 per cent at the end of january compared to 4 9 per cent at the end of december 2018 both tourism and diaspora remittances returned record inflows in 2018 with the dollars earned also backing the shilling to retain the upper hand against the dollar going into this year the shilling s gains against the dollar in recent months may be attributed to increased remittances increased output in the local agricultural industry and the uncertainty in the us economy surrounding the ongoing trade deal talks with china gitau said a strengthening shilling is expected to boost foreign investors earnings at the bourse since they stand to gain from shilling to dollar currency conversions indeed kenya did receive substantial flows of dollars from the diaspora and foreign direct investment but are these two factors enough to make such a tow on the shilling kenya s biggest foreign currency earners are the kenyans in the diaspora who send back more money the diaspora population estimated at three million remitted cumulative inflows of up to 2 697 billion sh274 2 billion to december last year from 1 947 billion sh197 9 billion in the 12 months to december 2017 reflecting a 39 percent growth this means that kenyans living and working abroad sent home about sh100 000 each making diaspora cash the country s top dollar earner almost catching up with total exports which stand at 4 9 billion sh490 billion another source of dollars is foreign investments in kenyan companies among notable portfolio investments were french downstream fuel industry group rubis energie bought kenolkobil in a sh36 billion transaction making it the largest foreign direct investment deal in recent years private equity firms africinvest and catalyst principal partners also acquired a minority stake in prime bank through injection of sh5 1 billion capital into the lender however i m burbidge says that compared to last year the level of private equity activity has not been as high which means that comparatively the currency is not getting help from fdi in february 219 a slower pace in deal activity was recorded in the east african region with only two deals having been disclosed during the month compared to the six deals disclosed in february 2018 and the record 15 deals in january 2019 edward burbidge and linda obwora said some observers have also posed a theory that cs rotich s tax amnesty and criminal pardon for those who had kept money outside the country may explain the rise in diaspora remittances and as such the strengthening of the shilling the stanbic economist however disputes this pointing out that last year when the amnesty was announced significant money did flow into the country but the shilling did not rally then rotich amnesty may not explain the current trend it happened in a big way last year but it is not as steep this year qureishi said institute of economic affairs chief executive kwame owino said the story of remittances has to be viewed with retrospect to the region where the rest of the east african countries have also been getting more money from citizens abroad yet their currencies still depreciated cbk says we have to take into account the fact that diaspora remittances have gone up significantly by over sh200 billion 2 billion however while this is significant it is not so much since we have been averaging about sh130 billion 1 3 billion to sh150 billion 1 5 billion a year mr owino said if we also look at the story about remittances vis a vis our neighbours their own remittances are not as big but are sizable in relation to their economic sizes this seems to suggest that the strengthening cannot be explained by remittances he said when we posed the question to the central bank of kenya to try and point us in the right direction our query was rebuffed by a generic market response the cbk s policy is clear and has not changed we have a flexible exchange rate policy and the cbk only intervenes to minimise volatility cbk said in fact cbk has actually been buying dollars to keep up an illusion of demand so that the dollar reserves don t fall further while the apex bank stockpiles its reserve ammunition for a rainy day the shilling is the strongest since early 2015 in fact the shilling could be stronger it s just that the cbk is buying dollars it is taking the opportunity to build its reserves if not the currency would be about 98 units for the dollar said jibran qureishi last week s forex reserves were the highest this year at sh840 billion 8 392 billion from a low of sh800 billion 7 93 billion at the beginning of the year off the record most analysts say it is the cbk that is literally controlling the shilling supported by favourable macroeconomics kenya has been cagey about the currency has given the rise of foreign borrowing which means that for every dollar we borrowed we need more shillings to pay back if the currency depreciates on debt with the balance of debt tipping to external where we owe foreign governments and institutions which need to be paid in dollars if the shilling depreciates significantly there will be implications owino said they mirror the bretton woods institution international monetary fund imf which last year said the shilling risked being classified as managed rather than operating on the forces of demand and supply reflecting limited movement of the shilling relative to the us dollar monetary and capital markets department 2018 report on exchange rate arrangement to be published in february 2018 will reclassify kenya s shilling from floating to other managed arrangement said imf the institute of economic affairs said they had done a comparative review which concurred with the assertion that the shilling was disjointed from market fundamentals here at the iea we believe the shilling is too strong we usually look at two benchmarks one which is basically imports vs exports what we call trade balance the imports are getting bigger while exports have not risen as much iea boss owino said if we also benchmark it against the regional currencies most have depreciated by about 10 per cent over the last three years yet the kenyan shilling has strengthened what is so peculiar about us he said iea warned that the lull was not sustainable as whenever the shilling stayed flat for too long it also fell more aggressively we also followed a record over 25 years of shilling depreciation in history and found that the kenyan currency tends to stay strong for long periods while depreciations are big about eight to nine per cent he said brutal fashion debt expert deepak dave of riverside capital also sounded a warning that the shilling s strength could unravel fast and urged cbk to prepare to deal with such an eventuality its good from inflation and debt servicing perspective unfortunately markets have a way of imposing the reality of fundamentals in a brutal fashion when that happens we have to hope cbk are ready to deal with the consequences deepak said now would be the time for reserves to be padded up treasury to make advance debt payments or redemptions and importers to build stocks we will only know if this all happened three or so months from now he said cbk would be hoping that if such a threat lay in the foreseeable future the national treasury would have negotiated with the imf for a stand by the facility giving the shaky confidence in the currency a much needed back up the strong shilling has also made kenya s exports uncompetitive regionally the effects are very clear we saw for the first time in a long while that uganda exported more to kenya in the last quarter of 2018 part of which had to do with the shilling when the shilling is too strong our exports to tanzania and uganda cannot be competitive owino said

about sh130 billion 1 3 billion to sh150 billion 1 5 billion a year mr owino said if we also look at the story about remittances vis a vis our neighbours their own remittances are not as big but are sizable in relation to their economic sizes this seems to suggest that the strengthening cannot be explained by remittances he said when we posed the question to the central bank of kenya to try and point us in the right direction our query was rebuffed by a generic market response the cbk s policy is clear and has not changed we have a flexible exchange rate policy and the cbk only intervenes to minimise volatility cbk said in fact cbk has actually been buying dollars to keep up an illusion of demand so that the dollar reserves don t fall further while the apex bank stockpiles its reserve ammunition for a rainy day the shilling is the strongest since early 2015 in fact the shilling could be stronger it s just that the cbk is buying dollars it is taking the opportunity to build its reserves if not the currency would be about 98 units for the dollar said jibran qureishi last week s forex reserves were the highest this year at sh840 billion 8 392 billion from a low of sh800 billion 7 93 billion at the beginning of the year off the record most analysts say it is the cbk that is literally controlling the shilling supported by favourable macroeconomics kenya has been cagey about the currency has given the rise of foreign borrowing which means that for every dollar we borrowed we need more shillings to pay back if the currency depreciates on debt with the balance of debt tipping to external where we owe foreign governments and institutions which need to be paid in dollars if the shilling depreciates significantly there will be implications owino said they mirror the bretton woods institution international monetary fund imf which last year said the shilling risked being classified as managed rather than operating on the forces of demand and supply reflecting limited movement of the shilling relative to the us dollar monetary and capital markets department 2018 report on exchange rate arrangement to be published in february 2018 will reclassify kenya s shilling from floating to other managed arrangement said imf the institute of economic affairs said they had done a comparative review which concurred with the assertion that the shilling was disjointed from market fundamentals here at the iea we believe the shilling is too strong we usually look at two benchmarks one which is basically imports vs exports what we call trade balance the imports are getting bigger while exports have not risen as much iea boss owino said if we also benchmark it against the regional currencies most have depreciated by about 10 per cent over the last three years yet the kenyan shilling has strengthened what is so peculiar about us he said iea warned that the lull was not sustainable as whenever the shilling stayed flat for too long it also fell more aggressively we also followed a record over 25 years of shilling depreciation in history and found that the kenyan currency tends to stay strong for long periods while depreciations are big about eight to nine per cent he said brutal fashion debt expert deepak dave of riverside capital also sounded a warning that the shilling s strength could unravel fast and urged cbk to prepare to deal with such an eventuality its good from inflation and debt servicing perspective unfortunately markets have a way of imposing the reality of fundamentals in a brutal fashion when that happens we have to hope cbk are ready to deal with the consequences deepak said now would be the time for reserves to be padded up treasury to make advance debt payments or redemptions and importers to build stocks we will only know if this all happened three or so months from now he said cbk would be hoping that if such a threat lay in the foreseeable future the national treasury would have negotiated with the imf for a stand by the facility giving the shaky confidence in the currency a much needed back up the strong shilling has also made kenya s exports uncompetitive regionally the effects are very clear we saw for the first time in a long while that uganda exported more to kenya in the last quarter of 2018 part of which had to do with the shilling when the shilling is too strong our exports to tanzania and uganda cannot be competitive owino said
the economic outlook of post independence zimbabwe resembles a fading cloth with each wash it has lost its lustre and as time goes on it threatens to disintegrate into a rag after inheriting a sound economy albeit one with deep socio economic disparities on gaining independence in 1980 the government of zimbabwe has instituted decades of economic decline and ever widening inequality by prioritising political and economic capital over everything else in the 1980s there was confidence amongst ordinary citizens who generally did not understand the underlying economic structural functionalities but this changed in the 1990s with the introduction of the economic structural adjustment programme esap supported by the world bank which introduced harsh austerity measures and economic liberalisation thereby exposing workers to the harsh realities of neo liberalism the trend worsened as zimbabwe trudged into late 1990s when large scale retrenchments bit workers and destroyed the social fabric of the country the chaotic land redistribution programme which started in 2000 forced zimbabwe s agrarian economy to its knees between 2000 and 2009 we witnessed a slump in agricultural production caused by the flight of experienced farmers and successive droughts this in turn weighed heavily on the manufacturing sector which relies on agricultural produce for raw materials the economy briefly recovered from 2009 to 2014 following the introduction of a multi currency system with the united states dollar as the base currency following the formation of a coalition government after the disputed 2008 election but since 2015 the economy has been in recession all key socio economic indicators have declined with inflation cash liquidity the budget deficit and public debt all taking a turn for the worse persistent shortages of foreign currency have spawned shortages of basic commodities and has driven the cost of everyday goods to record levels the official year on year inflation rose from 2 97 per cent in november 2017 to 3 56 per cent in january 2018 by november 2018 it officially reached an all time high of 31 per cent the highest since inception of the multi currency regime although noted economists have put that figure at a staggering 186 per cent making zimbabwe s rate of inflation second only to venezuela s 1 4 million per cent rising inflation has had a devastating impact on ordinary citizens incomes for those luckily enough to be in work or to have a pension have been massively eroded their predicament is worsened by the fact that most people do not have access to foreign exchange while service providers are demanding payment in hard currency there are also tens of thousands of workers who are victims of wage theft all of this leaves most people unable to pay for their basic needs be it food housing education healthcare or transport as if things couldn t get any worse in january 2019 the government increased the price of fuel by 158 per cent sending the economy into a tailspin that is likely to result in hyperinflation workers called for a stay away and citizens joined in workers face a wall of silence and an iron fist prospects of an economic recovery this year remain remote as the country is unlikely to meet neither its economic growth projections nor its inflation targets current circumstances have forced finance minister mthuli ncube to revise the projected economic growth rate for 2019 from 9 0 per cent to about 3 1 per cent and even this is unlikely to be achieved thanks to ever declining confidence from the international community and the high cost of living unless the government and its social partners namely business and labour quickly and sincerely revive the social contract labour unrest is likely to be a recurring feature of the months ahead faced with an economic implosion and an agitated populace instead of addressing economic fundamentals and engaging in dialogue the government has sought to silence all of its critics for years zimbabweans have been calling for economic stability electoral reforms rule of law institutional reforms and decent jobs but they have met a wall of silence and an iron fist damaging economic measures forced the zimbabwe congress of trade unions zctu to call for demonstrations in october 2018 which were quashed by the police in january 2019 the zctu called for a stay away and the state responded with brutal force unleashing the military which left about 17 people dead with reports of beatings rape and other atrocities the zctu leadership has been in the firing line with zctu president peter mutasa and me not only facing trial for public order offenses following the october protests but more recently we have been charged with the grave offense of trying to subvert the government if convicted we face 20 years in prison over the past 12 months teachers have also been under fire for going on strike to demand payment in us dollars as the value of all other forms of money bond notes electronic money has plummeted members of the amalgamated rural teachers union of zimbabwe have been hauled before the courts while doctors and nurses have been arbitrarily dismissed for calling for better pay and working conditions the government is trying to intimidate organised labour so that it can pursue its austerity agenda undisturbed as a result the situation for trade unions is more precarious now than it was during the mugabe era the government is unilaterally imposing its decisions on civil service collective bargaining processes trade union leaders are being targeted for arrest and detention the courts appear to be captured and no longer sensitive to labour collective power despite the state s attempts to break it is the only hope left for zimbabwe s workers 11 ways zimbabwe can move forward despite the seemingly hopeless nature of the situation facing labour in zimbabwe there are a number of ways that we can move forward cutting government expenditure the people have lost confidence in the government owing to fiscal indiscipline the reality of government spending stands in stark contrast to its rhetoric senior officials must cut their expenditure and the foreign trips that have consumed millions of the country s scarcely available forex informal sector zimbabwe has the second largest informal economy in the world after bolivia these workers need access to capital and to be supported towards formality rather than criminalised and attacked additionally the government urgently needs to open credit lines for small and medium enterprises to recapitalise the economy end corruption there is hardly a sector in zimbabwe that hasn t been blighted by corruption the guilty need to be held accountable and the business community needs to be assured of the safety of its investments encourage responsible foreign direct investment printing more money will not solve zimbabwe s current economic crisis responsible foreign direct investment is the key to economic growth and the government needs to create a conducive and sustainable environment for such investments policy consistency this remains a major challenge zimbabwe has various excellent blueprints for the positive transformation of the country but these policies are never implemented government ministers must also refrain from issuing conflicting policy statements as this tarnishes zimbabwe s already battered image create decent jobs zimbabwe has an abundance of natural resources from agriculture to minerals and a huge skilled labour force what is now needed is the political will and the right economic policies to create decent work for all drop the dollar although the introduction of the us dollar was necessary after the demonetisation of the zimbabwe dollar in 2009 in the long term zimbabwe needs to reintroduce its own currency rejuvenate production production must be recapitalised starting with the agricultural manufacturing and mining sectors the land reform programme which started in 2000 destroyed an agricultural sector that was once described as â the bread basket of africa with regards to manufacturing there are cheap and affordable products that should be produced locally matches candles and mineral water for example but currently they are all being imported meanwhile the mining sector lacks product value addition how can zimbabwe be the second largest platinum producer in the world but the majority of its people live in absolute poverty curb illicit financial flows serious levels of illicit financial flows have been recorded in the mining sector while our unfortunate economic circumstances have led the government to mortgage our mineral wealth to bogus â investors hellbent on looting our minerals the government must come up with strict laws to curb these losses zimbabwe s diamonds are said to be worth us 60 billion but who benefits from the proceeds certainly not ordinary zimbabweans instead us 15 billion from the nation s diamond sales are unaccounted for and have likely been siphoned out of the country this needs to stop real reforms the country s image is severely dented owing to its poor human rights record the absence of the rule of law and the recent military clampdown on civilians protesting against widespread hardships zimbabwe s government needs to engage in practical and meaningful reforms on every level despite the crushing national debt no credit lines will be open to zimbabwe until this takes place social dialogue an all stakeholders dialogue platform needs to be put in place urgently the inclusion of opposition parties trade unions religious institutions academia students and other parts of civil society is crucial the â command style of governance favoured by the current administration has proved to be incredibly ineffective key government policies are repeatedly announced without effective stakeholder engagement and the result has been resistance respecting the social contract will build the trust transparency and accountability zimbabwe needs to prosper equal times

set out below in full and unedited text you should carefully consider the specific risks and uncertainties set forth below and the other information contained within this strategic report as these are important factors that could cause the company s actual results performance or achievements to differ materially from our expected or historical results we operate in a highly competitive environment and unanticipated changes relating to competitive factors in our industry including ongoing industry consolidation may impact our results of operations we compete on the basis of a number of different factors such as product offerings project execution customer service and price in order to compete effectively we must develop and implement innovative technologies and processes and execute our clients projects effectively we can give no assurances that we will continue to be able to compete effectively with the products and services or prices offered by our competitors our industry including our customers and competitors has experienced unanticipated changes in recent years moreover the industry is undergoing vertical and horizontal consolidation to create economies of scale and control the value chain which may affect demand for our products and services because of price concessions for our competitors or decreased customer capital spending this consolidation activity could impact our ability to maintain market share maintain or increase pricing for our products and services or negotiate favorable contract terms with our customers and suppliers which could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows we are unable to predict what effect consolidations and other competitive factors in the industry may have on prices capital spending by our customers our selling strategies our competitive position our ability to retain customers or our ability to negotiate favorable agreements with our customers demand for our products and services depends on oil and gas industry activity and expenditure levels which are directly affected by trends in the demand for and price of crude oil and natural gas we are substantially dependent on conditions in the oil and gas industry including i the level of exploration development and production activity ii capital spending and iii the processing of oil and natural gas in refining units petrochemical sites and natural gas liquefaction plants by energy companies that are our customers any substantial or extended decline in these expenditures may result in the reduced pace of discovery and development of new reserves of oil and gas and the reduced exploration of existing wells which could adversely affect demand for our products and services and in certain instances result in the cancellation modification or re scheduling of existing orders in our backlog these factors could have an adverse effect on our revenue and profitability the level of exploration development and production activity is directly affected by trends in oil and natural gas prices which historically have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future factors affecting the prices of oil and natural gas include but are not limited to the following demand for hydrocarbons which is affected by worldwide population growth economic growth rates and general economic and business conditions costs of exploring for producing and delivering oil and natural gas political and economic uncertainty and socio political unrest government policies and subsidies related to the production use and exportation importation of oil and natural gas available excess production capacity within the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec and the level of oil production by non opec countries oil refining and transportation capacity and shifts in end customer preferences toward fuel efficiency and the use of natural gas technological advances affecting energy consumption development exploitation and relative price and availability of alternative sources of energy and our customers shift of capital to the development of these sources volatility in and access to capital and credit markets which may affect our customers activity levels and spending for our products and services and natural disasters the oil and gas industry has historically experienced periodic downturns which have been characterized by diminished demand for oilfield services and downward pressure on the prices we charge while oil and natural gas prices have recently started to rebound from the downturn that began in 2014 the market remains quite volatile and the sustainability of the price recovery and business activity levels is dependent on variables beyond our control such as geopolitical stability opec s actions to regulate its production capacity changes in demand patterns and international sanctions and tariffs continued volatility or any future reduction in demand for oilfield services and could further adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows our success depends on our ability to develop implement and protect new technologies and services our success depends on the ongoing development and implementation of new product designs including the processes used by us to produce and market our products and on our ability to protect and maintain critical intellectual property assets related to these developments if we are not able to obtain patent trade secret or other protection of our intellectual property rights if our patents are unenforceable or the claims allowed under our patents are not sufficient to protect our technology or if we are not able to adequately protect our patents or trade secrets we may not be able to continue to develop our services products and related technologies additionally our competitors may be able to independently develop technology that is similar to ours without infringing on our patents or gaining access to our trade secrets if any of these events occurs we may be unable to meet evolving industry requirements or do so at prices acceptable to our customers which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows the industries in which we operate or have operated expose us to potential liabilities including the installation or use of our products which may not be covered by insurance or may be in excess of policy limits or for which expected recoveries may not be realized we are subject to potential liabilities arising from among other possibilities equipment malfunctions equipment misuse personal injuries and natural disasters any of which may result in hazardous situations including uncontrollable flows of gas or well fluids fires and explosions although we have obtained insurance against many of these risks our insurance may not be adequate to cover our liabilities further the insurance may not generally be available in the future or if available premiums may not be commercially justifiable if we incur substantial liability and the damages are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits or if we were to incur liability at a time when we are not able to obtain liability insurance such potential liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows we may lose money on fixed price contracts as customary for some of our projects we often agree to provide products and services under fixed price contracts we are subject to material risks in connection with such fixed price contracts it is not possible to estimate with complete certainty the final cost or margin of a project at the time of bidding or during the early phases of its execution actual expenses incurred in executing these fixed price contracts can vary substantially from those originally anticipated for several reasons including but not limited to the following unforeseen additional costs related to the purchase of substantial equipment necessary for contract fulfillment or labor shortages in the markets for where the contracts are performed mechanical failure of our production equipment and machinery delays caused by local weather conditions and or natural disasters including earthquakes and floods and a failure of suppliers subcontractors or joint venture partners to perform their contractual obligations the realization of any material risks and unforeseen circumstances could also lead to delays in the execution schedule of a project we may be held liable to a customer should we fail to meet project milestones or deadlines or to comply with other contractual provisions additionally delays in certain projects could lead to delays in subsequent projects for which production equipment and machinery currently being utilized on a project were intended pursuant to the terms of fixed price contracts we are not always able to increase the price of the contract to reflect factors that were unforeseen at the time its bid was submitted and this risk may be heightened for projects with longer terms depending on the size of a project variations from estimated contract performance or variations in multiple contracts could have a significant impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows new capital asset construction projects for vessels and manufacturing facilities are subject to risks including delays and cost overruns which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations we regularly carry out capital asset construction projects to maintain upgrade and develop our asset base and such projects are subject to risks of delay and cost overruns that are inherent to any large construction project and are the result of numerous factors including but not limited to the following shortages of key equipment materials or skilled labor unscheduled delays in the delivery or ordered materials and equipment design and engineering issues and shipyard delays and performance issues failure to complete construction in time or the inability to complete construction in accordance with its design specifications may result in loss of revenue additionally capital expenditures for construction projects could materially exceed the initially planned investments or can result in delays in putting such assets into operation our failure to timely deliver our backlog could affect future sales profitability and relationships with our customers many of the contracts we enter into with our customers require long manufacturing lead times due to complex technical and logistical requirements these contracts may contain clauses related to liquidated damages or financial incentives regarding on time delivery and a failure by us to deliver in accordance with customer expectations could subject us to liquidated damages or loss of financial incentives reduce our margins on these contracts or result in damage to existing customer relationships the ability to meet customer delivery schedules for this backlog is dependent upon a number of factors including but not limited to access to the raw materials required for production an adequately trained and capable workforce subcontractor performance project engineering expertise and execution sufficient manufacturing plant capacity and appropriate planning and scheduling of manufacturing resources failure to deliver backlog in accordance with expectations could negatively impact our financial performance we face risks relating to our reliance on subcontractors suppliers and our joint venture partners we generally rely on subcontractors suppliers and our joint venture partners for the performance of our contracts although we are not dependent upon any single supplier certain geographic areas of our business or a project or group of projects may depend heavily on certain suppliers for raw materials or semi finished goods any difficulty in engaging suitable subcontractors or acquiring equipment and materials could compromise our ability to generate a significant margin on a project or to complete such project within the allocated timeframe if subcontractors suppliers or joint venture partners refuse to adhere to their contractual obligations with us or are unable to do so due to a deterioration of their financial condition we may be unable to find a suitable replacement at a comparable price or at all moreover the failure of one of our joint venture partners to perform their obligations in a timely and satisfactory manner could lead to additional obligations and costs being imposed on us as we may be obligated to assume our defaulting partner s obligations or compensate our customers any delay failure to meet contractual obligations or other event beyond our control or not foreseeable by us that is attributable to a subcontractor supplier or joint venture partner could lead to delays in the overall progress of the project and or generate significant extra costs even if we are entitled to make a claim for these extra costs against the defaulting supplier subcontractor or joint venture partner we may be unable to recover the entirety of these costs and this could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations our businesses are dependent on the continuing services of certain of our key managers and employees we depend on key personnel the loss of any key personnel could adversely impact our business if we are unable to implement key strategies or transactions in their absence the loss of qualified employees or failure to retain and motivate additional highly skilled employees required for the operation and expansion of our business could hinder our ability to successfully conduct research activities and develop marketable products and services pirates endanger our maritime employees and assets we face material piracy risks in the gulf of guinea the somali basin and the gulf of aden and to a lesser extent in southeast asia malacca and the singapore straits piracy represents a risk for both our projects and our vessels which operate and transport through sensitive maritime areas such risks have the potential to significantly harm our crews and to negatively impact the execution schedule for our projects if our maritime employees or assets are endangered additional time may be required to find an alternative solution which may delay project realization and negatively impact our business financial condition or results of operations seasonal and weather conditions could adversely affect demand for our services and operations our business may be materially affected by variation from normal weather patterns such as cooler or warmer summers and winters adverse weather conditions such as hurricanes in the gulf of mexico or extreme winter conditions in canada russia and the north sea may interrupt or curtail our operations or our customers operations cause supply disruptions or loss of productivity and may result in a loss of revenue or damage to our equipment and facilities which may or may not be insured any of these events or outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows and results of operations due to the types of contracts we enter into and the markets in which we operate the cumulative loss of several major contracts customers or alliances may have an adverse effect on our results of operations we often enter into large long term contracts that collectively represent a significant portion of our revenue these agreements if terminated or breached may have a larger impact on our operating results or our financial condition than shorter term contracts due to the value at risk moreover the global market for the production transportation and transformation of hydrocarbons and by products as well as the other industrial markets in which we operate is dominated by a small number of companies as a result our business relies on a limited number of customers if we were to lose several key contracts customers or alliances over a relatively short period of time we could experience a significant adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows our operations require us to comply with numerous regulations violations of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows our operations and manufacturing activities are governed by international regional transnational and national laws and regulations in every place where we operate relating to matters such as environmental protection health and safety labor and employment import export controls currency exchange bribery and corruption and taxation these laws and regulations are complex frequently change and have tended to become more stringent over time in the event the scope of these laws and regulations expand in the future the incremental cost of compliance could adversely impact our financial condition results of operations or cash flows our international operations are subject to anti corruption laws and regulations such as the u s foreign corrupt practices act fcpa the u k bribery act of 2010 the bribery act the anti corruption provisions of french law n 2016 1691 dated december 9 2016 relating to transparency anti corruption and modernization of the business practice sapin ii law the brazilian anti bribery act also known as the brazilian clean company act and economic and trade sanctions including those administered by the united nations the european union the office of foreign assets control of the u s department of the treasury u s treasury and the u s department of state the fcpa prohibits providing anything of value to foreign officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business or securing any improper business advantage we may deal with both governments and state owned business enterprises the employees of which are considered foreign officials for purposes of the fcpa the provisions of the bribery act extend beyond bribery of foreign public officials and are more onerous than the fcpa in a number of other respects including jurisdiction non exemption of facilitation payments and penalties economic and trade sanctions restrict our transactions or dealings with certain sanctioned countries territories and designated persons as a result of doing business in foreign countries including through partners and agents we are exposed to a risk of violating anti corruption laws and sanctions regulations some of the international locations in which we currently or may in the future operate have developing legal systems and may have higher levels of corruption than more developed nations our continued expansion and worldwide operations including in developing countries our development of joint venture relationships worldwide and the employment of local agents in the countries in which we operate increases the risk of violations of anti corruption laws and economic and trade sanctions violations of anti corruption laws and economic and trade sanctions are punishable by civil penalties including fines denial of export privileges injunctions asset seizures debarment from government contracts and termination of existing contracts and revocations or restrictions of licenses as well as criminal fines and imprisonment in addition any major violations could have a significant impact on our reputation and consequently on our ability to win future business we have implemented internal controls designed to minimize and detect potential violations of laws and regulations in a timely manner but we can provide no assurance that such policies and procedures will be followed at all times or will effectively detect and prevent violations of the applicable laws by one or more of our employees consultants agents or partners the occurrence of any such violation could subject us to penalties and material adverse consequences on our business financial condition or results of operations compliance with environmental laws and regulations may adversely affect our business and results of operations environmental laws and regulations in various countries affect the equipment systems and services we design market and sell as well as the facilities where we manufacture our equipment and systems and any other operations we undertake we are required to invest financial and managerial resources to comply with environmental laws and regulations and believe that we will continue to be required to do so in the future failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative civil and criminal penalties the imposition of remedial obligations the issuance of orders enjoining our operations or other claims these laws and regulations as well as the adoption of new legal requirements or other laws and regulations affecting exploration and development of drilling for crude oil and natural gas are becoming increasingly strict and could adversely affect our business and operating results by increasing our costs limiting the demand for our products and services or restricting our operations existing or future laws and regulations relating to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change may adversely affect our business existing or future laws concerning the release of greenhouse gas emissions or that concern climate change including laws and regulations that seek to mitigate the effects of climate change may adversely impact demand for the equipment systems and services we design market and sell for example oil and natural gas exploration and production may decline as a result of such laws and regulations and as a consequence demand for our equipment systems and services may also decline in addition such laws and regulations may also result in more onerous obligations with respect to our operations including the facilities where we manufacture our equipment and systems such decline in demand for our equipment systems and services and such onerous obligations in respect of our operations may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows disruptions in the political regulatory economic and social conditions of the countries in which we conduct business could adversely affect our business or results of operations we operate in various countries across the world instability and unforeseen changes in any of the markets in which we conduct business including economically and politically volatile areas could have an adverse effect on the demand for our services and products our financial condition or our results of operations these factors include but are not limited to the following nationalization and expropriation potentially burdensome taxation inflationary and recessionary markets including capital and equity markets civil unrest labor issues political instability terrorist attacks cyber terrorism military activity and wars supply disruptions in key oil producing countries the ability of opec to set and maintain

respect to shares listed on the nyse and euroclear with respect to shares listed on euronext paris dtc and euroclear being referred to as the clearance services the clearance services are widely used mechanisms that allow for rapid electronic transfers of securities between the participants in their respective systems which include many large banks and brokerage firms the clearance services have general discretion to cease to act as a depository and clearing agencies for our shares if either of the clearance services determine at any time that our shares are not eligible for continued deposit and clearance within its facilities then we believe that our shares would not be eligible for continued listing on the nyse or euronext paris as applicable and trading in our shares would be disrupted any such disruption could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our shares the united kingdom s proposed withdrawal from the european union may have a negative effect on global economic conditions financial markets and our business we are based in the united kingdom and have operational headquarters in paris france houston texas united states and in london united kingdom with worldwide operations including material business operations in europe in june 2016 a majority of voters in the united kingdom elected to withdraw from the european union in a national referendum brexit the referendum was advisory and the united kingdom government served notice under article 50 of the treaty of the european union in march 2017 to formally initiate a withdrawal process the united kingdom and the european union have had a two year period under article 50 to negotiate the terms for the united kingdom s withdrawal from the european union the withdrawal agreement and political declaration that were endorsed at a special meeting of the european council on november 25 2018 did not receive the approval of the united kingdom parliament in january 2019 further discussions are ongoing although the european commission has stated that the european union will not reopen the withdrawal agreement any extension of the negotiation period for withdrawal will require the consent of the remaining 27 member states of the european union brexit has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the united kingdom and the european union and has given rise to calls for certain regions within the united kingdom to preserve their place in the european union by separating from the united kingdom these developments or the perception that any of them could occur could have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of the global financial markets and could significantly reduce global market liquidity and restrict the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets asset valuations currency exchange rates and credit ratings may be especially subject to increased market volatility lack of clarity about applicable future laws regulations or treaties as the united kingdom negotiates the terms of a withdrawal as well as the operation of any such rules pursuant to any withdrawal terms including financial laws and regulations tax and free trade agreements intellectual property rights supply chain logistics environmental health and safety laws and regulations immigration laws employment laws and other rules that would apply to us and our subsidiaries could increase our costs restrict our access to capital within the united kingdom and the european union depress economic activity and further decrease foreign direct investment in the united kingdom for example withdrawal from the european union could depending on the negotiated terms of such withdrawal eliminate the benefit of certain tax related e u directives currently applicable to u k companies such as us including the parent subsidiary directive and the interest and royalties directive which could subject to any relief under an available tax treaty raise our tax costs if the united kingdom and the european union are unable to negotiate mutually acceptable withdrawal terms or if other e u member states pursue withdrawal barrier free access between the united kingdom and other e u member states or within the european economic area overall could be diminished or eliminated any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations as an english public limited company we must meet certain additional financial requirements before we may declare dividends or repurchase shares and certain capital structure decisions may require stockholder approval which may limit our flexibility to manage our capital structure we may not be able to pay dividends or repurchase shares of our ordinary shares in accordance with our announced intent or at all under english law we will only be able to declare dividends make distributions or repurchase shares other than out of the proceeds of a new issuance of shares for that purpose out of distributable profits distributable profits are a company s accumulated realized profits to the extent that they have not been previously utilized by distribution or capitalization less its accumulated realized losses to the extent that they have not been previously written off in a reduction or reorganization of capital duly made in addition as a public limited company incorporated in england and wales we may only make a distribution if the amount of our net assets is not less than the aggregate of our called up share capital and non distributable reserves and to the extent that the distribution does not reduce the amount of those assets to less than that aggregate following the merger we implemented a court approved reduction of our capital which was completed on june 29 2017 in order to create distributable profits to support the payment of possible future dividends or future share repurchases our articles of association permit us by ordinary resolution of the stockholders to declare dividends provided that the directors have made a recommendation as to its amount the dividend shall not exceed the amount recommended by the board of directors the directors may also decide to pay interim dividends if it appears to them that the profits available for distribution justify the payment when recommending or declaring payment of a dividend the directors are required under english law to comply with their duties including considering our future financial requirements in addition the board of directors determinations regarding dividends and share repurchases will depend on a variety of other factors including our net income cash flow generated from operations or other sources liquidity position and potential alternative uses of cash such as acquisitions as well as economic conditions and expected future financial results our ability to declare and pay future dividends and make future share repurchases will depend on our future financial performance which in turn depends on the successful implementation of our strategy and on financial competitive regulatory technical and other factors general economic conditions demand and selling prices for our products and services and other factors specific to our industry or specific projects many of which are beyond our control therefore our ability to generate cash depends on the performance of our operations and could be limited by decreases in our profitability or increases in costs regulatory changes capital expenditures or debt servicing requirements any failure to pay dividends or repurchase shares of our ordinary shares could negatively impact our reputation harm investor confidence in us and cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline our existing and future debt may limit cash flow available to invest in the ongoing needs of our business and could prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our outstanding debt we have substantial existing debt as of december 31 2018 after giving effect to the merger our total debt is 4 2 billion we also have the capacity under our 2 5 billion credit facility in addition to our bilateral facilities to incur substantial additional debt our level of debt could have important consequences for example it could make it more difficult for us to make payments on our debt require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of debt service reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions distributions and other general partnership purposes increase our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions limit our ability to obtain additional financing to enable us to react to changes in our business or place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to businesses in our industry that have less debt additionally any failure to meet required payments on our debt or to comply with any covenants in the instruments governing our debt could result in an event of default under the terms of those instruments in the event of such default the holders of such debt could elect to declare all the amounts outstanding under such instruments to be due and payable the london inter bank offered rate libor and certain other interest benchmarks may be subject to regulatory guidance and or reform that could cause interest rates under our current or future debt agreements to perform differently than in the past or cause other unanticipated consequences the united kingdom s financial conduct authority which regulates libor has announced that it intends to stop encouraging or requiring banks to submit libor rates after 2021 and it is unclear if libor will cease to exist or if new methods of calculating libor will evolve if libor ceases to exist or if the methods of calculating libor change from their current form interest rates on our current or future debt obligations may be adversely affected a downgrade in our debt rating could restrict our ability to access the capital markets the terms of our financing are in part dependent on the credit ratings assigned to our debt by independent credit rating agencies we cannot provide assurance that any of our current credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels capital structure planned asset purchases or sales near and long term production growth opportunities market position liquidity asset quality cost structure product mix customer and geographic diversification and commodity price levels a downgrade in our credit ratings particularly to non investment grade levels could limit our ability to access the debt capital markets or refinance our existing debt or cause us to refinance or issue debt with less favorable terms and conditions moreover our revolving credit agreement includes an increase in interest rates if the ratings for our debt are downgraded which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations an increase in the level of our indebtedness and related interest costs may increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions and may affect our ability to obtain additional financing as well as have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations uninsured claims and litigation against us including intellectual property litigation could adversely impact our financial condition results of operations or cash flows we could be impacted by the outcome of pending litigation as well as unexpected litigation or proceedings we have insurance coverage against operating hazards including product liability claims and personal injury claims related to our products or operating environments in which our employees operate to the extent deemed prudent by our management and to the extent insurance is available however our insurance policies are subject to exclusions limitations and other conditions and may not apply in all cases for example where willful wrongdoing on our part is alleged additionally the nature and amount of that insurance may not be sufficient to fully indemnify us against liabilities arising out of pending and future claims and litigation additionally in individual circumstances certain proceedings or cases may also lead to our formal or informal exclusion from tenders or the revocation or loss of business licenses or permits our financial condition results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected by unexpected claims not covered by insurance in addition the tools techniques methodologies programs and components we use to provide our services may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others infringement claims generally result in significant legal and other costs the resolution of these claims could require us to enter into license agreements or develop alternative technologies the development of these technologies or the payment of royalties under licenses from third parties if available would increase our costs if a license were not available or we are not able to develop alternative technologies we might not be able to continue providing a particular service or product which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows we conduct operations around the world in many different currencies because a significant portion of our revenue is denominated in currencies other than our reporting currency the u s dollar changes in exchange rates will produce fluctuations in our revenue costs and earnings and may also affect the book value of our assets and liabilities and related equity although we do not hedge translation impacts on earnings we do hedge transaction impacts on margins and earnings where the transaction is not in the functional currency of the business unit our efforts to minimize our currency exposure through such hedging transactions may not be successful depending on market and business conditions moreover certain currencies in which the company trades specifically currencies in countries such as angola and nigeria do not actively trade in the global foreign exchange markets and may subject us to increased foreign currency exposures as a result fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations or cash flows we may incur significant merger related costs we have incurred and expect to incur additional non recurring direct and indirect costs associated with the merger in addition to the costs and expenses associated with the consummation of the merger we are also integrating processes policies procedures operations technologies and systems while we have assumed that a certain level of expenses would be incurred relating to the merger and continue to assess the magnitude of these costs there are many factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of the integration and implementation expenses these costs and expenses could reduce the realization of efficiencies and strategic benefits we expect to achieve from the merger and the expected net benefit of the merger may not be achieved in the near term or at all our acquisition and divestiture activities involve substantial risks we have made and expect to continue to pursue acquisitions dispositions or other investments that may strategically fit our business and or growth objectives we cannot provide assurances that we will be able to locate suitable acquisitions dispositions or investments or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us even if we do successfully execute such transactions they may not result in anticipated benefits which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results if we are unable to successfully integrate and develop acquired businesses we could fail to achieve anticipated synergies and cost savings including any expected increases in revenues and operating results we may not be able to successfully cause a buyer of a divested business to assume the liabilities of that business or even if such liabilities are assumed we may have difficulties enforcing our rights contractual or otherwise against the buyer we may invest in companies or businesses that fail causing a loss of all or part of our investment in addition if we determine that an other than temporary decline in the fair value exists for a company in which we have invested we may have to write down that investment to its fair value and recognize the related write down as an investment loss a failure of our it infrastructure including as a result of cyber attacks could adversely impact our business and results of operations the efficient operation of our business is dependent on our it systems accordingly we rely upon the capacity reliability and security of our it hardware and software infrastructure and our ability to expand and update this infrastructure in response to changing needs we have been subject to cyber attacks in the past including phishing malware and ransomware and although no such attack has had a material adverse effect on our business this may not be the case with future attacks our systems may be vulnerable to damages from such attacks as well as from natural disasters failures in hardware or software power fluctuations unauthorized access to data and systems loss or destruction of data including confidential customer information human error and other similar disruptions and we cannot give assurance that any security measures we have implemented or may in the future implement will be sufficient to identify and prevent or mitigate such disruptions we rely on third parties to support the operation of our it hardware software infrastructure and cloud services and in certain instances utilize web based and software as a service applications the security and privacy measures implemented by such third parties as well as the measures implemented by any entities we acquire or with whom we do business may not be sufficient to identify or prevent cyber attacks and any such attacks may have a material adverse effect on our business while our it vendor agreements typically contain provisions that seek to eliminate or limit our exposure to liability for damages from a cyber attack we cannot ensure such provisions will withstand legal challenges or cover all or any such damages threats to our it systems arise from numerous sources not all of which are within our control including fraud or malice on the part of third parties accidental technological failure electrical or telecommunication outages failures of computer servers or other damage to our property or assets outbreaks of hostilities or terrorist acts the failure of our it systems or those of our vendors to perform as anticipated for any reason or any significant breach of security could disrupt our business and result in numerous adverse consequences including reduced effectiveness and efficiency of operations inappropriate disclosure of confidential and proprietary information reputational harm increased overhead costs and loss of important information which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations in addition we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future our insurance coverage may not cover all of the costs and liabilities we incur as the result of any disruptions or security breaches and if our business continuity and or disaster recovery plans do not effectively and timely resolve issues resulting from a cyber attack we may suffer material adverse effects on our business we are subject to governmental regulation and other legal obligations related to privacy data protection and data security our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business we are subject to international data protection laws such as the general data protection regulation or gdpr in the european economic area the gdpr imposes several stringent requirements for controllers and processors of personal data which have increased our obligations including for example by requiring more robust disclosures to individuals notifications in some cases of data breaches to regulators and data subjects and a record of processing and other policies and procedures to be maintained to adhere to the accountability principle in addition we are subject to the gdpr s rules on transferring personal data outside of the eea including to the united states and some of these rules are currently being challenged in the courts failure to comply with the requirements of gdpr and the local laws implementing or supplementing the gdpr could result in fines of up to 20 000 000 or up to 4 of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year whichever is higher as well as other administrative penalties we are likely to be required to expend significant capital and other resources to ensure ongoing compliance with the gdpr and other applicable data protection legislation and we may be required to put in place additional control mechanisms which could be onerous and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects we may not realize the cost savings synergies and other benefits expected from the merger the combination of two independent companies is a complex costly and time consuming process as a result we will be required to continue to devote management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of technip and fmc technologies the integration process may disrupt our businesses and if ineffectively implemented could preclude realization of the full benefits expected from the merger our failure to meet the challenges involved in successfully integrating the operations of technip and fmc technologies or otherwise realize the anticipated benefits of the merger could interrupt and seriously harm the results of our operations in addition the overall integration of technip and fmc technologies may result in unanticipated expenses liabilities competitive responses loss of client relationships diversion of management s attention or other problems and such problems could if material cause our stock price to decline the difficulties of combining the operations of technip and fmc technologies include but are not limited to the following managing a significantly larger company coordinating geographically separate organizations the potential diversion of management focus and resources from other strategic opportunities and from operational matters aligning and executing our strategy retaining existing customers and attracting new customers maintaining employee morale and retaining key management and other employees integrating two unique business cultures the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding the integration process consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations coordinating distribution and marketing efforts integrating it communications and other systems changes in applicable laws and regulations managing tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating our operations unforeseen expenses or delays associated with the merger and taking actions that may be required in connection with obtaining regulatory approvals many of these factors are at least partially outside our control and any one of them could result in increased costs decreased revenue and diversion of management s time and energy which could materially impact our business financial condition and results of operations in addition even if the operations of technip and fmc technologies are successfully integrated we may not realize the full benefits of the merger including the synergies cost savings sales or growth opportunities that we expect these benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all as a result the combination of technip and fmc technologies may not result in the realization of the full benefits expected from the merger the irs may not agree that we should be treated as a foreign corporation for u s federal tax purposes and may seek to impose an excise tax on gains recognized by certain individuals although we are incorporated in the united kingdom the u s internal revenue service the irs may assert that we should be treated as a u s domestic corporation and therefore a u s tax resident for u s federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 7874 of the u s internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code for u s federal income tax purposes a corporation i is generally considered a domestic corporation or u s tax resident if it is organized in the united states or of any state or political subdivision therein and ii is generally considered a foreign corporation or non u s tax resident if it is not considered a domestic corporation because we are a u k incorporated entity we would be considered a foreign corporation and therefore a non u s tax resident under these rules section 7874 of the code section 7874 provides an exception under which a foreign incorporated entity may in certain circumstances be treated as a domestic corporation for u s federal income tax purposes we do not believe this exception applies however the section 7874 rules are complex and subject to detailed regulations the application of which is uncertain in various respects it is possible that the irs will not agree with our position should the irs successfully challenge our position it is also possible that an excise tax under section 4985 of the code the section 4985 excise tax may be assessed against certain disqualified individuals including former officers and directors of fmc technologies inc on certain stock based compensation held thereby we may if we determine that it is appropriate provide disqualified individuals with a payment with respect to the section 4985 excise tax so that on a net after tax basis they would be in the same position as if no such section 4985 excise tax had been applied in addition there can be no assurance that there will not be a change in law or interpretation including with retroactive effect that might cause us to be treated as a domestic corporation for u s federal income tax purposes u s tax laws and or guidance could affect our ability to engage in certain acquisition strategies and certain internal restructurings even if we are treated as a foreign corporation for u s federal income tax purposes section 7874 u s treasury regulations and other guidance promulgated thereunder may adversely affect our ability to engage in certain future acquisitions of u s businesses or to restructure the non u s members of our group these limitations if applicable may affect the tax efficiencies that otherwise might be achieved in such potential future transactions or restructurings in addition the irs and the u s treasury have issued final and temporary regulations providing that even if we are treated as a foreign corporation for u s federal income tax purposes certain intercompany debt instruments issued on or after april 4 2016 will be treated as equity for u s federal income tax purposes therefore limiting u s tax benefits and resulting in possible u s withholding taxes although recent guidance from the u s treasury proposes deferring certain documentation requirements that would otherwise be imposed with respect to covered debt instruments and further indicates that these rules generally are the subject of continuing study and may be further materially modified the current regulations may adversely affect our future effective tax rate and could also impact our ability to engage in future restructurings if such transactions cause an existing intercompany debt instrument to be treated as reissued for u s federal income tax purposes we are subject to the tax laws of numerous jurisdictions challenges to the interpretation of or future changes to such laws could adversely affect us we and our subsidiaries are subject to tax laws and regulations in the united kingdom the united states france and numerous other jurisdictions in which we and our subsidiaries operate these laws and regulations are inherently complex and we are and will continue to be obligated to make judgments and interpretations about the application of these laws and regulations to our operations and businesses the interpretation and application of these laws and regulations could be challenged by the relevant governmental authorities which could result in administrative or judicial procedures actions or sanctions which could be material in addition the u s congress the u k government the european union the organization for economic co operation and development the oecd and other government agencies in jurisdictions where we and our affiliates do business have had an extended focus on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations new tax initiatives directives and rules such as the u s tax cuts and jobs act the oecd s base erosion and profit shifting initiative and the european union s anti tax avoidance directives may increase our tax burden and require additional compliance related expenditures as a result our financial condition results of operations or cash flows may be adversely affected further changes including with retroactive effect in the tax laws of the united states the united kingdom the european union or other countries in which we and our affiliates do business could also adversely affect us we may not qualify for benefits under tax treaties entered into between the united kingdom and other countries we operate in a manner such that we believe we are eligible for benefits under tax treaties between the united kingdom and other countries however our ability to qualify for such benefits will depend on whether we are treated as a u k tax resident the requirements contained in each treaty and applicable domestic laws on the facts and circumstances surrounding our operations and management and on the relevant interpretation of the tax authorities and courts for example because of the anticipated withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union brexit we may lose some or all of the benefits of tax treaties between the united states and the remaining members of the european union and face higher tax liabilities which may be significant another example is the multilateral convention to implement tax treaty related measures to prevent base erosion and profit shifting the mli which entered into force for participating jurisdictions on july 1 2018 the mli recommends that countries adopt a limitation on benefit rule and or a principle purposes test rule with regards to their tax treaties the scope and interpretation of these rules as adopted pursuant to the mli are presently under development but the application of either rule might deny us tax treaty benefits that were previously available the failure by us or our subsidiaries to qualify for benefits under tax treaties entered into between the united kingdom and other countries could result in adverse tax consequences to us including an increased tax burden and increased filing obligations and could result in certain tax consequences of owning and disposing of our shares we intend to be treated exclusively as a resident of the united kingdom for tax purposes but french or other tax authorities may seek to treat us as a tax resident of another jurisdiction we are incorporated in the united kingdom english law currently provides that we will be regarded as a u k resident for tax purposes from incorporation and shall remain so unless i we are concurrently a resident in another jurisdiction applying the tax residence rules of that jurisdiction that has a double tax treaty with the united kingdom and ii there is a tiebreaker provision in that tax treaty which allocates exclusive residence to that other jurisdiction in this regard we have a permanent establishment in france to satisfy certain french tax requirements imposed by the french tax code with respect to the merger although it is intended that we will be treated as having our exclusive place of tax residence in the united kingdom the french tax authorities may claim that we are a tax resident of france if we were to fail to maintain our place of effective management in the united kingdom any such claim would be settled between the french and u k tax authorities pursuant to the mutual assistance procedure provided for by the tax treaty concluded between france and the united kingdom there is no assurance that these authorities would reach an agreement that we will remain exclusively a u k tax resident a determination which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and future prospects a failure to maintain exclusive tax residency in the united kingdom could result in adverse tax consequences to us and our subsidiaries and could result in certain adverse changes in the tax consequences of owning and disposing of our shares the company has identified material weaknesses relating to internal control over financial reporting if our remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weaknesses or if one or more additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to further restate our financial results which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows management identified material weaknesses in the company s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2017 and december 31 2018 as described in the corporate governance report of this u k annual report a material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis as a result of the material weaknesses management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of december 31 2018 in addition as a result of these material weaknesses our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that as of december 31 2018 our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective until these material weaknesses are remediated they could lead to errors in our financial results and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows if our remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weaknesses or if one or more additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows restrict our ability to access the capital markets require significant resources to correct the weaknesses or deficiencies subject us to fines penalties or judgments harm our reputation or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence and in the market price of our stock additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting could be identified in the future any failure to maintain or implement required new or improved controls or any difficulties we encounter in their implementation could result in additional significant deficiencies or material weaknesses cause us to fail to meet our periodic reporting obligations or result in material misstatements in our financial statements any such failure could also adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual auditor attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting required under section 404 of the u s sarbanes oxley act of 2002 and the rules promulgated under section 404 the existence of a material weakness could result in errors in our financial statements that could result in a restatement of financial statements cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information leading to among other things a decline in our stock price we can give no assurances that the measures we have taken to date or any future measures we may take will fully remediate the material weaknesses identified or that any additional material weaknesses will not arise in the future due to our failure to implement and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting in addition even if we are successful in strengthening our controls and procedures those controls and procedures may not be adequate to prevent or identify irregularities or ensure

the economic outlook of post independence zimbabwe resembles a fading cloth with each wash it has lost its lustre and as time goes on it threatens to disintegrate into a rag after inheriting a sound economy albeit one with deep socio economic disparities on gaining independence in 1980 the government of zimbabwe has instituted decades of economic decline and ever widening inequality by prioritising political and economic capital over everything else in the 1980s there was confidence amongst ordinary citizens who generally did not understand the underlying economic structural functionalities but this changed in the 1990s with the introduction of the economic structural adjustment programme esap supported by the world bank which introduced harsh austerity measures and economic liberalisation thereby exposing workers to the harsh realities of neo liberalism the trend worsened as zimbabwe trudged into late 1990s when large scale retrenchments bit workers and destroyed the social fabric of the country the chaotic land redistribution programme which started in 2000 forced zimbabwe s agrarian economy to its knees between 2000 and 2009 we witnessed a slump in agricultural production caused by the flight of experienced farmers and successive droughts this in turn weighed heavily on the manufacturing sector which relies on agricultural produce for raw materials the economy briefly recovered from 2009 to 2014 following the introduction of a multi currency system with the united states dollar as the base currency following the formation of a coalition government after the disputed 2008 election but since 2015 the economy has been in recession all key socio economic indicators have declined with inflation cash liquidity the budget deficit and public debt all taking a turn for the worse persistent shortages of foreign currency have spawned shortages of basic commodities and has driven the cost of everyday goods to record levels the official year on year inflation rose from 2 97 per cent in november 2017 to 3 56 per cent in january 2018 by november 2018 it officially reached an all time high of 31 per cent the highest since inception of the multi currency regime although noted economists have put that figure at a staggering 186 per cent making zimbabwe s rate of inflation second only to venezuela s 1 4 million per cent rising inflation has had a devastating impact on ordinary citizens incomes for those luckily enough to be in work or to have a pension have been massively eroded their predicament is worsened by the fact that most people do not have access to foreign exchange while service providers are demanding payment in hard currency there are also tens of thousands of workers who are victims of wage theft all of this leaves most people unable to pay for their basic needs be it food housing education healthcare or transport as if things couldn t get any worse in january 2019 the government increased the price of fuel by 158 per cent sending the economy into a tailspin that is likely to result in hyperinflation workers called for a stay away and citizens joined in workers face a wall of silence and an iron fist prospects of an economic recovery this year remain remote as the country is unlikely to meet neither its economic growth projections nor its inflation targets current circumstances have forced finance minister mthuli ncube to revise the projected economic growth rate for 2019 from 9 0 per cent to about 3 1 per cent and even this is unlikely to be achieved thanks to ever declining confidence from the international community and the high cost of living unless the government and its social partners namely business and labour quickly and sincerely revive the social contract labour unrest is likely to be a recurring feature of the months ahead faced with an economic implosion and an agitated populace instead of addressing economic fundamentals and engaging in dialogue the government has sought to silence all of its critics for years zimbabweans have been calling for economic stability electoral reforms rule of law institutional reforms and decent jobs but they have met a wall of silence and an iron fist damaging economic measures forced the zimbabwe congress of trade unions zctu to call for demonstrations in october 2018 which were quashed by the police in january 2019 the zctu called for a stay away and the state responded with brutal force unleashing the military which left about 17 people dead with reports of beatings rape and other atrocities the zctu leadership has been in the firing line with zctu president peter mutasa and me not only facing trial for public order offenses following the october protests but more recently we have been charged with the grave offense of trying to subvert the government if convicted we face 20 years in prison over the past 12 months teachers have also been under fire for going on strike to demand payment in us dollars as the value of all other forms of money bond notes electronic money has plummeted members of the amalgamated rural teachers union of zimbabwe have been hauled before the courts while doctors and nurses have been arbitrarily dismissed for calling for better pay and working conditions the government is trying to intimidate organised labour so that it can pursue its austerity agenda undisturbed as a result the situation for trade unions is more precarious now than it was during the mugabe era the government is unilaterally imposing its decisions on civil service collective bargaining processes trade union leaders are being targeted for arrest and detention the courts appear to be captured and no longer sensitive to labour collective power despite the state s attempts to break it is the only hope left for zimbabwe s workers 11 ways zimbabwe can move forward despite the seemingly hopeless nature of the situation facing labour in zimbabwe there are a number of ways that we can move forward cutting government expenditure the people have lost confidence in the government owing to fiscal indiscipline the reality of government spending stands in stark contrast to its rhetoric senior officials must cut their expenditure and the foreign trips that have consumed millions of the country s scarcely available forex informal sector zimbabwe has the second largest informal economy in the world after bolivia these workers need access to capital and to be supported towards formality rather than criminalised and attacked additionally the government urgently needs to open credit lines for small and medium enterprises to recapitalise the economy end corruption there is hardly a sector in zimbabwe that hasn t been blighted by corruption the guilty need to be held accountable and the business community needs to be assured of the safety of its investments encourage responsible foreign direct investment printing more money will not solve zimbabwe s current economic crisis responsible foreign direct investment is the key to economic growth and the government needs to create a conducive and sustainable environment for such investments policy consistency this remains a major challenge zimbabwe has various excellent blueprints for the positive transformation of the country but these policies are never implemented government ministers must also refrain from issuing conflicting policy statements as this tarnishes zimbabwe s already battered image create decent jobs zimbabwe has an abundance of natural resources from agriculture to minerals and a huge skilled labour force what is now needed is the political will and the right economic policies to create decent work for all drop the dollar although the introduction of the us dollar was necessary after the demonetisation of the zimbabwe dollar in 2009 in the long term zimbabwe needs to reintroduce its own currency rejuvenate production production must be recapitalised starting with the agricultural manufacturing and mining sectors the land reform programme which started in 2000 destroyed an agricultural sector that was once described as â the bread basket of africa with regards to manufacturing there are cheap and affordable products that should be produced locally matches candles and mineral water for example but currently they are all being imported meanwhile the mining sector lacks product value addition how can zimbabwe be the second largest platinum producer in the world but the majority of its people live in absolute poverty curb illicit financial flows serious levels of illicit financial flows have been recorded in the mining sector while our unfortunate economic circumstances have led the government to mortgage our mineral wealth to bogus â investors hellbent on looting our minerals the government must come up with strict laws to curb these losses zimbabwe s diamonds are said to be worth us 60 billion but who benefits from the proceeds certainly not ordinary zimbabweans instead us 15 billion from the nation s diamond sales are unaccounted for and have likely been siphoned out of the country this needs to stop real reforms the country s image is severely dented owing to its poor human rights record the absence of the rule of law and the recent military clampdown on civilians protesting against widespread hardships zimbabwe s government needs to engage in practical and meaningful reforms on every level despite the crushing national debt no credit lines will be open to zimbabwe until this takes place social dialogue an all stakeholders dialogue platform needs to be put in place urgently the inclusion of opposition parties trade unions religious institutions academia students and other parts of civil society is crucial the â command style of governance favoured by the current administration has proved to be incredibly ineffective key government policies are repeatedly announced without effective stakeholder engagement and the result has been resistance respecting the social contract will build the trust transparency and accountability zimbabwe needs to prosper equal times

former governor of the people s bank of china beijing review the bfa has become an important platform for promoting globalization and the development of asia and emerging economies can you explain its role zhou xiaochuan the bfa is a high level dialogue platform with unique advantages over the years it has been committed to promoting economic integration in asia as well as globalization which are the focus of its annual meetings taking into consideration the challenges facing the world economy and regional cooperation we set the theme of this year s annual meeting as shared future concerted action common development as an open and inclusive platform for discussion on promoting regional and world economic growth the forum will build consensus on globalization free trade multilateralism and global governance and offer fresh ideas on innovation and structural reform this year s bfa will feature dozens of sub forums which will shed light on the trend of asian and global economies from different perspectives in addition the bfa will release relevant research reports and host thematic activities in collaboration with its partners this year s annual meeting is the first after a new board of directors took office last spring what will be new at the forum in addition to continuing in depth discussions on key areas it has focused on over the years such as economy finance and trade this year s forum will also cover topics such as innovation health culture education and media these issues matter to economic growth and global development some of these topics are interdisciplinary for example bfa chairman ban ki moon proposed a sub forum titled a sustainable future for rural asia and cities which will look at rural vitalization and smart city construction from a future perspective the sub forum will cover areas like urban planning and governance the application of new technologies in the digital age the development of creative industries and the preservation of cities cultural characteristics in addition to the annual meeting the bfa is also actively cooperating with some well known institutions to organize a series of special events for example it initiated a global health forum in 2018 which will debut in qingdao east china s shandong province this june with preparations presently underway the bfa has maintained good cooperation with the media and will soon launch some online and offline projects to promote media exchanges and training in asia in the fields of education science and technology and culture the bfa has introduced and will continue to introduce specific programs to promote dialogue and cooperation in related fields the themes and topics of the bfa annual conference are usually formulated in light of the world and asian economic situation how would you evaluate the current situation since the outbreak of the global financial crisis a decade ago countries have worked together to help the global economy out of the crisis global economic growth returned to pre crisis levels in 2017 a synchronized global economic recovery greeted the start of 2018 but it suffered a series of shocks later in the year global trade frictions escalated the u s federal reserve raised interest rates four times currencies in many emerging economies depreciated sharply oil prices plunged and global stock markets tumbled a very important reason giving rise to these phenomena is that in the decade after the outbreak of the global financial crisis many countries neither carried out enough structural reforms nor properly solved the problems of weak endogenous economic power and social polarization as a result economic globalization became the scapegoat while global populism unilateralism and trade protectionism are on the rise posing challenges to existing international economic trade and financial systems the international monetary fund imf toned down the expected global economic growth rate for 2019 and 2020 to 3 5 and 3 6 percent thus the international community needs to make great efforts to remedy and improve the situation nevertheless despite these changes in the past year the asian economy showed strong resilience and realized overall good performance asia was still the fastest growing region in the world economy contributing more than 60 percent to world economic growth the imf estimated that asia grew at 5 6 percent in 2018 and would grow at 5 4 percent in 2019 despite downturn pressure from external risks high savings and investment rates balanced current accounts sustained investment in human capital and technological innovation and the regional comprehensive economic partnership rcep under negotiation will become important forces driving sustainable development in asia in the future what has caused increased instability and uncertainty in world economic development structural problems in various countries coupled with the escalation of global trade frictions tightening financial conditions and increasing fluctuations in exchange rates and asset prices in 2018 have led to a deterioration of the external development environment for countries and increased instability and uncertainty in world economic development the escalation of trade frictions has become a major disturbance for the sustainable growth of the global economy since 2018 the u s has imposed tariffs on a variety of imports triggering countermeasures by trading partners and resulting in a tense global trade situation in the third quarter of 2018 the growth rate of new export orders slowed down significantly with the global trade outlook indicator dropping to 100 3 approaching a tipping point between boom and bust increased trade tensions can directly deflate business and market confidence as well as weaken investment and trade increased trade barriers can also increase commodity transaction costs reduce the efficiency of global resource allocation disrupt global supply chains and hinder the dissemination of new technologies thereby reducing productivity in the long run trade tensions could cloud the medium term growth prospects of the global economy the tightening of global financial conditions is a significant external factor affecting the steady growth of emerging market economies after the global financial crisis major countries implemented a long term quantitative easing monetary policy and as a result low cost capital flowed into emerging market economies on a large scale in 2018 as the u s federal reserve hiked interest rates more frequently as the u s dollar strengthened and as the european central bank sent signals to stop quantitative easing global financial conditions gradually tightened exposing emerging market economies to increased financing difficulties and financial market shocks in addition trade frictions and geopolitical risks have created fluctuations in commodity prices exchange rates of emerging market economies such as argentina turkey and south africa fluctuated dramatically greatly affecting the stable development of the domestic economy financial markets in some asian economies with better domestic economic fundamentals have also been affected by spillover effects in addition disruptive technological innovation while promoting leapfrog economic development has also created many difficulties for policymakers artificial intelligence block chains big data cloud computing and other disruptive technologies have spawned a variety of businesses rapidly changed people s way of life and work reconfigured the value system and inspired new products and services however disruptive technological innovation can also be used to evade traditional regulation for example the vigorous development of financial science and technology has brought about such thorny and wide ranging problems as the distortion of market supply and demand caused by high frequency transactions the use of virtual money for illegal transactions the leakage of consumer financial data and cyberattacks on important financial infrastructure which may cause significant risks given unstable and uncertain economic growth prospects how should globalization be promoted and international economic rules improved the international community should adhere to multilateralism work together to promote globalization improve global trade rules and return the world economy to the track of strong sustainable balanced and inclusive growth currently it is urgent to reform the world trade organization wto and safeguard the multilateral trading system wto reform cannot be accomplished by one country or one party alone multilateral discussions and consensus are needed to promote it wto members need to deepen mutual understanding and cooperation jointly safeguard free trade actively explore ways to improve trade negotiation frameworks and establish a new global trade order as soon as possible at the same time the international community should continue to reform the international monetary system and build a global financial safety net as the core institution of this safety net the imf needs to ensure sufficient liquidity while also improving the flexibility and pertinence of loan conditions asia europe latin america and brics countries brazil russia india china and south africa are also constantly improving arrangements for providing financial assistance at the regional level since 2008 more than 70 swap agreements have been signed between more than 50 central banks around the world stabilizing market confidence in addition more equitable globalization should be promoted by strengthening infrastructure interconnection according to world bank estimates about 60 percent of the world s economic output comes from coastal areas lying within 100 km from the coastline some countries especially landlocked countries are marginalized in the process of economic globalization which in turn hinders economic globalization meanwhile some experts estimate that the mode of economic globalization characterized by tariff concessions can promote world economic growth by up to 5 percent while the new type of economic globalization driven by interconnectivity can promote world economic growth by 10 15 percent it is for this reason that president xi jinping proposed the belt and road initiative to promote a new type of globalization the initiative has been recognized and supported by more than 100 governments and international organizations and has the broad participation of the private sector across the world what role does asia play in promoting globalization and improving international economic rules faced with the rise of anti globalization sentiment and trade protectionism asian leaders have jointly voiced their firm support for economic globalization and trade and investment facilitation through various platforms and have actively promoted regional integration in may 2018 the leaders of china japan and the republic of korea met and reiterated that they should jointly safeguard free trade and promote regional economic integration the qingdao declaration of the shanghai cooperation organization summit in june pointed out that economic globalization and regional integration are the general current trend so all parties should safeguard the authority and effectiveness of wto rules consolidate an open inclusive transparent non discriminatory and rule based multilateral trading system and oppose any form of trade protectionism in mid november the east asian leaders meetings proposed trade facilitation in east asia should be further strengthened e commerce and the digital economy should be promoted and rcep negotiations covering nearly half of the world s population and nearly one third of its trade volume should be completed as soon as possible as supporters of the multilateral free trade system many share common views on improving trade liberalization and investment facilitation resisting protectionism and unilateralism and addressing climate change at a time when global economic growth is facing bottlenecks and trade rules are being challenged asian countries hope to work with countries in other parts of the world to set up a bridge for restructuring the international trade and economic order formulate and maintain new rules and contribute to the sustainable growth of the world economy currently there are many high level exchange platforms such as the world economic forum and the asia pacific economic cooperation economic leaders meeting moreover china has initiated events including the belt and road forum for international cooperation and the world internet conference what are the unique features of the bfa compared to other platforms how can its competitiveness and attractiveness be maintained some of these platforms are intergovernmental international conferences and some are nongovernmental forums every one of them has its own characteristics and plays a very good role the annual meeting of the bfa covers various aspects of asia emerging markets and the world economy its participants include state leaders government ministers executives of the world s top 500 enterprises and other business leaders as well as opinion leaders it is a top notch feast of ideas in terms of the popularity depth and breadth of its

difficulties and financial market shocks in addition trade frictions and geopolitical risks have created fluctuations in commodity prices exchange rates of emerging market economies such as argentina turkey and south africa fluctuated dramatically greatly affecting the stable development of the domestic economy financial markets in some asian economies with better domestic economic fundamentals have also been affected by spillover effects in addition disruptive technological innovation while promoting leapfrog economic development has also created many difficulties for policymakers artificial intelligence block chains big data cloud computing and other disruptive technologies have spawned a variety of businesses rapidly changed people s way of life and work reconfigured the value system and inspired new products and services however disruptive technological innovation can also be used to evade traditional regulation for example the vigorous development of financial science and technology has brought about such thorny and wide ranging problems as the distortion of market supply and demand caused by high frequency transactions the use of virtual money for illegal transactions the leakage of consumer financial data and cyberattacks on important financial infrastructure which may cause significant risks given unstable and uncertain economic growth prospects how should globalization be promoted and international economic rules improved the international community should adhere to multilateralism work together to promote globalization improve global trade rules and return the world economy to the track of strong sustainable balanced and inclusive growth currently it is urgent to reform the world trade organization wto and safeguard the multilateral trading system wto reform cannot be accomplished by one country or one party alone multilateral discussions and consensus are needed to promote it wto members need to deepen mutual understanding and cooperation jointly safeguard free trade actively explore ways to improve trade negotiation frameworks and establish a new global trade order as soon as possible at the same time the international community should continue to reform the international monetary system and build a global financial safety net as the core institution of this safety net the imf needs to ensure sufficient liquidity while also improving the flexibility and pertinence of loan conditions asia europe latin america and brics countries brazil russia india china and south africa are also constantly improving arrangements for providing financial assistance at the regional level since 2008 more than 70 swap agreements have been signed between more than 50 central banks around the world stabilizing market confidence in addition more equitable globalization should be promoted by strengthening infrastructure interconnection according to world bank estimates about 60 percent of the world s economic output comes from coastal areas lying within 100 km from the coastline some countries especially landlocked countries are marginalized in the process of economic globalization which in turn hinders economic globalization meanwhile some experts estimate that the mode of economic globalization characterized by tariff concessions can promote world economic growth by up to 5 percent while the new type of economic globalization driven by interconnectivity can promote world economic growth by 10 15 percent it is for this reason that president xi jinping proposed the belt and road initiative to promote a new type of globalization the initiative has been recognized and supported by more than 100 governments and international organizations and has the broad participation of the private sector across the world what role does asia play in promoting globalization and improving international economic rules faced with the rise of anti globalization sentiment and trade protectionism asian leaders have jointly voiced their firm support for economic globalization and trade and investment facilitation through various platforms and have actively promoted regional integration in may 2018 the leaders of china japan and the republic of korea met and reiterated that they should jointly safeguard free trade and promote regional economic integration the qingdao declaration of the shanghai cooperation organization summit in june pointed out that economic globalization and regional integration are the general current trend so all parties should safeguard the authority and effectiveness of wto rules consolidate an open inclusive transparent non discriminatory and rule based multilateral trading system and oppose any form of trade protectionism in mid november the east asian leaders meetings proposed trade facilitation in east asia should be further strengthened e commerce and the digital economy should be promoted and rcep negotiations covering nearly half of the world s population and nearly one third of its trade volume should be completed as soon as possible as supporters of the multilateral free trade system many share common views on improving trade liberalization and investment facilitation resisting protectionism and unilateralism and addressing climate change at a time when global economic growth is facing bottlenecks and trade rules are being challenged asian countries hope to work with countries in other parts of the world to set up a bridge for restructuring the international trade and economic order formulate and maintain new rules and contribute to the sustainable growth of the world economy currently there are many high level exchange platforms such as the world economic forum and the asia pacific economic cooperation economic leaders meeting moreover china has initiated events including the belt and road forum for international cooperation and the world internet conference what are the unique features of the bfa compared to other platforms how can its competitiveness and attractiveness be maintained some of these platforms are intergovernmental international conferences and some are nongovernmental forums every one of them has its own characteristics and plays a very good role the annual meeting of the bfa covers various aspects of asia emerging markets and the world economy its participants include state leaders government ministers executives of the world s top 500 enterprises and other business leaders as well as opinion leaders it is a top notch feast of ideas in terms of the popularity depth and breadth of its topics for its participants the bfa is willing to strengthen exchanges with other platforms for example it has exchanged observers with the world economic forum and is willing to carry out more win win cooperation with other forums copyedited by rebeca toledo

oxides demonstrate up to 97 gold recoveries the company completed the preliminary metallurgical testwork on oxide mineralisation from zone a and selin prospects at the sanankoro gold discovery in southern mali encouraging results show coarse ore gold recoveries of up to 97 are achievable using standard cyanide leaching process first stage programme tested gold recoveries on 20mm 12 5mm and 6 5mm crush sizes that yielded ranges from nearly 70 to over 97 while small subsamples from both of prospects have been further tested using 75 micron fraction in a bottle roll test which demonstrated a gold recovery of 97 for both samples suggesting good leaching kinetics and suitability of the cil process the next stage of the testwork will further assess the potential for gold recovery using either heap leach or gravity cil processes which will take two months to complete a total of 80kg collected from representative diamond drill core at the zone a and selin have been used in studies

tungsten project in cornwall new age exploration nae to acquire its 50 interest in the local operating company cornwall resources acquisition of the new age exploration s 50 interest in cornwall resources gives strategic minerals 100 ownership of the project for an agreed price of 2 66m to be paid in three tranches 1 06m in cash payable within 30 days of nae shareholders approval 0 54m as a promissory note payable 180days after settlement and a 1 5 royalty on net smelter revenues generated by any future revenue generated by redmoor to a maximum of 1 06m the consolidation of the redmoor project under sml s ownership should allow the company to pursue its project timetable and development agenda without the need to accommodate the financial constraints and potentially divergent development strategy of a partner the redmoor resource update released in february increased the inferred mineral resource estimate from the march 2018 estimate of 4 5mt at an average grade of 1 tin equivalent 0 25 tin 0 37 tungsten trioxide and 0 57 copper to a new inferred resource estimate of 11 7mt at an average grade of 1 17 tin equivalent 0 17 tin 0 56 tungsten trioxide and 0 50 copper using a 0 45 tin equivalent cut off grade we note that canadian listed strongbow exploration is currently capitalised at the equivalent of approximately 5 9m and that its principal asset the south crofty mine also in cornwall has a combined mineral resource estimate in both the upper and lower mine areas of approximately 3 1mt of indicated and inferred resources at an average grade of 1 6 tin approximately 60 of the south crofty resource is classed as indicated and although its grade is higher than that at redmoor we consider that the purchase of 50 of the redmoor project for an effective price of around 39 tonne of contained inferred tin equivalent in the resource compares favourably with the 115 t of contained tin in the indicated and inferred resources implied by the current market valuation of strongbow our analysis of previous comments from the company published in september 2018 before the recent upgrade indicated that on a conceptual basis that at a tin price of us 22 000 tonne and a tungsten price of us 330 metric tonne unit a resource tonnage closer to 10mt would be required for a viable project offering adequate returns the february 2019 update even though only delineating an inferred resource makes an important step towards addressing this issue the new estimate confirmed the continuity of the sheeted vein system svs which hosts the high grade zones over a strike length exceeding 1 000m and for some 650m down dip implying that additional work could further extend the scale of the deposit although we speculate that the company might wish to deploy at

welcome to this week s market wrap podcast i m mike gleason coming up michael pento of pento portfolio strategies joins me for a must hear conversation on why he believes central bankers must perpetually keep interest rates near zero and the massive inflationary bubble economy that will likely result also find out how michael is approaching gold and gold related investments for his clients right now don t miss a tremendous interview with michael pento coming up after this week s market update precious metals markets are trading mixed this week as gold struggles to regain the 1 300 level gold prices pushed higher mid week but got pulled back down on thursday as of this friday recording the yellow metal comes in just above that key physiological level at 1 303 an ounce up a very slight 0 3 for the week silver looks lower by just a couple cents or 0 3 this week to bring spot prices to 15 36 an ounce the platinum market shows a weekly gain of 1 6 to trade at 834 and finally palladium is leading the precious metals pack once again advancing 2 4 this week to trade at 1 559 per ounce palladium finds itself just few dollars shy of another new record high it has been recording all time highs with regularity this year over the past three years palladium prices have tripled in value one of the real world consequences is a rise in catalytic converter thefts from parked vehicles a car s catalytic converter typically contains platinum or palladium in relatively small amounts the metals help remove harmful pollutants from emissions in recent years automakers have favored palladium for use in the converters of most gasoline powered vehicles that decision seemed smart when palladium prices were cheap now that they are approaching sky high territory automakers are fretting and many car owners across the country are facing costly replacement bills for stolen catalytic converters thieves eager to cash in on high palladium prices are targeting everything from students cars to church vans some in law enforcement are calling on car manufacturers to install anti theft cages around catalytic converters to deter thieves in the meantime motorists are being advised to install vehicle alarms and avoid parking their vehicles in unsecure wide open areas where thieves like to operate unfortunately bull markets in metals bring out the worst in some elements of society when copper prices were at record highs criminals set their sights on homes construction sites and electrical infrastructure when other base metals were flying high a few years ago some cities even suffered thefts on manhole covers when gold prices were setting records day after day from 2010 to 2011 scammers came out of the woodwork some ran slick television ads on cable tv news programs touting the value of gold but then sold customers overpriced coins falsely touted as rare some of these shady coin dealers got hit with lawsuits over their fraudulent and deceptive business practices unfortunately bait and switch rare coin peddlers haven t really gone away they will undoubtedly be back in bigger numbers to prey upon the uninformed when the gold market is grabbing headlines and

delay let s get right to this week s exclusive interview mike gleason it is my privilege now to welcome back michael pento president and founder of pento portfolio strategies michael is well known money manager and a terrific market commentator and author of the book the coming bond market collapse how to survive the demise of the u s debt market he s been a regular guest right here on the money metals podcast and we always love getting his wonderful insights michael thanks for the time again today and welcome back michael pento hey looking forward to be back on with you again mike mike gleason to begin as a primer for our discussion today i wanted to turn back the clock a bit and revisit some of what we were talking about during our last conversation now when we had you on back at the very end of november we were in the midst of what was a pretty bearish time and the stock market and that continued up until christmas but then treasury secretary steven mnuchin came out and made some interesting comments and also met with the heads of many of the nation s biggest banks and sure enough in the weeks following the equity markets went on a tear so did you watch what transpired there michael and come away with some of the same suspicions that we did that being that the powers that be worked in concert to keep the wheels on the markets and help it rebound from a very rough ending to 2018 or was the market simply due for a bounce back after a late year selloff touch on that first if you would before we get into other topics michael pento sure my pleasure i believe the market bounced and by the way i was short from a september late september all the way through christmas eve so i covered my shorts in the portfolio in the inflation deflation portfolio i then went long a little bit too early obviously in january so i m on the wrong side of that particular part of the trade although that s offset by longs in other stuff like gold and in treasuries and utilities but the reason why the market in general bounced is because how many times can you hear that the trade deal between xi jinping and trump is going to be fantastic and it s going to happen imminently so i firmly believe mike that nobody wants to be under the market or short the market especially in front of the imminent announcement of a trade deal that s number one number two is of course the move from an extremely hawkish jerome powell one that was going to raise rates to three and a half percent on the fed funds rate and was promising that the quantitative tightening program was going to remain on autopilot just like the predecessor janet yellen assured that it would be like watching paint dry of course none of those things happened and it totally seized up the high yield and junk bond market stock market drops 25 to 30 depending on the index you look at and of course that through the fed into fits so they came out and moved from being hawkish to being more dovish although i hasten to add i want to add two things why i still by the way still have a short buffer in the portfolio is number one is mike the trade deal or the trade tensions have nothing to do virtually nothing to do with the plunge in global growth in the global economy virtually nothing first of all i can prove that by claiming the facts the facts are that chinese exports to the united states increased by 11 in 2018 and exports from the u s to china we re up by a little bit less than 1 so trade actually increased and it led to huge buildup in inventories which is a plus the gdp because people were front row and front running the tariffs that we re going to go up supposedly in january and then they were supposed to go up again in march of course that has never happened so the trade conflagration has nothing to do with this collapse in global growth which we ll get into later that is not what hurt the global economy number two is the federal reserve did move incrementally more dovish however i hasten to add this this event is not lowering interest rates at this juncture that s number one number two the fed is still in the process of its quantitative tightening programs still unwinding burning about 40 billion worth of its assets per month now that s going to change that s going to end probably in october they ll let us know in the march meeting the fomc will let us know when that process is going to end but again the fed reserve is not dovish a dovish federal reserve is one that has hundreds of basis points on the fed funds rate that they are in the process of reducing or one that is in the process of buying assets and increasing its balance sheet that is a dovish fed we do not have that at all as a matter of fact if you look overseas or you look abroad other central banks like japan the boj and the ecb the european central bank have no room to reduce interest rates so if i m correct and economic cycle has turned and we were heading into a global recession then i would be very hesitant to go out and buy shares of the s p 500 at 18 times trailing 12 month earnings which by the way these earnings are falling mike gleason michael you wrote something recently about the extraordinary levels of consumer debt in the u s and mounting evidence of a crisis building you noted there are now more than 7 million car loans delinquent more than 90 days and an overall debt levels are higher than just prior to the 2008 financial crisis yes the real estate mortgage market might be healthier now but the fundamental problem of a nation choking on unpayable levels of debt has certainly not been solved share some of your observations about the current state of this slow motion crisis and what are some of the signs to look for with regards to the wheels finally coming off and this debt cycle shifting away from expansion into contraction michael pento well okay we haven t solved any of the problems that were extent in 2008 what we did was take interest rates down to 0 from five and a quarter percent in fact the whole world reduced interest rates are virtually 0 which engendered a huge increase in the amount of debt outstanding the s p ratings agency just said that debt has increased by 50 globally you ve increased the debt level by 50 other metrics are showing that we have 250 trillion of global debt right now and that s 330 of global gdp a you record high if you look what is going on in china for instance chinese household debt this is not me this is an independent agency called the s p 500 ratings agency this is not what michael pento has come up with household debt in china is up 716 since 2008 non financial corporate debt up 400 in 10 years total government debt up 416 in china in the last 10 years now that s just china but you look at the record high amount of corporate debt here in the united states to 9 trillion from 6 trillion if you look at a record amount of household that you ll get a doubling and then 2 trillion more of a government debt here in the united states what we ve done is we ve enabled we ve juggled using smoke and mirrors all of this phony economy by taking debt up to record high levels and making it sustainable by keeping interest rates at 0 which has also engendered asset bubbles that are out of this world in other words the home price to income ratio in the united states right now is 4 5 to one the record high was 5 3 but the average is three to three and a half so you have a whole group of gen xers or millennials that cannot afford their house because they re buried in student loans and their incomes are woefully insufficient to purchase home prices that are way above their salaries that s just in real estate look at the stock market back to 140 of gdp when the average of that metric is 60 of gdp we ve all of these bubbles they re supported by records amount of debt that are in turn supported by interest rates and borrowing costs that are 0 so this is a very unhealthy very dangerous cocktail that could blow up at any moment mike gleason yeah it seems like the question is just a matter of when not if when it comes to that blow up now we aren t political commentators and i know your focus is on economics and markets though these days it is hard to keep the markets and politics separated so we thought it would be fun to get your take on where you think the proverbial ship is headed the federal government is back to running trillion dollar deficits and there s almost no one left in washington who seems to care much about it in fact there are some avowed socialists who think government should be doing a whole lot more and they are getting ready to challenge donald trump in 2020 we don t know how good the chances are of a socialist getting elected but there is little doubt the ideology is increasing in popularity would you care to comment on what you think our listeners should expect out of washington over the next few years michael pento well this is even if you re a big believer in republicans i m a libertarian so i just come out and say i voted for donald trump and i m a libertarian by nature even the republicans or more and more like enemies of the free market so what i m trying to say to you is that across the globe there is an intractable move towards communism socialism and the abolition and abrogation of free markets so the control of governments no matter who you vote for of course if you vote for someone like a bernie sanders is going to be worse than if you voted for donald trump but the point of the matter is that nobody believes in markets any longer so we don t have a president who wants a fair and honest interest rate we don t have a central banker that wants an honest interest rate we don t have a politician who wants an honest interest rate we don t want to protect savers we don t want to protect retirees what we have become in this country and around the world are purveyors of asset bubbles that is the only job now of central bankers and politicians is to ensure since they ve usurped the power of the free market and taking it upon themselves they have one mandate it is only this to make sure asset prices and that s is the value of bonds the value of equities the value of real estate never fall that is their only mandate that s so sad to say but no matter who you vote for you can be assured that your freedoms will be usurped and you can be assured that free markets will become more and more extinguished and extinct mike gleason what are the dangers the long term dangers i know we talk about this a lot but just to expand on it if you would in terms of not letting markets ever correct i mean this sort of gets back to the whole idea of the difference between say austrian economics and keynesian economics markets do need to correct do they not michael pento mike the markets have become the economy so this was the determination made by jerome powell and the time span between october 3rd and december 24th so he then realized that his reverse qe program or quantitative tightening taking money out of the system when you ve already sent asset bubbles astronomically above the underlying economy was an untenable position and he realized this because the high yield market see he stopped there wasn t any issuance not one high yield bond was issued in the fourth quarter in december so they understood that the level of junk bonds the price level of junk bonds and the level of the stock market and the condition of solvency or perceived solvency of pension plans all hinged upon the level of asset prices stocks and bonds and real estate and once those prices corrected and by the way they were only down 25 20 to 30 depending on the index 30 on the russell and a little less on the s p 500 but it was determined that this is very quickly it was determined that this cannot be allowed to occur but here s the problem that i see you saw nothing so you asked me well then michael why don t a central banks just stay at zero and just keep printing money well eventually mike they re going to get the inflation that they so desire and when that happens every fixed income instrument that is not being actively purchased by the central bank will implode and yields will skyrocket and inflation by the way is going to wipe out any vestige left in the middle class but here s what quantitative easing does accomplish it does if it s protracted and immense in nature it can produce asset bubbles that we know but we also are aware that quantitative easing money printing just think of monetizing debt it s something that you hear about this modern monetary theory it s all a recycling of the same theory and the same thing is tried had been tried over and over again where the government just prints up just spends money and the central bank buys it prints it but it does not do anything for the underlying economy that s why you see total market capital gdp far astronomically far above the underlying economy so let s look at some of the data that we see around the world today so u s retail sales plunge a couple of months ago not the nonfarm payroll report for february showed a net number of jobs of 20 000 housing starts are down double digits existing home sales went to a three and a half year low let s look overseas where they just got out of qe in december europe s growth is practically zero italy is a 0 gdp germany is at 0 gdp japan as a 0 gdp growth the united states if you look at the atlanta fed our q1 gdp growth is projected to be 0 4 from 4 2 in q2 of last year and when you think about all this the earnings per share on the s p 500 which was once growing at 28 at the height of all his global qe when it was 180 billion every freaking month would now it s zero the earnings per share has gone from 28 growth to negative three and a half percent according to factset for q1 so this is what we ve been gendered in this is what we ve created in the world this is an artificial world totally dependent upon perpetual interest rates at 0 and never ending quantitative easing or debt monetization that s where we re at unfortunately markets no longer exists there is no more free mortgage in the fixed income spectrum and in most other areas of the world there is no free market for equities mike gleason yeah very well put couldn t agree more wells as we begin to close we definitely want to get your take on the gold and silver market specifically here the metal s got off to a great start this year we saw a pullback at the end of february now we re seeing a bit of a rally again the metals are going to need a catalyst in order to get something serious going to the upside at this moment we can see some potential drivers some volatility and selling coming back in the equities markets could push metals higher but we aren t a sure we re going to see that happen in the very near future what do you make of the current landscape for metals and what are you expecting in the weeks ahead michael pento so here s where what s going on and we are at a record high position for gold in the inflation deflation and economic cycle model that i run here at pento port so why is that okay why is that the case so we were a 5 goal when it was crashing in 2016 and 17 but we are now at 22 gold and gold related investments so why is that the case because nominal interest rates there s been a proclamation from central bankers that nominal interest rates can never go above zero you look at the negative rates now in japan the german boom has a yield going out 10 years now of 0 7 so interest rates can never be allowed to rise if you look at our 10 year note is now at least in the terms of yields is in a bear market so a bull market and bond prices in a bear market in that yield and when you come to the realization that nominal rates can never really get much above zero that s a rocket fuel for gold because gold loves are interest rates that are close to zero and falling because it doesn t produce any income it just preserves your purchasing power i say just in quotations just is pretty important now because its central banks are also going to have to resort to a return to quantitative easing i believe that the ecb is moving in that direction they also extended the tltlro which is a targeted long term refinancing operation basically just to spell it out for your audience it s basically when the central bank makes loans to commercial banks and commercial banks don t have to pay back the central bank if they make that loan to the private sector they don t have to pay back all of that debt so it s a negative interest loan to commercial banks they re more than incentivized to throw money into the real economy so you get and this was the same thing that the quantitative easing does it s an increase it leads to an increase in the money supply which tends to erode the faith and fiat currencies which of course leads to inflation so that means that real interest rates are going to be very much negative they are negative and they re going to be coming more and more negative and finally i think that eventually as this condition of stagflation at first is going to pervade across the entire globe and it s going to wax worse and worse with greater and greater intensity and then finally i believe the imf is going to have to come in and reset all of all the debt and all of the currencies together concurrently i think that s going to destroy all the faith and fiat currencies that includes the u s dollar so the u s dollar will seed its world s reserve currency status because of that fact and that means that gold is going to benefit from three things three things that are rocket fuel gold is going benefit from 0 nominal rates and below real interest rates that are negative and heading lower and the end of the u s dollar as a strong and independent reserve currency that s why i own gold now more than ever and i intend on only increasing that allocation as my predictions span out mike gleason yeah certainly would be a massive flight to safety into the yellow metal if that does transpire very interesting comments as always we ll leave it there we thank you again for your time and your wonderful commentary and look forward to catching up with you again down the road as this begins to unfold now before we let you go

money and i ll tell you one thing s for sure is that if you look at over the next few years one thing is for sure is that the control over the market is going to go in the hands more and more to the central planners and they are going to need it to default upon all of this debt this 250 trillion of debt which is up astronomically as a percentage of gdp and in nominal terms since the great recession occurred they are going to need to default on this debt either through or actually both in different times either through inflation or deflation so there s going to be an explicit restructuring which is very deflationary but before that there s going to be a massive bout of stagflation in fact i think that s already starting across the globe so what you re going to see in the short term is a recession and deflation followed by years of stagflation and then finally that great reset which is going to be a deflationary wipe out of the global economy and that means that you need an active strategy to navigate those treacherous waters and that s exactly what i do what i created with my 20 point model known as the inflation deflation and economic cycle model and investment strategy mike gleason yeah that s fantastic stuff people do need to keep in mind that the old days of just buying an index fund and sitting back and watching it to go higher probably coming to an end and michael would be a fantastic person to look at to switch some of those funds and he s got a great handle on the markets as you just heard well thanks again i appreciate the time hope you have a

this article is more than 5 years old getty ibm is paving the way for banks and other regulated financial institutions to join the blockchain revolution rather than going through a series of intermediaries when sending money across borders ibm has created a real time global payments network to support cross border transactions and foreign exchange in more than 50 countries using digital assets also known as cryptocurrencies or stable coins ibm blockchain world wire will help financial institutions improve the services they deliver to their consumers by optimizing and accelerating foreign exchange cross border payments and remittances using the stellar protocol world wire serves as a network provider for international payments enabling point to point money transfers in lieu of the complexities of conventional correspondent banking while ibm announced an initial pilot of world wire in october 2017 today the network is officially accessible in a growing number of markets we ve created a new type of payment network designed to accelerate remittances and transform cross border payments to facilitate the movement of money in countries that need it most said marie wieck general manager ibm blockchain by creating a network where financial institutions support multiple digital assets we expect to spur innovation and improve financial inclusion worldwide according to ibm world wire is the first blockchain network of its kind to integrate payment messaging clearing and settlement on a single unified platform participants are also allowed to dynamically choose from a variety of digital assets for settlement currently world wire has enabled payment locations in 72 countries with 48 currencies and 44 banking endpoints we ve created a new type of payment network that is unique in the sense that it streamlines the ability of businesses and consumers to move money around the world in real time this enables improved transparency without sacrificing the regulatory controls and policies we need in order to make sure that there aren t bad actors in the system we are convening a brand new network in 72 countries that will support pay in and payout end points in 48 currencies jesse lund head of ibm blockchain told me during a detailed podcast interview the world wire network currently supports settlement using stellar lumens xlm and a u s dollar stable coin through ibm s previously announced collaboration with stronghold personally i think cryptocurrencies could very well serve as a viable settlement instrument we ve started with lumens which is the native asset of the stellar network but we already have the capacity to introduce other cryptocurrencies that could include bitcoin or ether we will add more digital assets based on client demand and participants on the network said lund as local regulations continue to guide activation for the world wire network additional financial institutions across the globe have expressed interest in joining pending regulatory consent six international banks including bank busan and rizal commercial banking corporation rcbc have all signed letters of intent to issue their own stable coins on world wire upon approval this will add euro indonesian rupiah philippine peso korean won and brazilian real stable coins to the world wire network rcbc is pleased to be an early innovator with plans to issue our own peso stable coin on world wire pending final approval from our regulators said emmanuel narciso group head global transaction banking rcbc we re focused on innovation that adds value for our customers and world wire presents a tremendous opportunity to transform and enhance our payment infrastructure what this means for consumers one reason a number of banks and other regulated financial institutions have expressed interest in joining world wire is due to the benefits the network could offer to those sending money across borders international money transfers also known as remittances account for a significant aspect of the global economy according to economists at the world bank migrants across the world sent an estimated 574 billion to relatives in their home countries in 2016 the united states is currently the largest source of international remittances in the world sending a total of 56 3 billion in 2015 with the exception of the 2008 global financial crisis remittances sent from the u s have been consistently climbing for the past half century yet sending money across borders today requires a series of intermediaries for both clearing and settlement adding time and cost to the process with world wire clearing and settlement happens in near real time as the network uses digital assets like cryptocurrencies and stable coins to settle transactions these assets serve as an agreed upon store of value exchanged between parties meaning funds can be transferred at a fraction of the cost and time of traditional correspondent banking the stable coin we ve currently come to market with is a usd backed stable coin which is the easiest to use by default remember this network is designed for cross border payments where foreign exchange needs to be an inherent part of the capability most fx activities around the world tend to price through the us dollar so it s natural that the highest demand for participants on the network are willing to settle in us dollars explained lund the usd stable coin is an fdic insured coin that is pegged one for one with the us dollar in fact any usd stable coin on the world wire network represents a literal claim on deposits with a chartered bank in the united states this is just the beginning though we are now getting demand from banks all over the world who want to issue their own stable coins this network really has the potential to radically transform foreign exchange entirely moreover according to lund the stellar protocol offers clear benefits in terms of using blockchain technology to facilitate cross border payments through the world wire network we were looking for a blockchain protocol that could compliment what we ve been doing in the enterprise blockchain space which is private and permissioned but as we looked at that other space which is a public permissioned network we needed a protocol that had the capacity to issue tokens and have scalability stellar emerged pretty clearly as it provided the scalability we needed to support the transaction volumes we were looking at which is thousands of transactions per second explained lund
by brad tank chief investment officer fixed income the ecb s accommodative stance removes one more obstacle from a global soft landing as my colleagues and i prepare our latest quarterly fixed income investment outlook it is worth recalling that our last one which came off the press on december 19 and was battered by the winter storm in markets made a bold call for a soft landing for the economy three months and 150 basis points of high yield spread tightening later those wintry markets have calmed down and come around to our way of thinking still our thesis has yet to play out in full it depended firstly on central banks recognizing the need for a more accommodative stance and secondly on a stabilization and recovery in economic data out of china and europe how far have we come to clearing those hurdles momentum as i wrote back in january we got good reassurance from jerome powell then that the federal reserve is not the threat the messaging around holding rates steady over the coming months was much clearer than it had been in december and powell even departed from his strict data dependency line to acknowledge that the fomc was sensitive to what the market was telling it that gave the new year bounce some strong momentum just over a week ago the european central bank got its opportunity to reinforce that message on the positive side the central bank surprised markets with an earlier than expected announcement of new targeted long term refinancing operations tltro 3 and an extension to its forward guidance on the deposit rate which remains negative the tltro 3 loans would be offered quarterly at two years maturity with a cap on how much any one bank can borrow winter chill thereafter the message darkened as mario draghi presented the central bank s revised growth and inflation forecasts for the eurozone this year s gdp growth rate was cut from 1 7 to 1 1 and 2019 inflation was revised down from 1 6 to 1 2 with no sign of the near 2 target through 2020 and 2021 the ecb has been much more optimistic than the markets for some time and while those revisions could be viewed as simply closing that gap they still came as a bit of a shock additionally draghi acknowledged that the slowdown probably isn t temporary he repeated his consistent message that eurozone fiscal policy could be more accommodating and that structural reforms need to be stepped up substantially european bank stocks got a late blast of the winter chill losing more than 5 over the course of two trading sessions the euro weakened and bund yields plummeted leaving the german yield curve at its flattest for nearly three years and negative out to more than nine years accommodative with a week to digest the news however investors appear to have acknowledged that on balance tltro 3 adds to the accommodative environment prepared by the fed in january both u s and european equity indices recovered their post ecb losses with banks pulling back at least some ground germany s dax index is up 1 5 as i write on friday and italian government bonds have tightened by five basis points against german bunds on the underlying economic performance there is still work to do while u s data has stabilized at reasonable levels acknowledging some noise from bad weather and the government shutdown most numbers out of china and europe continue to get worse we need to see china s stimulus efforts gaining more traction over the coming months to underpin a recovery in the global growth oriented economies of europe japan and the emerging world we believe that is what we will get in the meantime i think we can chalk up this quarter s moves from the fed and the ecb as a clearance of the first hurdle for our soft landing thesis in case you missed it u s retail sales 0 2 in

million and increased 7 or 1 3 million respectively the fourth quarter decrease in 2018 compared to the fourth quarter 2017 primarily relates to a reduction in legal fees of 1 1 million this reduction is related to costs incurred in relation to the cotter litigation that did not go to trial the 1 3 million increase for the full year is primarily related to an increase in payroll related expenses attributable to reversal in 2017 for prior year incentive compensation accruals not deemed necessary offset by a decrease in legal and professional services gain on insurance recoveries during 2017 we recognized a non recurring 9 2 million gain from the final insurance settlement relating to the earthquake damage on our courtenay central parking structure excluding business interruption insurance

other financial information balance sheet and liquidity total assets increased by 15 6 million to 439 0 million at december 31 2018 compared to 423 4 million at december 31 2017 primarily driven by

6 million in the u s 3 5 million in australia and 2 0 million in new zealand we manage our cash investments and capital structure so we are able to meet short term and long term obligations for our business while maintaining financial flexibility and liquidity as part of our operating cycle we utilize cash collected from i our cinema business when selling tickets and f b items and ii rental income typically received in advance to first reduce our long term borrowings and realize savings on interest charges we then settle our operating expenses generally with a lag within traditional trade terms this generates a temporary working capital deficit we review the maturities of our borrowings and negotiate for renewals and extensions as necessary for liquidity purposes we believe the cash flow generated from our operations coupled with the proceeds on property sales and our ability to renew loans when due will provide sufficient liquidity in the upcoming year other information our

global operating strategy is to conduct business mostly on a self funding basis except for funds used to pay an appropriate share of our u s corporate overhead however we may decide to move funds between jurisdictions where circumstances merit such action as part of our goal to minimize our cost of capital non gaap financial measures this earnings release presents aggregate segment operating income and ebitda which are important financial measures for the company but are not financial measures defined by u s gaap these measures should be reviewed in conjunction with the relevant u s gaap financial measures and are not presented as alternative measures of eps cash flows or net income as determined in accordance with us gaap aggregate segment operating income and ebitda as we have calculated them may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies aggregate segment operating income we evaluate the performance of our business segments based on segment operating income and management uses aggregate segment operating income as a measure of the performance of operating businesses separate from non operating factors we believe that information about aggregate segment operating income assists investors by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of the company s business separate from non operational factors that affect net income thus providing separate insight into both operations and the other factors that affect reported results refer to consolidated and non segment results for a reconciliation of segment operating income to net income ebitda we present ebitda as a supplemental measure of its performance which is commonly used in our industry we define ebitda as net income adjusted for interest expense net of interest income income tax expense depreciation and amortization expense and an adjustment of interest expense depreciation and amortization for discontinued operations if any ebitda is a non gaap financial measure commonly used in our industry and should not be construed as an alternative to net earnings loss as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity as determined in accordance with u s gaap we have included ebitda in this earnings release as we believe that it provides management and our investors with additional information necessary to properly measure our performance and liquidity estimate our value and evaluate our ability to service debt adjusted ebitda using the principles we consistently apply to determine our ebitda we further adjusted the ebitda for certain items we believe are appropriate adjustable items described as follows gain on insurance recoveries this refers to the excess of insurance proceeds over our damaged property s book value and related demolition costs we excluded the portion allocated to the recoupment of lost business income we have considered this to be an appropriate adjustment for purposes of determining adjusted ebitda in accordance with the 2 year sec requirement for determining an item as non recurring infrequent or unusual in nature this refers to the excess of insurance proceeds over our damaged property s book value and related demolition costs we excluded the portion allocated to the recoupment of lost business income we have considered this to be an appropriate adjustment for purposes of determining adjusted ebitda in accordance with the 2 year sec requirement for determining an item as non recurring infrequent or unusual in nature legal expenses relating to the derivative litigation the james j cotter jr employment arbitration and other cotter litigation matters while we started to incur expenses in relation to these legal matters in 2015 we believe that the majority of these costs were thrust upon the company as it became necessary to defend the company s position in the derivative litigation and related matters to resolve mr cotter jr s claims relating to his termination and to protect our company s interests and that of our shareholders in light of mr cotter jr s efforts to effect a change of control of our company for this reason these costs should also be treated as non recurring in nature and accordingly an adjustable item for purposes of determining our adjusted ebitda we have not made adjustments for any gains relating to property sales including our realized gain on the burwood property in line with our overall business strategy that at any time we may decide to dispose of any property when we believe that an asset has reached the highest value that we could reasonably achieve without investing substantial additional sums for land use planning construction and marketing the reconciliation of ebitda to

0 million at december 31 2018 compared to 423 4 million at december 31 2017 primarily driven by increases in our operating and investing properties relating to capital enhancements in our existing

brisbane australia cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2018 were 13 1 million including 7 6 million in the u s 3 5 million in australia and 2 0 million in new zealand we manage our cash investments and capital structure so we are able to meet short term and long term obligations for our business while maintaining financial flexibility and liquidity as part of our operating cycle we utilize cash collected from i our cinema business when selling tickets and f b items and ii rental income typically received in advance to first reduce our long term borrowings and realize savings on interest charges we then settle our operating expenses generally with a lag within traditional trade terms this generates a temporary working capital deficit we review the maturities of our borrowings and negotiate for renewals and extensions as necessary for liquidity purposes we believe the cash flow generated from our operations coupled with the proceeds on property sales and our ability to renew loans when due will provide sufficient liquidity in the upcoming year other information our stock repurchase program that expired on march 2 2019 has been extended by our board of directors

operating businesses separate from non operating factors we believe that information about aggregate segment operating income assists investors by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of the company s business separate from non operational factors that affect net income thus providing separate insight into both operations and the other factors that affect reported results refer to consolidated and non segment results for a reconciliation of segment operating income to net income ebitda we present ebitda as a supplemental measure of its performance which is commonly used in our industry we define ebitda as net income adjusted for interest expense net of interest income income tax expense depreciation and amortization expense and an adjustment of interest expense depreciation and amortization for discontinued operations if any ebitda is a non gaap financial measure commonly used in our industry and should not be construed as an alternative to net earnings loss as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity as determined in accordance with u s gaap we have included ebitda in this earnings release as we believe that it provides management and our investors with additional information necessary to properly measure our performance and liquidity estimate our value and evaluate our ability to service debt adjusted ebitda using the principles we consistently apply to determine our ebitda we further adjusted the ebitda for certain items we believe are appropriate adjustable items described as follows gain on insurance recoveries this refers to the excess of insurance proceeds over our damaged property s book value and related demolition costs we excluded the portion allocated to the recoupment of lost business income we have considered this to be an appropriate adjustment for purposes of determining adjusted ebitda in accordance with the 2 year sec requirement for determining an item as non recurring infrequent or unusual in nature this refers to the excess of insurance proceeds over our damaged property s book value and related demolition costs we excluded the portion allocated to the recoupment of lost business income we have considered this to be an appropriate adjustment for purposes of determining adjusted ebitda in accordance with the 2 year sec requirement for determining an item as non recurring infrequent or unusual in nature legal expenses relating to the derivative litigation the james j cotter jr employment arbitration and other cotter litigation matters while we started to incur expenses in relation to these legal matters in 2015 we believe that the majority of these costs were thrust upon the company as it became necessary to defend the company s position in the derivative litigation and related matters to resolve mr cotter jr s claims relating to his termination and to protect our company s interests and that of our shareholders in light of mr cotter jr s efforts to effect a change of control of our company for this reason these costs should also be treated as non recurring in nature and accordingly an adjustable item for purposes of determining our adjusted ebitda we have not made adjustments for any gains relating to property sales including our realized gain on the burwood property in line with our overall business strategy that at any time we may decide to dispose of any property when we believe that an asset has reached the highest value that we could reasonably achieve without investing

wall street wants more stimulus from china more money from the government is a backstop to equities so why not sadly judging by this week s two sessions meeting in beijing they are not going to get what the chinese government used to give the communist party leaders are meeting this week to iron out the economic wrinkles and discuss what sectors of the economy should be opened up to increased foreign direct investment china has reached a point where it needs more foreign capital to grow here is what we know about the current fiscal and monetary stimulus plans coming out of china so far lower taxes but no corporate income tax breaks premier li keqiang announced yesterday that the government will reduce taxes and fees totaling 2 trillion yuan or around 298 billion this year that s almost twice as much fiscal stimulus than originally planned last year china made 1 3 trillion yuan in tax cuts as the economy showed signs of slowing amidst a creeping trade war with the u s cutting the vat and social security tax sst are the major components of the announced package but the contribution from each component was not mentioned during yesterday s meeting at the national people s congress in beijing to support the tax and fee cuts for the corporate sector beijing is asking state owned banks and some of its state owned enterprises to hand over larger portions of their profits this is a potential headwind for the ishares china large cap fxi exchange traded fund which is heavily invested in chinese soes and banks fxi was down 0 3 early wednesday underperforming the deutsche china a shares ashr etf li also said government officials will need to live within their means there are plans to reduce government spending on official overseas visits and even local travel for politicians general public expenditures will also be reduced beijing cut vat rates to 16 for manufacturing and 10 for agriculture transport service construction leasing services wholesale and retail sales and real estate the vat rate of 6 bracket remains for financial telecom and other services the three percentage points cut off the manufacturing vat tax was within market estimates but the other vat reductions were less than expected nomura securities economist ting lu estimates the announced vat rate cuts could save taxpayers around 617 billion yuan below market expectations but that is because a considerable proportion of high tech enterprises are already benefitting from tax reductions due to special tax treatments within the social security tax system provincial governments will be given more leeway as to how much they can cut from paychecks li said companies do not have to pay for back sst taxes owed in china an employer s contribution rate for pensions can be cut to 16 depending on the province where the company has set up shop for example the pension tax rates for employers in some cities such as guangzhou and shenzhen have been reduced to 14 for some time now it is unclear if those important china cities will lower rates even more if investors were hoping for the equivalent of a c corp tax break their hopes were dashed by keqiang on tuesday the same goes for real estate this year s report maintained the same line on real estate as it did last year with the goal of maintaining a stable and healthy development of the property sector seeing how china is a top down centrally managed economy li said electricity costs for manufacturing industrial and commercial use should be cut by 10 sell china utilities monetary policy interest rates remain low and dependent on inflation inflation is forecast to come in under 3 premier li called for more efforts to resolve the financing difficulties in the corporate sector especially for small and medium size enterprises he requested the central bank devise more targeted reserve ratio requirement cuts so smaller banks wopuld open up their accounts to loan to smaller businesses in china he also said he wanted to see larger banks increase credit supply to the market especially long term bank loans for manufacturing he said he will require the large state owned banks to increase loans to smaller businesses by more than 30 this year so china has a mandate from the government now to lend to small and midsize businesses market access china s national development reform commission chairman he lifeng said during a press conference on wednesday that the country should open up agriculture mining manufacturing and more service industries to foreign companies consumer spending accounted for 76 5 of gdp growth in 2018 and has become the floor in which the chinese economy stands on in case of tariff escalation from washington one of the takeaways from this week s npc talks was beijing s interest in boosting domestic consumption it ranked fourth on the task list of the 2019 government work report compared to seventh in the 2018 report ting of nomura pointed out this is a sign that beijing is increasingly recognizing short term headwinds and is attempting to stimulate domestic consumption to stem the slowdown he says yesterday s working report also mentioned deepening reforms in electricity oil gas and railway industries which implies these mostly state run industries could experience more forceful reforms this year more importantly equal treatment to foreign companies under chinese law was also a highlight though it is also unclear if this goes into effect immediately unfair treatment by chinese regulators and the courts is a top concern among u s businesses in china according to a recent survey by the american chamber of commerce in china as far as more opening up of the chinese economy is concerned this year s working report on foreign investment went from promoting stable foreign investment growth last year to increasing the attraction to foreign capital last year marked the 40th anniversary of china s opening to the world the report also promises to further allow for the operation of wholly foreign owned enterprises in more industries this suggests china is determined to have a more open attitude to foreign capital though this could be rhetoric designed to placate washington into thinking they are somehow winning the trade war by forcing china to become a freer market so far this year investors have seen a massive rally in chinese stocks thanks to increased exposure to mainland equities in the msci china index and positive developments in the trade war but investors who are expecting more stimulus might end up being disappointed unless state banks start handing out loans to any company out there just to keep gdp within target it s possible so long as the market perceives tariffs are no longer going up and china may or may not benefit from expanding credit then china stocks are likely to recover from last year s bear market source forbes
the has been in an uptrend for most of the quarter but in the past week the greenback lost momentum and its decline has some investors wondering if the dollar will continue to fall ahead of this week s federal reserve we ll discuss this and more when we focus on the greenback but the combination of softer data and stronger risk appetite made it difficult for the dollar to rally us data has disappointed for some time but the greenback hit multi month highs earlier this month because the uncertainty and weakness abroad was greater than the problems at home part of those concerns faded last week after the uk voted to rule out the no deal brexit that would have plunged britain europe and a large swath of the financial markets into a chaotic void equities rallied across the globe and the improvement in risk appetite helped lift high beta currencies like and looking ahead will remain in focus with a third brexit vote on tuesday and a bank of england thursday the federal reserve

in existing home sales key levels support 111 00 resistance 112 00 fed meeting an excuse to sell dollars this week s federal reserve could give investors an excuse to sell no changes are expected from the fed but follow every meeting this year and chairman powell s comments could send the greenback lower even though there have been more improvements than deterioration in the us economy since the last central bank meeting the fed is in no rush to raise interest rates last week we learned that increased by only 0 2 in january as slowed to 20k in february the housing market has peaked with rising interest rates slowing new and existing home sales growth while manufacturing and service sector activity recovered the us trade deficit hit an all time high most importantly inflation is low with consumer price growth easing to 1 5 from 1 9 in february so even if the central bank finds the uptick in confidence wages economic activity encouraging low inflation gives them the flexibility to hold off tightening until there are signs of consistent strength in the economy when the fed last met the dollar plunged after they removed the reference to further gradual rate increases from their monetary policy statement we don t expect the dollar to crash at this upcoming meeting but we can expect powell to his patient approach on rates which could be enough to encourage profit taking on long dollar positions one of the primary reasons why the dollar outperformed in the first quarter is relative weakness abroad but as some big uncertainties subside money could flow back into riskier currencies and riskier assets britain still doesn t have a brexit deal but at least we know that they won t be spinning out without an agreement slower growth in china has been a big problem for the rest of the world but tax cuts could provide a big boost to the economy the prospect of improvements could make other investments more attractive easing demand for us dollars even as the us economy outperforms in the long run however demand for the greenback should remain strong as the fed remains the only major central bank to raise interest rates this year is in an uptrend but if it falls back below 111 we should see a deeper slide towards 110 the bank of japan left interest rates unchanged last week but lowered its export and output assessment in response to terrible trade numbers data

tax cuts coming for china the improvement in risk appetite helped all 3 commodity currencies come off their lows last week but their recoveries were modest compared to the moves in european currencies the problem is that investors have no idea if and when a trade deal between the us and china will be reached every time president trump says they are close the agreement comes apart at the last minute it s true this time as well as the meeting and signing summit between trump xi gets pushed back to at least april talks aren t going as well as us president has suggested and in his own words he s in no rush to complete a deal now that equities are recovering so any support for asian assets will have to come from china s domestic policy measures thankfully china is cutting taxes in a package worth more than 2 trillion yuan starting april 1st the value added tax for various sectors will be lowered in an effort to bring relief to businesses and consumers will it help the economy absolutely will it be enough to turn around growth probably not labor market numbers are scheduled for release from australia this week and while business confidence declined we are looking for stronger job growth

near term bottom rising helped to drive the canadian dollar higher over the past week but the rally lost steam as the pair found support above 1 33 technically this is an important support level but fundamentally investors are looking for evidence to support the bank of canada s dovishness while stronger employment and higher oil prices should drive this week s and reports higher the risk of a downside surprise has limited the slide in usd cad the on the other hand has fundamental support for its decline despite the recovery in the country s turned into a deficit in the month of january the balance was three times worse than expected and accompanied by a significant downward revision to the january figures although a large part of the deterioration was caused by higher crude prices blowing out the import balance business and consumer suffered as a result these numbers reinforce governor orr s warning earlier last month that continued data deterioration could lead to a rate cut nzd usd erased all of its beginning of the week gains and is at risk of testing the february 22nd 6758 low with no new zealand data on this week s calendar nzd should move in lockstep with and take its cue from the market s appetite for technically ending the week at its lows is not good for the currency so while the 68 cent support still holds for now a move to 6750 is likely the bank of canada also has a lot to consider the labor market is strong but the rest of the economy is weak when the central bank last met it lowered its gdp and inflation forecasts these changes were validated by the latest reports which showed growth slowing to 0 4 from 2 growth also dropped to its weakest level in more than a year at the same time are recovering and the federal reserve appears to be slowing its pace of tightening we don t expect the bank of canada to change its policy stance which is no rate hikes at this time but eventually it will need to move higher what could be more important than the

the agreement to a third vote on tuesday as the options dwindle the chance of parliament supporting this deal increases but the margin of defeat means that very few people like the deal the only reason why is trading closer to 1 35 than 1 30 is because investors are relieved that no deal is off the table of course may who refuses to accept defeat said technically no deal is still the default until there is an agreement and she s right there are still 3 options the current withdrawal agreement no deal or a second referendum the government already asked to delay brexit until june 30th but that s predicated on parliament accepting the current withdrawal bill next week if they reject the deal again the uk will have to request for a longer extension from eu in the unlikely scenario that she wins investors will send gbp sharply higher as the uk is finally freed from brexit uncertainty if she loses however it may be up to the eu to decide how long the extension will be and the longer the delay the better it is for the currency may could still bring her a deal to a fourth vote before the march 29 deadline but its hard to see how she could rally the support she needs if she s beaten down 3 times already considering that we don t expect any surprises from tuesday s meaningful vote the impact on sterling should be limited but the ongoing focus on brexit won t help the currency the bank of england has no reason to be optimistic about the outlook for the economy while it is operating under the assumption that a deal will be reached a delay to brexit prolongs uncertainty which is rarely positive for an economy when the boe met last month it said the uk is set for its worst year since the financial crisis boe slashed its 2019 gdp and inflation forecast and expressed concerns about weaker growth and brexit consumer spending picked up at the start of the year but not enough to change the central bank s sentiment we expect continued caution from a central bank that has no

european central bank decided to introduce a third round of targeted refinancing operations and their pledge to keep policy accommodative throughout 2019 is the biggest reason for the currency s limited recovery with german hovering below 0 1 we continue to look for eur usd to hit 1 10 it shouldn t happen next week because the fed won t give investors a good reason to buy dollars but before

argentina s peso nothing but trouble this week argentina released its february inflation statistics inflation spiked again indeed the official annual inflation rate jumped to 51 3 yr while this spike caught most observers off balance it didn t surprise me each day i accurately measure argentina s inflation using high frequency data and purchasing power parity theory by my measure argentina s annual inflation rate is 100 yr see the accompanying chart that s nearly double the official rate reported for the end of february prof steve h hanke in response to argentina s inflation surge the banco central de la república argentina bcra did what all central banks with no credibility and junk currencies do it jacked up interest rates in an attempt to keep the peso from plunging and generating more inflation the lesson from this is clear argentina s 22nd program with the international monetary fund imf is not working as they often do the imf doctors have prescribed the wrong medicine to hold the managed pegged peso exchange rate which is a fatally flawed exchange rate regime with no credibility the bcra has to impose sky high interest rates with these rates the economy will collapse and the peso will eventually follow prof steve h hanke when i reflect on the peso there are plenty of additional lessons let s turn back the clock argentina s monetary system from april 1 1991 to january 6 2002 was known locally as convertibility it was an unusual name for an unusual system the convertibility system was not a currency board rather it was a currency board like system a mixture of currency board and central banking features as early as october 1991 while writing in the wall street journal i predicted that convertibility would eventually behave more like a typical central bank and that it would be engulfed in a currency crisis well that sad day arrived in 1999 and eventually the convertibility system in which the peso was linked to the u s dollar was abandoned on january 6 2002 many people asserted that the crux of the argentine crisis was an overvalued peso supposedly the peso s link to the strong u s dollar made the peso overvalued rendered argentina uncompetitive caused the economy to slump and forced the government to default does the story withstand scrutiny a classic sign of uncompetitiveness caused by an overvalued currency is declining exports but argentina s exports increased every year in the decade of the 1990s except in 1999 when brazil its largest trading partner suffered a currency crisis exports during the first 11 months of 2001 were about 3 2 ahead of exports during the same period in 2000 considering that estimated real growth in world trade was only 0 9 in 2001 argentina s export performance was relatively strong indeed the export sector was one of the few bright spots in the argentine economy if the rest of the economy had been growing as fast as the export sector during 2000 01 argentina would not have been swallowed by a recession in an attempt to bolster claims of a peso overvaluation some observers asserted on the basis of taxi rides from the airport or other casual impressions that prices were high in buenos aires and that high prices were evidence the peso was significantly overvalued against the dollar but a union bank of switzerland survey of prices in 58 of the world s largest cities at that time found that for a basket of 111 goods and services weighted by typical consumer habits including three categories of house rent buenos aires ranked 22nd about midway between the most expensive city tokyo and the least expensive mumbai bombay the survey also found those taxi rides that were allegedly so expensive cost about 8 less than the rides in rio de janeiro did at the time there were other indicators that contradicted the peso overvaluation story for example the economist magazine s big mac index indicated that the peso before its devaluation was 2 undervalued and although the big mac index as well as more sophisticated estimates of equilibrium exchange rates should be treated with skepticism a careful study of the matter using data from 1993 to 1999 indicated that the peso was always within 6 of its so called fundamental equilibrium real exchange rate so a second lesson derived from the argentine peso is that one should look carefully at the evidence before jumping to conclusions about overvaluation or undervaluation when it comes to the peso my school boy s theory of history applies it s just one damn thing after another perhaps it s time to dump the peso and replace it with the greenback by steve h hanke www cato org people hanke html twitter steve_hanke steve h hanke is a professor of applied economics and co director of the institute for applied

rttnews the major u s index futures are pointing to a mixed opening on monday with stocks likely to show a lack of direction following the strong upward move seen last week traders may be reluctant to make significant moves ahead of the federal reserve s monetary policy announcement later this week the fed is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged although traders are likely to keep a close eye on the accompanying statement for clues about the outlook for rates the central bank s economic projections and fed chairman jerome powell s subsequent press conference are also likely to be in focus nonetheless a notable drop by boeing ba is likely to weigh on the dow with the aerospace giant sliding by 2 4 percent in pre market trading the slump by boeing comes after a wall street journal report said federal prosecutors and transportation department officials are scrutinizing the development of the company s 737 max jetliners stocks fluctuated early in the session but moved mostly higher over the course of the trading day on friday with the upward move on the day the nasdaq and the s p 500 reached their best closing levels in five months the major averages ended the day well off their highs of the session but still firmly in positive territory the dow climbed 138 93 points or 0 5 percent to 25 848 87 the nasdaq advanced 57 62 points or 0 8 percent to 7 688 53 and the s p 500 rose 14 00 points or 0 5 percent to 2 822 48 with the gains on the day the major averages moved notably higher for the week the dow jumped by 1 6 percent while the s p 500 surged up by 2 9 percent and the tech heavy nasdaq soared by 3 8 percent the strength on wall street came amid optimism about u s china trade talks as well as indications of more chinese economic stimulus chinese premier li keqiang pledged support for the slowing economy during his annual news conference at the end of the national people s congress li said the country could use reserve requirements and interest rates to prevent a sharper deceleration in the world s second largest economy traders largely shrugged off the release of some disappointing u s economic data including a federal reserve report showing industrial production rose by much less than expected in the month of february the fed said industrial production inched up by 0 1 percent in february after falling by a revised 0 4 percent in january economists had expected production to climb by 0 4 percent compared to the 0 6 percent drop originally reported for the previous month the uptick in production came as a spike in utilities output and an increase in mining output was largely offset by a continued drop in manufacturing output the further decline in manufacturing output in february confirms that the global industrial slowdown is now weighing more heavily on u s producers said andrew hunter senior u s economist at capital economics he added with tighter fiscal and monetary policy constraining domestic demand the weaker external environment is another reason to expect a sustained slowdown in economic growth this year a separate report from the new york fed showed an unexpected slowdown in regional manufacturing growth in the month of march the new york fed said its headline general business conditions index fell to 3 7 in march after climbing to 8 8 in february while a positive reading still indicates growth in regional manufacturing activity economists had expected the index to rise to 10 0 the index remained below 10 for the third straight month which the new york fed said suggests growth has remained quite a bit slower so far this year than it was for most of 2018 meanwhile preliminary data released by the university of michigan on friday showed a significant improvement in u s consumer sentiment in the month of march the report said the consumer sentiment index jumped to 97 8 in march from the final february reading of 93 8 economists had expected the index to rise to 95 3 the bigger than expected increase by the index came as more positive assessments from lower income households more than offset a drop in sentiment among households with incomes in the top third since households with incomes in the top third account for more than half of all consumer expenditures cautious observers will conclude that the latest data are another indication that the end of the expansion is on the distant horizon said surveys of consumers chief economist richard curtin he added while that may well be true the current level of consumer sentiment at 97 8 hardly indicates an

increasingly the economists and politicians discussing the current economic downturn are referencing the early 1980s recession or in some cases the 1973 74 recession both of these recessions were hard and lasted about 16 months whereas the current recession is only 13 months old but is already a challenging one there has also been talk by economists and stock market seers about how the current recession could morph into the next great depression unfortunately a great depression comparison provides little help for investors trying to understand how energy markets might be affected the international energy agency iea in its recent oil demand forecasts has been commenting that the back to back declines of 2008 and 2009 would mark the first time for that to occur since 1982 1983 some 25 years ago in our november examination of the possible future course of the u s drilling rig count we used the 1980s downturn to plot how the current rig count downturn might unfold if this one were similar at the time we speculated that if this cycle s rig count fall followed the 1980s downturn pattern we were at risk of losing about 1 000 rigs from peak to trough now we are seeing and hearing estimates that this rig downturn will be so severe largely because of how low natural gas prices have fallen and the absence of a catalyst for them to rise soon that the rig count could fall to a low of 800 active rigs we have had discussions with various drilling company management teams who suggest based on the rate of weekly rig count declines that we could reach that target sooner rather than later it s amazing how when things come unglued the outlook rapidly shifts to the catastrophe scenario maybe it s because people want to emulate president obama if the u s rig count reaches the 800 working rig number sometime this year the drilling industry will have lost about 1 200 active rigs from its peak activity level last fall with that many rigs going idle it will be extremely difficult for drilling contractors to sustain profitability and if a contractor has significant debt levels companies may have issues with remaining in business on the other hand the level of optimism within the drilling contractor fraternity that this downturn will be quick to rebound is keeping managements focused on where the geographic strength will be on the upside the key question however is will the global economy remain depressed for several years making the energy demand forecasts of almost all analysts wrong and suggesting that 2010 will be another down year for energy consumption rather than a year of demand recovery as we have pointed out before the 1980s downturn actually lasted for four years the peak in oil demand came in 1979 and growth resumed in 1984 it was not until 1989 however that global oil use exceeded the total consumed in 1979 could a multiyear oil consumption downturn happen today there were several factors at work in the early 1980s downturn that contributed to it lasting as long as it did first was the scope of the economic problems that led to the recession second was the energy consumption adjustments undertaken by the united states europe and japanese economies in response to the dramatic climb in oil prices that began in 1973 third was the oil supply response driven by the fear of oil shortages and the correspondingly high oil prices experienced throughout the 70s let s examine these issues and whether any of them exist today the 1970s was a decade marked by seismic social and economic shifts that radically altered the global status quo the social stresses and economic turmoil that came from the vietnam war and the various attempts to resolve it resulted in an accelerated inflation rate by the end of 1960s early in the 1970s the automatic inflationprotection clauses incorporated into union labor contracts in the late 1960s in response to that period s increase in inflation began topressure the economy even though the actual inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index cpi was moderating in fact in 1970 the inflation rate flirted with 6 before falling back but it remained above 4 a rate thought to be intolerable on august 15 1971 president nixon instituted wage and price controls on the united states economy along with ending the exchangeability of dollars for gold bullion these were unique acts in peace time but they were supposed to only last for 90 days but instead ended up lasting for 1 000 with the august pronouncement the future course of the united states economy and that of the world was altered permanently the change set in motion actions and reactions that have shaped our world in the energy world seismic shifts were also occurring at this time the low and regulated natural gas prices of the 1960s contributed to the u s beginning to run out of gas supply to offset that eventuality gas consumers began substituting oil for gas the growth in global oil consumption began to strain supplies especially as the united states the world s largest oil producer hit peak production and began to decline as these shifts were occurring the seven sisters international oil companies commenced efforts to reduce the middle east posted price for crude oil on which the royalties owed to the host producing countries primarily those countries that were members of the organization of oil exporting countries opec were based this effort angered those countries and as the global oil supply demand balance tightened emboldened them to push for higher prices increased taxes and eventually the partial nationalization of the production concessions the shift in oil supply demand fundamentals was altering the power in the global energy market in favor of opec while most people associate the arab oil producers embargo of those western countries that supported israel in the 1973 six day war as the start of the rise in oil prices the reality is that underlying oil market supply demand trends had become sufficiently tight that producers could begin to extract economic rent for providing their oil to the market earlier in the decade from 1 80 a barrel in 1970 posted oil prices rose to 2 55 by early 1971 and were then pushed up to 3 45 in response to rising inflation and depreciation of the u s dollar opec members lifted oil prices and tax rates higher and increasingly gained more control over the oil producing concessions they had granted to the international oil companies decades earlier by the start of the fourth arab israeli war on october 6 1973 posted oil prices had climbed to 5 12 a barrel a couple of weeks after the war arab oil producing countries imposed their embargo and in december opec boosted oil prices to 11 65 a barrel effective january 1 1974 in response to these energy industry dynamics the nixon administration moved to put controls on oil prices leading to the august 17 1973 announcement of a new two tier pricing regime old oil that oil produced at or below 1972 s average production level and sold at a march 1973 prices plus 0 35 a barrel and new oil or the oil produced in excess of 1972 s average production level that was sold at uncontrolled prices this intersection of politics and regulation distorted the oil market pricing mechanism and triggered the 1970s oil boom which ultimately led to the industry s 15 year recession most people remember the 1970s as a period of escalating oil prices accelerating inflation and severe government regulation the reality is that oil prices jumped fourfold in 1973 remained essentially flat until 1978 when the iranian revolution overthrew that country s government and resulted in the removal of its oil from the world market sending oil prices from the mid teens to the midthirties the subsequent iran iraq war sent global oil prices to the upper thirties per barrel this explosion in oil prices coupled with the psychological impact of the malthusian view of the globe s future too many people not enough food nor sufficient raw materials to support them contributed to a bleak outlook for living standards out of the explosion of oil prices early in the 1970s emerged a huge energy conservation effort throughout the western world the globe s primary consumer of oil and gas more efficient automobiles and household appliances increased energy efficiency building standards and greater use of nuclear and non hydrocarbon fuel sources for power generation marked the world of the 1980s that can best be seen in the united states by the impact of the amount of liquid petroleum fuel used to generate electricity compared to that sourced from natural gas coal also increased its contribution to the power generation mix this is a reason why the world s demand for oil fell in the early 1980s and was slow to recover as the decade wore on these energy conservation and fuel switching trends were in addition to the decline in oil demand due to the economic recession set in motion by the harsh monetary policies implemented at the start of the 1980s in an attempt to break the back of the rampant inflation in the united states that had spread globally the u s federal reserve took actions to push short term interest rates above 20 crippling manufacturing and commerce and undercutting consumer demand the effect however was to cut the inflation rate in half to 6 2 in 1982 from 13 2 in 1980 and cut it in half again to 3 2 in 1983 but the resulting revival in economic activity did not reverse the energy efficiency gains put in motion during the second half of the 1970s for the four years 1980 1983 global oil consumption fell by a cumulative 6 5 million barrels a day this consumption fall amounted to 7 5 of global oil consumption from 1979 s peak had this been the only oil market dynamic at work the members of opec may have been able to compensate and prevent the cataclysmic fall in oil prices experienced in the mid 1980s as oil fell from 38 a barrel to 28 and then collapsed to near 10 before the bottom was reached the other significant dynamic at work during this period was the growth in non opec production stimulated by the twin factors of oil supply shortages and high prices the 1973 oil embargo set off alarm bells within the oil industry and governments that the world s consumers could potentially be held captive to politically motivated oil supply shortages coupled with high oil prices the petroleum industry embarked on a global exploration surge that resulted in the development of the hydrocarbon resources on alaska s north slope and offshore england and norway in the north sea these new producing areas were also assisted in expanding non opec oil supplies by growing oil production in mexico and brazil although its increased production merely offset imports freeing up additional oil supplies for western governments to purchase while these new supply basins had begun production during the 1970s they matured as large and sustainable supply sources in the 1980s the fall in global oil demand and the rise in oecd oil supplies combined to pressure opec s share of world oil production the loss of oil sales because of growing non opec supplies created economic problems for the opec member countries those opec countries facing the greatest economic pressures from falling oil prices cheated on the reduced opec production quotas designed to help stem the oil price decline as oil supplies in the global market grew oil prices collapsed this price collapse was a contributing factor in the battle to reestablish low inflation worldwide and it helped to stimulate a global economic recovery that eventually became one of the longest sustained economic growth periods in history when we look at the global energy market today what do we see demand is falling and each month the demand forecasts are ratcheted down as global economic growth projections are revised lower since february 2008 the imf has reduced its 2009 outlook for world economic growth from 3 0 to 2 2 and now to 0 5 traditionally a 2 growth rate has been considered the point below which the world enters a recession for 2010 the imf expects worldwide economic growth of 3 0 but it calls for the advanced economies of the world which includes the oecd countries to recover but their growth will still be less than half the growth rate experienced in 2007 the developing asian economies are expected to have a dramatic snapback in growth in 2010 but it also will be meaningfully less than in 2007 the question for the energy market is whether the 2009 economic growth forecast holds at its barely positive rate and 2010 s projection is revised meaningfully lower at the moment the more negative economic forecasters seem to be driving the outlook for the world s growth or lack thereof if there is a recovery in global economic activity that is above 2 0 then we should probably be looking for higher oil demand just how high is debatable the other side of the oil demand coin is oil supply and here the case for higher oil prices is stronger while the world had about six countries experiencing oil production declines in 1980 today that number is more like 25 with a growing number of countries struggling to avoid falling into that category in five years we could have another 15 30 countries that have gone beyond their peak production capacity that outlook begs a question where are the next north slopes and north seas at the present time these basins are in decline so the petroleum industry is working hard to slow the rates of decline while acknowledging that these basins are not going to be sources of new oil supplies by examining the production history and projected future production of one of the key non opec basins one can see the challenge facing the oil industry and in turn the world s economy norway commenced offshore oil production in 1970 production grew fairly steadily until it reached peak production about the turn of this century from that point norway s oil production has been in a steady decline that with the help of some new discoveries and enhanced production may be arrested for a brief time before then resuming its projected rapid rate of decline whether the oil industry is able to bring forth these additional resources or not will depend upon both technology and economics each of which has their own unique challenges at the present time maybe offshore brazil will be the new north slope and north sea but it will be a long time in coming and the oil will be expensive to produce the country has found several potentially huge new oil discoveries in deep water and under salt formations but no one is completely sure how easily these reservoirs will be developed and at what cost in the mean time the issue is whether global demand will continue to fall as it did in the 1980s most authoritative forecasts call for an upturn in oil consumption beginning in 2010 but those forecasts are predicated on economic projections calling for the current economic recession to end by then also we believe that unless a worldwide global initiative to address the global warming concerns is undertaken and it leads to everyone radically changing energy consumption habits energy demand growth will resume with a recovery in economic activity cap andtrade or a carbon tax have the potential for raising the cost of carbon associated with hydrocarbon resources and altering the desirability of particular fuels but probably not lowering total energy demand until these systems are in place and functioning well the needs and desires for improved lifestyles driven by population growth will push increased energy consumption all the best forecasts predict that the maximum effort from alternative fuels will not displace a significant volume of hydrocarbon fuel while natural gas might displace a certain volume of oil used for gasoline the transition will not happen in a meaningful way anytime soon the issue for the oil industry will be capital availability to fund the development of the world s known resources the future for oil and gas prices is tied to supply and demand fundamentals and an indicator of where oil prices may be headed in the near term is tied to opec s surplus productive capacity at the moment with rapidly falling demand opec is facing a growing production surplus compared to the surplus productive capacity opec battled in the mid 1980s this surplus is not serious and will probably turn out to be a transitory trend the forecast surplus should be about five million barrels per day of capacity in 2010 compared to over 10 million barrels per day in 1985 when world oil consumption was substantially lower than today moreover that surplus was the result of growing oil supplies from new producing basins the 1980s were marked by growing non opec oil supplies and radically altered demand patterns that hampered the ability of opec to deal with the rapid and large production surplus those two key conditions do not exist today and from all the available evidence are not likely to emerge anytime soon in the near term demand is the critical issue but barring another great depression killing economic activity for a number of years the global oil market will be selfcorrecting and quite possibly faster than many people think reprinted with

china can use reserve requirements and interest rates to support economic growth premier li keqiang said on march 15 promising broad policy steps to prevent a sharper slowdown for the world s second biggest economy li s comments suggest beijing is ready to roll out more forceful stimulus measures to ease strains on businesses and consumers china has so far promised billions of dollars in tax cuts and infrastructure spending as economic momentum is expected to cool further due to softer domestic demand and the trade war with the united states shares in china climbed on march 15 after the government reiterated its commitment to boosting growth the yuan recovered from a three week low against the dollar after li s comments china is targeting economic growth of 6 6 5 per cent this year down from 6 6pc in 2018 the slowest pace in 28 years of course we are faced with many uncertain factors this year we have to prepare more and we have reserved policy room to address uncertainties li told a news conference after the annual parliament meeting ended moreover we can deploy quantity based or price based policy tools such as reserve requirements and interest rates this is not monetary easing but to more effectively support the real economy li s comments reconfirm a consistent pro growth stance with clarity on fiscal easing and an earlier than expected effective date for tax cuts morgan stanley said in a note adding that it expects improved growth from the second quarter the support measures rolled out so far are taking time to kick in and most analysts believe activity may not convincingly stabilise until the middle of the year the central bank has cut banks reserve requirement ratios rrr five times over the past year with a two stage rrr cut in january releasing a total of 1 5 trillion yuan 223 23 billion into the financial system further cuts in rrr had been widely expected this year after fresh data pointed to persistently soft demand in the asian economic giant raising fears of a sharper slowdown sources told reuters in february that the central bank is not yet ready to cut benchmark interest rates to spur the slowing economy but is likely to cut market based rates an across the board cut in borrowing costs could also risk another flare up in debt and speculative activity like that in the wake of the 2008 09 global financial crisis tax and fee cuts promised cuts in value added tax vat for manufacturing and other sectors will take effect from april 1 while social security fees will be reduced from may 1 li said the premier announced on march 5 that the vat for the manufacturing sector would be cut to 13pc from 16pc vat for the transport and construction sectors will be reduced to 9pc from 10pc li on friday sought to soothe concerns that the tax cuts will weigh on local finances promising the central government will offer support to provinces in central and western china via payment transfers the premier said the government would take multiple measures to lower funding costs for small and micro firms by one percentage point this year beijing s tax cut efforts have focused on the manufacturing sector and small businesses that are vital for economic growth and employment li said the government hopes to create 13 million jobs this year the same as last year not allowing the economy to slip out of a reasonable range that is to say we will not allow waves of layoffs said li adding the government will provide support to firms creating the most jobs data on march 14 showed that china s survey based jobless rate rose to 5 3pc in february from 4 9pc in december partly due to job shedding by export oriented companies trade war china is still negotiating with the united states to resolve their trade frictions li said adding both sides have far more shared interests than conflicts and it would be unrealistic to decouple the world s two largest economies we hope that the consultations will be fruitful and will achieve mutual benefit and win win i believe that this is also the expectation of the world li said a summit to seal a trade deal between president donald trump and chinese president xi jinping will not happen at the end of march as previously discussed treasury secretary steven mnuchin said on march 14 washington and beijing have been locked in a tit for tat tariff battle as the united states presses china for an end to practices and policies it argues have given chinese firms unfair advantages including subsidising of industry limits on access for foreign companies and alleged theft of intellectual property on march 15 china s parliament approved a new foreign investment law that promises to create a transparent environment for foreign firms though there is scepticism about its enforceability the law designed to ease concerns among foreign companies about the difficulties they face in china will ban forced technology transfer and illegal government interference in foreign business practices li stressed that china did not and would never ask chinese companies to spy on other countries his comments came after increased international scrutiny of chinese telecommunications

by julien ponthus tommy wilkes and ritvik carvalho london reuters having spent three years and more than 2 6 trillion euros 3 trillion trying to boost economic growth across the euro zone the european central bank s mixed record may open the door for a high spending radical alternative with populist and anti austerity parties looking to build support before european parliamentary elections in may just as growth withers so called modern monetary theory mmt is challenging conventional thinking on debt deficits and how economies should be run popularized by alexandria ocasio cortez a rising star of the american left mmt posits in essence that a country with the ability to print its own currency can create and spend money freely so long as inflation is kept under control the country can t be forced into defaulting on its debts since it can always print money to pay creditors the theory runs it s music to the ears of european populists demanding a ramp up in public spending to fight unemployment and finance social programs years of central bank quantitative easing qe they say have done little except inflate financial asset prices mmt is about financing government spending and the real economy its advocates say while qe is solely designed to stimulate financial markets through massive purchases of private and public bonds on the secondary market mmt is unlikely to be put into practice in the euro zone any time soon rules of the currency area make it impossible for member states to print money unilaterally and mainstream policymakers have derided the economics behind it former u s treasury secretary larry summers has called mmt voodoo thinking but the ideas underpinning the theory are helping shape an ideological push against european fiscal orthodoxy and policymakers reluctance to consider big public debt funded investment schemes post european elections there will be much more talk at a european level of fiscal spending and stimulus john roe a fund manager at legal general investment management britain s biggest asset manager told reuters new deal roe noted calls for a vast publicly funded green new deal as touted by some left wing u s democrats are yet to materialize in europe but demands for such a policy remain a possibility which investors should take seriously the ecb s admission this month that qe had failed to lift inflation and economic growth and that it would leave interest rates at rock bottom until at least 2020 leaves it vulnerable to calls for a drastic rethink real world modern monetary theory defined as the monetization of large public deficits by the central bank would be most advisable in the eurozone even if close to impossible to implement in the bloc said vincent deluard an analyst at financial advisory firm intl fcstone graphic euro zone growth and inflation populist route with talk of europe slipping into a spiral of japanification a combination of weak growth and low inflation pressure is building for fresh policy approaches although advocates of mmt are yet to appear in european discourse as frequently as they have in the united states that could be about to change people are assuming that if there s a continued european economic slowdown after the european elections european politicians will say europe needs more infrastructure and they think they can print money at no extra cost

age of rage what populism means for markets rabobank market strategist michael every said investors should expect populist parties to use mmt to bolster their calls for higher public spending markets should to prepare for a far higher risk of truly paradigmatic shifts ahead every warned economic collapse little of this means much unless politicians ready to rip up the macroeconomic rulebook can make it into office and the financial establishment is unsurprisingly near universal in its condemnation they argue that governments let loose to print money can set off a spiral into hyperinflation

resulted in hyperinflation and economic turmoil praet said adding that s why central banks are independent a poll conducted by the university of chicago booth school of business found that 88 percent of economic experts disagreed with the idea that countries able to borrow in their own currencies need not worry about government deficits because they can always print money to finance their debts

now that that the central bank is buying dollars to create domestic liquidity will it continue to snap up as many indian government bonds the purchases in the current financial year have topped 42 billion traders expect these to be dialed down starting april 1 if the reduction is large enough to offset the 5 billion infusion bond investors get nothing in the net they may remain cautious about buying 10 year government bonds given the risk of fiscal slippage next year is high much of the massaging of the headline fiscal deficit for instance by pushing a chunk of the government s borrowing off budget will be reversed once the poll results are in
several theories explain why india s new central bank governor took his boldest step yet little attention has been paid to the consequences last week governor shaktikanta das made an unexpected tweak to the reserve bank of india s traditional management of longer term liquidity in the banking system by buying and selling government bonds india s currency sovereign debt and credit markets were all caught off guard by the announcement of a three year dollar rupee swap the rbi will buy 5 billion from banks for its reserves by giving them rupees and reverse the trade in 2022 this preemptive move would prevent the currency s appreciation according to one theory the central bank may want to scoop up incoming dollars from arcelormittal s long awaited 5 8 billion check for essar steel india ltd lest the rupee strengthens from an oversupply of greenbacks that payment should be coming in now that the ruia family former owners of the bankrupt asset is almost out of legal options to prevent the sale footnote i remain skeptical of a resolution before the next general elections are over and a new government is formed another hypothesis ties the swap to elevated funding costs for nonbank financiers the real economy which is already slowing could be in trouble if shadow lenders are forced to turn off the tap for builders amid a glut of unsold apartments in this line of thinking the rbi s move aims to ease financial conditions that s not far fetched with the biggest arranger of indian corporate debt warning of a crisis in credit markets however there s a third view which sees the swap spurring demand for lackluster government bonds long term yields continue to be stubbornly high banks could use the rupees they get by selling dollars to buy sovereign notes to the extent their purchases push yields lower they get to book mark to market gains or cut losses on their asset portfolios by march 31 the end of their financial year however it doesn t matter whether the rbi had currency credit or interest rates in mind what s more relevant is how the new liquidity management tool will shape expectations of what comes next now that that the central bank is buying dollars to create domestic liquidity will it continue to snap up as many indian government bonds the purchases in the current financial year have topped 42 billion traders expect these to be dialed down starting april 1 if the reduction is large enough to offset the 5 billion infusion bond investors get nothing in the net they may remain cautious about buying 10 year government bonds given the risk of fiscal slippage next year is high much of the massaging of the headline fiscal deficit for instance by pushing a chunk of the government s borrowing off budget will be reversed once the poll results are in the bond market hasn t failed to notice that a state run telecom company has delayed salaries hard to privatize national carrier air india ltd is on perpetual life support and that state run banks balance sheet repair job is proving longer and more expensive than the government expected when prime minister narendra modi took office in 2014 put another way the benchmark 10 year bond yield may remain sticky even if inflation doesn t accelerate to that extent the dollar swap may be ineffective in the government bond market though it could help ease the private sector s worsening credit crunch where the swap could do damage is the currency market a steeper yield curve might attract foreigners to tactically buy into high long term yields now that das is acquiring dollars in bulk via long term swaps the market may expect him to purchase less in the spot market a one off swap to stanch rupee appreciation could thus end up being foreign investors invitation to push the rupee uncomfortably higher on a daily basis but what is the alternative to the das put if the rbi keeps buying government bonds it surrenders its power to teach the government a lesson in fiscal arithmetic regardless of who wins on may 23 the next administration is expected to take a hard left turn more unfunded programs will be unveiled aficionados of modern monetary theory may say deficits don t matter but unlike the u s india s private and public sectors together can t borrow all they need in their own currency besides inflation which mmters accept as the only constraint on government borrowing isn t as well anchored as in developed nations volatile food and fuel prices still dominate consumers price expectations on the other hand if the rbi stops resisting day to day rupee appreciation and steps in only periodically with bulk dollar buying via swaps an overvalued rupee will usher in a short lived asset price boom followed by a bust after all fiscal and monetary policies can be coordinated locally and politicians longing to reclaim their power to freely print money can be ignored but how does das ask federal reserve chairman jerome powell to guarantee that the dollar won t resume its upward march a 5 billion swap is harmless enough any more and das would become as villainous in the eyes of the politically dominant indian nationalist thinking as his two immediate predecessors for turning india into a stooge of america the rbi s new boss is stuck between a rock and a hard place

the us federal reserve surprised markets recently with a large and unexpected policy change when the federal open market committee fomc met in december it increased the fed s policy rate to 2 25 2 5 and signalled that it would raise the benchmark rate another three times to 3 3 25 before stopping it also signalled that it would continue to unwind its balance sheet of treasury bonds and mortgage backed securities indefinitely by up to 50bn 38bn per month but just six weeks later at the fomc meeting in late january the fed indicated that it would pause its rate rises for the foreseeable future and suspend its balance sheet unwinding sometime this year several factors drove the fed s volte face first and foremost policymakers were rattled by the sharp tightening in financial conditions after the fomc s december meeting which hastened a rout in global equity markets that had begun in october and these fears were exacerbated by an appreciating us dollar and the possibility of an effective shutdown of certain credit markets particularly those for high yield and leveraged loans second in the latter half of 2018 us core inflation unexpectedly stopped rising toward the fed s 2 target and even started falling toward 1 8 with inflation expectations weakening the fed was forced to reconsider its rate rise plan which was based on the belief that structurally low unemployment would drive inflation above 2 third donald trump s trade wars and slowing growth in europe china japan and emerging markets have raised concerns about us growth prospects particularly after the protracted federal government shutdown with which the country met the new year fourth the fed has had to demonstrate its independence in the face of political pressures in december when it signalled further rate rises trump had been calling for a pause but since then the fed has had to worry about being blamed in the event of an economic stall fifth richard clarida a well respected economist and market expert joined the fed board as vice chair in the autumn of 2018 tipping the balance of the fomc in a more dovish direction before then the fed chair jerome powell s own dovish tendencies had been kept in check by a slightly less dovish staff and the third member of the fed s leadership troika the new york fed president john williams who expected inflation to rise gradually above target as the labour market tightened the addition of clarida amid stalling inflation and tightening financial conditions no doubt proved decisive in the fed s decision to hit the pause button but clarida also seems to have pushed the fed toward renewed dovishness in more subtle ways for starters his presence lends support to powell s view that the flattening of the phillips curve which asserts an inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment may be more structural than temporary some fed researchers disagree and have published a paper arguing that uncertainty with respect to the phillips curve should not stop the fed from normalising us monetary policy but with clarida s input the fed will be more inclined to focus on actual inflation trends rather than on the official unemployment rate and its implications under traditional models moreover while fed staff members tend to believe that the us economy s rate of potential growth is very low about 1 75 2 clarida like powell seems open to the idea that trump s tax cuts and deregulatory policies combined with the next wave of technological innovation will allow for somewhat stronger non inflationary growth finally clarida is spearheading an internal strategy review to determine whether the fed should start making up for below target inflation during recessions and slow recoveries by allowing for above target inflation during expansionary periods and though the review is still in its early stages the fed already seems to have embraced the idea that inflation should be allowed to exceed 2 without immediately triggering a tightening taken together these factors suggest that the fed could remain in pause mode for the rest of 2019 after all even a recent modest acceleration of wage growth does not seem to have produced higher inflation implying that the phillips curve may stay flatter for longer and given the fed s new de facto policy of targeting average inflation over the course of the business cycle a modest temporary increase in core inflation above 2 would not necessarily be met with policy action but while the fed is most likely to remain in a holding pattern for the bulk of 2019 another rate rise toward the end of the year or in 2020 cannot be ruled out china s growth slowdown seems to be bottoming out and recovery there could start to strengthen in the coming months especially if the current sino american negotiations lead to a de escalation of trade tensions likewise a deal to avert an economically disastrous no deal brexit could still be in the offing and it is possible that the eurozone s slowdown especially germany s will prove temporary moreover global financial conditions are easing as a result of the fed and other central banks renewed dovishness and this could translate into stronger us domestic growth much will depend on whether trump abstains from launching a separate trade war against the european auto industry which would rattle equity markets again yet barring more fights over the us federal budget and the debt ceiling not to mention possible impeachment proceedings against trump the us could be spared serious domestic political and policy shocks in the months ahead if us gdp growth does remain resilient this year some acceleration of wage growth and price inflation could follow and core inflation may even rise above target in the second half of the year or in 2020 and while the fed seems willing to tolerate a period of temporary above target inflation it cannot allow that to become the new status quo should this scenario arise later in the year or next year the fed could raise its baseline rate by another 25 basis points before settling into a protracted pause either way the new normal will be a us policy rate close to or just below 3

at bottom the castro problem lies in the special situation which created it the misery in which most of the latin american population lives the only alternative to castroism is the democratic revolution which betancourt has started to carry out if betancourt is not successful other castros will come and other castroisms rise in revolutions commanded by the anti american extreme left estado de são paulo brazil the alliance for progress president kennedy s ten year plan for economic aid to latin america has the merit of emphasizing the need for social reform as a necessary condition for economic growth the area s archaic and unjust systems of taxation and land tenure as the president tactfully but firmly pointed out must be modified if the underprivileged masses in those countries are to enjoy the benefits of modern technology aid under the program will therefore be channeled to those nations that are prepared to change the feudal characteristics of their society so that our assistance does not continue to make the rich richer and leave the poor as wretched as before despite the president s gratifying sophistication about economic aid and his bold rhetoric about a vast effort unparalleled in magnitude and nobility of purpose it remains to be seen if his policies measure up to latin american realities and aspirations for the first time in our history we are threatened by a rival ideology in this hemisphere fidel castro s cuba has already abandoned democracy and capitalism to experiment with the soviet system of dictatorship and state ownership and control if castro survives and achieves some measure of success with his headlong course the much less spectacular kennedy plan may seem too slow to latin america s awakening masses and the intellectuals who lead them and a number of castro like governments might seize power a crucial test of our policies will come in venezuela cuba s caribbean neighbor the richest nation in latin america governed by an exemplary liberal leader but still plagued with typical economic and social problems in the years that have elapsed since the overthrow of a military government in 1958 venezuela s newly fledged democracy has barely managed to survive a series of attacks by forces of both the left and right the almost successful assassination of president betancourt last june the armed uprising by university students in december and the series of riots bus burnings and insurrections by disgruntled military men in the last few months have made it seem that the country might be about to slide back into some form of dictatorship to keep the lid on betancourt has had to close the schools bar cuban newspapers and newspapermen ban political meetings jail hundreds of his opponents and an embarrassing step for a former revolutionary call in the army and place caracas under martial law these disorders have been accompanied and intensified by continued signs of economic distress the construction business is in a severe slump and exploration and drilling programs in the crucial oil industry are running at about half their 1959 levels even with dollar revenues of more than 100 million a month the current budget has a 250 million deficit in the past three years venezuela s dollar reserves have fallen by more than 1 billion despite betancourt s promise that last year s 200 million loan from fifteen u s banks was the last his government would make he is again looking for foreign assistance and has had to devalue the bolívar once the world s hardest currency these continued deficits and disorders are particularly discouraging because of venezuela s large and varied resources and the honest able and patient leadership of rómulo betancourt if liberal democratic reforms do not work here they are not likely to be successful in less richly endowed latin american states venezuela unlike some of its caribbean neighbors is not overpopulated its less than seven million people occupy an area one and one half times as large as texas and only 2 per cent of its land area is at present under cultivation there is a substantial cattle industry the country has more cows than people considerable production of such varied crops as coffee cacao rice sugar corn and potatoes and a remarkable variety of mineral resources in the guiana highlands south of the orinoco which contain half the area of the country but only 3 per cent of its population there are still largely unexploited reserves of asbestos bauxite coal diamonds and so on down to uranium the current production of iron ore from the same area s immense reserves feeds a small domestic steel industry and makes venezuela the largest ore exporter in the world dwarfing all these activities is the oil industry whose output of nearly three million barrels a day makes the nation the third largest producer in the world after the united states and the ussr and by far the largest exporter oil furnishes 90 per cent of venezuela s exports brings the government revenues of more than 2 million a day and is responsible for the country s per capita income of about 800 the largest in latin america with such resources to draw from it would seem that economic difficulties could be no more than temporary _____________ some of the problems facing the betancourt regime are indeed short term dating back from the 1948 58 dictatorship of marcos pérez jiménez like most latin dictators pj stole large amounts of money and wasted still more he left behind him 1 2 billion in promissory notes and such expensive mementos as an uneconomic 400 million steel plant a railroad with hardly any freight or passengers a money losing government airline an incredibly lavish officers club and the magnificent but generally empty hotel humboldt perched on a 4 000 foot hill overlooking the capital these white elephants have caused much of the current pressure on the bolívar a more serious difficulty for a country so heavily dependent on a single commodity for export is the current world oil glut increasing competition from the ussr and the closing of certain outlets for venezuelan crude oil the proved reserves in the soviet union have risen to 60 trillion barrels the current output of about three million barrels a day is scheduled to grow to nearly twice that by 1965 and consumption owing to the shortage of soviet automobiles will remain comparatively low cut rate soviet oil has been finding purchasers in half a dozen latin american countries and in finland denmark sweden italy west germany ceylon india and pakistan as well so that all the international producers have had to lower prices to meet the competition when fidel castro seized the standard shell and texaco refineries in cuba the whole of that small but significant market was lost to venezuela argentina which imported 300 million of oil a few years ago is now almost self sufficient and even exports small quantities and the eisenhower imposed quota on u s oil imports has also damaged venezuelan prospects as a result of these and other factors the government s 63 per cent share of oil profits fell from 823 million in 1958 to 740 million last year betancourt who is only the second democratically elected president of venezuela the first novelist rómulo gallegos was ousted by a junta of army officers and wealthy landlords in 1948 is of course not responsible for the current economic mess having come to power just when the slump started however he is blamed for it in the same way that herbert hoover was held responsible for the crash in 1929 agricultural workers and unemployed slum dwellers remember that they were a little better off economically in the booming times of pérez jiménez and the suez oil crisis pj s ouster brought back civil liberties but these have now been taken away again prices continue to climb and jobs are harder to find than ever it is not surprising that many caraqueños eagerly listen to prensa latina s glowing accounts of how well things are going in cuba and have come to agree with fidel castro s attacks on parliamentary democracy as only another disguise for exploitation of the working class _____________ the smoldering discontent that lies so close beneath the surface of venezuelan life is most readily apparent in caracas where a quarter of a million people live in slums as primitive as any in south america in the past fifteen years the capital s population has shot up from 300 000 to 1 3 million which is one fifth of the nation s total one sees in caracas the meaninglessness of per capita income figures it is quite misleading to strike an average between the bureaucrat or businessman living in a gleaming luxury apartment house and the unemployed laborer living in a hut made of packing cases and corrugated iron without electricity or running water such contrasts are sharper in caracas than anywhere in latin america the windows of the splendid officers club for example look out over a hillside scabbed over with wretched hovels from which in the rainy season tons of human excrement wash down caracas has more cars per hundred people than any other latin american city and traffic jams as bad as those in detroit or los angeles the visitor is therefore bound to be impressed by the octopus a new elevated highway connecting the different sections of town then he gets a chance to look beneath it and finds thousands of poor squatters using the road as a substitute for a roof the capital is the only area betancourt and his democratic action ad party failed to carry in the 1958 elections many of the workers who seized arms when pérez jiménez fled still have them and there is strong fidelista sentiment among the politically important student groups at the university only the army s heavy hand keeps order the social situation out in the countryside is just as lopsided and unstable a 1957 survey showed that some four thousand landowners less than 2 per cent of the proprietors of farms held about four fifths of all the cultivated land in the country two thirds of all the farms were smaller than thirteen acres and 14 per cent less than three acres some 350 000 rural families nearly a third of the total population were without any land at all three quarters of the working force is in agriculture but the country still cannot feed itself wheat corn meat and even eggs must be imported from the united states already inadequate urban and rural living standards are threatened by a population increase of 3 6 per cent a year these grave social problems are of course nothing new venezuela s masses have always been poor dirty landless hungry and illiterate what has changed is their former willingness to endure such conditions as part of the natural order of things the well named revolution of rising expectations kindled by the sight of luxuries at their very doorstep and fanned to a blaze by propaganda emanating from moscow peiping havana and hollywood is as strong in the caracas slums as in any underdeveloped area in the world despite his government s economic difficulties betancourt is doing what he can in the way of land reform housing programs and increased educational opportunities the difficulty is that expectation outruns achievement and that opposition parties can always promise more than the government in power is able to deliver as is usual in latin america the cutting edge of discontent is provided by the students the armed groups that fortified the school of pharmacy and defied the police last december showed the source of their ideology by nicknaming their strong points stalingrad and sierra maestra they are supported by the increasingly radical republican democratic urd party which quit the government coalition last november by the communists who got 6 per cent 160 000 of the congressional votes in 1958 and by the movement of the revolutionary left mir a fidelista splinter of the ad on the other flank betancourt is at times literally under fire from officers involuntarily retired in 1958 disgruntled captains and colonels on active duty who long for the return of military rule and occasional assassins hired by pérez jiménez or by generalissimo rafael leonidas trujillo of the dominican republic _____________ the troublesome and dangerous job of dealing with these almost overwhelming internal difficulties is complicated by the increasingly tense international situation in the caribbean dictatorships of the left and right feel themselves menaced by betancourt s middle of the road regime the venezuelan president still bears the scars caused by a dynamite explosion arranged by trujillo s thugs last june this attempt on the life of their freely elected ruler by a hated despot naturally brought a wave of sympathy in betancourt s favor and strengthened his position the appeal to violence emanating from havana is more pervasive and more dangerous cuba s economic problems monoculture the latifundio and dependence on the u s market and capital investments are so similar to venezuela s that castro s radical solutions naturally have a considerable amount of appeal to venezuelan students labor union leaders and left wing politicians the social and economic program of the cuban revolution its achievements suitably touched up for export are constantly reiterated by cuban tourists diplomats and the prensa latina radio station before betancourt barred cuban emissaries and the venezuelan police shot the leader of the 26th of july movement in caracas castro spent more money in venezuela than anywhere else in havana last christmas i met quite a few oil workers and union leaders from the lake maracaibo region who had been invited by the cuban government for the year end celebrations they were impressed by the farm cooperatives they had seen and were violently in favor of the revolution if the yankees ever attack cuba one of them said to me we will blow up every one of their wells in venezuela betancourt s struggle against fidelismo has not been helped by the short sighted policies of the dulles herter state department and the blundering incompetence of those senators from mississippi florida and alabama who play such key roles in shaping our latin american policy venezuelans remember that pérez jiménez got u s armaments loans and the legion of merit the highest award that can be given to a foreign citizen nobody in washington objected to pj s tyranny or incredible waste and graft so long as he met his obligations to new york bankers and cooperated with standard oil mobil gulf texaco and the rest during his years of exile betancourt had to swallow numerous slights from american officials anxious to remain on good terms with the dictator and the restoration of democratic government was greeted by some of those officials with the sour comment that the investment climate in venezuela has rapidly worsened the united states moves against the revolutionary cuban regime have also been managed with little regard for the awkward position in which they placed venezuela last june for example the venezuelan labor federation ctv and several urd leaders pledged themselves to support the cuban revolution against its yanqui enemies the u s diplomatic delegation at san jose that august however insisted on a strong anti castro stand a step which most latin american governments would have preferred to avoid angel luis arcaya betan court s urd foreign minister and chief of the venezuelan delegation to san jose fought for a milder resolution when beaten he refused to sign the final declaration and when he returned to caracas he was greeted as a hero it was betan court s dismissal of arcaya followed by the resignation of all the urd cabinet members that led to the student riots i have mentioned above senators ellender and eastland did not help matters when they declared that what latin america needs is more dictators like trujillo and wished there was a trujillo in every country in central and south america shortly afterward trujillo was given 322 000 tons of the sugar quota taken away from cuba our diplomatic triumph at san jose left castro as strongly in power as ever and achieved nothing but the weakening of an invaluable ally _____________ in the meanwhile the streets of caracas still heavily guarded by troops equipped with tear gas bombs and machine guns are quiet the leftist opposition has evidently decided that betancourt cannot be overthrown by a popular revolution just now and that a more patient policy is indicated the government s repressive measures they believe will be a continuing source of resentment and in the long run they do not think betan court s moderate reform program will satisfy popular aspirations the success or failure of these programs during the next few years will determine the political future of venezuela and it is in implementing them that betancourt is running into a number of obstacles a major and seemingly ineradicable difficulty is the continued dominance of the military in venezuelan public life and the generals habit of regarding themselves as a kind of super legislature betancourt remembers quite well that his mentor gallegos was thrown out of office when the army decided that it did not like his land and tax reforms and he therefore treats the opinions of the defense minister general antonio briceño livares with great caution and respect the army s loyalty moreover must be paid for betancourt is obliged to make continual obeisances to the important role of the military as the advance guard for the defense of our sovereignty and to spend a quarter of his budget on the practically autonomous armed forces even so the 150 year old habit of conspiracy continues no elected president has ever finished out his term in venezuela and if betancourt is unlucky or makes a major misstep the army will send him to join his unfortunate predecessors the government s land reform program has also had to be carried out with excessive moderation and in such a way as not to interfere with any vested interests venezuela has never had a tax on land and betancourt does not dare to impose one the agrarian reform law passed a little over a year ago will not touch privately owned estates that are under cultivation and guarantees payment in full for whatever land is expropriated one plantation in portuguesa state for example was purchased for 480 000 and turned over to some three hundred farm families who also had to be given loans for seed equipment and living expenses other farmers have been settled on formerly unused government lands which require expensive penetration roads and irrigation projects at the present time about twenty thousand farm families have been resettled on something like two million acres as congressman selden of alabama pointed out after a visit to venezuela last fall resettlement of all the landless rural families at the present rate will take at least fifteen years and cost about 7 billion venezuela does not have that much money and may not have that much time to head off a social revolution mild as it is the agrarian program is bitterly resented by the landholding oligarchs who see themselves losing their supply of cheap labor and their old status as feudal lords _____________ industrializing the nation the dream of every latin american government also presents grave problems venezuela is one of the highest cost countries in the world perhaps the only one whose citizens fly to miami or new york for an inexpensive vacation under their new contract the oil workers will receive 23 a day in wages and fringe benefits so that it is more expensive to hire a man in venezuela than in texas or california these high costs have edged venezuelan crude oil out of several markets and make it quite impossible for manufacturers to find an overseas outlet as a result venezuela has had to protect her infant industries with high tariff walls and to stay outside the developing south american common market but the home market of 6 6 million people nine tenths of them bitterly impoverished cannot support any sizable industrial plant betancourt has recently chartered a government industrial corporation which he hopes will make a second ruhr of the orinoco valley but even the officials in charge admit that it will take decades to turn their ambitious blueprints into reality the government programs in education and housing are also handicapped by prior commitments and lack of funds during his first two years in office betancourt built schools for some 90 000 pupils and provided free lunches for some 100 000 poor children but half the population remains illiterate and tens of thousands of students are still without classrooms fidel castro s cuba with infinitely smaller resources and at the cost of a social civil war has done a great deal more illiteracy in cuba should be all but eliminated by the end of this year the venezuelan housing program also lags behind cuba s less than 12 000 low cost houses have so far been built and a scandalously large number of them have been set aside for officers families who certainly do not need additional subsidies since the government cannot cut the army s budget and is unwilling or unable to impose land or income taxes the only way to speed up these programs would be to draw greater revenue from the oil companies but the present state of the world market for oil is discouraging venezuela exported 30 million more barrels in 1960 than in 1959 yet received 56 million bolívares less in income betan court s decision not to grant any more concessions has brought new investment to a halt yet the government oil company formed last year is too small and slow moving to take up the slack officials of the company were not even appointed until a year after its incorporation and its director hopes optimistically to produce ten thousand barrels a day by the end of this year as against 1 1 million a day for creole a subsidiary of standard oil the company seems to have been established merely as a sop to the nationalist groups who have been demanding a castro like expropriation of foreign owned properties the resignation this march of the finance minister dr thomas enrique carillo batalla after only three months in office is a sign of renewed financial crisis dr carillo s orthodox program aimed at balancing the budget and halting the flight of capital depended upon a 900 million long term loan from washington a sum vastly in excess of anything the u s was willing to put up the collapse of his minister s ambitious plans means still another setback for betan court s hope of reviving venezuela s economy and financing liberal reforms _____________ despite his difficulties betancourt is of course sympathetic to the kennedy program his comment upon it was that the white house begins to speak a language that has not been heard since the days of franklin delano roosevelt venezuela s president is an old personal friend of a a berle kennedy s chief adviser on latin american affairs betancourt is also highly satisfied with the appointment of teodoro moscoso as our next ambassador to venezuela moscoso the former head of operation bootstrap and the first puerto rican appointed to ambassadorial rank speaks spanish as his native language and has an exceptional grasp of latin american economic problems despite these promising auguries of understanding and good will kennedy too must reckon with internal political factors that may adversely affect his latin american program it is going to be very hard to persuade congress to provide more money for loans to nations that have squandered so many billions already representative otto passman of louisiana whose subcommittee is now studying the initial request for 500 million has a long record of successfully cutting down foreign aid appropriations venezuela s mineral exports to this country are also under pressure when labor secretary goldberg visited hibbing minnesota recently to investigate unemployment there for example he was told that charity begins at home and asked what the government intended to do about curbing iron ore imports president kennedy has also continued the quota on oil imports west virginia coal miners and u s oil producers unlike venezuelans can vote and make campaign contributions and sam rayburn and lyndon johnson must be kept satisfied such pressures as these may force further cutbacks and delays in a program that seems somewhat inadequate to begin with and the venezuelan people may not be willing to wait the consequences of betancourt s failure to resolve his domestic difficulties could be very serious a military dictatorship no longer seems a real possibility for the venezuelan people would refuse to work for such a government but if democratic reform fails in venezuela the nation is almost sure to take a sharp turn toward castroism and a fidel castro in caracas would make our current troubles with cuba look petty cuban sugar is not after all an essential commodity and because cuba is an island she can be effectively isolated by the u s navy operating out of our bases on the mainland and at guantanamo but venezuela supplies a substantial part of the western hemisphere s oil and two fifths of u s iron ore imports u s businessmen have 3 5 billion invested in the country three times their former stake in cuba from a strategic point of view venezuela s impenetrable mountain regions are ideal for castro style guerrilla warfare and her land frontiers border the most impoverished and rebellious regions of brazil and colombia these dark perspectives may seem rather remote but after observing fidel castro s rapid leftward course we cannot ignore the possibility of the same thing happening in countries like venezuela that suffer from the same social ills that bedeviled pre 1958 cuba _____________

the government of sri lanka has embraced free trade agreements ftas as a key focus of the national trade and development strategy the rationale of this policy choice has been intenselydebated in the sri lankan policy circles the debate has reached a new height following the release of the report of the committee of experts coe appointed by the president to evaluate the sri lanka singapore free trade agreement the purpose of this article is to assess this debate the purpose of this article is to contribute to this debate by assessing the trade outcome of sri lanka india free trade agreement slifta and sri lanka pakistan free trade agreement slpfta and the likely impact of the controversial sri lanka singapore free trade agreement slsfta the article focuses solely on the economic rationale of ftas ignoring political considerations sri lanka india free trade agreement slifta the slifta was signed in december 1998 and it became operational in march 2000 the agreement covers only merchandise trade traded goods in 2005 sri lanka and india initiated negotiations to extend the slfta into a comprehensive economic partnership agreement cepa which would cover services and investment in addition to broadening commodity coverage of trade liberalisation the slifta adopts a negative list approach to trade liberalisation to begin with india sri lanka fta islfta india provided sri lanka duty concessions 90 100 percent duty exemptions on 1351 items at the six digit level of the harmonized system however tea and garments produced with non indian fabrics were subject to import quotas and could enter india only through designated ports in early 2003 2799 more items were added to the concession list port of entry restrictions on tea and garments were relaxed and the quota on garment imports was expanded trade preferences granted by sri lanka to india are more extensive and larger in proportional terms but concessions have been granted mostly on products for which mfn tariffs are already very low most of food products exported from india which have considerable potential for rapid market penetration in sri lanka remain on the negative list with high import duties the roos of the agreement are a combination of rvc and cts value added 35 percent of fob value if the inputs come from both countries or 25 percent if inputs conform one of the two countries final product have a different classification compared to intermediate inputs at the 4 digit hs level the agreement incorporates special and differential treatment provisions to factor in sri lanka s smaller economic size kelegama 2014 weerakoon 2001 a claim made in various government reports and by proponents of fta is that sri lanka has been a net gainer of the slifta exports under the agreement account for over 60 percent of total exports to india whereas only a smaller share of import about 10 percent is covered by the agreement central bank of sri lanka 2018 ratnayake 2017 however a close look at the data suggests that this is a rather simplistic interpretation of the actual trade outcome under the agreement table 1 there was a surge of exports from sri lanka to india during the first seven to eight years following the agreement came into force this was mainly due to exports of vanaspati refined hydrogenated oil listed under hs 151620 and primary copper extracted from imported from scrap metal hs7403 these products accounted for over nearly 60 percent of total sri lankan export to india during this period however the expansion of these exports was not driven by sri lanka s comparative advantage in their production compared to india rather it was because indian manufactures invested heavily in sri lanka to produce these products to reap gains from lower sri lankan tariffs on required main inputs crude palm oil for vanaspati production and scrap metal for extracting primary copper and preferential under zero tariff entry of the end products to india under the fta athukorala 2014 the export dynamism of vanaspati and copper was short lived however under strong pressure from the indian vanaspati producers association india subsequently cut its import tariffs on palm oil from 70 percent in the early 1990s to 7 5 percent in january 2008 andthen to zero in march 2008 and imposed stringent tariff rate quotas on vanaspati imports from sri lanka consequently vanaspati exports disappeared from sri lanka s export list from about 2009 in the case of copper from 2008 india begun to regulate imports from sri lanka based on its own domestic value addition estimates made using the london metal exchange prices this remarkable policy response was based on india s concerns about the validity of the roo certificates issued by the sri lankan department of commerce following the introduction of the stringent procedure for approving market access a large proportion of sri lankan copper exports lanka because ineligible for entering india under the fta tariff concessions during the ensuing years sri lankan exports to india of some other products were also subjected from time to time to various forms of administrative protection such as stringent food safety regulations delaying customs clearance and changes made in the list of ports demarcated for the entry of sri lanka goods pal 2015 there is also anecdotal evidence that some sri lanka exporters have begun to shun the fta and export under the mfn tariffs because of the cumbersome and costly procedures involved in obtaining roo certificates and delays in import clearance at the indian ports reflecting the combined effect of all these factors the share of sri lanka s exports to india covered by the slifta declined from a peak of 97 percent in 2005 to about 64 percent during the past five years the share of total exports to india declined from about 8 5 percent in the early 2000s to 6 4 percent during 2015 17 even these figures need to be treated with caution because of some cases of alleged trade deflection that is rerouting some products of some products from other countries to india via sri lanka through alleged manipulation of the country of origin certification two highly publicised cases are rerouting to india of aricanuts from indonesia and black pepper from vietnam the food safety regulations and other administrative restrictions imposed by india on imports from sri lanka from time to time clearly support the view that in practice implementation of a bilateral fta is highly susceptible to domestic lobby group pressures particularly when the fta partner is a large country with greater bargaining power presumably a small country like sri lanka has a much better chance of resolving these issues through the multilateral dispute settlement process of the wto involvement of other wto members is the dispute settlement process could help overcome resistance arising at the bilateral level an interesting example is the resolution of the sri lanka eu dispute relating to cinnamon exports in 2006 some member countries of the eu introduced a de facto banned on imports of cinnamon from sri lanka because of sulphur dioxide so2 content sri lankan authorities were able to successfully resolve the dispute by appealing to the wto under the sanitary and phytosanitary animal and plant health agreement the settlement of the issue involved adoption of a new international food safety standard for cinnamon that helped ensuring transference in food safety monitoring in international cinnamon trade it is often claimed that under the slifta india has become the second largest destination for sri lankan exports however india accounts for only about 6 percent of sri lankan exports compared to the 26 percent share of the largest destination country the usa a close look at the commodity composition of exports cast doubt about possibilities for further expansion of exports from sri lanka to india most of the agricultural products which account for the bulk of total exports to india are subject to supply constraints sri lanka s total world exports of some agricultural products cinnamon cloves black pepper have increased at a much slower rates or even hardly increased suggesting that increase in exports to india involved diversion of exports from other markets propelled by duty free market access rather than by a net increase in domestic production most of the manufactured goods exported from sri lanka under the fta benefit from high mfn import tariffs in india and are therefore susceptible to further unilateral trade liberalisation in india garments the main manufacturing export of sri lanka account for less than 3 percent of sri lankan exports to india as a labour abundant country it is unlikely that india is prepared to substantially expose its garment industry to competition from sri lanka on a bilateral basis the picture is very different on the import side the share of imposts from india has on average accounted over 20 percent of sri lanka s total merchandise exports during 2000 17 even though imports under slifta account for a small and declining share in sri lanka s total imports from india averaging to a mere 6 percent during this period this pattern is consistent with sri lanka s high trade compatibility explained below with india on the import side the high compatibility is in fact what we would expect in trade between a small country and a giant trading pattern with a highly diversified production base even though india has a large and diversified production base compared to sri lanka and most of the products in sri lanka s import baskets are produced in india at internationally competitive prices moreover sri lanka isa low tariff country in the region with significant number of zero duty tariff lines given the strong trade compatibility and low import tariff tariff concessions granted under the slifta are not a significant determinant of sri lanka s imports from india on the export side the small share of exports to india 6 percent seems to reflect the low degree of compatibility between commodity composition of sri lanka s exports and that of india s exports india has strong cooperative advantage in world trade in most labour and resource intensive products exported from sri lanka the term trade compatibility refers to the extent to which the trade patterns of a given country match with that of its partner country whether products exported by a given partner country are the ones mostly imported by the other partner country and the vice versa the degree of trade compatibility depends on a country s comparative advantage in international production which intern depends on the nature of resource endowment and the stage of economic development the economic size of the country also matters because larger counties generally tend to have a more diversified product mix most of the ftas listed in the policy debate as success cases such as the north american free trade agreement nafta vietnam us ftas and ftas of australia and new zealand with china are between countries with strong trade compatibility on both import and export sides according to over estimates using the methodology of michaely 1996 compatibility commodity composition between sri lanka s imports and india s exports in world trade is as high as 68 percent where the comparable figure relating to sri lanka s exports and india s imports in only 22 percent there was a notable decline in sri lanka s bilateral trade deficit with india during about the first five years following the slifta came into effect this declining trend has disappeared since then over the past decade the bilateral trade deficit amounted to over five times of total exports to india without showing any declining trend given the glaring asymmetry on export and import sides between sri lanka and india under the slifta india has an exorbitant bargaining power in trade negotiation with sri lanka this arguably accounts for india s ability to control imports from sri lanka by resorting to various non tariff barriers pal 2015 notwithstanding its stated commitment to honour special and differential treatment provisions the experience so far under the slifta therefore does not augur well for sri lanka to obtain further market access through the ongoing etca negotiations si lanka pakistan free trade agreement slpfta the slptfa was signed in july 2002 and it came to effect in june 2005 in terms of the coverage of the concessions positive list and the roos the agreement is virtually a mirror image of the islindfa ahmad 2012 slpfta covers about 80 percent of total sri lankan exports to pakistan but these exports account for a mere 0 7 percent of total sri lankan exports table 2 the export mix is dominated by agricultural products and ago based raw material natural rubber vegetable products coconut and some spices the data for the past five years shows that the average utilisation of trqs offered under the slpftahas been very low tea 13 percent garments 4 percent betel leaves 6 percent for tea and garments higher prices of sri lankan products compared to imports from other sources are considered a major reason for the low quota utilisation sri lankan garment producers have significantly upgraded their product mix over the past few decades and pakistan is not attractive market for these products pbc 2018 imports from pakistan account for about 1 7 percent of total sri lankan imports the product mix consists of woollen fabrics and bed linen cements fertilizer and basmati rice there is no evidence of a notable increase in imports following the fta came into effect at the time of negotiating the agreement the sri lankan authorities expected that the country s garment industry would benefit from procuring cotton yarn and fabrics from pakistan world bank 2005 this expectation has not materialised pakistani yarn and fabric accounts for a small share less than 2 percent of these imposts to sri lanka this was presumably because garment producers must procure high quality inputs from established sources to meet the quality requirements demanded by the international buyers moreover garment producer in sri lanka have duty free access to imports from any country under the ftz scheme and duty rebate provisions available to non ftz firms overall trade patterns under the slpfta are consistence with our analytical prior that trade outcome under an fta depends crucially on the trade compatibility between the partner countries of course lack of awareness of among the business community of the trade concessions offered in the agreement as noted in a recent study by the pakistan business council pbc 2015 could have played a role at the margin some comments on the sri lanka singapore free trade agreement slsfta unlike the slifta and the slpfta slsfta has a wider range of reform provisions going beyond liberalisation of trade in goods to include other areas such as services movement of professionals telecommunications and electronic commerce overall the subject coverage is similar to the other ftas involving singapore the slsfta was signed on 1 many 2018 however whether or when and in what form will the agreement come into force remain uncertain following the release in last november 2018 of the report of the committee of experts coe appointed by the president to evaluate it singapore is one of the most opened trading nations in the world singapore s average mfn applied duty rate is zero for all imports other than imports of beverages and tobacco for which the averaged rate varies from 1 6 percent to 85 percent wto 2018 thus the slsfta is unlikely to have a direct impact on sri lanka s exports to singapore some commentators have expressed concern that under the agreement sri lanka would be able to exports to other southeast asian countries with which singapore has entered in to free trade agreement it simply reflects the popular media practice of treating trade within ftas as free trade this view ignores the fact that roos which are an integral part of any fta preclude transhipment of goods to a third country though a fta partner country sri lanka does not have string trade compatibility with singapore on the import side 31 percent in terms of the michaely index this is because over the past three decades singapore s export structure has undergone a dramatic transformation commodity composition of exports is now dominated by petrochemicals pharmaceuticals high tech parts and components of electronics and surgical and scientific equipment singapore is not a supplier of assembled final consumer electronics and electrical foods automobiles and low end parts and comports of these products which dominate sri lanka s manufacturing imports therefore the market penetration effect in sri lanka of singapore products under the agreement is like to be negligible there is a fear that the agreement could open the door for industrial waste and other environmentally harmful products to enter sri lanka this would entirely depend on the implementation of the roos of the agreement by the singapore authorities given the well functioning instructions in singapore with a proven record of adherence to the rule of law one can hope that there would be little room for tweaking or lax implementation of the roos on singapore s part the sri lankan authorities anticipate that slsfta would help linking the sri lankan manufacturing sector to global production networks global manufacturing value chain cbsl 2018 how this would happen is not clearly stated in the related government documents one possibility could be singapore based firms operating within production networks relocating some sediments tasks of the firms in sri lanka to exploit advantages from relative production cost differences indeed this process helped spreading production networks from singapore to the neighbouring countries during the period from about the mid 1970s to the late 1990s athukorala and kohpaiboon 2014 however because of the dramatic industrial transformation noted above industries such as semiconductor and hard disk drive with potential to shift relatively low end activities to low cost locations have already disappeared from singapore it is important to note that the electronics firms currently in operating in sri lankan manufacturing export predominantly to countries like japan usa germany and some european countries their exports to singapore and other asean countries are minuscule notwithstanding duty free access to these markets under the wto s information technology agreement even if there were some opportunities for production relocation whether the fta would be an effective vehicle for facilitating the process is highly debatable for two reasons first the very essence of global production sharing within global production networks is locating different segments of the production process globally rather regionally or bilaterally the relative cost advantage of producing assembling a given part or components in the supply chain need not necessarily lie in a country within the jurisdictional boundaries of a specific fta second there are formidable complications relating to the application of roos for trade within global production networks most of the task segments produced assembled within production networks have very thing value added margins in each location in addition most of imports and export of parts and components trained with production fall under the same hs 4 digit classifications therefore the identification of the origin of trade within production network for granting tariff preferences becomes a major challenge athukorala kohpaiboon 2011 put simply the rise of global production sharing strengthens the case for multilateral wto based or unilateral rather than regional fta approach to trade liberalisation to quote victor fung the honorary chairman of li fung the world s largest supply chain intermediary based in hong kong bilateralism distorts flows of goods in structuring the supply chain every country of origin rule and every bilateral deal has to be tackled on as additional considerations thus constraining companies in optimising production globally victor fung financial times november 3 2005 these considerations suggest that more appropriate policy option for facilitating a country s engagement in global production network is unilateral liberalisation or becoming a signatory to the ita both policy options assure unconditional duty free access to the required inputs the case for such broader liberalisation rather than following the fta route lies in that global production sharing is a global phenomenon rather than a regional or bilateral phenomenon one of the main envisaged gains to sri lanka from the slsfta is attracting fdi from singapore it is expected that the provisions in the investment chapter chapter 10 safeguards against expropriation most favoured nation treatment repatriation of capital and return from investment would entice singapore investors to come to sri lanka however these provisions are exactly similar to those embodied in the bilateral investment protection treaty bipt between the two countries that has been in force over three decades since september 1980 notwithstanding this long standing treaty sri lanka has so far been able to attack only a tiny share of rapidly expensing oversees fdi from singapore the total stock of our war fdi from singapore increased from us 32 billion 1994 5 to over 560 billion in 2015 16 however during this period singaporean fdi in sri lanka amounted to a mere us 1 2 billion based on investment approval records of the board of investment this compassion is much in line with the available multicounty evidence that a bipt or an fta with an fdi chapter for that matter is unlikely to entice foreign investors unless they are appropriately embodied in a broader reform addenda to improve the overall investment climate of the country hallward driemeier 2003 the data relating to the evolving patterns of outward fdi from singapore seems to suggest that even with required broader reforms opportunities for sri lanka to attract singaporean investors are not very promising this is because there is limited compatibility between the sectoral composition of singaporean outward fdi and both sri lanka s development priories and the current stage of economic development over a half of outward fdi from singapore is in the financial sector these investments are primarily destined to high income countries the manufacturing share of fdi which is relevant for sri lanka s objective of joining global production networks accounts for a smaller and declining share of total outward fdi 16 percent in 2015 16 compared to 25 percent in1994 95 mnes accounts for the lion s share of singapore s manufacturing industry over 80 percent output as noted the slsfta is unlikely to be relevant for these mnes because they make investment location decisions at their headquarters based of a wider inter country assessment report of the presidential committee a fuller assessment of the report of the presidential committee of experts coe on slsfta is beyond the scope of this article however we would like to make some brief observations on the report s key recommendation priority need to be given to unilateral trade policy reforms instead of relying on ftas we fully agree with this recommendation in fact we have provided empirical evidence in support of this view whereas coe s recommendation is based on priory reasoning in addition we have discussed inherent limitations of the fta approach to trade opening compared to unilateral and multilateral reforms we also endorse the recommendation that national trade policy must align with a coherent national development policy framework however we find that the recommendation made by the coe is not consistent with the objective of addressing supply side issues to improve the country s competitiveness in the context of the rapidly changing global economic order the recommendations are simply old wine in new bottles the coe recommends to focus on targeted liberalization so as to avoid interference with the growing or infant industries infants have to grow at home they cannot start off as exporters following the examples of japan south korea and brazil during 1965 1985 we were surprised to see brazil listed here an example to follow brazil is certainly not a development success story thomas 2006 yes brazil achieved rapid industrial growth during the import substitution era but the brazilian manufacturing industry has miserably failed to maintain this growth spurt during the ensuing decades in spite of country specific advantages such as the ample domestic resource base the vast domestic market and access to markets in neighbouring countries only a handful of firms emerged during the import substitution era have continued to reman internationally competitive give the lacklustre economic performance in a land of ample unexploded potential brazil is known in development policy circles as the eternal land of the future edwards 2010 export oriented industrialization in japan and south korea and also taiwan was certainly guided and aided by the state however their development success was not based on blanket industrial protection as advocated by the coe perkin 2013 studwell 2013 li 1995 park 1970 tsai 1997 trade protection and other government support to firms in these countries were strictly time bound and more importantly subject to stringent export performance requirement export discipline exporting firms always enjoyed duty free status in procuring imported inputs for export production culling those firms which did not measure up was an integral part of their policy more importantly all those countries had strong committed leadership that was vital for effective implementing these policies president park chun he who engineered the korean export oriented growth miracle summed up his policy vision as follows the economic planning or long range development programme must not be allowed to stifle creativity or spontaneity of private enterprises we should utilise to the maximum extent the merit usually introduced by the price mechanism of free competition thus avoiding the possible damages accompanying a monopoly system there can be and will be no economic planning for the same of planning itself park 1970 p 214 emphasis added the coe has ignored dramatic changes in the global economy in making the recommendations that infants have to grow at home this conventional infant industry argument is based on the standard trade theoretical assumption that countries trade in goods produced from beginning to the end within its geographical boundaries it is not consistent with global production sharing which has been the prime mover of export oriented industrialisation in this era of economic labialisation to be successful in this form of specialisation a firm has to have a global focus at birth it is important to note that most if not all of the successful exporting firms in sri lankan manufacturing emerged de novo benefitting from the concurrent liberalisation of foreign trade and investment regimes athukorala 2019 we do not agree with the coe s recommendation for postponing trade reforms until achieving the required supply side capabilities trade liberalisation should instead be an integral part of the overall reform package it is not possible to achieve supply side desiderata emphasised in the report such as factor efficiency and productivity growth improving innovative capacity under a protectionist trade regime contrary to the coe s claim in east asian countries trade reforms have gone hand in hand with supply side reforms by trade liberalisation we mean here a move towards a relative more uniform tariff suture that has a low average tariff with provisions for duty free access to intermediate inputs for export production not mindless dismantling of all trade barriers relating to trade policy reforms the coe recommends combining para tariff pt with customs duties in order to provide protection to domestic manufacturers the existing cocktail of pts was introduced in an arbitrary fashion during 2005 2015 for revenue raising purposes not for protecting industries thanks to tariff reforms introduced at successive stages during the preceding two decades by the early 2000s sri lanka had been approaching an important policy phase marked by shifting the agenda away from protection and towards achieving a stable and predictable trade policy regime this process was interrupted by the arbitrary introduction pts and upward adjustment the rates pts are an anomaly in the import duty structure that complicates customs administration there is also evidence that pts are now a major cause of anti export bias in the incentive structure combining pts and customs duties would help perpetuating the ant export bias in making the recommendation for combining pts with customs tariffs the coe has overlooked an important feature of the tariff structure almost all intermediate imports to the country come under zero duty tariff lines but these imports are subject to pts so removing pts would directly help rather than hinder domestic producers ability to procure intermediate inputs at world market prices is an important determinant of the competitiveness of manufacturing exports concluding remarks the role of ftas in trade performance is vastly exaggerated in the sri lankan policy debate most politicians and much of the media often do not seem understand the distinction between free trade and trade under ftas in reality ftas are essentially preferential trade deals and actual trade effect is conditioned by the choice of commodity coverage which is basically determined by political considerations and lobby group pressure and rules of origin the actual coverage of ftas in world trade much lower that portrayed in the sri lankan debate over 80 of world trade is taking place under the standard most favor nation mfn tariff system the failure to make progress with the process of multilateral liberation under the wto does not make a valid case for giving priority to ftas the proliferation of ftas over the past three decades has been driven largely by a number of non economic factors including the bandwagon effects if the road to multilateral approach to trade reforms is closed then the better and time honored alternative is unilateral liberalization combined with appropriate supply side reforms the outcome of ftas or unilateral liberalization depends crucially on supply side reforms needed to improve firms capability to reap gains from market opening however even with effective supply side reforms ftas would not promote trade in the absence of significant compatibility in trade patterns of the partner countries trade compatibility depends on the nature of economic structures and the stage of development of the countries location of the countries in the same region the neighborhood factor does not necessarily ensure trade compatibility our estimates of trade compatibility and the analysis of the experience under the slifta and slpfta cast doubt on potential trade gains from signing ftas with countries in the region giving priory to fta is the national trade and development strategy is not consistent with the government s objective of linking domestic manufacturing to global production networks global manufacturing value chain global production sharing is a global not necessarily a regional phenomenon the relative cost advantage of producing assembling a given part or components in the supply chain need not necessarily lie in a country within the jurisdictional boundaries of a specific fta there is no evidence to support the view that sri lanka needs an intermediary country singapore to join production networks the electronics films currently operating in sri lankan manufacturing export predominantly to countries like japan usa germany and some european countries their exports to singapore and other asean countries minuscule notwithstanding duty free access to these markets under the wto s information technology agreement the available evidence on the role of ftas in attracting fdi is mixed at best the only policy inference one can make from this evidence is that ftas can play a role at the margin in enticing foreign investors provided the other preconditions on the supply side are met proliferation of ftas has the adverse side effect of complicating the tariff structure giving rise to inefficiencies in resource allocation overlapping of the standard mfn tariffs with fta tariff concessions and multiple roosattached ftas weaken efficiency improvements in the custom system and opens up opportunities for corruption prof prema chandra athukorala is professor of economics australian national

a new analysis of china s growth shows its economy slumping and that it has recently crossed its long term filtered growth trend line the filtered growth trend line is developed utilizing a macroeconomic mathematical tool to smooth short term fluctuations from time series data when you look at the filtered growth trend for china s economy since 1978 in exhibit 12 the pace of its growth including those periods of modest decline creates a slow undulating line over time rather than the sharp up and down movements reflected in a plot of the actual changes in real annual gross domestic production the current trend pattern suggests a further weakening in the country s economic growth based on china s history of economic growth the people who prepared this chart are suggesting that china s economy will slump for potentially four years they arrive at their forecast based on the three economic contractions since 1978 that averaged 4 3 years we believe it might be of more value to examine closer the three historic recession periods and business conditions in the first recession 1978 1982 china s economy was subjected to the same pressures the rest of the world s economy experienced as there was a broad based recession during that period the second recession spanned the 1988 1991 period again when the world suffered a recession but one that was much more mild than the earlier period it did include the last time of significant social unrest marked by the tiananmen square confrontation between students and the chinese military the six year recession of 1996 2002 encompassed the asian currency crisis which was regional in scope rather than the global one we are now dealing with that economic recession was accompanied by a huge collapse in oil prices that inflicted economic pain on the southeast asia region we looked at china s oil consumption over 1978 2008 over that period china s oil consumption has grown by slightly over 6 1 million barrels a day b d from 1 825 million b d to 7 940 million b d within this growth profile there were periods of rapid oil consumption increases and periods of slow growth and even periods of decline in consumption for example in 1978 1982 china s oil demand fell by 224 000 b d then in 1988 1991 oil consumption grew by 313 000 b d the more recent period of economic weakness 1996 2002 saw the country s oil consumption grow by 1 586 million b d clearly each of these periods was marked by different economic and financial factors making it impossible to merely point to one and say that should be the model for forecasting the impact on china s oil consumption in the next recession it is interesting to note the relative impact of the consumption growth or contraction on china s total oil consumption in each period when oil consumption fell in the early 1980s the average annual decline measured against the average annual total consumption during the period was 3 3 in 1988 1991 the impact was 4 3 during the most recent period of economic weakness the impact of the oil consumption change was 5 6 of average annual chinese demand looking to the future to try to assess the impact of a contracting chinese economy on the country s oil demand we think the recent period of economic weakness may prove to be of greater guidance value than the two earlier periods that means we still expect chinese oil consumption to grow in the next few years even if the pace of economic activity is below its historic trend line growth rate so far we have seen the iea s estimates for china s oil demand growth shrink this is true for both 2008 which has already seen significant deterioration in the country s rate of growth and 2009 the iea initially estimated china s oil demand growth for 2008 at 500 000 b d but have reduced it to 85 000 b d and its 2009 growth projection has fallen from a 400 000 b d increase to 290 000 b d we would not be surprised to see the 2009 forecast fall further as we move deeper into the year we feel safe stating that conclusion given the latest economic data points and antidotal evidence coming from china for example guangdong province mainland china s largest exporting base grew at 10 1 in 2008 some 4 6 percentage points slower than in 2007 the province s export growth shrunk 5 6 percentage points from the 22 3 growth recorded in 2007 while industrial output slowed by 5 2 percentage points to 12 8 in 2008 according to guangdong province s vice governor huang longyun the number of businesses that closed or de registered in 2008 increased to 62 400 4 739 more than in the previous year small companies and traditional industries made up the bulk of the casualties the province added 32 800 new companies in the pearl river delta area the vice governor pointed out that some of the province s economic indicators declined seriously last year he believes the province is facing the worst economic environment since the asian financial crisis a decade ago the poor health of the chinese economy and especially its export industry was further substantiated by figures for china s air cargo volumes for mainland airlines in november that declined 11 3 compared to the prior year air cargo from the mainland to hong kong a major export hub for chinese air freight declined 22 4 in november after slipping 3 1 in october as reported by the south china morning post the air cargo weakness was supported by the second profit warning issued to the hong kong stock exchange by cathay pacific an unidentified cathay pacific executive said he expects hong kong exports to fall year over year more than 20 in december magnifying the 15 4 decline experienced in november besides profit warnings cathay pacific has parked two large air freight planes to trim its u s and european capacity by 10 the outlook for an improvement in chinese exports in the near term is not promising according to sunny ho lop kee executive director of the hong kong shippers council pearl river delta factories are working on old contracts if they have any as no new contracts have been signed in recent months the market for exports will be slow to recover since new contracts have 6 week to 6 month lag times from signing to production with the demand for high end goods electronics and high fashion withering in the united states and europe he does not expect much of a recovery in the region s exports until well into 2009 the economic softness recently showed up in china s foreign exchange reserves which increased by 27 last year to 1 95 trillion that growth was down from prior years growth rates marking the first time in a decade that has happened in 2008 foreign exchange reserves increased by 417 8 billion compared to 461 9 billion in 2007 the slowdown is attributed to a shrinking trade surplus that became very evident in the second half of last year and a possible slowing of the speculative hot money flows into the country as we read these economic statistics and learn about growing economic and financial turmoil in china we are reminded about the chinese counter arguments to the theory that countries that host the olympics suffer slower economic growth following the event this analysis points to the 5 2 annual gdp growth in japan in 1965 the year following the tokyo olympics and a year with 13 1 growth people also point to 1988 when south korea s growth rate slowed to 6 7 from 10 6 the year prior to the seoul olympics it seems that this economic growth pattern was also true for spain australia and greece it was not true for the united states as its post atlanta olympics growth rate accelerated to 4 5 from the prior year s 3 7 the research conducted on this economic growth phenomenon by various chinese professors concluded that there is a close relationship between the host country s economic growth following an olympics and the host city s economic size the larger the city s role in the host country s gdp the greater the impact on the national economy tokyo represented 26 3 of japan s gdp in 1965 while seoul accounted for 27 7 of south korea s economy and sydney was 24 5 of australia s national product these three cities accounted for over one quarter of their country s gdp athens was even greater as it accounted for 34 2 of greece s economy in contrast atlanta accounted for only 1 9 of u s gdp in 2007 beijing s gdp was 900 billion yuan in contrast to 25 000 billion yuan for all of china s economy beijing represented only 3 6 of its nation s economic activity because almost all of the olympic events and venues were in or close to beijing the view of these economists was that the country would not suffer the same economic fate of most of the other host cities since the global economic and financial downturn deepened soon after the ending of the olympics it is hard to discern whether beijing will prove to be the exception to the rule of cities with small national economic impact not experiencing a post olympic slowdown as more global oil forecasts call for 2009 s demand to decline from 2008 marking the second year in a row of declining oil consumption one might expect there to be a significant impact on china s oil use we believe china s recently announced economic stimulus package that emphasizes new infrastructure investment coupled with the country s expanding population and domestic consumption energy use will increase unless we experience a global recession similar in scale to the great depression we believe there is little that will stop china s oil consumption from growing if nothing else the government may consider accelerating buying foreign crude oil for storage in its newly completed strategic storage facilities while we are comfortable in projecting increased chinese oil consumption we are not sure about the rate of its consumption growth for global oil markets therein may lay a problem if china s oil demand growth is not robust which we believe means 500 000 b d to one million b d of annual growth then global oil markets could be negatively impacted for a period of time that would place downward pressure on oil prices a counter to that view is suggested by recent research from bca research that examined the history of china s economic growth since 1975 they concluded that china s healthy economic growth periods nearly always were preceded by major economic challenges that correlation extends back 30 years to the start of deng xiaoping s efforts to use market forces to strengthen the chinese economy after the 1970s economic slowdown china embarked in the early 1980s on its policy of socialism with chinese characteristics which blended state ownership of major industries with private enterprise the result was acceleration in china s growth rate again after a government induced economic slowdown and the tiananmen square massacre in the late 1980s deng made his famous tour of southern china to promote special economic zones and other market oriented reforms china s growth then shot up the same sequence of government action and rapid economic growth followed china s admission into the world trade organization in 2001 from this research bca believes there is the opportunity for china to seize upon the current financial turmoil and take bold actions that will boost the country s growth there may be a huge opportunity for the government to use its announced economic stimulus program to begin the shift of its economy away from an export dependent model to one more reliant on domestic consumption that could not only provide a stimulus to economic growth but also provide a more steady growth for china in the future if this is part of the government s plan it would help explain the government s efforts in recent years to seek out oil and mineral resources around the world to ensure the country s raw material supplies it also suggests that china will continue to need more oil in future years

a motorbike rider passes electricity pylons alongside a roadway on the outskirts of chengdu capital of southwestern china s sichuan province in a file photo china is making major cuts in electricity rates to support business and its sagging economy raising questions about government subsidies and environmental concerns on march 9 china s central electric utility state grid corp announced a 10 percent reduction in average electricity charges for business users this year to relieve the burden on the real economy the official xinhua news agency said the break comes on top of a 10 6 percent rate cut for commercial users in 2018 that saved china s businesses 79 2 billion yuan u s 11 7 billion according to the report with industrial users included the assistance last year totaled 91 5 billion yuan u s 13 6 billion the state owned utility said while state controlled rates are subject to change the announcement appeared to be unusual in citing the economic benefit as the purpose without any reference to market conditions fuel prices or generating costs the moves posed a host of policy questions about regulation in the power sector pricing reform and the potential for anti competitive industrial subsidies the huge drop in electricity bills also highlighted the government s all out response to china s economic slowdown which has so far included tax cuts infrastructure spending and a surge in bank loans although the cost of the combined rate cuts for 2018 and 2019 appears to be substantial the announcement did not specify whether the state grid power producers or the government would pay for it according to the xinhua report the state grid topped the list of china s largest companies last year with revenue of 2 36 trillion yuan u s 351 7 billion suggesting that the utility could cover the cost but the company s total profit fell 14 3 percent from a year earlier dropping for the first time in five years an analysis by hong kong based ping an securities said the burden of the break the burden of last year s break fell mostly on grid companies although some provinces reduced on grid tariffs for coal fired generators said philip andrews speed a principal fellow at the national university of singapore s energy studies institute the plan this year calls for the coal fired power plants to pay for the rate reductions for business consumers since most or all of the provinces are expected to cut their on grid tariffs the coal fired generators are complaining now which is quite justified andrews speed said overcapacity of generation has drastically reduced their operating hours and is squeezing margins and now they are getting lower tariffs some for the second year running he said the government s decision to manipulate electricity rates for the purpose of economic stimulus is seen as a setback for energy reforms these measures completely undermine the development of the power market andrews speed said this has been announced at a time when the government is claiming to be liberalizing the power market by allowing generators to sell to large users at tariffs to be set by negotiation and allowing a proliferation of power retailers he said in his annual work report to the national people s congress on march 5 premier li keqiang suggested that the government would advance reforms and set lower electricity rates at the same time we will deepen electric power market reforms overhaul electricity price surcharges reduce the electricity usage cost for the manufacturing industry and reduce the average electricity price of general industrial and commercial industry by another 10 percent li said from an environmental standpoint large rate cuts are also likely to be counterproductive since cheaper power prices encourage energy consumption while the rate reductions are across the board they will likely provide the biggest benefit to the largest energy users and sources of emissions including makers of steel cement and building materials a general view of a construction site owned by state grid corporation of china the country s state owned electric utility monopoly in beijing oct 17 2016 credit afp competition concerns the double digit cuts will also come as a gift and effective subsidy to marginal state owned enterprises soes potentially raising competition concerns of trading partners american steelmakers and other manufacturers have long complained about the effects of chinese subsidies but whether the issue of power pricing will figure in the current u s china trade negotiations is open to question the issue of whether the rate cuts constitute a subsidy is complex said william reinsch a former commerce department official now a senior adviser at the center for strategic and international studies in washington the definition of subsidy in both u s law and wto world trade organization rules requires specificity reinsch said that is to be a subsidy there must be a specific benefit to somebody if the government lowers the rate for everybody that would not be a subsidy because it is not specific reinsch said there are other complications the laws would not support u s action against a subsidy unless a u s party was injured raising more questions about competition and the size of per unit costs the wto would want to know whether the rate cuts apply only to chinese companies or also to foreign companies manufacturing in china the question of whether the decrease qualifies as a subsidy also depends on whether the price of electricity has been lowered below a market rate which is hard to determine in china and so on taking all that into account the rate cuts might still be actionable which could trigger a countervailing duty reinsch said but the outcome seems far from a slam dunk a hot button issue in any case it is unclear that chinese subsidies in general are the hot button issue that they once seemed to be for u s negotiators a review of statements and reports over the past year suggests that u s complaints about subsidies were mostly directed at the chinese government s support for high tech industries under the made in china 2025 initiative as the government has stepped back from promoting the plan the subsidy issue seems to have largely faded from view still u s policy statements continued to cite opposition to chinese subsidies as a top agenda item in the past year speaking in november at the asia pacific economic cooperation apec summit in papua new guinea u s vice president mike pence blasted china for unfair trade practices that included subsidies pence cited forced technology transfer intellectual property theft and industrial subsidies on an unprecedented scale usa today reported at the time a government white paper on trade frictions last september also made clear that china had come under pressure on the subsidy issue china s subsidy policy complies with wto rules and should not be attacked said a xinhua report on the white paper arguments but with signs that u s and china negotiators are closing in on a trade deal the years of controversy over subsidies may be left to another day we have not emphasized subsidies and when we do it s about lending said derek scissors an asia economist at the american enterprise institute in washington who has reportedly advised the administration of president donald trump on the negotiations in an email message scissors indicated that the rate cuts are unlikely to raise u s concerns this reads like another attempt to bolster business confidence and will barely be noticed by the u s team scissors said if that is the case china may be free to pursue a bad economic energy and environmental policy on its own
i first suggested the u s economy was headed toward a recession more than a year ago and now others are forecasting the same i give a business downturn starting this year a two thirds probability the recessionary indicators are numerous tighter monetary policy by the federal reserve that the central bank now worries it may have overdone the near inversion in the treasury yield curve the swoon in stocks at the end of last year weaker housing activity soft consumer spending the tiny 20 000 increase in february payrolls compared to the 223 000 monthly average gain last year then there are the effects of the deteriorating european economies and decelerating growth in china as well as president donald trump s ongoing trade war with that country there is of course a small chance of a soft landing such as in the mid 1990s at that time the fed ended its interest rate hiking cycle and cut the federal funds rate with no ensuing recession by my count the other 12 times the central bank restricted credit in the post world war ii era a recession resulted it s also possible that the current economic softening is temporary but a revival would bring more fed restraint policy makers want higher rates in order to have significant room to cut in the next recession and the current 2 25 percent to 2 50 percent range doesn t give them much leeway the fed also dislikes investors zeal for riskier assets from hedge funds to private equity and leveraged loans to say nothing of that rankest of rank speculations bitcoin with a resumption in economic growth a tight credit induced recession would be postponed until 2020 recession conjures up specters of 2007 2009 the most severe business downturn since the 1930s in which the s p 500 index plunged 57 percent from its peak to its trough the fed raised its target rate from 1 percent in june 2004 to 5 25 percent in june 2006 but the main event was the financial crisis spawned by the collapse in the vastly inflated subprime mortgage market similarly the central bank increased its policy rate from 4 75 percent in june 1999 to 6 5 percent in may 2000 still the mild 2001 recession that followed was principally driven by the collapse in the late 1990s dot com bubble that pushed the tech laden nasdaq composite index down by a whopping 78 percent the 1973 1975 recession the second deepest since the 1930s resulted from the collapse in the early 1970s inflation hedge buying of excess inventories that deflated the s p 500 by 48 2 percent the federal funds rate hike from 9 percent in february 1974 to 13 percent in july of that year was a minor contributor the remaining eight post world war ii recessions were not the result of major financial or economic excesses but just the normal late economic cycle business and investor overconfidence the average drop in the s p 500 was 21 2 percent at present i don t see any major economic or financial bubbles that are just begging to be pricked the only possibilities are excess debt among u s nonfinancial corporations and the heavy borrowing in dollars by emerging market economies in the face of a rising greenback housing never fully recovered from the subprime mortgage debacle the financial sector is still deleveraging in the wake of the financial crisis consumer debt remains substantial but well off its 2008 peak in relation to household income consequently the recession i foresee will probably be accompanied by about an average drop in stock prices the s p 500 fell 19 6 percent from oct 3 to dec 24 but the recovery since has almost eliminated that loss a normal recession related decline of 21 2 percent meeting the definition of a bear market from that oct 3 top would take it to 2 305 down about 18 percent from friday s close but not much below the christmas eve low of 2 351 a gary shilling is president of a gary shilling co a new jersey consultancy a registered investment advisor and author of the age of deleveraging investment strategies for a decade of slow growth and deflation some portfolios he manages invest in currencies and commodities
china is making major cuts in electricity rates to support business and its sagging economy raising questions about government subsidies and environmental concerns on march 9 china s central electric utility state grid corp announced a 10 percent reduction in average electricity charges for business users this year to relieve the burden on the real economy the official xinhua news agency said the break comes on top of a 10 6 percent rate cut for commercial users in 2018 that saved china s businesses 79 2 billion yuan u s 11 7 billion according to the report with industrial users included the assistance last year totaled 91 5 billion yuan u s 13 6 billion the state owned utility said while state controlled rates are subject to change the announcement appeared to be unusual in citing the economic benefit as the purpose without any reference to market conditions fuel prices or generating costs the moves posed a host of policy questions about regulation in the power sector pricing reform and the potential for anti competitive industrial subsidies the huge drop in electricity bills also highlighted the government s all out response to china s economic slowdown which has so far included tax cuts infrastructure spending and a surge in bank loans although the cost of the combined rate cuts for 2018 and 2019 appears to be substantial the announcement did not specify whether the state grid power producers or the government would pay for it according to the xinhua report the state grid topped the list of china s largest companies last year with revenue of 2 36 trillion yuan u s 351 7 billion suggesting that the utility could cover the cost but the company s total profit fell 14 3 percent from a year earlier dropping for the first time in five years an analysis by hong kong based ping an securities said the burden of the break the burden of last year s break fell mostly on grid companies although some provinces reduced on grid tariffs for coal fired generators said philip andrews speed a principal fellow at the national university of singapore s energy studies institute the plan this year calls for the coal fired power plants to pay for the rate reductions for business consumers since most or all of the provinces are expected to cut their on grid tariffs the coal fired generators are complaining now which is quite justified andrews speed said overcapacity of generation has drastically reduced their operating hours and is squeezing margins and now they are getting lower tariffs some for the second year running he said the government s decision to manipulate electricity rates for the purpose of economic stimulus is seen as a setback for energy reforms these measures completely undermine the development of the power market andrews speed said this has been announced at a time when the government is claiming to be liberalizing the power market by allowing generators to sell to large users at tariffs to be set by negotiation and allowing a proliferation of power retailers he said in his annual work report to the national people s congress on march 5 premier li keqiang suggested that the government would advance reforms and set lower electricity rates at the same time we will deepen electric power market reforms overhaul electricity price surcharges reduce the electricity usage cost for the manufacturing industry and reduce the average electricity price of general industrial and commercial industry by another 10 percent li said from an environmental standpoint large rate cuts are also likely to be counterproductive since cheaper power prices encourage energy consumption while the rate reductions are across the board they will likely provide the biggest benefit to the largest energy users and sources of emissions including makers of steel cement and building materials a general view of a construction site owned by state grid corporation of china the country s state owned electric utility monopoly in beijing oct 17 2016 credit afp competition concerns the double digit cuts will also come as a gift and effective subsidy to marginal state owned enterprises soes potentially raising competition concerns of trading partners american steelmakers and other manufacturers have long complained about the effects of chinese subsidies but whether the issue of power pricing will figure in the current u s china trade negotiations is open to question the issue of whether the rate cuts constitute a subsidy is complex said william reinsch a former commerce department official now a senior adviser at the center for strategic and international studies in washington the definition of subsidy in both u s law and wto world trade organization rules requires specificity reinsch said that is to be a subsidy there must be a specific benefit to somebody if the government lowers the rate for everybody that would not be a subsidy because it is not specific reinsch said there are other complications the laws would not support u s action against a subsidy unless a u s party was injured raising more questions about competition and the size of per unit costs the wto would want to know whether the rate cuts apply only to chinese companies or also to foreign companies manufacturing in china the question of whether the decrease qualifies as a subsidy also depends on whether the price of electricity has been lowered below a market rate which is hard to determine in china and so on taking all that into account the rate cuts might still be actionable which could trigger a countervailing duty reinsch said but the outcome seems far from a slam dunk a hot button issue in any case it is unclear that chinese subsidies in general are the hot button issue that they once seemed to be for u s negotiators a review of statements and reports over the past year suggests that u s complaints about subsidies were mostly directed at the chinese government s support for high tech industries under the made in china 2025 initiative as the government has stepped back from promoting the plan the subsidy issue seems to have largely faded from view still u s policy statements continued to cite opposition to chinese subsidies as a top agenda item in the past year speaking in november at the asia pacific economic cooperation apec summit in papua new guinea u s vice president mike pence blasted china for unfair trade practices that included subsidies pence cited forced technology transfer intellectual property theft and industrial subsidies on an unprecedented scale usa today reported at the time a government white paper on trade frictions last september also made clear that china had come under pressure on the subsidy issue china s subsidy policy complies with wto rules and should not be attacked said a xinhua report on the white paper arguments but with signs that u s and china negotiators are closing in on a trade deal the years of controversy over subsidies may be left to another day we have not emphasized subsidies and when we do it s about lending said derek scissors an asia economist at the american enterprise institute in washington who has reportedly advised the administration of president donald trump on the negotiations in an email message scissors indicated that the rate cuts are unlikely to raise u s concerns this reads like another attempt to bolster

when last may the omnibus agriculture appropriation bill for 1961 was on the floor of the house for final consideration a city congressman rose to say there are literally no farmers in my district our part of this 4 000 000 000 appropriation is about 100 per family the question in my mind is should i vote aye when my name is called on this bill the report would seem to indicate that we have been pouring money down a rathole here throughout the session on the preceding day when some two dozen members had joined in friendly debate there was no comment of this kind congressman jamie whitten of mississippi floor manager of the bill rose to answer is the gentleman asking a question yes thereupon mr whitten launched into the only general justification of the agriculture appropriation bill that had seemed called for in two days of bickering over small points may i say mr whitten began that a big part of this bill is commitments where we have contracts so we have to pay them our report points up the feeling which is very similar to that of the gentleman that we need to do something we are getting into more and more trouble and in spite of the cost the farmer s situation is getting worse we point that out in an effort as best we can to push forward some improvement but i do not think we would be doing the right thing not to pass this bill we would be violating contracts and we would be making bad matters worse the city congressman persisted may i ask one more question i notice that the personnel in the department of agriculture has jumped from 67 000 in 1952 to 86 000 today at the same time farm families have dropped around 700 000 and the farm population has dropped by three million would someone explain to me why we need more people in the department when we have a smaller number of farmers to work with to this mr whitten replied the gentleman will remember that we wrote about this in the report and pointed these facts out because we have some question about it too as this sitting of the house drew to a close after having produced that day more than thirty pages of small print triple column in the congressional record in addition to forty six pages the day before a delaware congressman rose to deliver the one other substantial speech in opposition mr chairman he began apologetically i presume that in some quarters a vote against this bill will be considered an act of legislative irresponsibility maybe so but for as long as the present politically inspired congressional deadlock that prevents the passage of constructive legislation in the price support field continues i shall feel constrained to vote against any and all agricultural appropriation bills the farm program that congress put together a generation ago in the dark days of the great depression and that subsequent congresses have been embroidering upon ever since has produced for us virtual harvests of insanity that we can neither sell nor give away one can search in vain he concluded without finding any specific suggestion for improving the situation worthy of grasping for as a drowning man might grasp for straws the bill was then passed without a record vote _____________ in the last seven years the support and subsidizing of agriculture has cost the people of the united states 26 billion with the passage of the present bill the schedule has been set for a total farm expenditure by the administration of 32 billion the billion dollar agricultural appropriation bills drift whole and untouched through months of subcommittee and committee hearings and successive debates in both houses of congress year after year and so great is their political momentum that they are rarely amended except to shift the billions around a bit inside each bill nearly every cent of the billions appropriated for agriculture has been legislated as well as expended to the accompaniment of expressions of distaste by ezra taft benson the conservative secretary of agriculture who will probably be remembered as the man who spent the most money most unwillingly in all the long history of the united states what forced his hand what made agriculture the third largest item in the national budget outranked only by defense and interest on the defense generated national debt and followed by the defense generated veterans administration partly the answer lies in the place that farmers have traditionally occupied in the american scheme of things in 1776 and 1787 nine tenths of all united states citizens were farmers certain of the founding fathers jefferson most prominently conceived of democracy as the way the people would forever govern themselves while toiling at agriculture to earn a living cultivators of the earth are the most valuable citizens they are the most vigorous the most independent the most virtuous and they are tied to their country and wedded to its liberty and interests by the most lasting bonds on another occasion jefferson noted that the corruption of morals in the mass of cultivators is a phenomenon of which no age has furnished an example this idea that farmers are the people was written into our federal and state constitutions and also into a great number of statutes over the next century and a half and to this very day rural voters have maintained a disproportionate grip on the government in practically all jurisdictions but the municipal the citizens of iowa for instance are now locked in struggle because farmers and rural people still control the state legislature although they compose less than a third of the state population through the use of this power farmers have been able to make the rest of the country pay for the fact that farm numbers are falling and the farm population shrinking in the decade before the first world war one american in three was a farmer or a member of a farm family and practically everybody had a relative who lived on the land agriculture was then at a peak of prosperity the present price support laws in fact stand substantially as written by political agrarians of twenty five years ago when the price of basic farm commodities was fixed at a guaranteed percentage of parity a concept derived from the relation between farm and non farm prices in the years 1910 1914 inclusive this period had been american agriculture s most prosperous to date and it provided a solid gold statistical yardstick with which to measure farm costs prices income and other variables nevertheless during this very era farm population kept declining and it declined even through the flash boom of the first world war continuing downward in the years that followed it rose slightly in the depths of the great depression then subsided again within the next two years it has been slipping ever since by 1954 farmers had dwindled to one eighth of the population according to the special farm census of that year it has been estimated that when the figures for this year s decennial census are tabulated they will show that farm population has shrunk to about 17 million out of a total of 180 million people or 9 5 per cent of the population the latest figures simply mark a continuation of a century long trend whose causes are deeply imbedded in our social structure as colin clark puts it in the conditions of economic progress careful generalization of the available facts indicates that the most important concomitant of economic progress is the movement of the working population from agriculture to manufacture and then from manufacture to commerce and services one of the products of economic advance is the expansion of opportunities for ill paid ill housed ill fed country people to get better jobs in towns and cities to country politicians this means lost votes to country retailers and farm supply dealers lost trade and to the farmers who have the skills and capital to stay put an opportunity given our political habits to vote themselves considerable public support as farm numbers have fallen agriculture has grown increasingly monetized it takes more and more money to grow a crop the farmer today has to spend seventy cents on supplies and labor before he can make a dollar as a result the economic ties between commercial farmers and local non farm businesses and businessmen have become closer at the same time agriculture has also become increasingly consolidated a family type farm is now much larger than it used to be the old 160 acre norm is obsolete in the corn belt for example the general farm if it is to yield optimum returns for the family labor invested in it must approach 300 acres in size this process of consolidation which has kept farm real estate values rising at an average rate of 6 per cent yearly in the past decade and as much as 12 to 14 per cent in some areas is still continuing though it has slowed down in the past quarter during and immediately after the second world war the consolidating process was facilitated by record profits now it is fostered by technology and accelerated by competition improved models or new kinds of farm equipment and implements fertilizers and weed killing bug killing and growth promoting chemicals hybrid varieties or other improved strains of seed scientifically compounded feeding supplements that contain antibiotics minerals and vitamins portable irrigation systems these and many other innovations including such important factors as the new managerial technology of expanding output to lower unit costs on a given acreage and labor base have enabled the more efficient commercial farmers and full time farm workers to produce sufficient food and fiber for 100 and even more consumers per man _____________ as an industry agriculture is now in a very strong position its total assets are up 300 per cent above 1940 the value of farm land has increased by 400 per cent the average worth of a commercial farm is 135 000 and the average net income of commercial farm operators from farming is 7 200 per annum as for that traditional indicator of trouble the foreclosure rate it was 16 per 10 000 farms last year at the same time the comparable bankruptcy rate for all non farm businesses was 52 or three and a half times higher the current economic report of the president sums it all up succinctly production per man hour on farms in 1958 was more than three times the 1930 1939 average in the last ten years this rise in efficiency was about 80 per cent a growth rate of 6 per cent a year or three times the increase in american industrial output per man hour in the same period with the increasing capitalization of farm operations paid inputs expanded by two thirds and unpaid inputs such as homegrown seed and fodder or feedstuffs for draft animals and livestock declined by one third of the average in 1930 1939 one of the results of the rapid commercialization of agriculture has been to make farmers newly sensitive to the costs of goods and services they buy in relation to the prices their own commodities sell for in the markets nothing more clearly illustrates the new condition than the fact that the risks of the market have become more serious to the commercial farmer than the risks of the weather he watches price trends more anxiously than the barometer the effect of this can be read between the lines of the current agriculture appropriations bill the amount directly budgeted by congressman whitten s subcommittee on agricultural appropriations for price insurance stabilization was 3 000 000 000 and the line budget item for federal crop insurance was 6 300 000 that is about one five thousandth part of the former yet federal money is still spent on agriculture as if the industry were seriously ailing last year the total net farm income of all farmers from farm operations was 11 billion at the same time the federal expenditure on agriculture was about 6 billion which means that it cost the people of the united states more than 55 cents to enable our farmers to earn a dollar more since in this computation no allowance has been made for state expenditures in behalf of farming the mayors of our big cities complain annually at their national conference and did this year again that farmer dominated legislatures divert disproportionate shares of state tax funds farm leaders concede that all this is true the arithmetic is clear beyond any question their response generally is to point out that farm incomes per capita are somewhat less than half of the national income per capita i e city folks earn twice as much so they ought not to complain _____________ among the statistics of agriculture that particular one the average farmer income is beyond doubt the most misleading averages which lump all farmers together the one mule cotton and tobacco croppers of the southeast the 300 acre corn and hog farmers of the midwest the wheat men of the great plains holding upward of 2 500 acres and the horn of plenty operators in the irrigated lands of texas and california are worse than useless such figures are in fact fraudulent about 85 per cent by value of all the marketed crops of food and fiber produced in the united states are grown on just about one third about 1 3 million of our farms the relatively small number of prosperous commercial farmers not the more numerous needy get the lion s share of public support nobody likes to talk about it outside the seminars on rural sociology but we have a large farm population of older people and of insufficiently endowed under educated poorly capitalized and generally unequipped and under implemented farmers clinging to the scratch lands of america the department of agriculture has only just begun to tell them what else to do where else to go about a million dollars of federal money a mere one six thousandth of the total farm budget was devoted to that purpose last year this year the administration asked that the allocation for this purpose be tripled to one two thousandth congressman whitten saw fit to grant a sum of one four thousandth of the total _____________ the benefits of price stabilization whether in the form of commodity loans or marketing orders relate directly to the number of bushels tons bales or pounds a farmer grows and so are most helpful to the large commercial farmers federal agricultural conservation program money which runs to about a quarter of a billion dollars annually is given to farmers for spending on lime and fertilizer chiefly and benefits here are similarly related to the amount of acreage a farmer brings to the program and what he can do with the land after it has been needled with nutrients at the public cost in the same way it is the commercial farmer who stands to benefit most by agricultural research and education market reporting and trend forecasting services the grading and food inspection services the bias in favor of business farming is repeated in all fifty of the state departments of agriculture these departments are run by professional agronomists for the benefit of commercial farmers farmers who grow less than commercial quantities of produce have in the like proportion less need for the services of these agencies or to put it another way it s an open secret in farm circles that the smaller the farm generally speaking the more poorly it is managed the operator does not have the means to make use of good advice even if offered economically if not morally this fact has appeared to justify a comparative neglect of the small farmer the only substantial usda program with a built in bias favoring the low income or marginal farmer is the soil bank or conservation reserve this device for taking surplus land out of production has been in operation since 1956 and at the present time about 5 per cent of u s cropland is under conservation reserve contracts which stipulate that it is to lie fallow hence the word conservation in the title of the program from ancient times until the development of soil science fallowing was thought to be the only method or more recently the essential method for fertilizing land under cultivation now we know that the notion is utter hokum researchers have shown that the chinese for instance cropped their lands continuously for thousands of years without ever giving their fertile soils any rest and one can travel through the length and breadth of rural america without ever finding except in the great plains area the semi arid overworked wheat bowl of the continental united states any farmers who practice biennial or triennial fallowing as once done since conservation reserve contracts are long term contracts the conservation actually means the direct opposite of what it signifies in the acp program described above under such contracts the farmer is paid to leave land uncultivated but to plant grass or trees on it so that the rains won t wash the naked soil away the average payment for planting such protective cover in the first year is about 12 per acre per year for three to ten years commercial farmers have been putting their poorer acres into this reserve while lavishing extra care on their better lands the consequence has been little reduction in many areas in the amount of crops produced for the surplus stockpile the present administration in a feeble opposition to this mad business has offered special incentives for whole farm placements in the reserve this creditable action does amount to concentrating the benefits of the program on the low income farm population today about two thirds of all the cropland in the reserve consists of whole farm units whose owners have resigned from agriculture with a pension so to speak but can continue to live on the place commute to a job in town use the permanent pasture and orchard land and maintain a home garden recent plans to double the acreage impounded by this operation and to extend it through the next decade have withered because of the opposition of small town feed fertilizer implement and hardware dealers the commercial farmer and small town businessman often operate as a political team they work hand in glove to uphold their mutual interests against the overwhelming majority of the people who live in the larger towns and cities under the sacred symbols of the family farm and the small enterprise this team has developed and maintained over the past twenty five years a system of subsidies bounties licensed monopolies and other privileges without parallel in proportion to their incomes in the long history of economic intervention in the united states _____________ the conviction of righteousness which pervades the farm belt when matters of current income and government assistance are discussed must be examined to be believed fortunately a splendid example is at hand several months ago the saturday evening post published an article entitled the farmer s side of the case it was an impressively smooth job of writing and it included a sufficient amount of data to derive by cross reference and a sparing use of standard statistics the actual value of the farm enterprise offered as a test case the story begins as so many farm narratives do with a statement of faith my husband carl and i firmly believe that our farm a large beautiful family type farm makes a substantial contribution to the economy and health of our country it ends as such narratives commonly do with a statement of despair we hang on knowing that for farmers everywhere there will be more debts a gradual loss of their equity in their land and a widespread fear that some day unless something is done the scales will tip too far and family farms such as ours will be a thing of the past 1 then follow the facts the conger dairy farm in southeastern kansas produces a thousand quarts of milk daily from a herd of 200 registered holstein cows who graze on its 720 acres of land for this average daily milk production the congers receive yearly 29 000 they also grow 61 acres of wheat under a license or allotment for full price support which boosts their gross income to at least 32 000 the costing of their assets is a fairly simple matter holsteins of the quality described are worth 600 each conservatively thus the value of the herd is 120 000 farmland averages nationally 111 per acre since this is an unusually well run farm the land is easily worth 125 an acre or 90 000 buildings house barns silo and milking parlor a weird arrangement of machinery through which cows pass supplying their own motive power to be washed tested stripped of their milk and ejected are estimated at 50 000 finally the implements and other equipment for a farm of this size the vehicles tractor and so on are valued at 20 000 the whole adds up to 280 000 before indebtedness farm indebtedness is about 11 per cent of total farm assets today since mrs conger supplies no data except to say that the farm was 7 000 in the red for operating expenses two years ago we must impute the average ratio of debt or about 30 000 to this particular farm the conger farm is probably worth a clear quarter of a million dollars when mr conger bought the place in 1939 he made the down payment out of his savings as a county agent and such agents used to be paid on the same scale as country school teachers the remainder of the quarter million apparently came out of the earnings of the enterprise plus inventory appreciation over the twenty years from that time to the present after deductions to cover all family expenses most of this farm growth occurred in the war and postwar years when the korean war ended a full decade of record breaking profits for agriculture ended too and an era of ordinary earnings began since 1952 our farm has made little if any profit in good years and in bad years such as 1955 we have lost as much as 4 058 other commercial farms in the area averaged only 4 834 in wages for their operators over the past six years one of the clues to this odd situation is that mrs conger and her friends do their bookkeeping thus according to her own account operating expenses are deducted from gross receipts then a fair investment return of 6 per cent on net working capital and 4 per cent on net fixed capital is deducted and the value of any unpaid labor such as mine is subtracted commercial farmers who keep books in this way can live through years of adversity claiming that they make no profits and little or no pay while their families continue to live as usual nor must they necessarily go into debt returns on fixed and working capital may be quite substantial some commercial farmers can live fairly well on these deducts alone and since they pay their dependents too they may have a family income that is really handsome even while they themselves work for nothing what then is the specific trouble with commercial farming does it really need 55 cents of federal expenditure for every dollar earned as the conger example shows it all depends on how you define need that particular farm family has been in business only twenty years the children have grown up and are earning cash wages or salaries in town the congers could sell out if they chose for a quarter of a million dollars conservatively invested this would yield a depression proof income of 14 000 yearly thus in two thirds of the time it takes salaried persons employed by government or industry to accumulate a retirement fund the congers have arrived and they can leave a substantial estate to each of their children besides _____________ in sum we see here the agricultural problem how such decent average hard working right thinking country people as farmers like the congers present themselves can claim they must be kept in business with public assistance when they could comfortably retire or if they must work could turn to some other form of enterprise that normally and directly pays profits as well as wages to the proprietors but instead they have chosen to farm and complain some sections of the farm economy especially wheat have been so corrupted by subsidies that they would collapse if supports were withdrawn whole states in the great plains area both the dakotas montana nebraska kansas are kept afloat in the expectation of an uninterrupted flow of u s treasury paper ccc checks conservation payments soil bank remittances and so on how much the u s department of agriculture will have to lend to farmers in any one year is unpredictable the price support laws specify that all basic crops grown on licensed or allotted acreage shall be acceptable as security or collateral for federal loans at fixed valuations per bushel or per pound how much farmers may offer and how much the department must have on hand to pay out to them in loans depends on unpredictable weather and market conditions an unusually good harvest as in 1958 or large carry over stocks from previous years could depress the market so seriously that unanticipated quantities of qualified crops are offered for federal loans and abandoned in the government s possession this has resulted repeatedly in the diminution of the department s lending capacity in such cases the department is authorized to borrow directly from the treasury and the capital impairment is made up in the next appropriation bill this is a unique privilege possessed by no other department of the federal government nor in all probability by any of the state municipal or county governments or agencies throughout the united states agriculture and its clients enjoy the luxury of an open ended budget at the present time the total of direct usda loans to farmers or to agencies performing services for farmers exclusive of loans guaranteed by the department is 17 billion the department s interest charges are invariably lower than those of any other lender and the collateral it will accept is often of dubious value to take one instance the commodity credit corporation the price support subsidiary of the department has a lending authority of 14 5 billion and an inventory of forfeited collateral for which 7 2 billion was paid the carrying charges interest transportation and storage costs only on this and 2 billion of additional price support loans not yet in default are 1 25 billion annually or 3 5 million every day and in the last half of this year farmers will dump another billion dollars worth of surplus crops on the government does all this make sense when the national welfare requires that we spend all we can spare on so many other important needs _____________ 1 the claim that the family farm is dying out and farm corporations are taking over is a fraud according to the most thorough study of this question the usda report on family farms in a changing economy agriculture information bulletin 171 1957 since 1940 there is evidence that operators of family farms have made a slight gain over those of large scale farms in controlling land resources and market sales there are just as many family farms now proportionately as there were thirty years ago
june crude oil futures traded above 70 a barrel last friday before retreating to close at 68 44 part of the driving force behind the rise to 70 was a report issued by goldman sachs gs nyse that it was revising its oil price forecast for the end of 2009 to 85 a barrel from its prior 65 forecast briefly the goldman sachs higher price predictions are based on its belief that the world has entered into a four part bull market for crude oil they view the current rise to 65 as reflecting the normalization of pricing dislocations caused by the credit crisis and its impact on oil demand they believe that most of the yearly oil demand decline anticipated has already occurred and that demand is stabilizing and should head higher in the future as the recession ends and economic growth resumes their second phase is that opec s production cuts coupled with stable and slowly rising oil demand will support higher prices as inventories contract and is the principle reason for their 2009 year end price forecast hike the third bull phase will see oil prices rising to 90 from the prior estimate of 70 a barrel in order to drive the resumption of investment in developing new oil resources their final phase will take oil prices to 95 a barrel by the end of 2010 as energy scarcity becomes a greater consideration longer term goldman sachs suggests that oil demand in developed economies will need to shrink in order to support increasing consumption in the bric brazil russia india and china nations this is an interesting point because it suggests that oil demand in america europe and japan will be less important for the globe s petroleum industry in the future than the developing economies that view was outlined in a recent report issued by the mckinsey institute the report suggests according to frank holmes of u s global investors china will account for one third of the world s energy demand growth in the 2010 2020 period mckinsey employing what it believes are conservative global gross domestic product gdp growth estimates projects that china s industrial sector will necessitate an incremental 28 quadrillion british thermal units qbtus and its residential sector will need an additional 11 6 qbtus one qbtu is equal to 172 million barrels of oil in 2006 according to the international energy agency iea china consumed 75 qbtus and over the next decade its consumption will rise by 52 4 qbtus or nearly 70 for the world energy demand should rise by roughly 34 or 158 5 qbtus compared to 2006 s estimated consumption of 472 qbtus within the world forecast the united states should see a six qbtus increase on 100 qbtus of energy consumption in 2006 of major energy consumers japan will experience only a 0 4 qbtu increase in the next decade less than a 2 increase as its steel 0 1 qbtu and light duty vehicle 0 5 qbtu businesses actually experience negative energy demand mckinsey does say that improved energy efficiency could alter its forecast of demand growth and therefore its projections for specific country and industry energy demand estimates these forecasts point out the challenge confronting executives in the petroleum industry will the economic recovery that may or may not be underway but will be at some point in the near future be strong or weak possibly the recovery will be somewhere in between in another article in this musings we touch on the issue of the state of americans love affair with the automobile will we continue to build and buy new cars at the historic rates of the past or will we need to settle for a significantly lower target what types of new housing will americans buy slightly down sized mcmansions or the modest homes of the 1950s and 1960s the answers to these questions will determine how america s energy demand will grow and what fuels will be favored the questions posed above are important and relate primarily to the united states but they also impact the economic future of the rest of the world s developed economies especially those countries of europe and japan with aging populations demographics are the engine of economic and energy demand that are often overlooked by forecasters just how will china s economy evolve as it confronts a rapidly aging population with few younger workers to support them due to the decades long government policy mandating one child families a bigger question is how will american consumers evolve as the credit crisis and economic recession end we can envision a future american economy that more resembles the 1950s than the 1960s or 1990s it is possibly that just as the 1950s set the stage for a robust 1960s which produced the longest post war economic expansion until the 1990s a decade long consumer retrenchment could set the stage for a robust economic era beginning in 2020 on what basis might we assume this scenario if we consider the historical pattern of u s government debt as a percentage of gross domestic product gdp since 1929 to 2010 the post world war ii period provides an interesting template for the future during that period the older population felt lucky to be alive having survived the 1930s and 1940s and settled in to a time of saving preservation of capital and lowered expectations as consumers during the eisenhower years real progress was made in reducing the high relative public debt levels of the war years and in planting the seeds for a new kind of consumption based economy transistor radios black and white and color televisions new cars and new homes were all part of this new consumption economy but as the shift in the composition of spending was underway the kennedy administration relaxed tax codes to stimulate the economy s growth which set off a 106 month trough to peak expansion lasting from february 1961 to december 1969 as the economy expanded the composition of private public sector debt was rebalanced and the weighting of gdp was altered with consumers ultimately accounting for 70 of domestic growth and 20 of international growth today we are undertaking another significant structural change in which public sector debt will account for a greater share of total debt this shift has meant that it takes more debt to generate incremental dollars of u s national income in fact recently the ratio was up to 5 of new debt needed for 1 of incremental national income the result of this shift is that the ratio of gross national debt to gdp will rise to 82 5 in 2010 from 55 about 20 years earlier only japan 177 and italy 117 today have higher debt burdens at the end of 2008 the average u s household debt to income ratio rose above 1 6 the eurozone is about half that ratio aggregate u s public corporate and consumer debt stood at 57 trillion or four times net income and is rising largely driven by public debt current income tax revenues of 2 6 trillion won t support an additional 1 84 trillion in federal debt u s public debt held by non resident foreigners is about 115 of gdp the net result of all this is that consumer spending had to drop and the savings rate had to rise the issues are to what level over what time period and what will the impact be on consumption most likely we will have a japanese style deleveraging in which the debtto income ratio is pushed down to 100 over the next 10 years in a typical debt dynamics model if we assume that the nominal interest rate on existing debt is 7 the future growth rate of nominal disposable income in 5 80 of savings generated are used to pay down debt then the household savings rate would need to rise from 4 to 10 by 2018 the impact of that savings increase would be to cut the consumption growth rate by three quarters of one percent that calculation is based on a normal savings rate model but if the calculation is off a declining savings rate such as experienced in the implication of this model for future u s economic growth is considerably less consumer spending recent years the reduction in the consumption growth rate would be greater real consumption growth rates remain negative and even in the last half of 2006 and in 2007 growth was in the 2 3 range that rate would fall with a higher personal savings rate the implication of this model for future u s economic growth is considerably less consumer spending that will mean fewer cars houses appliances vacations computers and other electronic gadgets along with other things consumed in the u s it also means that there will be a negative impact on manufacturing in many developing economies and reduced world trade many industries being forced to retrench now may face years of highly competitive commercial markets for consumers as the rolling stones put it you can t always get what you want inventories will be kept low meaning delivery times for goods will expand supplies of products will be limited meaning re orders may be non existent operating margins will be sustained by managing inventories deflationary price discovery and distribution will dominate the economic landscape this environment we are describing may resemble the post korean war period when interest rates were low large drops in gdp occurred as the economy struggled to shift from its war driven to a consumer driven mode inflation was generally low during this period except for some brief spikes due to demand supply shocks the stock market may trade in a range for many years as occurred in that period and during the 1970s but as we near the end of the static period the market could rise dramatically the risk to this scenario is that the war underway between the public and private sectors results in the federal government usurping larger and larger segments of the economy and turning the u s into a quasi planned economy another possible outcome from this public private debt struggle is that the government decides to repudiate certain debt while this would appear to be a low probability given the government s control over the money supply there were several periods when american states repudiated their debt the first occurred in the 1840s following the panics of 1837 and 1839 largely related to the inflationary boom caused by the second bank of the united states as the deflationary period of the 1840s unfolded nine of the 28 states repudiated some or all of their liabilities the next wave of repudiation happened in the south after its occupation by the north following the civil war eight southern states under democratic administrations repudiated their debt during the 1870s and 1880s the final american debt repudiation occurred after the spanish american war the u s repudiated the debt of cuba after conquering the island as we claimed the debt was incurred by the spanish government without the consent of the cubans and was used to help finance oppression and therefore wasn t legitimate from the economic recovery scenario we have laid out we can begin to build a model of what energy demand growth should look like and the implications for the petroleum industry we will tackle that in our next issue of musings
markets almost never go up in a straight line but for basically all of 2017 boeing nyse ba did just that is the tragic crash of the ethiopian 737 max 8 a trigger to establish a short position no but in my opinion weâ re getting closer to that point there have been over 130 crashes of boeing 737s since 1970 of 7 312 737s delivered in boeingâ s history none of these crashes brought the company down for anything beyond short term trading but even though this horrible event may not be the trigger i believe that the trigger is coming by the end of this year here i will explain why despite being a long established blue chip dow stock boeing is really a momentum stock fraught with considerable risk not a passive income stable growth play unless youâ re holding it for decades it has been this way since the 1960â s 1963 1967 saw the stock rally 550 with a 50 retracement in between then a catastrophic 7 year bear market took hold that saw 90 of that value wiped out just like the dow itself in the great depression then a crazy 1 700 rally from 1974 to 1980 whose principal year was 1978 sort of like the current rally highlighted by 2017â s 133 run another boeing bear struck in 1980 for the next two years taking out 66 of the previous bull run this extreme pattern would repeat itself 5 more times through the 2008 financial crisis and we are currently somewhere in the 6 th round of this turbulent airplane ride permabulls will say there will be no retracement this time but history begs to differ if boeing shares have been acting this way since the 1960â s itâ s more likely than not that the pattern will repeat especially considering that the parabolic run since 2017 is quite familiar blow off toppish action for this particular stock on a long term chart that includes the recent run every other bull run is masked to insignificance by comparison but donâ t let the zoom out mislead you this last one is quite tame on a logarithmic scale compared to the ones we saw in the 60â s and 70â s given the volatility i am not looking for a specific price target in order to establish shorts on boeing but rather two specific developments these are an oil spike and significantly higher interest rates both of which i am expecting over the next year or two in order to understand why here are some numbers that can help put boeingâ s business in context it is extremely dependent on the airline industry consider commercial aircraft accounts for 60 of its revenues which topped the incredible milestone of 100 billion last year that alone doesnâ t sound so lopsided 65 of its operating profit comes from the commercial aircraft segment ok still somewhat balanced however a whopping 90 of the companyâ s total growth in operating profit since 2017 comes from commercial airplanes since 2016 itâ s even more lopsided with 95 of total growth in operating profit coming from commercial airplanes alone the chart below taken from its 10 k shows the raw data source boeing 10 k 2018 page 20 but amazingly it gets even more lopsided than that if we look at aircraft deliveries since 2016 we can see how heavily reliant boeing is on the 737 the model that crashed over the weekend in ethiopia source boeing 10 k 2018 page 26 as the table shows also taken from boeingâ s 10 k 72 of deliveries last year were for the 737 this is higher than last yearâ s 69 share which was higher than 2016â s 65 share boeing is becoming more and more reliant on a single airplane model of one segment of the company the only other airplane of significance is the 787 accounting for another 18 of deliveries in 2018 so we can begin to understand why the stock tanked as much as 13 5 on news of the crash of a 737 boeing is somewhat a momentum stock rather than a defensive capital preservation play and it basically all comes down to the 737 so at bottom the health of boeing depends on the health of the airline industry and its appetite for 737s this may seem like an obvious point but now we can see how acute the point actually is whenever the global economy enters recession boeing plummets precipitously during the last financial crisis boeing was down 73 peak to trough and this was far from the worst bear market that boeing has ever had economic considerations it has long been my opinion that the next downturn will be inflationary not deflationary it will be stagflation and i have written about my reasoning for this in the past for confirmation of this i am looking for much higher energy prices together with rising interest rates the trigger for much higher oil prices is actually rather straightforward and that is the restriction of sulfur concentrations in maritime fuel to 0 5 from the current 3 5 starting january 1 2020 oilprice reported on this last year and the situation has not changed one economist believes that the shock could push low sulfur oil or light sweet crude to 200 a barrel his basic reasoning is that maritime shipping accounts for 5 of oil demand and itâ s almost all cheaper high sulfur moving that all to low sulfur would be a massive overnight shift and would require a significant price increase to ration land based consumption whether oil gets to 200 or to 120 on the regulation is beside the point weâ re now below 60 doubling by january will be a shock to global energy prices especially at a time when opec is cutting production higher oil prices means higher jet fuel prices which means worse finances for airlines they wonâ t be able to keep the order pace for 737s which depends on a booming airline industry not just in the us but globally this accompanied with a global recession which a recent business insider survey of economists says that 50 believe will happen by 2020 me included is a 1 2 punch that could trigger then next medium term boeing bear a recession and higher interest rates could put the clamps on defense spending finally which is boeingâ s second biggest segment as card carrying member of the military industrial complex the conditions arenâ t ripe yet but they could be by early summer especially if boeing hits new highs by may or june i generally track the dollar supply growth rate in the banking system to time short positions and update periodically on where we are with that rate if that rate gets very low this summer when it is seasonally timed to do so boeing will be one of my main shorting targets why boeing could quickly recover from this crisis an argument can be made that the ongoing boeing 737 max crisis could destabilize the company and its stock price before any economic crisis hits the united states this is certainly possible and there is no way to know for certain if boeing will recover quickly as it has from past crashes this is a grounding of an entire fleet and not just an isolated crash that does make the situation a more serious but let s look at the total numbers according to a boeing statement on the grounding order from the faa there are 371 737 max airplanes currently in service globally there are 4 636 737 max models still undelivered so the fact that this grounding is taking place now rather than after thousands have already been delivered is very good news for boeing it is still possible to contain this problem car companies recover from recalls and i believe boeing will recover from a recall of 371 airplanes back in february 2015 128 737s were grounded for a few days for maintenance issues in 2013 the entire fleet of 787 dreamliners was grounded from january to july because batteries were causing fires boeing eventually fixed the problem neither of these issues caused the stock to fall in any significant way this grounding is obviously much more serious in scope and ramification but it is not completely without precedent whatever the problem is with the 737 max it will eventually be fixed yes boeing will lose a lot of money but it won t be a sustained loss into the future and investors should be cool headed enough to realize this and refrain from panic selling in the near term there will be some panic selling for sure but there are also plenty of potential buyers who understand that the 737 max issue will be resolved so they are likely to buy on any strong dips limiting the current decline boeing has very little debt so there is nothing close to a solvency problem its balance sheet is healthy thanks to its booming business so it can afford a hit without any strategic or certainly any existential issues on the slim chance that the problem is not fixable and the entire fleet has to be scrapped or the problems are so deep that the costs to fix the problem are enormous both possibilities i see as extremely unlikely then yes boeing could end up in a severe crisis from which it might not be able to recover any time soon those who want to protect themselves against this possibility could choose to short now with contracts out to 2020 or 2021 when i believe wider economic issues will catch up anyway but be prepared for a draw down in short positions if the issues with the 737 are fixed before any credit crisis ensues and the stock jumps to new highs

february according to the conference board which conducts a monthly assessment of consumers short term outlook on income business and labor market conditions the boomerang around this closely watched measure of consumer perceptions reflects a postrecession mind set one that is easily spooked by instability housing values and the stock market have recovered but vast swaths of americans haven t made up lost ground during the past decade consumers may be waiting for the other shoe to drop there s a general sense in the market that a recession has to be around the corner but i don t necessarily think that s so said analyst ken perkins founder of the research firm retail metrics the labor market has been strong the consumer has a little more in their pocket gas prices are low the underpinnings for spending should be good the overhang perkins said is massive student debt among younger consumers that is delaying purchases of homes and other big items retailers rely on younger generations to power sales as they launch careers set up their own homes and start families you ve got a lot of young consumers who would love to buy a car buy a house perkins said but there s this massive student debt that s really worrisome there are signs that people are having trouble paying their bills economists saw a red flag in a february report that found a record 7 million americans

china is making major cuts in electricity rates to support business and its sagging economy raising questions about government subsidies and environmental concerns on march 9 china s central electric utility state grid corp announced a 10 percent reduction in average electricity charges for business users this year to relieve the burden on the real economy the official xinhua news agency said the break comes on top of a 10 6 percent rate cut for commercial users in 2018 that saved china s businesses 79 2 billion yuan u s 11 7 billion according to the report with industrial users included the assistance last year totaled 91 5 billion yuan u s 13 6 billion the state owned utility said while state controlled rates are subject to change the announcement appeared to be unusual in citing the economic benefit as the purpose without any reference to market conditions fuel prices or generating costs the moves posed a host of policy questions about regulation in the power sector pricing reform and the potential for anti competitive industrial subsidies the huge drop in electricity bills also highlighted the government s all out response to china s economic slowdown which has so far included tax cuts infrastructure spending and a surge in bank loans although the cost of the combined rate cuts for 2018 and 2019 appears to be substantial the announcement did not specify whether the state grid power producers or the government would pay for it according to the xinhua report the state grid topped the list of china s largest companies last year with revenue of 2 36 trillion yuan u s 351 7 billion suggesting that the utility could cover the cost but the company s total profit fell 14 3 percent from a year earlier dropping for the first time in five years an analysis by hong kong based ping an securities said the burden of the break the burden of last year s break fell mostly on grid companies although some provinces reduced on grid tariffs for coal fired generators said philip andrews speed a principal fellow at the national university of singapore s energy studies institute the plan this year calls for the coal fired power plants to pay for the rate reductions for business consumers since most or all of the provinces are expected to cut their on grid tariffs the coal fired generators are complaining now which is quite justified andrews speed said overcapacity of generation has drastically reduced their operating hours and is squeezing margins and now they are getting lower tariffs some for the second year running he said the government s decision to manipulate electricity rates for the purpose of economic stimulus is seen as a setback for energy reforms these measures completely undermine the development of the power market andrews speed said this has been announced at a time when the government is claiming to be liberalizing the power market by allowing generators to sell to large users at tariffs to be set by negotiation and allowing a proliferation of power retailers he said in his annual work report to the national people s congress on march 5 premier li keqiang suggested that the government would advance reforms and set lower electricity rates at the same time we will deepen electric power market reforms overhaul electricity price surcharges reduce the electricity usage cost for the manufacturing industry and reduce the average electricity price of general industrial and commercial industry by another 10 percent li said from an environmental standpoint large rate cuts are also likely to be counterproductive since cheaper power prices encourage energy consumption while the rate reductions are across the board they will likely provide the biggest benefit to the largest energy users and sources of emissions including makers of steel cement and building materials a general view of a construction site owned by state grid corporation of china the country s state owned electric utility monopoly in beijing oct 17 2016 credit afp competition concerns the double digit cuts will also come as a gift and effective subsidy to marginal state owned enterprises soes potentially raising competition concerns of trading partners american steelmakers and other manufacturers have long complained about the effects of chinese subsidies but whether the issue of power pricing will figure in the current u s china trade negotiations is open to question the issue of whether the rate cuts constitute a subsidy is complex said william reinsch a former commerce department official now a senior adviser at the center for strategic and international studies in washington the definition of subsidy in both u s law and wto world trade organization rules requires specificity reinsch said that is to be a subsidy there must be a specific benefit to somebody if the government lowers the rate for everybody that would not be a subsidy because it is not specific reinsch said there are other complications the laws would not support u s action against a subsidy unless a u s party was injured raising more questions about competition and the size of per unit costs the wto would want to know whether the rate cuts apply only to chinese companies or also to foreign companies manufacturing in china the question of whether the decrease qualifies as a subsidy also depends on whether the price of electricity has been lowered below a market rate which is hard to determine in china and so on taking all that into account the rate cuts might still be actionable which could trigger a countervailing duty reinsch said but the outcome seems far from a slam dunk a hot button issue in any case it is unclear that chinese subsidies in general are the hot button issue that they once seemed to be for u s negotiators a review of statements and reports over the past year suggests that u s complaints about subsidies were mostly directed at the chinese government s support for high tech industries under the made in china 2025 initiative as the government has stepped back from promoting the plan the subsidy issue seems to have largely faded from view still u s policy statements continued to cite opposition to chinese subsidies as a top agenda item in the past year speaking in november at the asia pacific economic cooperation apec summit in papua new guinea u s vice president mike pence blasted china for unfair trade practices that included subsidies pence cited forced technology transfer intellectual property theft and industrial subsidies on an unprecedented scale usa today reported at the time a government white paper on trade frictions last september also made clear that china had come under pressure on the subsidy issue china s subsidy policy complies with wto rules and should not be attacked said a xinhua report on the white paper arguments but with signs that u s and china negotiators are closing in on a trade deal the years of controversy over subsidies may be left to another day we have not emphasized subsidies and when we do it s about lending said derek scissors an asia economist at the american enterprise institute in washington who has reportedly advised the administration of president donald trump on the negotiations in an email message scissors indicated that the rate cuts are unlikely to raise u s concerns this reads like another attempt to bolster business confidence and will barely be noticed by the u s team scissors said if that is the case china may be free to pursue a bad economic energy and environmental policy on its own copyright 1998

china is making major cuts in electricity rates to support business and its sagging economy raising questions about government subsidies and environmental concerns on march 9 china s central electric utility state grid corp announced a 10 percent reduction in average electricity charges for business users this year to relieve the burden on the real economy the official xinhua news agency said the break comes on top of a 10 6 percent rate cut for commercial users in 2018 that saved china s businesses 79 2 billion yuan u s 11 7 billion according to the report with industrial users included the assistance last year totaled 91 5 billion yuan u s 13 6 billion the state owned utility said while state controlled rates are subject to change the announcement appeared to be unusual in citing the economic benefit as the purpose without any reference to market conditions fuel prices or generating costs the moves posed a host of policy questions about regulation in the power sector pricing reform and the potential for anti competitive industrial subsidies the huge drop in electricity bills also highlighted the government s all out response to china s economic slowdown which has so far included tax cuts infrastructure spending and a surge in bank loans although the cost of the combined rate cuts for 2018 and 2019 appears to be substantial the announcement did not specify whether the state grid power producers or the government would pay for it according to the xinhua report the state grid topped the list of china s largest companies last year with revenue of 2 36 trillion yuan u s 351 7 billion suggesting that the utility could cover the cost but the company s total profit fell 14 3 percent from a year earlier dropping for the first time in five years an analysis by hong kong based ping an securities said the burden of the break the burden of last year s break fell mostly on grid companies although some provinces reduced on grid tariffs for coal fired generators said philip andrews speed a principal fellow at the national university of singapore s energy studies institute the plan this year calls for the coal fired power plants to pay for the rate reductions for business consumers since most or all of the provinces are expected to cut their on grid tariffs the coal fired generators are complaining now which is quite justified andrews speed said overcapacity of generation has drastically reduced their operating hours and is squeezing margins and now they are getting lower tariffs some for the second year running he said the government s decision to manipulate electricity rates for the purpose of economic stimulus is seen as a setback for energy reforms these measures completely undermine the development of the power market andrews speed said this has been announced at a time when the government is claiming to be liberalizing the power market by allowing generators to sell to large users at tariffs to be set by negotiation and allowing a proliferation of power retailers he said in his annual work report to the national people s congress on march 5 premier li keqiang suggested that the government would advance reforms and set lower electricity rates at the same time we will deepen electric power market reforms overhaul electricity price surcharges reduce the electricity usage cost for the manufacturing industry and reduce the average electricity price of general industrial and commercial industry by another 10 percent li said from an environmental standpoint large rate cuts are also likely to be counterproductive since cheaper power prices encourage energy consumption while the rate reductions are across the board they will likely provide the biggest benefit to the largest energy users and sources of emissions including makers of steel cement and building materials a general view of a construction site owned by state grid corporation of china the country s state owned electric utility monopoly in beijing oct 17 2016 credit afp competition concerns the double digit cuts will also come as a gift and effective subsidy to marginal state owned enterprises soes potentially raising competition concerns of trading partners american steelmakers and other manufacturers have long complained about the effects of chinese subsidies but whether the issue of power pricing will figure in the current u s china trade negotiations is open to question the issue of whether the rate cuts constitute a subsidy is complex said william reinsch a former commerce department official now a senior adviser at the center for strategic and international studies in washington the definition of subsidy in both u s law and wto world trade organization rules requires specificity reinsch said that is to be a subsidy there must be a specific benefit to somebody if the government lowers the rate for everybody that would not be a subsidy because it is not specific reinsch said there are other complications the laws would not support u s action against a subsidy unless a u s party was injured raising more questions about competition and the size of per unit costs the wto would want to know whether the rate cuts apply only to chinese companies or also to foreign companies manufacturing in china the question of whether the decrease qualifies as a subsidy also depends on whether the price of electricity has been lowered below a market rate which is hard to determine in china and so on taking all that into account the rate cuts might still be actionable which could trigger a countervailing duty reinsch said but the outcome seems far from a slam dunk a hot button issue in any case it is unclear that chinese subsidies in general are the hot button issue that they once seemed to be for u s negotiators a review of statements and reports over the past year suggests that u s complaints about subsidies were mostly directed at the chinese government s support for high tech industries under the made in china 2025 initiative as the government has stepped back from promoting the plan the subsidy issue seems to have largely faded from view still u s policy statements continued to cite opposition to chinese subsidies as a top agenda item in the past year speaking in november at the asia pacific economic cooperation apec summit in papua new guinea u s vice president mike pence blasted china for unfair trade practices that included subsidies pence cited forced technology transfer intellectual property theft and industrial subsidies on an unprecedented scale usa today reported at the time a government white paper on trade frictions last september also made clear that china had come under pressure on the subsidy issue china s subsidy policy complies with wto rules and should not be attacked said a xinhua report on the white paper arguments but with signs that u s and china negotiators are closing in on a trade deal the years of controversy over subsidies may be left to another day we have not emphasized subsidies and when we do it s about lending said derek scissors an asia economist at the american enterprise institute in washington who has reportedly advised the administration of president donald trump on the negotiations in an email message scissors indicated that the rate cuts are unlikely to raise u s concerns this reads like another attempt to bolster business confidence and will barely be noticed by the u s team scissors said if that is the case china may be free to pursue a bad economic energy and environmental policy on its own copyright 1998

competitive pressures in north america europe and asia including at the shanghai china facility that was shut down in the fourth quarter of 2018 a small portion of the volume decline was associated with the start of the previously disclosed customer product transition discussed below volume for elastics products in personal care increased year over year net sales in surface protection declined slightly in the fourth quarter of 2018 versus 2017 primarily due to lower volume that the company continues to believe resulted from customer inventory corrections partially offset by a one time

regarding a previously disclosed significant product transition the total annual sales that will be adversely impacted by this product transition is approximately 70 million during 2019 the company expects sales for the product of 30 to 35 million with the potential for no sales thereafter any actions that the company takes to reduce fixed costs to partially mitigate the decline in variable contribution that will accompany the decline in sales will depend on the level of success that personal care has with replacing the lost business with new products and business personal care has increased its annual r d spending by approximately 5 million since 2014 reaching 12 million in 2018 personal care is also investing capital and is accelerating sales and marketing efforts to capture growth and diversify its customer base and product offerings the personal care component of pe films had operating profit from ongoing operations plus depreciation and amortization in the fourth quarter of 2018 of 3 1 million as a result of the decline in sales from the significant product transition discussed above the company expects operating profit from ongoing operations plus depreciation and amortization for this component of approximately negative 1 5 million during the first half of 2019 personal care projects its operating profit from ongoing operations plus depreciation and amortization to turn positive in the second half of 2019 assuming production and sales growth targets are achieved because of the significance of the customer transition discussed above the company performed an asset recoverability test and goodwill impairment analysis for the personal care component of pe films the company s analysis concluded that the fair value of the personal care reporting unit was less than its carrying value accordingly the goodwill associated with personal care of 46 8 million 38 2 million after deferred income tax benefits was written off

products used in surface protection applications will be made obsolete by possible future customer product transitions to less costly alternative processes or materials these transitions could possibly be fully implemented by the fourth quarter of 2019 when fully implemented the company estimates that the annualized adverse impact on future operating profit from this customer shift will be

management projects primarily for the industrial sector then usaid requested assistance with pilot projects to introduce environmental audits for sustainable tourism in the caribbean for water energy and waste the 18 month project was extended several times and became a seven year program that was instrumental in the sustainable tourism movement that helped us grow to a full sustainable tourism practice working from the caribbean to the red sea to asia today we re working more on energy efficiency renewable energy and climate change so in the caribbean we ve moved from sustainable tourism to implementing the first regional programmatic clean development mechanism it will allow hotels to bundle their emission reduction activities from energy efficiency and small scale renewable energy to qualify for certified emission reduction credits which can be sold to industrialized countries or corporations to help meet their emission reduction targets now after 30 years i am again focused on renewable energy and energy efficiency i now work on programs policy development and project development as the chief of party for the usaid indonesia clean energy development iced project now in its second phase iced ii has been instrumental in creating the wind power and solar energy market in indonesia our greatest contribution is anticipating the technical and economic considerations of high penetrations of renewable energy on the national electricity system and to offer advice based on the lessons learned from the united states and other countries that have already gone through similar transitions why is clean energy development in indonesia a priority at this time indonesia is among the world s largest emitters of greenhouse gases and energy is the fastest growing source of emissions so there s no solution to global climate change without indonesia after being relatively isolated for many years indonesia now sees itself as exercising a leadership role in curbing carbon emissions and achieving energy independence indonesia has an important and fragile ecosystem they have some of the largest contiguous tropical rainforests and are struggling with deforestation issues and since the country sits in the ring of fire it is under threat from natural disasters additionally the demand for electricity is growing by 7 to 10 percent per year and nearly a quarter of indonesia s households still don t have access to electricity indonesia has announced very aggressive targets to reduce emissions by 26 percent by 2020 or 41 percent with foreign assistance indonesia also has a national policy to achieve 23 percent of all primary energy and 25 percent of all new generating capacity from new and renewable energy sources the united states has a bilateral trade and investment commitment to indonesia as well as a congressional earmark for funding to be spent on global climate change norway and other countries have also committed significant funds the iced project is helping indonesia meet its energy security and climate change commitments tetra tech ard is managing parallel forestry programs related to the emissions reduction goals that program improves carbon sequestration and iced reduces emissions from the energy sector does clean energy development have other benefits for indonesia indonesia s energy supply is dominated by fossil fuels while the main population centers such as java bali and parts of sumatra can benefit from large power plants much of the country is made up of small islands and is very decentralized these areas have been historically reliant on diesel which means fuel has to be taken to small islands by barge recently rough seas prevented the shipping of fuel to nias island off the south coast of sumatra and the whole island was without electricity for days the distributed nature of indonesia s population also makes it increasingly expensive to reach what is called the last mile or the consumers farthest from the electricity generation sources the status quo is not working so the national electric utility pln has emerged as the principal partner with the iced project we re working with the national government as well as regional and local authorities to meet energy needs at every level the projects rely on indigenous sources such as hydropower biomass solar wind and biofuels we ll also be working in areas that aren t connected to the electricity grid providing energy to small clinics schools and households in remote communities in these cases we re not just reducing emissions but also providing access to energy in areas that are un served most likely displacing charcoal and wood fuel overall iced has the potential to help indonesia become a leader in this field which means increased economic opportunities what is the biggest challenge on the project relative to countries that have had successful programs indonesia has not progressed past the policy stage to implementation and coordination in program administration our focus at the programmatic level is on bringing in the real elements to make the program happen and on creating the market in a systematic way indonesia is poised for success but it needs to progress in a strategic way for example climate change and energy diversification targets are set without a clear plan for how to achieve them the biggest challenge is that the iced results are tied to the development of commercial projects while indonesia has enormous potential in renewable resources and investors and banks are eager to finance projects the government of indonesia has not established sufficient incentives such as the purchase price for electricity from renewable energy projects currently iced is assisting more than 150 projects with a combined generating capacity of nearly 1 800 megawatts this represents a combined investment of more than 3 billion however many of the projects are stalled waiting for higher feed in tariffs and the realization of government fiscal incentives how is this project representative of tetra tech s energy expertise in developing countries tetra tech offers our clients real solutions to their energy security needs and commitments for reducing greenhouse gas emissions rather than just doing policy we have the ability to take a project all the way through financing construction and operations we re uniquely positioned to work on the entire project life cycle it is an exciting time to be working in this field and for tetra tech to be shaping the market
as the us and its allies slap new sanctions on the country life for venezuelans gets worse amid shortage of medicine and food hardship is everywhere in venezuela these days everywhere i go there are people trying to fulfil their basic needs some more than others but the struggle is the same take alfredo felix for example the 60 year old suffers from diabetes and needs dialysis three times a week but the power outages of the past few days have been difficult for people like him because of the blackout i couldn t do my dialysis and i felt dizzy and weak i don t know what is going to happen in this country sometimes i feel we are at a point of no return he says with tears in his eyes the acute shortage of medicines has added to the misery of patients like felix venezuela s cash strapped government is struggling with an economic crisis that has forced the country to reduce imports this combined with hyperinflation is making it difficult for people to buy or even find the medication they need hospitals are struggling to find basic items to help those in need the situation is difficult for the venezuelan government most economists say united states sanctions were implemented four years ago when the damage to the economy was already done the first sanctions that prevented venezuela from negotiating its debt came after venezuela already had one of the highest risks in the world and the risk was because of the drop in oil prices and with a government that did not want to modify its budget or the controls on exchange rate said ronald balza an economist in the capital caracas venezuela continued spending when it already owed billions of dollars in debt said balza 190308182845194 so paying interest on its debt is a major issue in fact some economists say the government is restructuring debt payments but there are no official numbers from the administration government officials say the us the united kingdom and others are freezing its assets that they would be able to buy medicines if that money were to be released but what you can see here is also years of mismanagement and massive corruption that can be measured in billions of dollars hospitals where i am right now in the city of barcelona haven t had gauze syringes or basic medicine for years in january this year the us announced new sanctions with the objective to choke venezuela s economy even more in late april all oil exports to the us will supposedly be suspended but the sanctions go beyond the oil the financial system has tentacles around the world so any commercial operation that has anything to do with venezuela will be affected any transaction that is in us dollar will be affected now the real sanctions begin says cesar mota an oil expert in caracas as i write this i can see oil tankers at sea i am told already that nobody wants to buy venezuelan oil as they are afraid of the sanctions there is overcompliance with the us and it will affect not only every agency or person related to the venezuelan government but local companies as well western recognition the us the european union and other countries in the region recognise opposition leader juan guaido as venezuela s interim president the us has said it wants to force president nicolas maduro out of office and hope the new sanctions will help speed up the process but analysts warn that the strategy is unlikely to work the us is betting on a total collapse of the country and it has been disappointing it has been applied in cuba iran syria zimbabwe and north korea yes the government got weaker they have complications they had to change policies but the government did not change says luis vicente leon a political analyst in venezuela 190123205835912 my question is why is the trump administration implementing measures that will have an enormous effect on the venezuelan people and that has already failed in so many other countries around the world in fact the sanctions will likely make people more dependent on the government everyone i talk to in venezuela is tired and upset except those who go to pro government rallies who act as if nothing is actually wrong they say people are leaving the country in search of better opportunities that is not what i have seen in every border country with venezuela they arrive hungry ill and in desperate need of help the majority of the population except those with us dollars are desperate many too tired to even take to the streets to protest venezuela s economy will certainly deteriorate even further as the us sanctions start to affect the oil sector later this year but the faces of felix and engibel gomez a 17 year old girl with cancer and so many others come to mind when i see a policy that will deteriorate their lives even further they cannot wait forever for things to change in venezuela and one thing is certain this year their lives will only get worse
the ecstasy of gold by mark watson mitchell 18 march 2019 8 mins to read mark watson mitchell explains some very interesting facts about gold and why the precious yellow metal is a long term winner

for it the first gold rush of 1697 brought gold from brazil into london partly transported by moses mocatta on ships owned by the east india company which had a royal charter from queen elizabeth i this inflow of gold led to demand for a purpose built london vault which the bank of england duly set up their bullion warehouse served the whole of the european market as it does now and was further stocked by the influx to london from the subsequent gold rushes in california australia and south africa the refineries that were set up to process this gold were located close to the bank of england which played a key role in being a custodian regulator and facilitator of lending and selling of gold by other banks in 1750 the bank set up the london good delivery list which formally recognised those refineries that produced gold bars of a certain standard and could therefore be allowed to enter the london market today this list is regarded as the only globally accepted accreditation for the bullion market ensuring that the wholesale bullion bars traded in the market meet standards and quality required by good delivery by 1850 the london gold market was dominated by five companies n m

measurable improvement following a deep 1 6 percent drop in december when holiday spending should have been in full throttle although some hesitancy is still lingering economist jack kleinhenz of the national retail federation said in a statement it is good to see consumer spending showing traction given the concerns on the minds of american families last month consumer spending still fuels the nation s economic engine and retail sales are a window into our willingness to shop and eat out at restaurants it s a key gauge of how people feel about their personal finances in the moment minnesota

postrecession mind set one that is easily spooked by instability housing values and the stock market have recovered but vast swaths of americans haven t made up lost ground during the past decade consumers may be waiting for the other shoe to drop there s a general sense in the market that a recession has to be around the corner but i don t necessarily think that s so said analyst ken perkins founder of the research firm retail metrics the labor market has been strong the consumer has a little more in their pocket gas prices are low the underpinnings for spending should be good the overhang perkins said is massive student debt among younger consumers that is delaying purchases of homes and other big items retailers rely on younger generations to power sales as they launch careers set up their own homes and start families you ve got a lot of young consumers who would love to buy a car buy a house perkins said but there s this massive student debt that s really worrisome

oregon us representative peter defazio press release u s representative peter defazio d or u s senator brian schatz d hi and u s senator chris van hollen d md will introduce legislation to create a new progressive tax on financial transactions that would generate billions in revenue while addressing economic inequality and reducing high risk and volatility in the market high frequency traders front run the market and drive up prices for individuals pension funds and other value investors said rep peter defazio or 04 some days high frequency traders trade billions of shares that they sometimes hold for only seconds or less they reap enormous financial benefits for themselves and their privileged elite investors but add no value to our economy congress needs to rein in excessive speculative activity and protect working families from these dangerous practices while maintaining appropriate market liquidity this legislation will curb unnecessary speculation and generate much needed revenue to help the federal government fund national priorities and invest in the real economy to benefit all americans over the last decade wall street has made record profits from high risk trades that have made the market dangerously volatile while doing nothing to add real value to our economy or raise wages for workers said senator schatz my bill will help discourage this kind of risky volume based trading and bring in billions in new revenue wall street has made an art of high speed trading and rank speculation that has fattened the wallets of a few while putting everyday americans at risk this tiny high roller fee will help curb this risky behavior while generating revenue that we can invest in growing our real economy and helping hard working families said senator van hollen the wall street tax act addresses the disconnect between the financial system and the real economy by reducing unproductive and speculative trading by increasing transaction costs slightly the bill will help redirect investment that has flooded into transactions without economic value into more productive areas of the economy it will also reduce the risk of financial crashes and limit the risks that high speed arbitrage pose to our financial system volatile high volume trading is great for wall street traders who can make millions off of fluctuations said senator merkley but it does nothing to help middle class families or to invest in jobs and innovation this legislation restores balance to our markets while raising revenue for key priorities that help working families more than a decade after wall street greed brought the american economy to its knees big banks and the richest americans are doing just fine yet main streets and hardworking new yorkers all over our state are still struggling said senator gillibrand congress needs to do everything it can to prevent another financial crisis and this bill would update the rules for wall street help prevent systemic risk in our financial system and raise revenue so we can invest in our economy i am proud to support this legislation and i urge my colleagues to stand with workers and fight with me to pass it the wealthiest 10 percent of americans own an estimated 85 percent of stock market wealth the bipartisan tax policy center estimates that a tax of this kind would only apply to the highest earners in the country with almost half of those affected belonging to the wealthiest 1 percent the wall street tax act would tax the sale of stocks bonds and derivatives at 0 1 percent 10 basis points and would raise an estimated 777 billion over a decade a stock trade of 1 000 would incur a tax of just one dollar the tax would apply to the fair market value of equities and bonds and the payment flows under derivatives contracts initial public offerings and short term debt with a maturity of less than 100 days would be exempted in addition to schatz and van hollen the legislation is cosponsored by u s senators jeff merkley d ore and kirsten gillibrand d n y in the senate in the house of representatives the schatz defazio bill is cosponsored by u s representatives rosa delauro d conn raul grijalva d

distort the economy and increase societal inequities good taxes can simultaneously raise revenues because they promote growth and equity the wall street tax act is an example of the latter a good tax that encourages the economy to move away from wasteful excessive short term financial transactions toward more productive activities that enhance the well being of our entire economy said joseph

by marcello estevão global director of macroeconomics trade and investment at the world bank he was brazil s deputy minister of finance for international affairs g20 deputy and chairman of the board of directors of the new development bank shanghai from end 2016 to end 2018 following the impeachment of president dilma rousseff in mid 2016 and the inauguration of president michel temer who had been vice president the new team responsible for brazil s international economic agenda worked diligently for greater integration of our country into the world economy that has happened in many areas including relations with international organizations the domestic framework for officially supported export credits and trade policy with regard to relations with international organizations the team has contributed to deepen brazil s participation in the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd the mandate of which focuses on the discussion and international consolidation of best practices in public policies brazil s finance ministry paved the way for the submission of the brazilian government s request for oecd membership in may 2017 the beginning of a process that has resulted so far in a significant expansion of brazilian adherence to the oecd legal instruments the country has already adhered to 56 instruments and requested adherence to another 79 which qualifies brazil as the non member country with the highest degree of compliance to oecd standards the process of brazil s adherence to the codes of liberalization of capital movements and current invisible operations a key instrument in the oecd normative framework started in 2017 and is expected to be concluded in 2019 the government wide effort required for this adherence to happen also counted on leadership from brazil s central bank the ministry of foreign relations and former president temer s own cabinet the ministry has also supported the strengthening of financial cooperation within the brics brazil russia india china and south africa movement aimed at forging stronger partnerships geared to national development of particular note are initiatives for the effective launching of operations of the new development bank ndb composed of the five brics members the ministry s efforts contributed to results in two areas i approval of four projects funded by the ndb in brazil since 2017 corresponding to a portfolio equivalent of us 621 million and ii the signing in july 2018 of a headquarters agreement for the establishment of the regional office of the americas which will operate in são paulo and will have a representative office in brasília the opening of the regional office in 2019 will contribute to the identification of projects and the expansion of the ndb portfolio within the public and private sectors in brazil the beginning of the brics brazilian presidency in 2019 will be an opportunity for further progress in topics that we have supported those include the expansion of the ndb to new members strengthening of infrastructure investment cooperation and the constitution of a financial mechanism to assist the development of local corporate bond markets brics bond fund it is important to note that tighter relations with oecd and brics countries are not mutually exclusive as the effective actions taken in the past two and a half years bear witness brazil has had a rich history of independence and pragmatism resulting from its privileged geopolitical position in the world including no military problems at its borders relatively smooth political transitions and no serious civil unrests those factors have allowed the country to have independent positions in international fora and establish economic ties with different countries aiming solely at benefiting its population in the same vein brazilian representatives have also worked in the past two and a half years to strengthen the international financial institutions of the bretton woods system with regard to the imf international monetary fund that work strived to support the fund s contribution to the international financial safety net in a context of tightening global financial conditions and heightened trade tensions in that regard the brazilian government has supported the timely conclusion of the fifteenth general review of quotas an important process for both the expansion of resources available to the fund in light of its mandate of prevention and resolution of balance of payments crises and its institutional adaptation to the dynamism of some members especially emerging market economies with respect to the world bank brazil s economic team has sought continued support for economic growth focused on financing public sector projects and leveraging resources from the private sector moreover the dialogue with the world bank has led to a partnership in the analysis of key topics of the domestic economic agenda anchored in the world bank s expertise and reflected in reports covering topics such as productivity labor market fiscal policy water resources management reform of the social security system and the infrastructure gap in brazil we have also taken an active position in the negotiations for an increase in world bank capital concluded recently thanks to these negotiations large middle income emerging economies such as brazil and china will continue to benefit from engaging with the world bank while also contributing to the bank s activities in less developed areas of the globe over the last years brazil s finance ministry has supported the work of the g20 the main forum for international economic cooperation among its members in addition to contributing to the different activities carried out in the group s finance track the secretariat of international affairs sain mf co chaired with australia the g20 infrastructure working group iwg in 2018 based on the objective of attracting private capital to the financing of infrastructure with the creation of an asset class this work has centered on possible measures by governments and international organizations to reduce transaction costs and mitigate risks that are hard for individual investors to bear so that investment can flourish in this sector in practice the iwg s co chairs directed the work toward different topics provision of guarantees by multilateral banks implementation of minimum requirements for project preparation in multilateral banks and local institutions standardization of contractual and financial clauses for mitigation of risks and legal uncertainty and establishment of a global infrastructure database the discussions referred to common g20 problems affecting both emerging and more advanced economies at the same time these interactions have helped to shed light on the governance of infrastructure investment in brazil indeed the international debate has filtered through views on how national development banks and more generally government policies for the sector should be designed in the period considered there was significant progress with regard to the framework for officially supported export credits in light of the role of sain mf in the management of the export credit insurance system sce backed by the export guarantee fund fge and the recovery of credits arising from direct financing finex proex in november 2016 brazil joined the paris club the main international forum for coordination of official creditors this step strengthened brazil s role in supporting coordinated and sustainable solutions to the recovery of debts incurred by other nations in a scenario of our consolidation as a creditor to different governments in parallel the sce fge governance was improved with the launching of an integrity and compliance program in 2017 that was geared to curb acts of corruption laundering or concealment of funds and financing of terrorism in guaranteed operations we have also prepared an overhaul of the sce financial structure that is ready to be implemented by the new administration the new structure is centered on a fund that is capitalized by the premia paid by insured exporters instead of having these premia enter in the government s general budget as has been the case since the program s inception 20 years ago the fund would have a private nature and would be backed by capital already available in abgf brazil s export credit agency and ultimately by brazil s treasury this way managers of the system the new ministry of economy would not have to go to congress to request additional resources to pay for unexpected obligations above and beyond what had been budgeted the year before payments to insured private sector representatives would happen more efficiently thus reducing the uncertainty surrounding the current system by being more credible and better designed the new system would provide more support to exports of large manufacturing goods and services that are not covered by the private sector after some years of good financial performance we expect that private sector investors would be interested in participating in this fund further reducing risks to brazil s taxpayers importantly i should also highlight the finance ministry s efforts in support of greater trade liberalization as brazil is one of the most closed economies in the world this relative trade isolationism is mainly the result of restrictive policies including high tariffs and non tariff barriers which were for years less concerned with the welfare of the average brazilian citizen and more concerned with providing protection to domestic producers these policies had disastrous consequences for domestic productivity competitiveness consumers welfare and income

elaboration by estevão and alcaraz 2018 since 2016 the participation of sain mf in the trade policy decision making process has been guided by the objective of reducing the so called brazil cost that was achieved by cutting import tariffs and suspending or not applying antidumping and countervailing measures when appropriate with regard to tariffs the secretariat presented proposals for the gradual reduction of sectoral rates with significant potential impact on economic growth analytical work by ministry officials regarding the temporary reduction of import tariffs in scenarios of supply or demand shocks supported 159 tariff reduction proposals to the brazilian international trade committee camex comprised of representatives of seven ministries and mercosur southern common market this work has resulted in tariff reductions and direct savings to importers estimated at us 470 million concerning antidumping and countervailing measures we coordinated public interest analyses to avoid those measures when costs for the brazilian economy would surpass gains to specific sectors as an example official estimates show that the suspension of duties on hot rolled flat steel products in 2017 prevented an annual net negative impact on the brazilian economy in the order of r 1 5 billion approximately us 400 million the set of initiatives implemented since 2016 have aimed at increasing brazil s global presence and fostering the domestic objective of economic growth with stability backed by advances in productivity and efficiency of public policies the period has witnessed significant progress which has also provided opportunities for follow up and further improvement to the administration that has just started in 2019 indeed the new government was elected with the stated objective to better integrate the brazilian economy into international trade and capital flows the next step seems clear supporting the efforts of the outgoing economic team to reduce barriers to trade and facilitate imports of goods services and technology that would be a crucial contribution to productivity growth and the reduction of production costs in brazil as has happened in other countries when similar reforms were implemented
oregon us representative peter defazio press release u s representative peter defazio d or u s senator brian schatz d hi and u s senator chris van hollen d md will introduce legislation to create a new progressive tax on financial transactions that would generate billions in revenue while addressing economic inequality and reducing high risk and volatility in the market high frequency traders front run the market and drive up prices for individuals pension funds and other value investors said rep peter defazio or 04 some days high frequency traders trade billions of shares that they sometimes hold for only seconds or less they reap enormous financial benefits for themselves and their privileged elite investors but add no value to our economy congress needs to rein in excessive speculative activity and protect working families from these dangerous practices while maintaining appropriate market liquidity this legislation will curb unnecessary speculation and generate much needed revenue to help the federal government fund national priorities and invest in the real economy to benefit all americans over the last decade wall street has made record profits from high risk trades that have made the market dangerously volatile while doing nothing to add real value to our economy or raise wages for workers said senator schatz my bill will help discourage this kind of risky volume based trading and bring in billions in new revenue wall street has made an art of high speed trading and rank speculation that has fattened the wallets of a few while putting everyday americans at risk this tiny high roller fee will help curb this risky behavior while generating revenue that we can invest in growing our real economy and helping hard working families said senator van hollen the wall street tax act addresses the disconnect between the financial system and the real economy by reducing unproductive and speculative trading by increasing transaction costs slightly the bill will help redirect investment that has flooded into transactions without economic value into more productive areas of the economy it will also reduce the risk of financial crashes and limit the risks that high speed arbitrage pose to our financial system volatile high volume trading is great for wall street traders who can make millions off of fluctuations said senator merkley but it does nothing to help middle class families or to invest in jobs and innovation this legislation restores balance to our markets while raising revenue for key priorities that help working families more than a decade after wall street greed brought the american economy to its knees big banks and the richest americans are doing just fine yet main streets and hardworking new yorkers all over our state are still struggling said senator gillibrand congress needs to do everything it can to prevent another financial crisis and this bill would update the rules for wall street help prevent systemic risk in our financial system and raise revenue so we can invest in our economy i am proud to support this legislation and i urge my colleagues to stand with workers and fight with me to pass it the wealthiest 10 percent of americans own an estimated 85 percent of stock market wealth the bipartisan tax policy center estimates that a tax of this kind would only apply to the highest earners in the country with almost half of those affected belonging to the wealthiest 1 percent the wall street tax act would tax the sale of stocks bonds and derivatives at 0 1 percent 10 basis points and would raise an estimated 777 billion over a decade a stock trade of 1 000 would incur a tax of just one dollar the tax would apply to the fair market value of equities and bonds and the payment flows under derivatives contracts initial public offerings and short term debt with a maturity of less than 100 days would be exempted in addition to schatz and van hollen the legislation is cosponsored by u s senators jeff merkley d ore and kirsten gillibrand d n y in the senate in the house of representatives the schatz defazio bill is cosponsored by u s representatives rosa delauro d conn raul grijalva d

distort the economy and increase societal inequities good taxes can simultaneously raise revenues because they promote growth and equity the wall street tax act is an example of the latter a good tax that encourages the economy to move away from wasteful excessive short term financial transactions toward more productive activities that enhance the well being of our entire economy said joseph

washington d c united states of america march 18 2019 apo group south sudan is facing a deep economic crisis following several years of conflict the september 2018 peace agreement has increased the prospects for lasting peace and reestablishing macroeconomic stability and credibility full dedication to peace economic stabilization and robust oil management will be key in rebuilding policy credibility and regaining access to external financial support a staff team from the international monetary fund imf led by jan mikkelsen visited south sudan during march 5 15 to conduct discussions of the 2019 article iv consultation at the conclusion of the mission mr mikkelsen made the following statement the resumption of hostilities in july 2016 severely impaired the south sudanese economy which led to a substantial loss of income high inflation foreign exchange shortages and acute deterioration in humanitarian conditions about half of the country s population is estimated to face food insecurity and more than 4 million people are displaced moreover the conflict has led to the loss of fiscal discipline and weakening of public institutions the country is in a deep economic crisis and policy adjustments are urgently needed to reestablish economic stability and credibility the peace agreement signed in september 2018 has significantly increased the prospects for lasting peace restoring macroeconomic stability and returning to positive economic growth the implementation of the peace agreement including the cessation of hostilities in large parts of the country have contributed to a peace dividend in the form of increased daily oil production of about 20 percent another positive development is the decline in inflation to about 40 percent by end 2018 from triple digits previously the mission stressed that restoring macroeconomic stability would require collaborative efforts by south sudan and its development partners while development partners continue to support south sudan through humanitarian assistance amounting to about us 1 5 billion annually external support is needed to be directed towards implementation of the peace agreement however the government must also do its part by restoring budgetary discipline strengthening oil management and transparency and applying rigorous priorities on spending with due consideration to peace related spending on the management of oil revenues the mission urges the authorities to immediately stop contracting oil advances that are expensive and nontransparent this measure will also help to ensure that oil revenues will be fully available for financing budgetary spending meanwhile the central bank should continue tight monetary policies and refrain from lending to the government to keep inflation on a decelerating path and gradually replenish foreign exchange reserves fiscal conditions for the remainder of 2018 19 will be constrained by large repayments of oil advances with a tight resource envelope the authorities should strictly prioritize core peace related spending and payment of civil servant salaries with the clearance of oil advances in the current fiscal year the 2019 20 budget can be based on a predictable revenue stream with a projected rise in oil revenue and improvement in the collection of non oil revenue by the newly formed national revenue authority the authorities are advised to formulate a balanced budget with appropriately prioritized allocations for the peace process the costs related to the formation of the enlarged revitalized transitional government of national unity and paying salary arrears to civil servants the current dual foreign exchange rate system with a large spread between the official rate and the parallel market rate is unwarranted as it gives rise to rent seeking and reduces inflows of foreign exchange into the country there is an urgent need to normalize the foreign exchange market by discontinuing the so called special accounts whereby numerous foreign account holders are forced to sell foreign exchange at the official rate and letting banks freely determine their buying and selling rates demonstrating dedication to peace economic stabilization and robust management of oil revenue and public finances will be key in rebuilding policy credibility and regaining access to external financial support the mission met with first vice president deng gai minister of finance mabiordit central bank governor ngor other high level government officials and representatives of the diplomatic community private sector and civil society the team wishes to express its gratitude to the south sudanese authorities for the constructive discussions and their hospitality the imf executive board is expected to complete the 2019 article iv consultation in may 2019
as the economic contagion of the global financial crisis was spreading from country to country in 2007 it was frequently noted that the mainstream economics profession seemed to be just as much in the dark about the true causes of the crisis as were the general public in place of anything incisive and theoretically grounded most people were forced to make do with vague hand waving and metaphors to explain the crash with one particularly well worn bromide sticking out in my own memory as almost the defining phrase of the crisis when america sneezes the whole world gets sick however applicable that apophthegm may have been to the 2007 8 crisis it was certainly the phrase which came to mind recently when news broke that following the u s federal reserve s dovish turn last month central banks across the developing world have followed suit by shifting back toward lower interest rates an aggregate of interest rate moves across 37 developing economies showed that over the course of february the number of central banks in that group which had cut interest rates was greater by three than the number which had raised interest rates this compares with a net rate rise in january with one more central bank having raised rates than cut them in that group indeed this aggregate of 37 developing economies had not shown any net fall in interest rates throughout the previous nine months leading up to the end of january 2019 with interest rate hikes having either equaled or exceeded interest rate cuts for the duration of that period an easy money trend the trend began on 1st february just two days after fed chairman jerome powell announced that the case for raising rates has weakened when azerbaijan s central bank cut its refinancing rate by 50 basis points bringing it down to 9 25 this move was followed shortly afterwards by the reserve bank of india which unexpectedly cut its key interest rate by 25 basis points on february 6th one of the biggest interest rate cuts of the month followed on the 14th with a surprise move by the egyptian central bank which cut its deposit rate to 15 75 and its lending rate to 16 75 a decline of 1 in both cases then on february 20th the bank of jamaica cut its key rate by 25 basis points down to 1 5 two days later the central bank of paraguay made a similar 25 basis point cut to its policy rate bringing it down to 5 and rounding out the month the national bank of the kyrgyz republic cut its own policy rate to 4 50 down from 4 75 on february 26th what has prompted this widespread shift toward looser monetary policy in the developing world while the rationales may differ from country to country in some of their specific details one prevailing theme has appeared time and again throughout the various justifications for these shifts toward lower rates fear of deflation after having strengthened consistently throughout most of 2018 the us dollar first stumbled and then noticeably fell between mid december and mid january and has largely been flatlining since as the equal and opposite reaction to this weakening of the dollar over the past few months the currencies of many of these developing economies have correspondingly strengthened in terms of dollars this has threatened to drop certain measures of inflation in those countries below their central banks inflation targets which in the mind of the mainstream economist brings with it the threat of unemployment and economic slowdown couple this with the various uncertainties and potential shocks currently manifesting on the global economic stage such as the chinese economic slowdown and the uncertainty surrounding brexit and you have a situation in which cutting interest rates would seem to be to the mainstream economist the textbook response after all what harm could possibly come from central bank inflationism and artificially low interest rates the price of low interest rates the advocates of austrian economics may find themselves increasingly occupied with the task of answering that question over the coming months after having maintained near zero interest rates for most of the past decade the past two years have seen the world s central banks gradually start the process of normalizing rates again in response to the sluggish recovery however as the austrian business cycle theory of ludwig von mises demonstrates that period of unsustainably low interest rates will not have been without costs such low interest rates will have induced investors into risky long term projects which will no longer maintain the illusion of profitability once rates rise back to their natural long term levels the relative upswing in the global economy over the past few years will be put under increasing pressure by the rising cost of borrowing pressure which it will likely not be able to withstand given the unsound foundation of unsustainably low interest rates on which that upswing has been built examining the movement of interest rates over the previous two business cycles in for example the united states seems to reveal a familiar pattern as the economy was recovering from the previous bust and entering the next boom the fed took this as its cue to raise interest rates back up to non crisis levels just as the austrian business cycle theory would lead us to expect however these rising rates shook the foundations of the unsustainable booms created by the previous periods of lower interest rates causing the economy to stutter the fed then reacted to this weakening of the boom by first halting and then reversing its interest rate rises with the recessions of 2001 and 2008 both having followed shortly after such reversals with central banks around the world currently signalling a likely softening of their previous plans for rate hikes it may well be that we have begun entering into the final stages of of this familiar cycle once again
first this report was for january the february report will be released on march 29th new home sales for january were reported at 607 000 on a seasonally adjusted annual rate basis saar this was below the consensus forecast however the three previous months were revised up with these revisions sales increased 2 3 in 2018 compared to 2017 i expect sales to be around the same level in 2019 as in 2018 not fall off a cliff and my guess is we haven t seen the peak of this cycle yet on inventory months of inventory is now above the top of the normal range however the number of units completed and under construction is still somewhat low inventory will be something to watch very closely earlier new home sales decreased to 607 000 annual rate in january click on graph for larger image this graph shows new home sales for 2018 and 2019 by month seasonally adjusted annual rate sales in january were down 2 4 year over year compared to january 2018 the comparison will be most difficult in q1 and here is another update to the distressing gap graph that i first started posting a number of years ago to show the emerging gap caused by distressed sales now i m looking for the gap to close over the next several years the distressing gap graph shows existing home sales left axis and new home sales right axis through january 2019 this graph starts in 1994 but the relationship had been fairly steady back to the 60s following the housing bubble and bust the distressing gap appeared mostly because of distressed sales the gap has persisted even though distressed sales are down significantly since new home builders have focused on more expensive homes i still expect this gap to slowly close however this assumes that the builders will offer some smaller less expensive homes if not then the gap will persist however this assumes that the builders will offer some smaller less expensive homes if not then the gap will persist xisting home sales are counted when transactions are closed and new home sales are counted when contracts are signed so the timing of sales is different

consecutive week but series of resistances ahead can restrict the pace of the upmove in the near term immediate resistance is at 300 a break above it can take sbi higher to 305 a strong break above 305 can then target 310 315 or even 320 over the medium term the region between 315 and 320 is a crucial medium term resistance whether sbi breaks above 320 or not will decide the direction of the next move on the other hand if sbi reverses lower from 305 a near term dip to 300 or 297 is possible significant support is between 297 and 295 the stock will come under pressure only if it declines decisively below 295 the next targets are 285 and 280 but such a sharp fall looks unlikely investors can hold the long positions at 283 with a revised stop loss at 286 move the stop loss higher to 297 as soon as the stock moves up to 301 book profits at 305 bullish outlook is intact for itc 290 9 itc closed on a mixed note last week the stock was volatile between 289 and 297 a key support is at 288 as long as the stock sustains above this support the overall bullish outlook will remain intact the indicators on the charts are also positive the 21 day moving average has crossed over the 100 day moving average it is now on the verge of crossing over the 200 day moving average this is a bullish signal indicating that the downside could be limited as such itc can move up to test the 300 303 resistance cluster a pull back from this resistance zone can trigger a corrective fall to 297 295 a further break below 295 will see the corrective fall extending to 290 and 288 on the other hand if itc manages to breach 303 decisively it will gain fresh momentum such a break can take the stock up to 310 investors can continue to hold the long positions taken at 282 278 and 272 retain the stop loss at 273 revise the stop loss higher to 285 as soon as the stock moves up to 299 book profits are 310 key resistance ahead for infosys 718 8 the fall in infosys paused last week as the stock consolidated above 700 the region between 729 and 730 is a crucial resistance a strong break and a decisive close above 730 will negate the head and shoulder pattern formed on the daily chart in such a scenario infosys will gear up for a fresh rally to 760 and 770 in the coming weeks but a failure to breach 730 and a pull back thereafter can drag the stock to 710 and 700 this will confirm the head and shoulder reversal pattern in that case the possibility will be high of the stock breaking below 700 and declining to 690 685 or even 675 the target level of the reversal pattern cluster of supports is poised between 690 and 675 as such the pace of fall below 700 could be slow and a further fall below 675 looks less probable medium term traders can hold the long positions taken at 725 720 and 715 retain the stop loss at 680 for the target of 790 revise the stop loss higher to 735 as soon as the stock moves up to 755 near term outlook is unclear for ril 1 322 6 ril rallied as expected last week breaking above the key resistance level of 1 320 the stock surged over 7 per cent intra week and made a new record high of 1 361 45 but it reversed lower towards the end of the week giving back some of the gains and closed 4 4 per cent higher for the week though the broader bullish view remains intact the near term outlook is unclear the price action will need a close watch as to whether ril manages to sustain above the psychological level of 1 300 a decisive break below 1 300 can take ril lower to 1 260 but such a fall will be a good buying opportunity from a long term perspective if ril manages to sustain above 1 300 and reverses higher it can revisit 1 350 1 360 it will also keep the possibility high of the stock targeting 1 400 or even higher levels investors can hold the long positions taken at 1 260 1 245 and 1 225 retain the stop loss at 1 180 for the target of 1 420 revise the stop loss higher to 1 320 as soon as ril moves up to 1 360 tata steel shows positive bias 515 5 tata steel has been stuck in a narrow 505 530 range over the last couple of weeks a breakout on either side of 505 or 530 will decide the direction of the next move if tata steel breaks below 505 a fall to 495 490 is possible the region between 495 and 490 is a strong support which can limit the downside a further fall below 490 looks less likely at the moment on the other hand if tata steel breaks the current sideways range and goes above 530 it can move up initially to 540 it will also keep the uptrend that has been in place since late january intact an eventual break above 540 will then increase the likelihood of the stock targeting 560 levels over the medium term the bias is positive on the charts so the possibility is high of the stock breaking above 530 as such medium term traders can go long on dips at 510 and 505 stop loss can be placed at 485 for the target of 555 revise the stop loss higher to 515 as soon as the stock moves up to the level of 525 9 00 am

first this report was for january the february report will be released on march 29th new home sales for january were reported at 607 000 on a seasonally adjusted annual rate basis saar this was below the consensus forecast however the three previous months were revised up with these revisions sales increased 2 3 in 2018 compared to 2017 i expect sales to be around the same level in 2019 as in 2018 not fall off a cliff and my guess is we haven t seen the peak of this cycle yet on inventory months of inventory is now above the top of the normal range however the number of units completed and under construction is still somewhat low inventory will be something to watch very closely earlier new home sales decreased to 607 000 annual rate in january click on graph for larger image this graph shows new home sales for 2018 and 2019 by month seasonally adjusted annual rate sales in january were down 2 4 year over year compared to january 2018 the comparison will be most difficult in q1 and here is another update to the distressing gap graph that i first started posting a number of years ago to show the emerging gap caused by distressed sales now i m looking for the gap to close over the next several years the distressing gap graph shows existing home sales left axis and new home sales right axis through january 2019 this graph starts in 1994 but the relationship had been fairly steady back to the 60s following the housing bubble and bust the distressing gap appeared mostly because of distressed sales the gap has persisted even though distressed sales are down significantly since new home builders have focused on more expensive homes i still expect this gap to slowly close however this assumes that the builders will offer some smaller less expensive homes if not then the gap will persist however this assumes that the builders will offer some smaller less expensive homes if not then the gap will persist xisting home sales are counted when transactions are closed and new home sales are counted when contracts are signed so the timing of sales is different

president donald trump keeps changing his story in the swirling investigations into russia election interference and hush money payments to women who say they had affairs with him he insists that payments to porn actress stormy daniels and former playboy model karen mcdougal during the 2016 campaign were private transactions and that any crime committed would be the fault of his former personal attorney michael cohen not him that s a change from what the president said before trump previously had denied knowledge of payments and dismissed any hint of a crime in the special counsel s probe into contacts between russia and the trump campaign trump tried to cast doubt on whether his former national security adviser michael flynn had lied to the fbi flynn in fact pleaded guilty to doing just that over the past week trump also made a flurry of false or unsupported statements about immigration he said with no evidence that migrants are plagued with disease he asserted that mexico has in effect agreed to pay for his border wall even as he threatens a partial government shutdown if congress doesn t approve billions of dollars to build it he twisted federal statistics to claim the recent arrest of 10 terrorists who don t exist a look at the claims cohen trump remember michael cohen only became a rat after the fbi did something which was absolutely unthinkable unheard of until the witch hunt was illegally started they broke into an attorney s office tweet sunday the facts it was not a break in the fbi executed a search warrant obtained from a judge in conducting the raid and seizing records on a variety of matters among them a 130 000 payment made to porn actress stormy daniels by trump s lawyer cohen the application for the warrant was approved high in the justice department former fbi director james comey tweeted in response sunday that trump is lying about the lawful execution of a search warrant issued by a federal judge trump i never directed him to do anything wrong whatever he did he did on his own interview thursday with fox news trump i never directed michael cohen to break the law many campaign finance lawyers have strongly stated that i did nothing wrong with respect to campaign finance laws if they even apply because this was not campaign finance tweets thursday trump so now the dems go to a simple private transaction wrongly call it a campaign contribution which it was not but even if it was it is only a civil case like obama s but it was done correctly by a lawyer and there would not even be a fine lawyer s liability if he made a mistake not me cohen just trying to get his sentence reduced tweets dec 10 the facts whatever the truth his account is evolving trump s description of the payments as a simple private transaction which he couples with his insistence that did nothing wrong with respect to campaign finance laws is not how he explained it just a few months ago in april trump issued a blanket denial that he knew anything about reports of 130 000 in hush money paid to daniels saying reporters would have to ask michael cohen a month later he then acknowledged the payments as a private contract trump is now saying if something criminal happened it would be solely cohen s fault as his former attorney both cohen and american media inc the company that owns the national enquirer tabloid say they made hush money payments to daniels and mcdougal for the purpose of helping trump s 2016 white house bid a campaign finance violation both women alleged they had extramarital affairs with trump which the white house denies federal prosecutors say the payments were made at trump s direction for the payments themselves to be a crime rather than a civil infraction prosecutors would need to show that trump knew that what he was doing was wrong when he directed cohen to pay the women and that he did so with the goal of benefiting his campaign it s unclear what federal prosecutors in new york will decide to do if they conclude that there is evidence that trump himself committed a crime in the meantime trump s changing version of the truth is running head on into facts agreed to by prosecutors russia investigation trump wow 19 000 texts between lisa page and her lover peter s of the fbi in charge of the russia hoax were just reported as being wiped clean and gone such a big story that will never be covered by the fake news witch hunt tweet saturday the facts the justice department s watchdog in a report released thursday found no evidence the fbi intentionally destroyed text messages of former fbi agent peter strzok and former fbi lawyer lisa page who were involved in the hillary clinton email investigation when they worked for the bureau the inspector general faulted an fbi wide software failure that has resulted in large portions of fbi text messages not being archived the report examined a gap in messages from december 2016 through may 2017 from the phones of strzok and page the fbi ultimately managed to recover thousands of the messages some congressional republicans had suggested the messages were intentionally deleted the inspector general report said there was no evidence strzok and page circumvented protocol strzok was removed from special counsel robert mueller s russia investigation after anti trump texts were discovered he has since been fired page resigned trump well the fbi said michael flynn a general and a great person they said he didn t lie and mueller said well maybe he did and now they re all having a big dispute so i think it s a great thing that the judge is looking into that situation it s an honor for a lot of terrific people remarks thursday the facts that s not what the fbi said and flynn trump s former national security adviser has agreed that he lied to the fbi he pleaded guilty to it and is to be sentenced this week the first white house official punished as part of special counsel robert mueller s ongoing russia investigation the idea that flynn didn t lie to the fbi picked up steam after republicans on the house intelligence committee issued a report this year that said ex fbi director james comey in a private briefing told lawmakers that agents who interviewed flynn discerned no physical indications of deception and saw nothing that indicated to them that he knew he was lying to them but comey called that description garble in a private interview with house lawmakers this month comey in essence said flynn was a good liar having a natural conversation with agents answered fully their questions didn t avoid that notwithstanding they concluded he was lying as for trump s comment that the judge is looking into the matter it s true u s district judge emmet sullivan has asked for documents related to the agents who interviewed flynn it s not clear from sullivan s order whether he considers there to be a dispute to resolve or if he just wants to see the underlying documents as he decides flynn s sentence border security trump the democrats policy of child seperation sic on the border during the obama administration was far worse than the way we handle it now remember the 2014 picture of children in cages the obama years tweet sunday the facts democratic president barack obama did not have a separation policy the trump administration didn t explicitly either but that was the effect of his zero tolerance policy which meant that anyone caught crossing the border illegally was to be criminally prosecuted even those with few or no previous offences the policy meant adults were taken to court for criminal proceedings and their children were separated in most cases if the charge took longer than 72 hours to process which is the longest time that children can be held by customs and border protection children were sent into the care of the health and human services department zero tolerance remains in effect but trump signed an executive order june 20 that stopped separations trump also misrepresents 2014 photos of children in holding cells they did not involve family separation the photos taken by the associated press during the obama administration showed children who came to the border without their parents and were being housed at a customs and border protection center in nogales arizona the photos were identified as such but wrongly described online as illustrating imprisonment under trump trump people with tremendous medical difficulty and medical problems are pouring in and in many in many cases it s contagious they re pouring into our country we have to have border security statement in oval office meeting tuesday with democratic leaders rep nancy pelosi and sen chuck schumer the facts trump provided no evidence that people coming into the country including the caravan at the u s mexico border are carrying contagious diseases at a higher rate than the u s population medical screening is part of the process for vetting people who seek asylum a study published this month by the ucl lancet commission on migration and health called scares about contagion one of the most pervasive myths about migrants the study found no evidence that migrants pose a significant public health risk to countries such as the u s that have good health systems in fact migrants themselves face health threats from arduous journeys violence along the way or overcrowding in shelters or camps the lancet commission said while some may come from regions where certain diseases are common the report noted that international tourism and movement of animals spread illness too as for the caravan and other migrants from the south world bank statistics show mexico and central america vaccinate most children against measles sometimes at a bit higher rate than the u s along the border between mexico and california public health departments have long had a system in place to watch for signs of outbreaks of a variety of illnesses whether they re immigration related or not trump our southern border is now secure and will remain that way tweet tuesday trump we need border security people are pouring into our country including terrorists we have terrorists but we caught 10 terrorists these are over the last very short period of time 10 these are very serious people statement in oval office meeting the facts trump contradicted himself declaring the border secure and insecure on the same day and trump is wrong about the government recently catching 10 terrorists his statement is a mangling of federal statistics showing that u s customs and border protection stopped an average of seven to 10 people a day in the 2017 budget year who were denied entry to the u s because they were on a watch list that average applied to all points of entry and overwhelmingly from airports and was not specific to the southern border the standard for placing someone on the list is reasonable suspicion a lower bar than the probable cause needed to arrest someone for an alleged crime the statistics do not show how many might have been arrested or charged with anything in any event trump rendered a daily average as 10 recently captured terrorists in the flesh as for border security u s arrests on the mexican border jumped 78 percent in november from a year earlier to the highest level in trump s presidency increased arrests indicate that more people are trying to cross the border illegally jobs pelosi we came at a place to say how do we meet the needs of american people who have needs the economy has people are losing their jobs oval office meeting trump well we have the lowest unemployment that we ve had in 50 years oval office meeting the facts trump is correct about jobs there may always be some layoffs even if the economy is strong general motors for instance said last month it would cut as many as 14 000 workers in north america in a restructuring aimed at generating cash to spend on innovation even though u s auto sales are near historic highs but the u s economy has now added jobs for a record 98 straight months dating to october 2010 during the obama administration the labor department reported the unemployment rate in november stayed at 3 7 percent a five decade low for the third straight month the job gains are pushing down unemployment rates to historically low levels for a variety of groups the unemployment rate for men aged 20 and above fell last month to 3 3 percent the lowest in 18 years the rate for americans with just high school diplomas dropped to 3 5 percent the lowest since december 2000 the african american jobless rate declined to 5 9 percent matching may s figure as the lowest on record that s making it more challenging for businesses to find the workers they need employers have posted 7 million open jobs outnumbering the ranks of the unemployed which fell last month to just under 6 million the wall trump i often stated one way or the other mexico is going to pay for the wall this has never changed our new deal with mexico and canada the usmca is so much better than the old very costly anti usa nafta deal that just by the money we save mexico is paying for the wall tweet thursday the facts this is a face saving statement to mask the fact that mexico refused to pay for a u s border wall trump gave up trying to make it do so and u s taxpayers are on the hook for it in essence trump is arguing that new terms of trade with mexico will increase economic growth in the u s and produce more tax revenue that s what everyone hopes trade agreements will do as part of that he hopes for a lower trade deficit with mexico neither outcome is assured the deal negotiated with mexico and canada is an update of the north american free trade agreement he railed against not a transformative pact the three countries will continue trading in an environment of mainly low or no tariffs with improvements here and there for all three partners there is no credible way for trump to forecast additional growth covering costs that are being charged to u s taxpayers if the wall is built trade balances depend on too many factors consumer tastes exchange rates overall economic performance and the choices of thousands of companies among them and some are well outside any government s control trump specifically promised in the campaign that mexico would pay for the wall that is not the same as trying to reduce the u s trade deficit which is about the exchange of goods and services among private entities rather than payments between governments nor is a trade deficit necessarily a penalty on consumers it is the result of consumers buying things made in another country he wants some 25 billion from congress for wall construction over five years and promises a partial government shutdown if he does not get a 5 billion or so portion in the next week congress may or may not give him that if it does it will not be because lawmakers expect a refund to the treasury in future years from extra growth produced by a trade deal trump tremendous amounts of wall have already been built statement in meeting tuesday with pelosi and schumer trump people do not yet realize how much of the wall including really effective renovation has already been built we have already built large new sections fully renovated others making them like new tweets the facts tremendous portions of the wall have not been built yes some barrier renovation has happened but little wall construction has been completed under trump congress allocated roughly 1 4 billion in the spring a bit more than 5 percent of what trump wanted for border security and specified that the money was not to be used for construction of the prototype wall sections that stand near san diego instead the money is to strengthen or replace existing fencing with more secure fencing altogether trump promised in the campaign that he d build a 1 000 mile 1 600 kilometer wall as high as 40 feet or 12 meters and have mexico pay for it which isn t happening if some 650 miles 1 050 km of existing fencing are considered in the equation that leaves him with about 350 miles 560 km of wall to build

by yaleglobal online vietnam s communist party takes an unorthodox path to a market economy but may need to move beyond the party state for full potential by börje ljunggren for us president donald trump his second summit with north korea s kim jong un was reality check rather than success for host vietnam though the summit was undoubtedly a grand triumph the country s rapid economic development and deft diplomacy gained unprecedented spotlight while a recent cybersecurity law and detentions of regime critics went unnoticed vietnam accomplished a lot with trump meeting with president and party secretary nguyễn phú trong trump said that he felt very good about having this summit in vietnam because you really are an example of what can happen with good thinking he added that vietnam is thriving like few places on earth and emerging as a model for north korea the two men oversaw the signing of 20 billion in commercial trade deals good ties with the us also enhance vietnam s security situation china s growing strength is making it increasingly important for hanoi to hedge and the united states is the natural counterweight despite the devastating vietnam war ending in 1975 during which more than 2 1 2 million us soldiers served in the country in the effort to prevent communism spreading beyond north vietnam vietnam has clawed its way toward more capitalism and a market system despite communist rule the country remains a party state with the leading role of the communist party written into the constitution which also states that it is the duty of the vietnamese armed forces to defend not only the country but also the party two seemingly incompatible images emerge one of a country increasingly integrated into the global economy and one of a party determined to maintain its monopoly on power in an era when social media is an integral part of everyday life the median age in vietnam is 31 so its younger generation has only heard about struggles during and after the war the decade immediately after the war was much more difficult for vietnam than foreseen the country s reunification was based on the north vietnamese model more than 2 million people left the country many as boat refugees and many of chinese ethnic origin hanoi entered into a friendship treaty with the soviet union straining sino vietnamese relations and after a period of border confrontations vietnamese troops in december 1978 entered pot pot s cambodia and removed the regime deng xiaoping s china wanting to teach hanoi a lesson launched a costly attack on vietnam s northern border regions in 1979 china mobilized more than 600 000 troops with 200 000 going into vietnam relations remained frozen for more than a decade the united states china and the association of southeast asian nations formed an unholy alliance in support of cambodia s prince sihanouk and the khmer rouge and vietnam found itself isolated and barely able to feed itself the year 1986 became a turning point with the launching of vietnam s doi moi renovation process the government de collectivized agriculture created space for private initiatives and opened the economy for trade and foreign direct investment a huge rice deficit quickly turned into a surplus and vietnam soon became the third largest rice exporter in the world in a letter in 1995 to his politburo colleagues prime minister võ văn kiệt told them not to fear the future nguyễn co thach the legendary foreign minister described 1995 as a bumper crop year vietnam normalized relations with the us entered an agreement with the eu and became a member of asean an organization originally formed in 1967 to contain vietnam and communism the past 25 years have been a period of economic and social momentum the country s foreign policy has been successful creating a conducive international environment with an economy growing by about 7 percent a year social indicators also tell an impressive story the share of the population living below the poverty line has fallen from above 50 percent in 1992 to 3 percent today with income inequality increasing without reaching extreme levels the role of foreign trade has grown dramatically the total value of the country s foreign trade today being twice as large as its gdp with foreign direct investment as a major factor in 2018 the volume of new fdi commitments equaled 8 percent of gdp seafood crude oil coffee and rice are big export items but are not enough to power the economic growth south korea s samsung investments are in a class of its own millions of smartphones are assembled at its plant in thai nguyen north of hanoi and that one with other samsung factories employ more than 150 000 workers exports from samsung s factories generate close to one fourth of vietnam s total export earnings more than us 50 billion in 2018 the dilemma is that the value added from foreign direct investments mainly labor remains low and linkages to the domestic economy remain rather weak vietnam is at the lower spectrum of the value chain fdi receives priority while reforms of state owned enterprises remain slow and small and medium sized enterprises still do not receive sufficient recognition large conglomerates like vingroup with oligarch phạm nhật vượng are more welcome and interesting startups are entering the scene but the current model does not offer sufficient space for truly dynamic domestic development two factors are crucial the quality of higher education and the communist party s attitude attracting fdi is considered more manageable than actively promoting small and medium sized enterprises with potential political implications in 2007 vietnam joined the world trade organization as asean member vietnam is part of trade agreements with japan china and south korea and in recent years negotiated a number of major free trade agreements including a bilateral agreement with south korea in 2015 and the transpacific partnership agreement tpp organized by former us president barack obama obama went out of his way to include vietnam inviting party secretary trong to the white house in 2015 trump ditched the agreement but the other 11 countries persevered and a comprehensive and progressive agreement on transpacific partnership cptpp has now entered into force vietnam and the european union also finalized an agreement in 2015 but it has not yet been approved by the european parliament as some members expressed concerns about human rights both agreements include potentially important articles about labor rights and in the eu vietnam agreement a paragraph about civil society s monitoring role suggesting that new space should be opening for labor such international economic development stands in stark contrast to the political frontier where the party shows little willingness to give up its monopoly on power party secretary trong who also chairs the military commission and last year become president of vietnam is a party builder rather than a reformist focused on strengthening party legitimacy by fighting corruption a former politburo member and oligarchs have received long prison sentences still transparency international s ranking of vietnam has fallen further the country ranked 117 out of 180 nations in 2018 demonstrating the limitations of party driven anti corruption campaign in lieu of systemic reforms in mid 2018 the government exposed its ambitions to control social media with introduction of a cyber law that led to widespread protests in january a slightly modified version became law vietnam in sharp contrast to china allows facebook and google the new law requires facebook to censor anti government content among its 38 million facebook users 40 percent of the entire population and allow authorities to access users online data the genie however is already out of the bottle the party risks deepening its image of belonging to the past rather than the future so far the party has managed its unorthodox path to a market economy but could soon face tough choices vietnam s big challenge is to venture choosing a more open way forward than china ultimately daring to move beyond the party state and realizing

excluded from the most directly comparable financial measure so calculated and presented in this regard gaap refers to generally accepted accounting principles in the united states we have provided reconciliations of the non gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures we believe the presentation of non gaap financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because these financial measures are useful for trending analyzing and benchmarking the performance and value of our business by excluding certain expenses and other items that may not be indicative of our core business operating results these non gaap financial measures allow investors to evaluate our performance from management s perspective resulting in greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by us in our financial and operational decision making facilitate comparisons with prior periods and reflect the principal basis on which management monitors financial performance facilitate comparisons with the performance of others in the post acute industry provide better transparency as to the measures used by management and others who follow our industry to estimate the value of our company and allow investors to view our financial performance and condition in the same manner as our significant landlords and lenders require us to report financial information to them in connection with determining our compliance with financial covenants we use non gaap financial measures primarily as performance measures and believe that the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to them is net income loss attributable to genesis healthcare inc we use non gaap financial measures to assess the value of our business and the performance of our operating businesses as well as the employees responsible for operating such businesses non gaap financial measures are useful in this regard because they do not include such costs as interest expense income taxes and depreciation and amortization expense which may vary from business unit to business unit depending upon such factors as the method used to finance the original purchase of the business unit or the tax law in the state in which a business unit operates by excluding such factors when measuring financial performance many of which are outside of the control of the employees responsible for operating our business units we are better able to evaluate value and the operating performance of the business unit and the employees responsible for business unit performance consequently we use these non gaap financial measures to determine the extent to which our employees have met performance goals and therefore the extent to which they may or may not be eligible for incentive compensation awards we also use non gaap financial measures in our annual budget process we believe these non gaap financial measures facilitate internal comparisons to historical operating performance of prior periods and external comparisons to competitors historical operating performance the presentation of these non gaap financial measures is consistent with our past practice and we believe these measures further enable investors and analysts to compare current non gaap measures with non gaap measures presented in prior periods although we use non gaap financial measures as financial measures to assess value and the performance of our business the use of these non gaap financial measures is limited because they do not consider certain material costs necessary to operate the business these costs include our lease expense only in the case of adjusted ebitdar the cost to service debt the depreciation and amortization associated with our long lived assets losses on early extinguishment of debt transaction costs long lived asset impairment charges federal and state income tax expenses the operating results of our discontinued businesses and the income or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests because non gaap financial measures do not consider these important elements of our cost structure a user of our financial information who relies on non gaap financial measures as the only measures of our performance could draw an incomplete or misleading conclusion regarding our financial performance consequently a user of our financial information should consider net loss attributable to genesis healthcare inc as an important measure of its financial performance because it provides the most complete measure of our performance other companies may define non gaap financial measures differently and as a result our non gaap financial measures may not be directly comparable to those of other companies non gaap financial measures do not represent net income loss as defined by gaap non gaap financial measures should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for or superior to gaap financial measures we use the following non gaap financial measures that we believe are useful to investors as key valuation and operating performance measures ebitda we believe ebitda is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because it helps investors evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the impact of our capital structure interest expense and our asset base depreciation and amortization expense from our operating results in addition covenants in our debt agreements use ebitda as a measure of financial compliance adjustments to ebitda we adjust ebitda when evaluating our performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance in the case of adjusted ebitda we believe that the presentation of adjusted ebitda when combined with gaap net loss attributable to genesis healthcare inc and ebitda is beneficial to an investor s complete understanding of our operating performance in addition such adjustments are substantially similar to the adjustments to ebitda provided for in the financial covenant calculations contained in our lease and debt agreements we adjust ebitda for the following items gain loss on early extinguishment of debt we recognize gains or losses on the early extinguishment of debt when we refinance our debt prior to its original term requiring us to write off any unamortized deferred financing fees we exclude the effect of gains or losses recorded on the early extinguishment of debt because we believe these gains and losses do not accurately reflect the underlying performance of our operating businesses other loss income we primarily use this income statement caption to capture gains and losses on the sale or disposition of assets we exclude the effect of such gains and losses because we believe they do not accurately reflect the underlying performance of our operating businesses transaction costs in connection with our acquisition and disposition transactions we incur costs consisting of investment banking legal transaction based compensation and other professional service costs we exclude acquisition and disposition related transaction costs expensed during the period because we believe these costs do not reflect the underlying performance of our operating businesses customer receivership and other related charges we excluded the non cash costs of 55 0 million and 90 9 million recorded in the three and twelve months ended december 31 2017 these non cash costs were related to customer receivership proceedings and the related respective write down of unpaid accounts receivable we believe these charges are caused by the challenging operating environment particularly for highly levered customers of our rehabilitation therapy business accordingly we believe these costs do not accurately reflect the underlying performance of our operating businesses long lived asset impairments we exclude non cash long lived asset impairment charges because we believe including them does not reflect the ongoing performance of our operating businesses additionally such impairment charges represent accelerated depreciation expense and depreciation expense is also excluded from ebitda goodwill and identifiable intangible asset impairments we exclude non cash goodwill and identifiable intangible asset impairment charges because we believe including them does not reflect the ongoing operating performance of our operating businesses severance and restructuring we exclude severance costs from planned reduction in force initiatives associated with restructuring activities intended to adjust our cost structure in response to changes in the business environment we believe these costs do not reflect the underlying performance of our operating businesses we do not exclude severance costs that are not associated with such restructuring activities losses of newly acquired constructed or divested businesses the acquisition and construction of new businesses is an element of our growth strategy many of the businesses we acquire have a history of operating losses and continue to generate operating losses in the months that follow our acquisition newly constructed or developed businesses also generate losses while in their start up phase we view these losses as both temporary and an expected component of our long term investment in the new venture we adjust these losses when computing adjusted ebitda in order to better analyze the performance of our mature ongoing business the activities of such businesses are adjusted when computing adjusted ebitda until such time as a new business generates positive adjusted ebitda the divestiture of underperforming or non strategic facilities is also an element of our business strategy we eliminate the results of divested facilities beginning in the quarter in which they become divested we view the income or losses associated with the wind down of such divested facilities as not indicative of the performance of our ongoing operating business stock based compensation we exclude stock based compensation expense because it does not result in an outlay of cash and such non cash expenses do not reflect the underlying performance of our operating businesses other items from time to time we incur costs or realize gains that we do not believe reflect the underlying performance of our operating businesses in the current reporting periods we incurred the following expenses that we believe are non recurring in nature and do not reflect ongoing operating performance of the company or our operating businesses 1 regulatory defense and related costs we exclude the costs of investigating and defending the inherited legal matters associated with prior transactions we believe these costs are non recurring in nature as they will no longer be recognized following the final settlement of these matters also we do not believe the excluded costs reflect underlying performance of our operating businesses 2 other non recurring costs in the three and twelve months ended december 31 2018 we excluded 4 5 million and 13 0 million respectively of costs attributable to the write down of receivables in our non core physician services business and the impairment of unrealized incentives associated with a government program rewarding the meaningful use of technology in delivery of healthcare this incentive was estimated to be earned and recognized between 2015 and 2016 within our physician services line of business in the three months ended december 31 2017 we excluded 0 3 million of costs incurred in connection with a settlement of disputed costs related to previously reported periods and a regulatory audit associated with acquired businesses and related to pre acquisition periods in the twelve months ended december 31 2017 we excluded 3 5 million of costs primarily incurred in connection with the removal of a non cash actuarially developed discount related to the settlement of workers compensation claims for policy years 2012 and prior we do not believe the excluded costs reflect the underlying performance of our operating businesses see the reconciliation of net loss attributable to genesis healthcare inc to ebitda and adjusted ebitda included herein adjusted ebitdar we use adjusted ebitdar as one measure in determining the value of prospective acquisitions or divestitures adjusted ebitdar is also a commonly used measure to estimate the enterprise value of businesses in the healthcare industry in addition financial covenants in our lease agreements use adjusted ebitdar

foolishly the dccc is trying to push freshman members from trump districts rightward these are mostly rural districts and the dccc as usual is making a big mistake two such districts are in iowa ia 01 whose population is 47 7 rural and ia 03 whose population is 21 1 rural both abby finkenauer in the former and cindy axne in the latter would do well to ignore the dccc and pay attention instead to fellow iowan austin frerick director of special projects at the open markets institute and author of to revive rural america we must fix our broken food system at thelast month america s agricultural system he wrote has become extractive and more and more of the profits are flowing to a few a senior official at the iowa farm bureau the nation s largest agricultural organization recently told him that most rural communities will soon disappear frerick wrote that even though the organization s nominal mission is to help farm families prosper and improve their quality of life the official seemed accepting of this fate even a bit happy about it either way he told me that nothing could be done the thing is the senior official isn t wrong the outlook for rural communities is grim there are fewer jobs than there were a generation ago and the ones that remain pay lower and lower wages america s agricultural system is predicated on an extractive model where more and more of the profits flow to a few if current trends continue rural america will soon be owned by a handful of families and corporations who will run their empires remotely with driverless tractors and poorly paid staff this decline occurred as a result of deliberate policy decisions made by politicians from both parties who favor multinational corporations at the expense of rural communities but contrary to what the senior official at the iowa farm bureau said rural america can be revived it has a future but only if we challenge who holds power in the current system and create an agricultural system that rewards meaningful work economic power is more concentrated today than at any other point in american history and nowhere is this power more apparent than in agriculture the american food supply chain from the seeds we plant to the peanut butter in our neighborhood grocery stores is concentrated in the hands of a few multinational corporations this concentrated power comes at the expense of farmers and workers because the supply processing distribution and retail networks are controlled by only a handful of firms farmers face higher costs for their inputs and lower prices for their goods in the 1980s 37 cents out of every dollar went back to the farmer today farmers take home less than 15 cents on every dollar this new economic reality forces farmers to survive on volume creating a system where only the largest farms can make a living the nation s meatpacking industry is now more concentrated than when upton sinclair wrote the jungle more than a century ago four companies two of which are foreign owned now slaughter 52 percent of all meat consumed in the united states more than twice the market share that the four largest companies held in 2002 the meat racket the secret takeover of america s food business the current system closely resembles sharecropping large corporations like tyson foods will only slaughter a farmer s chickens if he has an exclusive contract with the company in many rural communities a farmer raising animals for slaughter has the choice of selling to only one slaughterhouse and because tyson is often the only buyer in town it calls the shots dictating everything from the facilities a farmer builds on her farm to the feed she uses to the price the farmer receives for full grown chickens the farmer has very little power in this transaction and this asymmetry is a key factor in why as journalist christopher leonard documents in the current system closely resembles sharecropping large corporations like tyson foods will only slaughter a farmer s chickens if he has an exclusive contract with the company in many rural communities a farmer raising animals for slaughter has the choice of selling to only one slaughterhouse and because tyson is often the only buyer in town it calls the shots dictating everything from the facilities a farmer builds on her farm to the feed she uses to the price the farmer receives for full grown chickens the farmer has very little power in this transaction and this asymmetry is a key factor in why 71 percent of american chicken farmers live below the poverty line for slaughterhouse workers industry concentration has contributed to wage stagnation over the course of the past few decades workers at a hormel slaughterhouse in austin minnesota made 10 69 per hour in 1985 equal to 25 04 in 2018 when adjusted for inflation but 33 years later the average slaughterhouse worker makes less than 3 more meanwhile wan long the chairman and ceo of wh group the holding company of smithfield foods made 291 million in 2017 the equivalent annual wages of 10 457 slaughterhouse workers because farmers and other rural workers make less money they also spend less money within their communities creating a ripple effect that negatively impacts other local businesses as a result rural communities are hollowing out young people are leaving in droves and the folks left behind are struggling to make ends meet the recovery from the great recession was an urban phenomenon if rural communities had matched urban employment growth trends they would have added more than 850 000 new jobs but according to the u s department of agriculture rural areas still have not even recovered the jobs they lost in the recession and many never will a handful of trends reflect this loss of opportunity and the decline in living conditions medicaid now pays for more than half of the births at rural hospitals suicide rates are higher in rural america than in urban america and the gap is growing the overall violent crime rate in iowa rose by only 3 percent between 2006 and 2016 but grew by 50 percent in communities with fewer than 10 000 residents the opioid epidemic thrives from the desperation created by these economic circumstances thus it is little surprise that rural communities simmer with a resentment that contributed to the election of donald trump these faceless multinational corporations strip workers of their dignity and respect a fact that is often lost in recent discussions about economic consolidation this dynamic is not easily quantifiable but it s easy to recognize when you ask workers what they think of their employers look no further than a candy company in creston iowa that fired more than 250 workers days before christmas last year after being bought out to the company these workers were merely seen as a number on some faraway excel spreadsheet not as parents who had to go home on christmas without jobs collin peterson every year brings a new bestselling book that documents how broken the american food system is the current democratic party platform mentions agriculture and food six times each the republican party mentions them only a few times more but neither party recommends substantive changes to the current system the recently passed farm bill which received significant support from both parties in december largely maintains the status quo the crop subsidy program for example will continue to give 80 percent of all farm subsidies to the top 20 percent of american farmers it is little wonder that monopolies and corporate farms have grown more powerful at the expense of workers and family farmers beyond the farm bill the inability of either party to challenge concentrated power in the american food system is best illustrated with the meat monopolies the obama administration tried to stand up to chicken monopolies by proposing new regulations to prevent abusive behavior but cowered when the industry pushed back and if the democratic party ignored the concentration of power of the meat monopolies the republican party particularly under trump has exploited and entrenched it the trump administration recently increased the speed caps for killing lines in slaughterhouses and is considering removing them for hogs making dangerous work even more dangerous in november the administration eliminated the grain inspection packers and stockyards administration an agency under the united states department of agriculture that oversaw enforcement of antitrust law in the meatpacking business in doing so it removed one of the few safeguards for workers and small businesses in an already unbalanced marketplace america s agricultural system should allow regular folks to make a decent living producing food deliberate policy decisions caused the decline in farmers share of the food dollar and many of the same policy decisions explain why wages for slaughterhouse workers have stagnated during the past three decades reversing these decisions can help farmers slaughterhouse workers and families within the food industry and would help revive rural communities there are a number of simple actions that can help reverse the downward trajectory for example a ban on contract farming and tournament style pricing would help realign the power dynamics between chicken farmers and the large corporations that exploit them for workers capping the killing line speeds at slaughterhouses and requiring meat inspectors to be public employees would similarly realign these dynamics these actions would level the playing field for farmers workers and small businesses and restore dignity and respect to workers at all levels of the american food system but the best way to reshape america s food system to benefit rural communities is to restore competition by replacing the current pro monopoly antitrust regime in the curse of bigness antitrust in the new gilded age columbia law school professor tim wu records the enforcement history of anti monopoly laws in the united states for much of the 20th century the federal government administered an antitrust framework that sought to avoid concentrated economic power this framework helped ensure competitive balance and sparked broad economic growth that benefited workers across the economic spectrum but in the early 1980s the federal trade commission and the department of justice influenced by the work of robert bork pared back antitrust enforcement bork argued that the government must only focus on the impact of consumer prices when assessing anti competitive harm this approach known as the consumer welfare standard has resulted in less antitrust enforcement and with the assumption that larger firms can create efficiencies that lead to lower prices for consumers firms have gotten bigger and industries have become more consolidated the problem with the consumer welfare standard is that its basic premise has been disproven in mergers merger control and remedies a retrospective analysis of u s policy economist john kwoka analyzed the effects to prices after mergers after reviewing almost 200 recent mergers he found that post merger prices increased by an average of 4 3 percent thus the consumer welfare standard fails to meet its own modest goal of reducing consumer prices yet despite this evidence this broken enforcement strategy continues to be supported by both major political parties perhaps most importantly the consumer welfare standard is a misguided enforcement strategy because it does not account for the chicken farmers who are squeezed by tyson or the slaughterhouse workers whose wages have stagnated even as profits within their industry have soared it does not account for the ripple effects that harm small businesses or the communities that have been hollowed out as the industries that support them wither away and it doesn t offer relief to people like my parents who took pride in their work and were trusted by the communities that they served it is time to turn the page on this failed theory and put the anti back into antitrust
