the euro s global role in a changing world a monetary policy perspective speech by benoît cœuré member of the executive board of the ecb at the council on foreign relations new york city 15 february 2019 this year marks the 20th anniversary of the euro s creation an event which has triggered much reflection on the single currency s successes and challenges most of this commentary has rightly focused on the economic track record of the euro area the main aim of monetary union was after all to maximise the benefits of the eu s internal market and thereby shift europe onto a higher growth trajectory i will not discuss these benefits today instead i will merely say that since day one many commenters including here in the united states have predicted the imminent demise of the euro however the truth is that today three out of four people in the euro area support the euro the broadest support since its creation one should never underestimate the resilience and strength of europe s monetary union project today i would like to focus on a different aspect however the external dimension of the euro that is its international role for some europeans external factors have always formed part of the case for the single currency a currency with a global standing would not just be a symbol of european unity on the world stage it would also be a tool to project global influence following this line of thought it is no coincidence that the final push towards monetary union took place against the backdrop of the confrontational foreign economic policies of the 1980s yet by the time the euro was launched in 1999 this protective aspect of the single currency had rather disappeared from view the turn of the century was the age of the end of history when conflicts between great powers were seen as a relic of the past replaced by a widespread liberal order the notion that countries should view their currencies as tools of foreign economic policy became unfashionable as a result few politicians in europe took note that after quickly establishing itself as a global currency the euro gradually lost international standing from the mid 2000s onwards you can see this on my first slide which shows a composite index measuring the euro s international role today it stands at an historic low the euro s international role has declined since the mid 2000s index of the euro s international role percentages four quarter moving averages sources bis imf cls ilzetzki reinhart and rogoff 2017 and ecb calculations notes arithmetic average of the shares of the euro at constant exchange rates in stocks of international bonds cross border loans cross border deposits foreign exchange settlements global foreign exchange reserves and exchange rate regimes data on the share of the euro in global trade invoicing were not available those on foreign exchange settlements are at market exchange rates the latest data are for the fourth quarter of 2017 while the euro is the second most used currency by most measures it often lags behind the dollar by a wide margin you can see this on slide 2 which shows the shares of major currencies in selected measures of international currency use the euro is the world s second global currency snapshot of the international monetary system percentages sources bis imf swift gopinath 2016 and ecb calculations note data as at the fourth quarter of 2017 or latest available european policymakers have woken up to these developments there have been a series of calls in recent months for the euro to assume a stronger international role the main reason that i see for these calls relates to the growing perception of a shift in global governance from leadership built on trust and common identities what the ancient greeks called hegemonia to leadership based on arkhe hard power where policies and doctrines are imposed on others in such an environment being the issuer of a global reserve currency confers international monetary power in particular the capacity to weaponise access to the financial and payments systems as has been clear on a number of recent occasions the prospect of being shut out of major financial systems makes fines or economic sanctions markedly more threatening this shift in global governance in turn has contributed to the belief that the eu may be more exposed to the risk that the monetary power of others is not used in its best interests or is even used against it these risks are not new of course as tommaso padoa schioppa once noted the demise of the gold standard shifted monetary management away from international constraints and towards domestic priorities in padoa schioppa s words this is when monetary nationalism took over the novelty of our situation today is that these concerns extend well beyond advanced economies other nations are now seeking to raise the international profile of their currencies the renminbi for example was included in 2016 in the international monetary fund s special drawing rights sdr basket alongside the us dollar euro yen and pound sterling china recently also launched its first oil futures contract denominated in renminbi the so called petroyuan in an apparent bid to strengthen the hold of the renminbi in global energy markets there are certainly high barriers to other currencies displacing the dollar in the international financial and commodity system yet multi polar currency systems existed in the not so distant past before world war one the pound sterling the deutsche mark and the french franc all vied for global supremacy as reserve currencies and the interwar period was characterised by a sterling dollar duopoly so if history is any guide a multi polar system could well become a reality once again in fact and you can see this on slide 3 some shifts are already taking place both the euro and the dollar have lost similar ground as international reserve currencies since the global financial crisis it remains to be seen whether this is a short lived development or the beginning of a larger trend the euro and the us dollar have lost ground as international reserve currencies share of the euro and the us dollar in global foreign exchange reserves percentages sources imf and ecb calculations notes data adjusted for exchange rate valuation effects the latest observations are for the fourth quarter of 2017 so how are we as central bankers affected by these developments the ecb of course does not take a view on foreign policy questions it is not for us to decide on europe s role in the world or on which countries outside europe choose to use the euro and which do not we continue to see the global role of the euro as being primarily a market led process that said we are not indifferent to the current debate in europe for two major reasons first we see an alignment between the policies that will strengthen the euro s global role and the policies that are needed to make the euro area more robust we support efforts to improve the design of economic and monetary union emu and these efforts will also indirectly foster a stronger international role for the euro second a stronger global role for the euro may have tangible consequences for the conduct of monetary policy in my remarks this morning i would like to explain these two points in more detail policies supporting the euro s international role the decline of the euro s international role is on the face of it puzzling the euro area displays two of the fundamental elements that economists deem essential in fostering a currency s international use the first element is that it is the currency of a large economy that is comparable in economic size to that of the united states the second is that it is issued by the world s largest trading bloc these two elements featured prominently in the discussions that took place 20 years ago as to whether the euro could match the international standing of the dollar secular factors unrelated to the euro area such as the parallel rise of the renminbi have certainly played a role in stalling the euro s progress but what is also clear is that establishing an international currency is not just a matter of economic size you can see this clearly on slide 4 the united states accounts for a much smaller share of the global economy today than it did after world war ii and yet the us dollar is still by far the leading global reserve currency now like then economic size is not the only factor determining global currency use importance of the us and the us dollar in the global economy percentages sources maddison project imf weo and eichengreen mehl and chitu 2016 note share of the us in global gdp in ppp terms the last observation is for 2017 this suggests that factors specific to the euro area are likely to have prevented the euro from rising more forcefully as an international currency i see these factors as closely related to three broad shortcomings in the institutional design of the eu and emu first the ability to provide stability both domestically and internationally second the limited depth and liquidity of euro area financial markets and third europe not speaking with one voice on international matters including national security an international currency must be stable take stability first empirical research confirms that next to size and openness stability is a key determinant of international currency use but stability means different things to international investors who hold the currency as a store of value and international borrowers who use it as a financing vehicle for borrowers broadly speaking stability derives primarily from central banks monetary policy frameworks research finds that the currencies that become dominant in international financing are the ones whose central bank actively pursues an inflation stabilisation policy that protects borrowers real debt burdens to deliver this stability central bank independence is crucial that aspect was highlighted in 2011 by the us treasury secretary timothy geithner in the context of the renminbi becoming part of the imf s sdr basket for investors stability mainly comes from a currency s ability to act as a safe haven in times of global financial stress this is what some have coined the exorbitant duty of international currency status which offsets the exorbitant privilege in crisis times since it leads to negative wealth effects for the currency issuer theoretical work suggests that investors are more likely to perceive sovereign debt as safe if the fundamentals of the issuer are strong relative to other possible issuers but not necessarily strong on an absolute basis this may explain for example why investors did not rebalance away from us treasuries throughout the global financial crisis despite the stark deterioration in the united states fiscal position for currency unions however absolute fundamentals arguably matter more the reason is that in the absence of a common consolidated balance sheet sovereign debt exhibits a higher degree of credit risk than it does in economies that can pursue their own monetary policy public debt can therefore behave like private debt when risk aversion rises this fact was not unknown the idea of the euro was always that a credible set of fiscal rules would ensure that national sovereign debt would be safe but the euro area debt crisis exposed flaws in the design of our monetary union with the crisis the number of aaa rated euro area sovereigns fell from eight to three today aaa rated euro area sovereign debt amounts to just 10 of gdp in the united states it is more than 70 you can see this on slide 5 the supply of euro area safe assets has declined and is small relative to the us outstanding amount of aaa rated debt securities issued by euro area central governments eur billions sources oecd government statistics and ecb staff calculations notes outstanding amounts at market value the blue bars in the chart report debt securities issued that are rated aaa aaa both by standard and poor s and moody s local currency long term debt rating totals for 2007 includes austria finland france germany ireland luxembourg the netherlands and spain totals for 2018 include germany luxembourg and the netherlands debt securities issued by central governments 2018 as percent of gdp sources oecd government statistics imf weo and ecb staff calculations notes outstanding amounts at market value for the euro area publicly held treasury securities outstanding for the us see the preceding footnote for definitions of the rating universe but europe has learnt its lesson considerable efforts have been made in recent years to improve the euro area governance framework and work is still ongoing we now have a single supervisor for large banks a single framework for resolving failing institutions a single fund to finance those resolution activities and soon a single backstop for that fund we have also established the european stability mechanism which provides a safety net for sovereigns threatened with losing market access provided that they implement sound economic policies but for the euro to act as a true effective hedge in times of stress and therefore to attain and maintain international status we need to further strengthen the fiscal dimension of emu sound fiscal and structural policies are needed to provide international investors with what they need most a large and elastic supply of safe assets the fact that the supply of euro denominated safe assets can shrink at precisely the time when demand for such assets is rising has not been lost on investors it is likely a dominant factor keeping the euro from having a stronger international role we know that the journey towards a true european safe asset one that does not vanish on rainy days will be long and full of perils while progressing towards this objective we should thus also focus our efforts on upgrading the credit quality of outstanding liabilities which can only be achieved if governments make public debt more sustainable by committing to credible fiscal rules the need for deeper and more liquid capital markets the second and related shortcoming of emu is the segmentation of its capital markets deep and liquid financial markets are fundamental to a currency s ability to attain international status they reduce transaction costs making the currency more attractive for international financing and settlement and as more liquid markets mitigate rollover risk they are perceived as safer by investors this is not just theory recent research shows that capital market depth was critical in helping the us dollar to catch up with and then overtake the pound sterling in the first half of the last century financial deepening was by far the most important contributor to the increase in the share of dollar denominated international bonds issued between 1918 and 1932 its impact dwarfed that of economic size or credibility european capital markets appeared to be becoming more integrated and hence deeper prior to 2008 but this impression was based more on price convergence than on real cross border integration you can see this clearly on slide 6 which shows composite indicators of euro area financial integration produced by the ecb the quantity based indicator remains at about half of its pre crisis peak and at very low levels in absolute terms financial fragmentation has weighed on the euro s global standing financial integration in the euro area indices source ecb notes the price based composite indicator aggregates ten indicators covering the period from the first quarter of 1995 to the fourth quarter of 2017 while the quantity based composite indicator aggregates five indicators available from the first quarter of 1999 to the third quarter of 2017 the indicators are bounded between zero full fragmentation and one full integration increases in the indicators signal greater financial integration for a detailed description of the indicators and their input data see ecb 2018 financial integration in europe frankfurt am main the latest data are for the third quarter of 2018 cyclical factors and the doom loop between euro area banks and sovereigns have certainly aggravated market segmentation but the underlying reasons for it are structural capital markets in europe are still fragmented along national lines since various legal and institutional barriers hinder the creation of a single pool of liquidity this is precisely why policymakers have now put their weight behind the capital markets union cmu project but progress remains too slow we at the ecb see cmu as a key priority for the next european commission and parliament the ecb has been complementing these efforts by upgrading its payment system infrastructure which contributes to market integration and in turn to the depth and liquidity of euro area securities markets recent initiatives include the successful launch of our securities settlement platform target2 securities a new platform for instant payments and the upgrade of our large value transactions target system in time these systems may offer international market participants easier access to our currency international currencies carry a security premium the third and final factor that is likely to have held back the international role of the euro relates to the eu s ability to speak with one voice on international affairs i will venture very warily into what is certainly not central bankers territory but empirical evidence supports the view that the us dollar benefits from a substantial security premium nations that depend on the us security umbrella hold a disproportionate share of their foreign reserves in dollars global geopolitical outreach matters for international currency status predicted share of the us dollar in the foreign exchange reserves of selected countries percentages source eichengreen b a mehl and l chiţu 2019 note the figures show the predicted shares of the us dollar in the foreign reserve holdings of five countries which depend on the us security umbrella predicted shares are computed under two scenarios i using estimates from a model restricted to standard economic determinants of international currency choice shown as yellow bars and ii using estimates from a model expanded to include the effect on international currency choice of the countries nato membership shown as red bars actual us dollar shares are shown as blue bars the actual dollar shares are based on publicly available estimates for the year 1987 korea 2004 germany 2006 japan 2007 saudi arabia and 2016 taiwan see eichengreen et al 2019 for further details on the sources for the data you can see this on slide 7 a model restricted to economic factors the yellow bars under predicts by a wide margin the dollar reserves of countries dependent on the united states for their security a model including their nato membership the red bars comes much closer to the actual shares by one estimate military alliances boost the share of a currency in the partner country s foreign reserve holdings by about 30 percentage points this is not a new phenomenon during the late 19th century a growing share of deutsche marks in austria hungary s reserves went hand in hand with the triple alliance i e the secret agreement between germany austria hungary and italy signed in 1882 and renewed periodically until world war i the increasing importance of french francs in russia s reserves in the years after the franco russian alliance of 1894 reflected similar security patterns of course this aspect of a currency s international status extends beyond emu but it has a clear implication for policymakers europe already exerts global leadership in regulatory competition and trade domains european initiatives to foster cooperation on security and defence to speak with one voice on international affairs and in short to further assert global leadership might also help promote the euro s global outreach the monetary policy consequences of a greater international role for the euro now one important aspect that is often overlooked in the debate about strengthening the international role of the euro is what it would mean for the ecb s monetary policy this is what i would now like to discuss as i see it the monetary policy relevance of an international currency has probably increased over time on account of both the evolution of the international monetary system itself and the way central banks implement monetary policy today in particular at the zero lower bound more specifically i see three broad implications for the conduct and transmission of our monetary policy all of which we would need to understand and take into account when defining the appropriate stance for the euro area first is the effect on exchange rate pass through this is in part mechanical the more the domestic currency is used for trade invoicing the less the pass through to import prices in the face of fluctuations in the exchange rate this holds not only over the short run when prices are sticky but also over the long run when they are adjusted by producers the tight correlation between domestic currency invoicing and exchange rate pass through is evident in the euro area as you can see on the left hand chart of slide 8 euro area countries with a greater share of imports invoiced in euro those on the south east corner of the chart are more insulated from fluctuations in the euro exchange rate and have lower pass through to import prices international currency status lowers exchange rate pass through exchange rate pass through to import prices vs euro invoicing across euro area countries source the international role of the euro ecb july 2015 notes long run exchange rate pass through is estimated using a standard log linear regression model of the quarterly log change in import price unit values on the quarterly changes of the standard broad measure of the neer 38 of the euro a quarterly effective measure of inflation in production costs of the euro area s major trading partners and the quarterly log change in industrial production excluding construction the estimation sample spans the time period from the first quarter of 2000 to the last quarter of 2014 the share of euro invoicing reported on the x axis is the average over the sample period the black line is a fitted regression line exchange rate pass through to euro area import prices in response to a monetary policy shock percent source ecb calculations based on casas et al 2017 note the figure plots the impulse response of import prices to a negative 25 basis point cut in the short term interest rate leading to 1 depreciation in the exchange rate under local currency euro pricing and dominant currency dollar pricing obtained in a calibrated small open economy model the degree of pass through in turn has a strong influence on the transmission of shocks which has differing implications for monetary policy on the one hand lower pass through means that import prices are better shielded from exogenous exchange rate shocks and monetary policy can focus more on domestic sources of inflationary pressures as of today more than 90 of us imports are invoiced in us dollars by comparison less than 50 of extra euro area imports are invoiced in euro if this share were to increase to say 70 the sensitivity of import prices to exchange rate movements would decline by around one third on the other hand the effect of domestic monetary policy on import prices is more limited when pass through is low you can see this on the right hand chart which plots simulations from a calibrated model of the exchange rate pass through clearly increased local currency pricing would in principle attenuate an important lever of monetary policy but it is also true that in the euro area exchange rate pass through has already notably declined over the past two decades mainly due to the declining share of commodity imports and the increasing role of global value chains you can see this on slide 9 today the pass through to final consumer price inflation may be less than a third of what it was at the beginning of the century there has been a marked decline in exchange rate pass through over time exchange rate pass through to hicp inflation percent sources eurostat and ecb staff calculations notes the chart shows the cumulated impulse response dark blue line of hicp inflation to a 1 appreciation in the neer after three years over time and the respective 95 confidence bands light blue lines the cumulated impulse response is based on the updated estimation of hahn 2003 over a 20 year rolling window from the first quarter of 1980 to the first quarter of 2016 each point on the dark blue line refers to the end point of each 20 year rolling sample with the first sample referring to the period from the second quarter of 1981 to the first quarter of 2000 and the last sample to the period from the second quarter of 1996 to the first quarter of 2016 the second way in which an international currency is relevant for monetary policy is its effect on interest rates in principle international currency issuers enjoy greater monetary autonomy central banks in small open economies for example are typically more heavily exposed to foreign spillovers in setting interest rates than those presiding over an internationally dominant currency but international currencies are not isolated from foreign spillovers greater external demand for euro area securities for instance can increase the influence of foreign factors on domestic monetary and financial conditions for example in periods of global stress investors rush to the safety and liquidity of dollar denominated securities thereby compressing term premia these effects however are typically temporary and policymakers can hence afford to look through such volatility other effects may prove more durable however the past experience of the federal reserve highlights these challenges it is well documented that the large demand for us securities by foreign central banks in the run up to the financial crisis contributed to the decline in longer term us interest rates thereby in part offsetting the parallel tightening efforts by the federal open market committee in other words the effects of such purchases by foreign central banks do not fundamentally differ from those of domestic central banks which purchase assets as part of their efforts to stimulate the economy quantitative easing it is not that these effects are completely absent in the euro area today as the second most important reserve currency demand from foreign central banks can also be expected to have affected euro area financing conditions but there is a difference and it is due to a distinctive feature of the euro area which i have already highlighted the lack of a single safe asset we have seen foreign demand driving a wedge between sovereign bond yields in the euro area specifically foreign central banks currently hold more than 40 of their euro reserves in german government bonds well above germany s share of total outstanding euro denominated sovereign bonds which is around 15 the implication is that efforts to improve the stability of our currency union could be expected to lead to a more even distribution of reserve demand effects across the euro area this by itself would benefit the transmission of our monetary policy the final monetary policy implication of a stronger international role for the euro is that spillovers and spillbacks through international trade and finance would probably be larger there are two broad channels to consider here the first is that the increased use of the euro as an international funding currency would amplify the so called international risk taking channel of monetary policy which operates through international bank leverage as you can see on my last slide the risk taking channel is strong for the united states international currency status increases monetary policy spillovers strong link between us dollar movements and international dollar lending sources bis and ecb staff calculations notes growth in us dollar lending refers to quarterly changes in cross border loans and deposits in us dollars of bis reporting banks neer stands for nominal effective exchange rate positive changes indicate a dollar appreciation the sample period is q1 2002 q3 2015 as in avdjiev koch and shin 2017 the black line is a fitted regression line when monetary policy eases the us dollar depreciates and international lending in dollars grows because emerging market borrowers balance sheets look stronger in dollar terms which encourages lenders to provide them with dollar denominated credit second if the euro were used more for trade among third countries a depreciation of the euro would make all euro denominated exports cheaper from euro area and non euro area firms alike this would cause an increase in global trade with potentially positive spillbacks and since the euro area is more open to trade than the united states the spillbacks to it could even be larger than those to the united states the flipside is that central banks in smaller economies not least in emerging market economies could turn more frequently to the ecb for currency swap lines when the tide turns i e if and when monetary policy is tightened and the availability of international liquidity in euro dries up the ecb would then be called on to increase its activities as an international lender of last resort any extension of the global network of currency swap lines would however have to be based on sound monetary arguments central banks are mindful of global financial stability but they always act in full discretion and within domestic mandates conclusion it is time for me to conclude the decline in the euro s international role in recent years is primarily a symptom of the initial fault lines in economic and monetary union there is thus a close alignment between the policies that will strengthen the euro s global role and the policies that are needed to make the euro area more robust the ecb continues to see the global role of the euro as being primarily a market led process nevertheless we support efforts to overcome the shortcomings in the design of our monetary union and these efforts will also indirectly foster a stronger international role for the euro at the same time a stronger global role for the euro may have tangible consequences for the conduct of monetary policy all of which we would need to understand and take into account when designing the common monetary policy for the euro area but provided the right economic policies are adopted a stronger global role of the euro could help facilitate the transmission of monetary policy across euro area financial markets and reduce perilous fragmentation thank you
overview the s p 500 snapped a four day advance yesterday and equities in the asia pacific followed suit all the markets in the region were lower but in australia msci s regional benchmark stalled after reached a four month high in the middle of the week european markets were mostly higher in the morning session after slipping yesterday including today s gains the dow jones stoxx 600 has risen in 11 of the past 14 sessions and has only fallen one week so far this year for almost an 8 gain it is about 2 below its 200 day moving average benchmark 10 year bond yields eased moved lower in the asia pacific region after rates fell in the us yesterday european bond markets are mixed with core yields mostly a little lower and peripheral yields firmer led by italy the us 10 year yield fell five basis points yesterday after the dismal retail sales report the us dollar is firmer against most of the major currencies and on the week only australian and new zealand dollars resisted the draw among emerging market currencies the thai baht and brazilian real were the only ones to buck the broader greenback advance asia pacific china reported softer than expected inflation but record aggregate financing january ppi rose 0 1 year over year down from 0 9 it is the lowest in a couple of years and led by a decline in raw material prices consumer prices unexpectedly eased to 1 7 from 1 9 soft price pressures play into the economic slowdown story however a slowing of food price inflation from 2 5 to 2 0 was the main weight on the cpi as non food prices were steady at 1 7 nevertheless many expect the pboc to ease monetary policy through another reduction in the reserves requirements though a rate cut cannot be entirely ruled out either separately china reported a surge in lending aggregate financing jumped to cny4 64 trillion a record from cny1 59 in december new bank loans cny3 23 trillion from cny1 08 trillion in december drove this but the difference between new bank loans and aggregate financing is a rough and ready metric of the shadow banking sector officials had been squeezing it but now seem to have backed off in an attempt to support the economy activity in the shadow banking sector increased for the first time in eleven months japan reported q4 gdp yesterday 0 3 after a 0 7 contraction in q3 and this rendered today s final december industrial output 0 1 moot the mof weekly portfolio flow data showed japanese investors continue to buy foreign bonds in the first six weeks of 2019 they bought an average of jpy640 bln a week during the same period in 2018 there were net sellers of an average of jpy45 5 bln japanese have sold foreign equities at a slightly slower pace than last year jpy190 bln average vs jpy245 bln foreign investors have bought an average of jpy512 bln a week of japanese bonds sellers in the first six weeks of 2018 of an average jpy169 bln foreign investors have been set sellers of japanese equities after having been small buyers at the start of last year the new zealand dollar is the big winner this week if sustained the 1 5 advance this week would be the largest in three months it comes on the back of a central bank that was less dovish than the market had expected however we suspect the market s reaction is exaggerated the january pmi hints at why the headline eased to 53 1 from 54 8 but most troubling was the slump in new orders to 13 month lows the us dollar is little changed against the yen after slipped to a four day low just above jpy110 25 there are options for about 3 bln struck at jpy109 95 jpy11000 that expire today initial resistance is pegged near jpy110 60 now the us dollar recorded new 2019 highs yesterday near jpy111 15 the australian dollar is also little changed it has spent the week straddling the 0 7100 level the us dollar gained 0 4 against the chinese yuan during the first week since the lunar new year holiday to close onshore at cny6 7745 europe while there may have been some seasonal distortion uk retail sales strongly surprised on the upside in january economists forecast around a 0 2 gain but instead a 1 2 rise was reported excluding fuel it appears uk shoppers were drawn by deep discounts for clothing where sales rose 2 1 on the other hand and despite discounts department stores and household goods purchases slumped 4 4 the largest decline in a little more than a year and a half the eurozone reported december trade figures since q4 gdp has already been reported it did not attract much attention it was little changed at slightly more than 15 bln euros we looked at the 12 month moving average to smooth out the month to month noise and see the large picture it peaked at the end of 2016 near 22 bln euros the 12 month average last year was about 16 2 bln euros a 25 decline spain s cabinet meeting is continuing now but the outcome is expected to be an election announcement for mid april the minority socialist government was unable to get parliament s approval for its budget proposal political jitters may see the premium spain offers over germany to widen and short term participants may look to sell spain against portugal but medium and longer term investors may see any meaningful underperformance of spain as a new buying opportunity the euro has been straddling 1 13 this week though so far today is the first day this week that it has not poked above 1 13 note that the euro has not posted a weekly close below 1 13 since june 2017 there are two sets of options expiring today one is struck at 1 1275 for about 710 mln euros and the other is at 1 1250 for almost 750 mln euros look for north america try to push it lower as many short term participants see the fed s soma operations system open market account that drains liquidity today as being dollar friendly sterling is consolidating its recent losses by trading in a narrow range above yesterday s lows just above 1 28 it has fallen about 1 this week and is the third consecutive weekly loss there is an option for around gbp245 mln at 1 2790 that expires today america this round of us china trade talks is ending the press is playing up the lack of visible signs of progress but it is not clear what it expected although there is the early march deadline it has seemed likely for more than a week that an extension was probable and the xi and trump would meet before the tariff freeze ended there are some rumors that china sought a 90 day extension but the us is favoring 60 days we had previously suggested a 30 day extension seemed reasonable many recognize that china will be reluctant to capitulate to all of the us demands a sense that trump wants to avoid another december like meltdown in stocks secure a political victory and is focused on short term transactional goals makes an agreement likely of course the longer term strategic competition remains president trump s claim of emergency powers to secure funding for the wall on the mexican border will likely face a legal challenge trump has done a good job of moving on issues that are important to his constituency and even if he loses the legal challenge he will make it 2020 rallying cry while it is a focus of domestic politics it does not seem to be much of a market factor the us reports a series of economic data today but nothing will change the general view industrial production and manufacturing output soared in december and likely stagnated in january the december treasury international capital report is not a market mover it will be interesting though to see how investors shifted portfolios during the record bloodbath at the end of last year february data is more interesting and relevant it comes in the form of the empire state manufacturing survey look for modest improvement and the university of michigan consumer sentiment survey small improvement is expected here too canada reports its portfolio flows and january existing home sales looking for the fifth consecutive decline the us dollar is consolidating yesterday s gains against the canadian dollar that brought it to cad1 3340 its highest level in a few weeks there is a nearly 800 mln option at cad1 3275 that expires today and could be in play the pair is little changed on the week the mexican peso is off about 1 this week as political jitters and heavier em in general took a toll previous dollar resistance near mxn19 20 now serves as support the dollar index is up about 0 5 for the week and has held above 97 00 today the cyclical high from the end of last year was near 97 70

number of fronts and reported higher earnings for the quarter our results were hurt by higher costs for raw materials and logistics as well by customer concerns over tariffs and trade policies said samuel r allen chairman and chief executive officer these latter issues have weighed on market sentiment and caused farmers to become more cautious about making major purchases at the same time sales

cogwriter the mainstream media msm realizes that the us has a lot of debt but pushes the false notion that it should not be a real concern the federal debt is rising concern is not february 15 2019 washington the federal debt ticked past 22 trillion this week a record that comes despite continued economic growth but neither political party appears to be making a priority of debt reduction larry kudlow the director of president trump s national economic council said on thursday that the president was concerned about the rise of the debt and that the administration would propose some reductions in federal spending in its next budget but he said the scale of the debt was not a problem the government s borrowing has real costs notably the need to make interest payments to investors why the 22 trillion national debt doesn t matter here s what you should worry about instead the u s federal government s debt load hit another milestone this month it s now a record us 22 trillion in nominal terms that s 67 000 for every man woman and child living in the u s and it s up 2 trillion since president donald trump took office in 2017 for comparison u s debt is more than the total size of the united states 20 trillion economy and equivalent to the gross domestic products of china japan and germany combined i believe it is worth asking whether we should even care about the size of government debt default isn t imminent first of all it s important to note current u s debt levels do not indicate any risk of imminent default why it s irrelevant although 22 trillion is a large number it is essentially irrelevant to proper thinking about the economic role of the u s government or about responsible fiscal policy the real burden to worry about yet the 22 trillion on balance sheet debt is likely to woefully underestimate the federal government s true liabilities and its potential demand on the economy s resources the national debt is the government s formal commitment to repay its creditors but uncle sam has many other commitments for future spending that are not on the books so called off balance sheet liabilities such liabilities do not show up in standard debt measures economist jim hamilton has recently estimated that such off balance sheet liabilities could exceed 70 trillion more than three times the the current value of outstanding treasury securities while the msm sees some concerns they tend to consider them irrelevant as well as manageable that being said not all secular sources agree here is something from peter schiff peter schiff the president and ceo of euro pacific capital and one of the few who predicted the 2008 great recession before it happened has said that what we are experiencing now is the beginning of the end schiff made his comments during his keynote speech at the vancouver resource investment conference the economic guru says that the federal reserve has made the decision to halt interest rate hikes in order to attempt to save the flailing stock market peter traces the moves of the federal reserve all the way back to the first rate hike of december 2015 and shows how the central bank has put the united states on a path toward a financial crisis that will be bigger than 2008 peter insists he s been right about what would happen all along it s just taken us a little longer to get to the actual financial disaster than he expected the reason that i originally said that i did not expect the fed to raise rates again was because i knew that raising rates was the first step in a journey that they could not finish that in their attempt to normalize rates the stock market bubble would burst and the economy would reenter recession normalizing interest rates when you ve created an abnormal amount of debt is impossible i knew all along that at some point that would be it you know the straw that breaks the camel s back i didn t know how many rate hikes the bubble economy could take but i knew there was a limit and i still knew that there s no way they were ever going to get back up to normal or neutral whatever that number is it ain t 2 peter schiff people are going to realize that we checked into the monetary roach motel that i talked about from the beginning and that there s no way out and then the dollar is going to fall like a stone when they find out that it s never over and it didn t work then there s going to be nothing propping up the dollar and it s going to drop like a stone the price of gold is going to take off and the recession that we re entering into which is going to be an inflationary recession is going to be worse than what we now call the great recession maybe it s taken longer than we might have thought to play out but this is the beginning of the end peter schiff despite some issues that peter schiff has had he is correct that normalizing interest rates is virtually impossible as the debt of the us cannot sustain interest payments at historically normal rates 5 10 some in the alternative media have indicated that only a financial reset can save the us the continuing church of god ccog put together the following video on our bible news prophecy youtube channel related to some reset talk here is a link to the sermonette video financial reset by 2022 anyway the debt situation is serious in case anyone is still unaware government debt is out of control it doubled under president obama and it is anticipated to increase for 50 percent in the next ten years it s not just the repayment of debt that presents a potential crisis it s the interest payments with a clear correlation between government debt and diminished growth a natural first step would be for the government to ease its deficit spending on programs such medicaid social security and medicare to decrease the waste inherent in some of these programs interest rates are expected to rise to 1 trillion during the next decade that is more than the us spends each year on medicaid and its military it will cost 55 000 per household over the next ten years just to service debt the once great country of america appears to be on the decline paralyzed by mounting debts it cannot handle at of january foreign investors own 6 35 trillion in us bonds with china and japan the largest investors with a total of 2 trillion when the demand for treasury bonds decreases the federal reserve will need to increase interest rates which increases the cost of borrowing at this moment i consider the above scenario overly optimistic cf habakkuk 2 6 8 as usa debt rises the us federal reserve may again need to raise interest rates in order to sell the debt normally in forms of us treasury bills bonds this puts more pressure on the debt and the ability to repay it shortly after becoming us president barack obama said that the levels of deficit spending that the usa was engaging in was unsustainable something that is unsustainable cannot continue indefinitely the rise of usa debt is unsustainable but the politicians seem to not be that concerned the rise of us debt was listed by me as number 11 of 19 items to prophetically watch in 2019 here is a link to a related sermon 19 items to watch in 2019 the anglo american world order will come to an end accumulation of debt and then having to pay historically normal interest rates will strain the national economies of the usa uk and canada more than almost anyone will believe it will be a financial crisis beyond what most pundits would consider possible those who think the debt is of no real concern and that current world order with the usa s dollar on top will last until the end of this century are in error repentance is needed the usa and its anglo saxon allies will not last to the end of this century watch also end of the anglo american order the bible teaches that debt is a curse 15 but it shall come to pass if you do not obey the voice of the lord your god to observe carefully all his commandments and his statutes which i command you today that all these curses will come upon you and overtake you 43 the alien who is among you shall rise higher and higher above you and you shall come down lower and lower 44 he shall lend to you but you shall not lend to him he shall be the head and you shall be the tail 45 moreover all these curses shall come upon you and pursue and overtake you until you are destroyed 47 because you did not serve the lord your god with joy and gladness of heart for the abundance of everything 48 therefore you shall serve your enemies whom the lord will send against you in hunger in thirst in nakedness and in need of everything and he will put a yoke of iron on your neck until he has destroyed you 49 the lord will bring a nation against you from afar from the end of the earth as swift as the eagle flies a nation whose language you will not understand 50 a nation of fierce countenance which does not respect the elderly nor show favor to the young 51 and they shall eat the increase of your livestock and the produce of your land until you are destroyed they shall not leave you grain or new wine or oil or the increase of your cattle or the offspring of your flocks until they have destroyed you 52 they shall besiege you at all your gates until your high and fortified walls in which you trust come down throughout all your land and they shall besiege you at all your gates throughout all your land which the lord your god has given you deuteronomy 28 15 42 45 47 52 it needs to be understood that some of the cursings in the old testament of the bible are clearly to occur at the latter time of the end evil will befall you in the latter days because you will do evil in the sight of the lord to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands deuteronomy 31 29 and since national repentance has not occurred these matters will worsen 18 and after all this if you do not obey me then i will punish you seven times more for your sins 19 i will break the pride of your power i will make your heavens like iron and your earth like bronze 20 and your strength shall be spent in vain for your land shall not yield its produce nor shall the trees of the land yield their fruit 26 when i have cut off your supply of bread ten women shall bake your bread in one oven and they shall bring back your bread by weight and you shall eat and not be satisfied 27 and after all this if you do not obey me but walk contrary to me 28 then i also will walk contrary to you in fury and i even i will chastise you seven times for your sins 29 you shall eat the flesh of your sons and you shall eat the flesh of your daughters 30 i will destroy your high places cut down your incense altars and cast your carcasses on the lifeless forms of your idols and my soul shall abhor you 31 i will lay your cities waste and bring your sanctuaries to desolation and i will not smell the fragrance of your sweet aromas 32 i will bring the land to desolation and your enemies who dwell in it shall be astonished at it 33 i will scatter you among the nations and draw out a sword after you your land shall be desolate and your cities waste 34 then the land shall enjoy its sabbaths as long as it lies desolate and you are in your enemies land then the land shall rest and enjoy its sabbaths 35 as long as it lies desolate it shall rest for the time it did not rest on your sabbaths when you dwelt in it leviticus 26 18 20 26 35 a prophecy in habakkuk 2 shows that god teaches that you should pay attention to the rising debt 2 then the lord answered me and said write the vision and make it plain on tablets that he may run who reads it 3 for the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the end it will speak and it will not lie though it tarries wait for it because it will surely come it will not tarry 5 indeed because he transgresses by wine he is a proud man 6 will not all these take up a proverb against him and a taunting riddle against him and say woe to him who increases what is not his how long and to him who loads himself with many pledges 7 will not your creditors rise up suddenly will they not awaken who oppress you and you will become their booty 8 because you have plundered many nations all the remnant of the people shall plunder you because of men s blood and the violence of the land and the city and of all who dwell in it habakkuk 2 2 3 5 6 8 the above prophecy will be fulfilled at the time of the end cf the message was true but the appointed time was long in the latter days for the vision refers to many days yet to come daniel 10 1 14 daniel 8 19 11 27 29 35 use the same hebrew term for appointed time as habakkuk 2 3 while daniel 10 using a different term ties the latter days to the time in daniel 8 19 habakkuk 2 was not fulfilled in its entirety anciently notice that those who read the above should take action this is the opposite of the general position of the msm mainstream media that there is nothing to be concerned about time

company completed the previously announced sale of the gualcamayo mine in argentina to mineros s a the company received consideration with a total value of approximately 85 million which includes cash proceeds of 30 million 30 million in additional payments related to the advancement of the deep carbonates project and royalties related to metal production at gualcamayo and the deep carbonates project the consideration received offers significant upside in the case of new oxide discoveries higher gold prices and or development of the deep carbonates project thereby preserving considerable optionality the transaction also includes an option for mineros to acquire up to a 51 interest in the la pepa project in chile the company s exploration programs continue to deliver on mineral resources discovery and mineral reserve replacement and growth the exploration program successfully increased gold mineral reserves to replace 2018 mineral depletion excluding assets that were disposed of in 2018 on the same basis measured and indicated gold mineral resources and inferred mineral resources increased by 5 and 7 respectively for silver mineral reserves decreased 3 measured and indicated mineral resources decreased 4 and inferred mineral resources decreased 3 for copper mineral reserves increased 6 measured and indicated mineral resources increased 55 and inferred mineral resources increased 211 the balance sheet as at december 31 2018 includes cash and cash equivalents of 98 5 million with available credit of 705 0 million for total liquidity of 803 5 million net debt 4 as at december 31 2018 was 1 66 billion daniel racine yamana s president and chief executive officer commented as follows in 2018 we achieved another year of exceeding our production guidance for all metals and at costs better than or in line with our guidance gold and copper exceeded the increased guidance levels we announced in october while silver production exceeded the guidance that was lowered at that time our operational performance would not have been possible without our success in delivering cerro moro on time and on budget and exceeding expectations on both production and costs through the first six months of commercial production throughout the year we also advanced several strategic initiatives including closing the sale of the canadian malartic exploration properties the gualcamayo mine and completion of the business combination between brio gold and leagold in addition to the ongoing evaluation and engagement in discussions relating to scenarios to develop agua rica overall we remain in a strong position to carry the company s health and safety operational and balance sheet momentum into 2019 development optimization and strategic initiatives chapada the company continues to advance its exploration program with the objective of identifying higher grade copper and gold opportunities that are near the chapada mine completing infill drilling of the sucupira and baru deposits which would lead to a pit expansion and advancing district scale targets mineralization has been identified along a 15 kilometre trend with numerous prospective areas under consideration for further drilling infill drilling in the baru area is expected to reduce stripping ratios for the sucupira deposit and drilling on oxide mineralization such as hidrotermalito brings the potential for heap leaching opportunities that could complement the suruca oxides project notwithstanding the focus on the exploration potential to discover higher grade copper and gold areas the company has also advanced other projects that are expected to further enhance returns from the chapada mine to this end the company has completed studies and evaluations on several of the development opportunities at chapada and has embarked on a feasibility level review of a three phase plan at chapada these opportunities range in scope from plant optimization initiatives to enhance copper and gold recoveries to plant expansions to bring forward cash flows and pit wall pushbacks to expose higher grade zones the study and evaluations include third party design and engineering estimates of capital expenses production and operating cost forecasts given the nature of the opportunities the projects can be considered on their own or as part of a phased development plan this flexibility in approach allows the company to balance the maximization of value at chapada with the allocation of capital across the broader company portfolio the phase 1 plant optimization work with expected recovery improvements in the range of 2 for both metals has been approved associated capital expenditures are estimated to be approximately 9 million the company is continuing to prioritize engineering for long lead time equipment for phase 1 and during the fourth quarter the flotation circuit expansion continued as planned with the installation of six new dfr flotation cells commissioning is scheduled for mid 2019 engineering is being advanced for phases 2 and 3 an expansion of the chapada mill and pushback of the chapada pit wall to expose higher grade sucupira ores respectively while review of these projects are in the evaluation process the company does not anticipate the allocation of significant expansionary capital for these projects before 2021 based on the work completed to date the company estimates the phased plan will provide the foundation to sustain annual production in the range of 100 000 to 110 000 ounces of gold not including contributions to gold production from identified higher grade areas of suruca which is a gold only ore body and 150 to 160 million pounds of copper until at least 2034 this represents an opportunity to deliver significant cash flow increases and cash flow returns on invested capital and an increase to the production outlook as disclosed in the chapada ni 43 101 technical report dated march 21 2018 further project details are expected to be available in mid 2019 with the completion of the feasibility study a development decision for phase 2 is expected to follow in 2020 suruca gold only oxide and sulphide development opportunity concurrent with the multi phase plan for chapada development of the gold only suruca oxides deposit continues to be evaluated as a standalone heap leach operation for which a feasibility study level update has been completed furthermore the suruca sulphides project has been updated in the 2018 exploration results for these ore bodies resulting in an increase of gold mineral resources the integrated scenario for suruca ore bodies includes processing of the oxides through a heap leach and processing of the gold only sulphides through a carbon in leach cil plant located at chapada alternatives to process the sulphide portion of suruca earlier in the life of mine are currently being contemplated including an exploration program designed to test further extensions of the sulphide mineralization and metallurgical test work the company expects to continue this development program through 2019 in order to build on the results from the 2017 and 2018 programs which resulted in extensions of the oxide and sulphide deposits canadian malartic the canadian malartic extension project is continuing according to plan with contributions from barnat expected to begin in 2019 with more meaningful contributions in 2020 on a 50 basis expansionary capex is expected to be 37 million of which 34 million is earmarked for the extension project in 2019 work in the fourth quarter continued to focus on the highway 117 road deviation pit preparation and tailings expansion other optimization and monetization initiatives agua rica the company is continuing its evaluation of and engagement in discussions relating to various development scenarios for agua rica this includes an integration scenario between agua rica and alumbrera pursuant to which a joint pre feasibility study has started concurrently the company continues the engagement with the other partners of alumbrera and with various other stakeholders at the national and provincial level separately the company continues to advance alternatives for the development of agua rica this includes technical work and analysis for project development options for agua rica as well as the review and consideration of various strategic alternatives all in an effort to advance the project and surface value considerable effort has been undertaken to advance two development scenarios one a large scale open pit integrated operation and the other an initially smaller scale but scalable standalone operation the large scale open pit scenario contemplates the aforementioned integration with the neighboring alumbrera mine in which the company holds a 12 5 interest and for which it expects to complete an updated pre feasibility study during the first half of 2019 suyai the company previously completed a scoping study that evaluated two options for ore processing both of which provide favorable project economics the first considered the construction of a cil processing facility for the on site production of gold and silver in the form of doré the second considered the construction of a processing facility for on site production of gold and silver contained in a high grade concentrate which would be shipped abroad for subsequent precious metal recovery both approaches considered an identical underground configuration with average annual production expected to be in excess of 200 000 ounces of gold and 300 000 ounces of silver the company believes both scenarios address past concerns regarding open pit mining and the development scenario that includes production of an on site concentrate addresses many of the past concerns regarding the use of cyanide and would potentially meet provincial regulations currently in place in chubut the company will work with local stakeholders to obtain and sustain its social license should the project progress to a more advanced stage the company continues to pursue development plans and other strategic alternatives for the project given the extensive amount of work performed to date the existing scoping study could rapidly progress to a feasibility study allowing for the project to be developed in a short time frame the suyai project is one of the highest gold grade development ready projects in the americas while a financial adviser has not been retained at this time the company is evaluating its strategic alternatives in addition to development of the project monument bay the monument bay deposits are hosted in the stull lake greenstone belt comprised by three volcanic assemblages ranging in age from 2 85 to 2 71 ga gold and tungsten mineralization occurs along the steeply north dipping twin lakes shear zone and the az sheer zone in 2018 approximately 16 270 metres of drilling were completed on the monument bay project the focus was testing targets near the twin lakes deposit and testing regional targets in addition during the period a new geological interpretation of the deposit was formed and is expected to form the basis for an updated block model and mineral resource estimate groundwork is continuing and generating prospects for follow up testing in 2019 on september 13 2018 the company signed an exploration agreement with red sucker lake first nations in relation to the monument bay exploration site in northern manitoba this is an important step allowing the company to solidify a strategic collaboration with this community as it continues to advance the project other the company continues to pursue development and strategic initiatives for the 56 7 held agua de la falda joint venture with codelco located in northern chile the historical jeronimo feasibility study focused on maximizing production from the sulfide deposits the company completed the study of a low capital start up project based on the remaining oxide inventory with positive results and is evaluating exploration plans on the highly prospective claims surrounding the

geological interpretation and cut off grade additions due to infill drilling cerro moro argentina at cerro moro increases in gold and silver mineral reserves partially offset depletion associated with 2018 production the main increases came from the discovery of new high grade near surface vein veronica and the extensions of nini also drilling in the core mine area returned mineralized intercepts at michelle milagros and tres lomas which will be followed up upon in 2019 updated economical parameters with higher cut off grades for both mineral reserves and mineral resources had the impact of reducing tonnage but increasing the overall grade due to the previous focus of the site on project development start up and ramp up of operations long term exploration effort began in 2018 and as result the current mineral resources do not consider drilling results for the last four months of the year these results are in the process of being analyzed and are expected to provide good quality targets for 2019 this ultimately resulted in 13 lower gold for remaining measured and indicated mineral resources and 24 lower inferred mineral resources regional exploration south of the mine area intercepted a wide zone of mineralization at naty these zones are expected to undergo further drilling in 2019 as part of the increased exploration budget allocation to the mine the following chart

product basis shown on a per ounce basis the attributable cost for each metal is calculated net of by products by applying copper and zinc net revenues which are incidental to the production of precious metals as a credit to gold and silver ounces produced thereby allowing the company s management and stakeholders to assess net costs of precious metal production these costs are then divided by gold and silver ounces produced cash costs of gold and silver on a co product basis shown on a per ounce basis costs directly attributed to gold and silver will be allocated to each metal costs not directly attributed to each metal will be allocated based on the relative value of revenues which will be determined annually the attributable cost for each metal will then be divided by the production of each metal in calculating cash costs per ounce on a co product basis for the period cash costs of copper on a co product basis shown on a per pound basis costs attributable to copper production are divided by commercial copper pounds produced by product and co product aisc all in sustaining costs per ounce of gold and silver produced seeks to represent total sustaining

increase in adjusted ebitda primarily due to strong business performance and incremental contribution from new projects placed into service across many business segments since the fourth quarter of last year partially offset by the absence of ebitda from the assets sold in the gas transmission and midstream segment in 2018 for further detail on business performance refer to adjusted ebitda by segments partially offsetting the dcf growth drivers noted above was higher maintenance capital expenditures primarily within gas transmission and midstream reflecting a shift in the timing of maintenance capital to the fourth quarter partially offset by the absence of maintenance capital expenditures from portions of the canadian and u s gas processing businesses that were sold in the second half of 2018 higher current tax which in part reflected higher earnings before income tax generated from operating segments lower equity distributions in excess of equity earnings due to higher equity earnings from stronger underlying performance that were not matched by a corresponding increase in cash distributions during the quarter as well as an absence of equity distributions from an asset sold in 2018 for the year ended december 31 2018 dcf has increased by 2 004 million compared to the comparative 2017 period the increase is in large part attributable to the timing of the merger

further detail on business performance refer to adjusted ebitda by segments lower earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest following the completion of enbridge s buy in of the publicly held interest in its sponsored vehicles which were completed in separate transactions in the fourth quarter of 2018 partially offsetting the adjusted earnings growth drivers noted above was higher depreciation and amortization expense as a result of placing new assets into service partially offset by ceasing to record depreciation expense for assets which were classified as assets held for sale

foreign exchange hedge rates used to convert united states dollar denominated canadian mainline ijt revenues lakehead system also benefited from higher throughput however this was more than offset by a decrease in the lakehead system local toll primarily driven by the reduction in the corporate federal income tax rate in the u s reducing the cost of service revenue requirement embedded in tolls applicable to facilities expansions undertaken in the past regional oil sands system growth was driven by contributions from new projects placed into service in late 2017 in particular the wood

operating performance optimization of throughput on existing assets synergy realization from the spectra acquisition and successfully bringing 7 billion of new projects into service in 2018 strategically we achieved the key priorities laid out in our three year business plan that was rolled out at the end of 2017 ahead of schedule in addition to delivering strong cash flow and earnings per share growth we executed significant non core asset sales accelerated balance sheet de leveraging and simplified the corporate structure we ve received close to 6 billion of proceeds from the 7 8 billion of non core asset sales announced through 2018 these sales allowed us to fully focus attention on our low risk pipeline and utility assets the proceeds were applied to debt repayment so that at year end our consolidated debt to ebitda metric was down to 4 7x well ahead of our original target of 5 0x in addition in the fourth quarter we completed the buy in of all four of our sponsored vehicles this now brings all of our core assets together under the enbridge roof which allows us to retain more cash flow to re invest in the business and for financial flexibility as well as

increase in adjusted ebitda primarily due to strong business performance and incremental contribution from new projects placed into service across many business segments since the fourth quarter of last year partially offset by the absence of ebitda from the assets sold in the gas transmission and midstream segment in 2018 for further detail on business performance refer to adjusted ebitda by segments partially offsetting the dcf growth drivers noted above was higher maintenance capital expenditures primarily within gas transmission and midstream reflecting a shift in the timing of maintenance capital to the fourth quarter partially offset by the absence of maintenance capital expenditures from portions of the canadian and u s gas processing businesses that were sold in the second half of 2018 higher current tax which in part reflected higher earnings before income tax generated from operating segments lower equity distributions in excess of equity earnings due to higher equity earnings from stronger underlying performance that were not matched by a corresponding increase in cash distributions during the quarter as well as an absence of equity distributions from an asset sold in 2018 for the year ended december 31 2018 dcf has increased by 2 004 million compared to the comparative 2017 period the increase is in large part attributable to the timing of the merger

further detail on business performance refer to adjusted ebitda by segments lower earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest following the completion of enbridge s buy in of the publicly held interest in its sponsored vehicles which were completed in separate transactions in the fourth quarter of 2018 partially offsetting the adjusted earnings growth drivers noted above was higher depreciation and amortization expense as a result of placing new assets into service partially offset by ceasing to record depreciation expense for assets which were classified as assets held for sale

quarter of 2017 the increase reflected the factors noted above partially offset by a higher average number of shares outstanding following the offering of approximately 33 million of the company s

foreign exchange hedge rates used to convert united states dollar denominated canadian mainline ijt revenues lakehead system also benefited from higher throughput however this was more than offset by a decrease in the lakehead system local toll primarily driven by the reduction in the corporate federal income tax rate in the u s reducing the cost of service revenue requirement embedded in tolls

copper and gold areas the company has also advanced other projects that are expected to further enhance returns from the chapada mine to this end the company has completed studies and evaluations on several of the development opportunities at chapada and has embarked on a feasibility level review of a three phase plan at chapada these opportunities range in scope from plant optimization initiatives to enhance copper and gold recoveries to plant expansions to bring forward cash flows and pit wall pushbacks to expose higher grade zones the study and evaluations include third party design and engineering estimates of capital expenses production and operating cost forecasts given the nature of the opportunities the projects can be considered on their own or as part of a phased development plan this flexibility in approach allows the company to balance the maximization of value at chapada with the allocation of capital across the broader company portfolio the phase 1 plant optimization work with expected recovery improvements in the range of 2 for both metals has been approved associated capital expenditures are estimated to be approximately 9 million the company is continuing to prioritize engineering for long lead time equipment for phase 1 and during the fourth quarter the flotation circuit expansion continued as planned with the installation of six new dfr flotation cells commissioning is scheduled for mid 2019 engineering is being advanced for phases 2 and 3 an expansion of the chapada mill and pushback of the chapada pit wall to expose higher grade sucupira ores respectively while review of these projects are in the evaluation process the company does not anticipate the allocation of significant expansionary capital for these projects before 2021 based on the work completed to date the company estimates the phased plan will provide the foundation to sustain annual production in the range of 100 000 to 110 000 ounces of gold not including contributions to gold production from identified higher grade areas of suruca which is a gold only ore body and 150 to 160 million pounds of copper until at least 2034 this represents an opportunity to deliver significant cash flow increases and cash flow returns on invested capital and an increase to the production outlook as disclosed in the chapada ni 43 101 technical report dated march 21 2018 further project details are expected to be available in mid 2019 with the completion of the feasibility study a development decision for phase 2 is expected to follow in 2020 suruca gold only oxide and sulphide development opportunity concurrent with the multi phase plan for chapada development of the gold only suruca oxides deposit continues to be evaluated as a standalone heap leach operation for which a feasibility study level update has been completed furthermore the suruca sulphides project has been updated in the 2018 exploration results for these ore bodies resulting in an increase of gold mineral resources the integrated scenario for suruca ore bodies includes processing of the oxides through a heap leach and processing of the gold only sulphides through a carbon in leach cil plant located at chapada alternatives to process the sulphide portion of suruca earlier in the life of mine are currently being contemplated including an exploration program designed to test further extensions of the sulphide mineralization and metallurgical test work the company expects to continue this development program through 2019 in order to build on the results from the 2017 and 2018 programs which resulted in extensions of the oxide and sulphide deposits canadian malartic the canadian malartic extension project is continuing according to plan with contributions from barnat expected to begin in 2019 with more meaningful contributions in 2020 on a 50 basis expansionary capex is expected to be 37 million of which 34 million is earmarked for the extension project in 2019 work in the fourth quarter continued to focus on the highway 117 road deviation pit preparation and tailings expansion other optimization and monetization initiatives agua rica the company is continuing its evaluation of and engagement in discussions relating to various development scenarios for agua rica this includes an integration scenario between agua rica and alumbrera pursuant to which a joint pre feasibility study has started concurrently the company continues the engagement with the other partners of alumbrera and with various other stakeholders at the national and provincial level separately the company continues to advance alternatives for the development of agua rica this includes technical work and analysis for project development options for agua rica as well as the review and consideration of various strategic alternatives all in an effort to advance the project and surface value considerable effort has been undertaken to advance two development scenarios one a large scale open pit integrated operation and the other an initially smaller scale but scalable standalone operation the large scale open pit scenario contemplates the aforementioned integration with the neighboring alumbrera mine in which the company holds a 12 5 interest and for which it expects to complete an updated pre feasibility study during the first half of 2019 suyai the company previously completed a scoping study that evaluated two options for ore processing both of which provide favorable project economics the first considered the construction of a cil processing facility for the on site production of gold and silver in the form of doré the second considered the construction of a processing facility for on site production of gold and silver contained in a high grade concentrate which would be shipped abroad for subsequent precious metal recovery both approaches considered an identical underground configuration with average annual production expected to be in excess of 200 000 ounces of gold and 300 000 ounces of silver the company believes both scenarios address past concerns regarding open pit mining and the development scenario that includes production of an on site concentrate addresses many of the past concerns regarding the use of cyanide and would potentially meet provincial regulations currently in place in chubut the company will work with local stakeholders to obtain and sustain its social license should the project progress to a more advanced stage the company continues to pursue development plans and other strategic alternatives for the project given the extensive amount of work performed to date the existing scoping study could rapidly progress to a feasibility study allowing for the project to be developed in a short time frame the suyai project is one of the highest gold grade development ready projects in the americas while a financial adviser has not been retained at this time the company is evaluating its strategic alternatives in addition to development of the project monument bay the monument bay deposits are hosted in the stull lake greenstone belt comprised by three volcanic assemblages ranging in age from 2 85 to 2 71 ga gold and tungsten mineralization occurs along the steeply north dipping twin lakes shear zone and the az sheer zone in 2018 approximately 16 270 metres of drilling were completed on the monument bay project the focus was testing targets near the twin lakes deposit and testing regional targets in addition during the period a new geological interpretation of the deposit was formed and is expected to form the basis for an updated block model and mineral resource estimate groundwork is continuing and generating prospects for follow up testing in 2019 on september 13 2018 the company signed an exploration agreement with red sucker lake first nations in relation to the monument bay exploration site in northern manitoba this is an important step allowing the company to solidify a strategic collaboration with this community as it continues to advance the project other the company continues to pursue development and strategic initiatives for the 56 7 held agua de la falda joint venture with codelco located in northern chile the historical jeronimo feasibility study focused on maximizing production from the sulfide deposits the company completed the study of a low capital start up project based on the remaining oxide inventory with positive results and is evaluating exploration plans on the highly prospective claims surrounding the

geological interpretation and cut off grade additions due to infill drilling cerro moro argentina at cerro moro increases in gold and silver mineral reserves partially offset depletion associated with 2018 production the main increases came from the discovery of new high grade near surface vein veronica and the extensions of nini also drilling in the core mine area returned mineralized intercepts at michelle milagros and tres lomas which will be followed up upon in 2019 updated economical parameters with higher cut off grades for both mineral reserves and mineral resources had the impact of reducing tonnage but increasing the overall grade due to the previous focus of the site on project development start up and ramp up of operations long term exploration effort began in 2018 and as result the current mineral resources do not consider drilling results for the last four months of the year these results are in the process of being analyzed and are expected to provide good quality targets for 2019 this ultimately resulted in 13 lower gold for remaining measured and indicated mineral resources and 24 lower inferred mineral resources regional exploration south of the mine area

note to united states investors concerning estimates of measured indicated and inferred mineral resources this news release uses the terms mineral resource measured mineral resource indicated mineral resource and inferred mineral resource are defined in and required to be disclosed by national instrument 43 101 however these terms are not defined terms under industry guide 7 and are not permitted to be used in reports and registration statements of united states companies filed with the commission investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of the mineral deposits in these categories will ever be converted into mineral reserves inferred mineral resources have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility it cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category under canadian rules estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form the basis of feasibility or pre feasibility studies except in rare cases investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource exists or is economically or legally mineable disclosure of contained ounces in a mineral resource is permitted disclosure under canadian regulations in contrast the commission only permits u s companies to report mineralization

comparable to similar information made public by u s companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements under the united states federal securities laws and the rules and regulations of the commission thereunder non gaap financial measures and additional line items and subtotals in financial statements the company has included certain non gaap financial measures to supplement its consolidated financial statements which are presented in accordance with ifrs including the following cash costs per ounce of gold produced on a co product and by product basis cash costs per ounce of silver produced on a co product and by product basis co product cash costs per pound of copper produced all in sustaining costs per ounce of gold produced on a co product and by product basis all in sustaining costs per ounce of silver produced on a co product and by product basis all in sustaining co product costs per pound of copper produced net debt net free cash flow average realized price per ounce of gold sold average realized price per ounce of silver sold and average realized price per pound of copper sold the company believes that these measures together with measures determined in accordance with ifrs provide investors with an improved ability to evaluate the underlying performance of the company non gaap financial measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed under ifrs and therefore they may not be comparable to similar measures employed by other companies the data is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with ifrs management s determination of the components of non gaap and additional measures are evaluated on a periodic basis influenced by new items and transactions a review of investor uses and new regulations as applicable any changes to the measures are duly noted and retrospectively applied as applicable cash costs and all in sustaining costs the company discloses cash costs because it understands that certain investors use this information to determine the company s ability to generate earnings and cash flows for use in investing and other activities the company believes that conventional measures of performance prepared in accordance with ifrs do not fully illustrate the ability of its operating mines to generate cash flows the measures as determined under ifrs are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flows from operating activities cash costs figures are calculated in accordance with a standard developed by the gold institute which was a worldwide association of suppliers of gold and gold products and included leading north american gold producers the gold institute ceased operations in 2002 but the standard remains the generally accepted standard of reporting cash costs of production in north america adoption of the standard is voluntary and the cost measures presented herein may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies the measure of cash costs along with revenue from sales is considered to be a key indicator of a company s ability to generate operating earnings and cash flows from its mining operations this data is furnished to provide additional information and is a non gaap financial measure the terms co product and by product cash costs per ounce of gold or silver produced co product cash costs per pound of copper produced co product and by product aisc per ounce of gold or silver produced and co product aisc per pound of copper produced do not have any standardized meaning prescribed under ifrs and therefore they may not be comparable to similar measures employed by other companies non gaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with ifrs and is not necessarily indicative of operating costs operating profit or cash flows presented under ifrs by product and co product cash costs cash costs include mine site operating costs such as mining processing administration production taxes and royalties which are not based on sales or taxable income calculations but are exclusive of amortization reclamation capital development and exploration costs the company believes that such measure provides useful information about the company s underlying cash costs of operations cash costs are computed on a weighted average basis net of by product sales and on a co product basis as follows cash costs of gold and silver on a by product basis shown on a per ounce basis the attributable cost for each metal is calculated net of by products by applying copper and zinc net revenues which are incidental to the production of precious metals as a credit to gold and silver ounces produced thereby allowing the company s management and stakeholders to assess net costs of precious metal production these costs are then divided by gold and silver ounces produced cash costs of gold and silver on a co product basis shown on a per ounce basis costs directly attributed to gold and silver will be allocated to each metal costs not directly attributed to each metal will be allocated based on the relative value of revenues which will be determined annually the attributable cost for each metal will then be divided by the production of each metal in calculating cash costs per ounce on a co product basis for the period cash costs of copper on a co product basis shown on a per pound basis costs attributable to copper production are divided by commercial copper pounds produced by product and co product aisc all in sustaining costs per ounce of gold and silver produced seeks to represent total sustaining expenditures of producing gold and silver ounces from current operations based on co product costs or by product costs including cost components of mine sustaining capital expenditures corporate general and administrative expense excluding stock based compensation and exploration and evaluation expense all in sustaining costs do not include capital expenditures attributable to projects or mine expansions exploration and evaluation costs attributable to growth projects income tax payments financing costs and dividend payments consequently this measure is not representative of all of the company s cash expenditures in addition the calculation of all in sustaining costs does not include depletion depreciation and amortization expense as it does not reflect the impact of expenditures incurred in prior periods all in sustaining co product costs reflect allocations of the aforementioned cost components on the basis that is consistent with the nature of each of the cost component to the gold silver or copper production activities similarly all in sustaining by product costs reflect allocations of the aforementioned cost components on the basis that is consistent with the nature of each of the cost component to the gold and silver production activities but net of by product revenue credits from sales of copper and zinc a reconciliation of total cost of sales of gold silver and copper sold cost of sales excluding depreciation depletion and amortization plus depreciation depletion and amortization per the consolidated financial statements to co product cash costs of gold produced co product cash costs of silver produced co product cash costs of copper produced co product aisc of gold produced co product aisc of silver produced co product aisc of copper produced by product cash costs of gold produced by product cash costs of silver produced by product aisc of gold produced and by product aisc of silver produced is provided in section 11 of the md a for the three

net debt 4 as at december 31 2018 was 1 66 billion daniel racine yamana s president and chief executive officer commented as follows in 2018 we achieved another year of exceeding our production guidance for all metals and at costs better than or in line with our guidance gold and copper exceeded the increased guidance levels we announced in october while silver production exceeded the guidance that was lowered at that time our operational performance would not have been possible without our success in delivering cerro moro on time and on budget and exceeding expectations on both production and costs through the first six months of commercial production throughout the year we also advanced several strategic initiatives including closing the sale of the canadian malartic exploration properties the gualcamayo mine and completion of the business combination between brio gold and leagold in addition to the ongoing evaluation and engagement in discussions relating to scenarios to develop agua rica overall we remain in a strong position to carry the company s health and safety operational and balance sheet momentum into 2019 development optimization and strategic initiatives chapada the company continues to advance its exploration program with the objective of identifying higher grade copper and gold opportunities that are near the chapada mine completing infill drilling of the sucupira and baru deposits which would lead to a pit expansion and advancing district scale targets mineralization has been identified along a 15 kilometre trend with numerous prospective areas under consideration for further drilling infill drilling in the baru area is expected to reduce stripping ratios for the sucupira deposit and drilling on oxide mineralization such as hidrotermalito brings the potential for heap leaching opportunities that could complement the suruca oxides project notwithstanding the focus on the exploration potential to discover higher grade copper and gold areas the company has also advanced other projects that are expected to further enhance returns from the chapada mine to this end the company has completed studies and evaluations on several of the development opportunities at chapada and has embarked on a feasibility level review of a three phase plan at chapada these opportunities range in scope from plant optimization initiatives to enhance copper and gold recoveries to plant expansions to bring forward cash flows and pit wall pushbacks to expose higher grade zones the study and evaluations include third party design and engineering estimates of capital expenses production and operating cost forecasts given the nature of the opportunities the projects can be considered on their own or as part of a phased development plan this flexibility in approach allows the company to balance the maximization of value at chapada with the allocation of capital across the broader company portfolio the phase 1 plant optimization work with expected recovery improvements in the range of 2 for both metals has been approved associated capital expenditures are estimated to be approximately 9 million the company is continuing to prioritize engineering for long lead time equipment for phase 1 and during the fourth quarter the flotation circuit expansion continued as planned with the installation of six new dfr flotation cells commissioning is scheduled for mid 2019 engineering is being advanced for phases 2 and 3 an expansion of the chapada mill and pushback of the chapada pit wall to expose higher grade sucupira ores respectively while review of these projects are in the evaluation process the company does not anticipate the allocation of significant expansionary capital for these projects before 2021 based on the work completed to date the company estimates the phased plan will provide the foundation to sustain annual production in the range of 100 000 to 110 000 ounces of gold not including contributions to gold production from identified higher grade areas of suruca which is a gold only ore body and 150 to 160 million pounds of copper until at least 2034 this represents an opportunity to deliver significant cash flow increases and cash flow returns on invested capital and an increase to the production outlook as disclosed in the chapada ni 43 101 technical report dated march 21 2018 further project details are expected to be available in mid 2019 with the completion of the feasibility study a development decision for phase 2 is expected to follow in 2020 suruca gold only oxide and sulphide development opportunity concurrent with the multi phase plan for chapada development of the gold only suruca oxides deposit continues to be evaluated as a standalone heap leach operation for which a feasibility study level update has been completed furthermore the suruca sulphides project has been updated in the 2018 exploration results for these ore bodies resulting in an increase of gold mineral resources the integrated scenario for suruca ore bodies includes processing of the oxides through a heap leach and processing of the gold only sulphides through a carbon in leach cil plant located at chapada alternatives to process the sulphide portion of suruca earlier in the life of mine are currently being contemplated including an exploration program designed to test further extensions of the sulphide mineralization and metallurgical test work the company expects to continue this development program through 2019 in order to build on the results from the 2017 and 2018 programs which resulted in extensions of the oxide and sulphide deposits canadian malartic the canadian malartic extension project is continuing according to plan with contributions from barnat expected to begin in 2019 with more meaningful contributions in 2020 on a 50 basis expansionary capex is expected to be 37 million of which 34 million is earmarked for the extension project in 2019 work in the fourth quarter continued to focus on the highway 117 road deviation pit preparation and tailings expansion other optimization and monetization initiatives agua rica the company is continuing its evaluation of and engagement in discussions relating to various development scenarios for agua rica this includes an integration scenario between agua rica and alumbrera pursuant to which a joint pre feasibility study has started concurrently the company continues the engagement with the other partners of alumbrera and with various other stakeholders at the national and provincial level separately the company continues to advance alternatives for the development of agua rica this includes technical work and analysis for project development options for agua rica as well as the review and consideration of various strategic alternatives all in an effort to advance the project and surface value considerable effort has been undertaken to advance two development scenarios one a large scale open pit integrated operation and the other an initially smaller scale but scalable standalone operation the large scale open pit scenario contemplates the aforementioned integration with the neighboring alumbrera mine in which the company holds a 12 5 interest and for which it expects to complete an updated pre feasibility study during the first half of 2019 suyai the company previously completed a scoping study that evaluated two options for ore processing both of which provide favorable project economics the first considered the construction of a cil processing facility for the on site production of gold and silver in the form of doré the second considered the construction of a processing facility for on site production of gold and silver contained in a high grade concentrate which would be shipped abroad for subsequent precious metal recovery both approaches considered an identical underground configuration with average annual production expected to be in excess of 200 000 ounces of gold and 300 000 ounces of silver the company believes both scenarios address past concerns regarding open pit mining and the development scenario that includes production of an on site concentrate addresses many of the past concerns regarding the use of cyanide and would potentially meet provincial regulations currently in place in chubut the company will work with local stakeholders to obtain and sustain its social license should the project progress to a more advanced stage the company continues to pursue development plans and other strategic alternatives for the project given the extensive amount of work performed to date the existing scoping study could rapidly progress to a feasibility study allowing for the project to be developed in a short time frame the suyai project is one of the highest gold grade development ready projects in the americas while a financial adviser has not been retained at this time the company is evaluating its strategic alternatives in addition to development of the project monument bay the monument bay deposits are hosted in the stull lake greenstone belt comprised by three volcanic assemblages ranging in age from 2 85 to 2 71 ga gold and tungsten mineralization occurs along the steeply north dipping twin lakes shear zone and the az sheer zone in 2018 approximately 16 270 metres of drilling were completed on the monument bay project the focus was testing targets near the twin lakes deposit and testing regional targets in addition during the period a new geological interpretation of the deposit was formed and is expected to form the basis for an updated block model and mineral resource estimate groundwork is continuing and generating prospects for follow up testing in 2019 on september 13 2018 the company signed an exploration agreement with red sucker lake first nations in relation to the monument bay exploration site in northern manitoba this is an important step allowing the company to solidify a strategic collaboration with this community as it continues to advance the project other the company continues to pursue development and strategic initiatives for the 56 7 held agua de la falda joint venture with codelco located in northern chile the historical jeronimo feasibility study focused on maximizing production from the sulfide deposits the company completed the study of a low capital start up project based on the remaining oxide inventory with positive results and is evaluating exploration plans on the highly prospective claims surrounding the

geological interpretation and cut off grade additions due to infill drilling cerro moro argentina at cerro moro increases in gold and silver mineral reserves partially offset depletion associated with 2018 production the main increases came from the discovery of new high grade near surface vein veronica and the extensions of nini also drilling in the core mine area returned mineralized intercepts at michelle milagros and tres lomas which will be followed up upon in 2019 updated economical parameters with higher cut off grades for both mineral reserves and mineral resources had the impact of reducing tonnage but increasing the overall grade due to the previous focus of the site on project development start up and ramp up of operations long term exploration effort began in 2018 and as result the current mineral resources do not consider drilling results for the last four months of the year these results are in the process of being analyzed and are expected to provide good quality targets for 2019 this ultimately resulted in 13 lower gold for remaining measured and indicated mineral resources and 24 lower inferred mineral resources regional exploration south of the mine area intercepted a wide zone of mineralization at naty these zones are expected to undergo further drilling in 2019 as part of the increased exploration budget allocation to the mine the following chart

silver produced on a co product and by product basis co product cash costs per pound of copper produced all in sustaining costs per ounce of gold produced on a co product and by product basis all in sustaining costs per ounce of silver produced on a co product and by product basis all in sustaining co product costs per pound of copper produced net debt net free cash flow average realized price per ounce of gold sold average realized price per ounce of silver sold and average realized price per pound of copper sold the company believes that these measures together with measures determined in accordance with ifrs provide investors with an improved ability to evaluate the underlying performance of the company non gaap financial measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed under ifrs and therefore they may not be comparable to similar measures employed by other companies the data is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with ifrs management s determination of the components of non gaap and additional measures are evaluated on a periodic basis influenced by new items and transactions a review of investor uses and new regulations as applicable any changes to the measures are duly noted and retrospectively applied as applicable cash costs and all in sustaining costs the company discloses cash costs because it understands that certain investors use this information to determine the company s ability to generate earnings and cash flows for use in investing and other activities the company believes that conventional measures of performance prepared in accordance with ifrs do not fully illustrate the ability of its operating mines to generate cash flows the measures as determined under ifrs are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flows from operating activities cash costs figures are calculated in accordance with a standard developed by the gold institute which was a worldwide association of suppliers of gold and gold products and included leading north american gold producers the gold institute ceased operations in 2002 but the standard remains the generally accepted standard of reporting cash costs of production in north america adoption of the standard is voluntary and the cost measures presented herein may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies the measure of cash costs along with revenue from sales is considered to be a key indicator of a company s ability to generate operating earnings and cash flows from its mining operations this data is furnished to provide additional information and is a non gaap financial measure the terms co product and by product cash costs per ounce of gold or silver produced co product cash costs per pound of copper produced co product and by product aisc per ounce of gold or silver produced and co product aisc per pound of

presented under ifrs by product and co product cash costs cash costs include mine site operating costs such as mining processing administration production taxes and royalties which are not based on sales or taxable income calculations but are exclusive of amortization reclamation capital development and exploration costs the company believes that such measure provides useful information about the company s underlying cash costs of operations cash costs are computed on a weighted average basis net of by product sales and on a co product basis as follows cash costs of gold and silver on a by product basis shown on a per ounce basis the attributable cost for each metal is calculated net of by products by applying copper and zinc net revenues which are incidental to the production of precious metals as a credit to gold and silver ounces produced thereby allowing the company s management and stakeholders to assess net costs of precious metal production these costs are then divided by gold and silver ounces produced cash costs of gold and silver on a co product basis shown on a per ounce basis costs directly attributed to gold and silver will be allocated to each metal costs not directly attributed to each metal will be allocated based on the relative value of revenues which will be determined annually the attributable cost for each metal will then be divided by the production of each metal in calculating cash costs per ounce on a co product basis for the period cash costs of copper on a co product basis shown on a per pound basis costs attributable to copper production are divided by commercial copper pounds produced by product and co product aisc all in sustaining costs per ounce of gold and silver produced seeks to represent total sustaining expenditures of producing gold and silver ounces from current operations based on co product costs or by product costs including cost components of mine sustaining capital expenditures corporate general and administrative expense excluding stock based compensation and exploration and evaluation expense all in sustaining costs do not include capital expenditures attributable to projects or mine expansions exploration and evaluation costs attributable to growth projects income tax payments financing costs and dividend payments consequently this measure is not representative of all of the company s cash expenditures in addition the calculation of all in sustaining costs does not include depletion depreciation and amortization expense as it does not reflect the impact of expenditures incurred in prior periods all in sustaining co product costs reflect allocations of the aforementioned cost components on the basis that is consistent with the nature of each of the cost component to the gold silver or copper production activities similarly all in sustaining by product costs reflect allocations of the aforementioned cost components on the basis that is consistent with the nature of each of the cost component to the gold and silver production activities but net of by product revenue credits from sales of copper and zinc a reconciliation of total cost of sales of gold silver and copper sold cost of sales excluding depreciation depletion and amortization plus depreciation depletion and amortization per the consolidated financial statements to co product cash costs of gold

their presentation provides useful information to investors because gross margin excluding depletion depreciation and amortization excludes the non cash operating cost item i e depreciation depletion and amortization cash flows from operating activities before net change in working capital excludes the movement in working capital items mine operating earnings excludes expenses not directly associated with commercial production and operating earnings excludes finance and tax related expenses and income recoveries these in management s view provide useful information of the company s cash flows from operating activities and are considered to be meaningful in evaluating the company s past financial performance or the future prospects
there is no more recent example of the many theoretically apparent pitfalls of socialism coming to life than in venezuela the south american nation is but the latest example on the long list of countries to have fallen victim to the siren s song of a socialist utopia while over the past decade journalists like michael moore politicians like bernie sanders and economists like joseph stiglitz have praised the so called socialist economic miracle in venezuela with hyperinflation now leading to starvation and millions fleeing the country it is inarguable that these praises were premature and wholly unwarranted unfortunately economist turned political hack paul krugman still to this day carries on the tired line that the venezuelan government simply mismanaged and are corrupt and will not admit that this situation arose from problems inherent to socialist ideals and policy i aim to show how feeble this line of thinking is what s more what may be the final months of the maduro government are serving as a reminder of how even socialist regimes ironically rely heavily on the successes of capitalism to maintain the last vestiges of their socialist society political philosophy has consequences the bolivarian revolution led by the late venezuelan president hugo chavez began in 1999 under the guise of snuffing out imperialism corruption and inequality in practice this meant implementing nationalist politics and a state run socialist economy with a slogan like motherland socialism or death it would seem that the bolivarian revolution should have been seen for what it was from the very outset the beginning of the end for the venezuelan economy the failure of the aforementioned journalists politicians and economists to foresee economic and political ruin as the necessary outcome of such a revolution despite the long list of historical evidence that would make such optimism clearly undeserved speaks not only to their ideological bias but also to their poor understanding of the very foundations of economic and institutional success many still to this day will not admit that the devastation witnessed in venezuela is a problem inherent to socialism they claim that venezuela is not a model of true socialism but of autocracy and blame the ills of the government and economy on corruption however it has long been evident that the historical correlation between the rise of tyrannies and state run socialist economies are actually causal relationships as mises stated the idea that political freedom can be preserved in the absence of economic freedom and vice versa is an illusion decades before venezuelan s were planning their revolution mises had already observed that tyranny is the political corollary of socialism as representative government is the political corollary of the market economy to suggest otherwise is to ignore economic and political history in lieu of capitalism socialism puts the fate of individuals in the hands of bureaucracies bureaucracies cannot be managed by economic calculation like businesses in a capitalist economy and are therefore destined for bloat inefficiency and mismanagement as mises wrote bureaucratic conduct is conduct bound to comply with detailed rules and regulations fixed by the authority of a superior body it is the only alternative to profit management whenever the operation of a system is not directed by the profit motive it must be directed by bureaucratic rules the alternative philosophy of economic and political liberalism which originated from the age of enlightenment and places the rights of the individual over that of society at large has thus been in the crosshairs of socialist do gooders and unabashed tyrants since its origins the relationship between political philosophy and material wellbeing is not a mystery given that the political philosophy of a nation is the foremost determinant of its economic policies a political philosophy rooted in foundational principles of private property rights and individualism promotes the market exchange and innovation that allows for an abundance of material comforts like food shelter and medicine only a legal framework built on the sovereignty of private property rights allows individual citizens to own the means of production to negotiate and depend on enforceable contracts and gives rise to the capital accumulation and investment that causes entrepreneurship and capitalism to flourish ironically for the socialists the absence of the very profit motive for which they vilify under capitalism leads to the perverse incentives and lack of accountability in socialist bureaucracies which sow the seeds of corruption and tyranny in government inefficiency corruption graft and tyranny are therefore features of socialism and are not something that can be avoided if only true socialism were tried once more it s not that true socialism the socialist utopia of prosperity under shared ownership of the means of production hasn t been the goal of many failed states like venezuela it s just that it s an inherently impossible outcome from enacting socialist policy the myth of the venezuelan resource curse one such venezuelan bureaucracy that plays a key role in the venezuelan economy is petróleos de venezuela s a which is more commonly referred to as pdvsa pdvsa is venezuela s state owned oil and natural gas company that serves as the largest source of government revenues due to its production and exportation of crude oil venezuela has the largest proven oil reserves in the world accounting for nearly 300 billion barrels of oil the nation is also rich in other precious natural resources such as gold this may lead one to ask why then does a country so rich in natural resources continue to suffer such economic hardship beginning in the mid 1990 s academic literature began to hone in on a so called resource curse wherein the relationship between natural resource abundance and economic growth was closely examined some researchers have concluded that many countries have not only squandered their natural resources but that economic performance has actually suffered as a result of the rise of natural resource discovery and production people are therefore quick to point to venezuela as yet another example of the resource curse in action rather than attributing blame to socialism some recent research however has found evidence that it is not likely the fault of simply having an outsized natural resource industry that starves the economy of investment elsewhere after all there are many historical examples where this curse did not arise it is no accident that nations that have been largely immune to the resource curse despite their large natural resource sectors have been those that arose from foundations of property rights individualism and capitalism property rights which allow for the rise of private contracts and the private accumulation of the means of production preclude the mass confiscation and government management of resources which is present under socialist control as mises so concisely stated economic calculation can only take place by means of money prices established in the market for production goods in a society resting on private property in the means of production by nationalizing industries and then making bloated government budgets dependent on the revenue of said industries the government is then necessarily exposed financially to its largest industries in a socialist state such as venezuela where government revenues are increasingly dependent on a single highly volatile commodity like oil that is priced in the global market it is little wonder that the economy would be marred in instability the supposed resource curse in venezuela properly described is then nothing more than another example of the failure of socialist bureaucracies in their effort to try and function like market economies placing resources in the hands of the people really means placing it in the hands of the government and its cronies furthermore in centrally planned socialist economies such as venezuela where many individuals obtain their incomes in groups that compete over government revenue it would seem to necessarily follow that corruption graft and a class of politically connected elites would grow at the expense of the rest of society in political science terms it breeds clientelism or the exchange of goods and services for implicit or explicit political support in fact recent research has suggested that not only may the resource curse not exist but that a clientelist economy may actually be a prerequisite for supposed resource curse outcomes image it is not merely a coincidence that even as global oil demand and production has risen in recent decades a nation so rich in oil reserves saw its oil production peak just before the nationalization of the oil and gas industry began in the early 1970 s venezuelan oil production rose once more throughout the 1990 s as pdvsa began to employ private contractors but that all changed with the election of hugo chávez and the start of the bolivarian revolution during the venezuelan general strike of 2002 2003 chávez fired 19 000 employees of pdvsa and replaced them with employees loyal to his government since then venezuelan oil production has plummeted by 70 percent this is clearly not the result of a curse that naturally arises from the laws of economics but one that follows from government trying to ignore those laws monetary policy and hyperinflation a socialist economic meltdown would hardly be complete without a collapse of the currency after all like corruption and graft inflation of the nation s money supply under a socialist state should be expected the collapse of the venezuelan currency the bolivar is particularly tragic given that it was one of the strongest currencies in south america during the time of venezuelan economic success from the 1950 s to 1970 s inflation began taking hold in the 1980 s following the venezuelan government increasingly nationalizing industry and politicizing the central bank in the 1970 s predictably the expansion of government led to growth in spending deficits and debt as has typically been the case throughout history instead of admitting failure and reversing course the government began fleecing the people of venezuela through the initially hidden but now obvious tax of inflation by printing more bolivars at the expense of the purchasing power of the currency this policy allows governments to inflate away their debts as they drive the currency toward worthlessness as mises so aptly noted in the theory of money and credit inflation has always been an important resource of policies of war and revolution and why we also find it in the service of socialism for consumers a policy of monetary inflation has led to staggering price hikes throughout the economy in a failed effort to compensate maduro ordered six minimum wage hikes in the country throughout 2018 and in 2019 has already issued an additional 300 percent increase this brings the minimum wage to 18 000 bolivars per month or less than 7 us dollars coupled with government price controls this has led to mass shortages of basic goods like food water and toilet paper at this point the bolivar is literally not even worth the paper it is printed on indeed it makes more financial sense to use the bolivar as toilet paper than to use it to try and buy toilet paper enormous stacks of cash are needed for basic goods given the currencies worthlessness a cup of coffee which a year ago cost 0 45 bolivars now costs 1 700 bolivars image best estimates show that venezuelans saw prices rise at an annualized rate of 160 000 by the end of 2018 venezuelans have no access to medical services children and the elderly are starving to death and millions of people are fleeing the country in mass as a result the tragedy is that this suffering is the direct result of something that is completely avoidable as mises described in the 1950 s the most important thing to remember is that inflation is not an act of god that inflation is not a catastrophe of the elements or a disease that comes like the plague inflation is a policy indeed as has been proven throughout history it is a policy that follows from the growth of government under socialism trade in the final days of the revolution last july major general manuel quevedo the career military officer who had been made president of pdvsa met with a catholic priest and a gathering of pdvsa workers and officials at the pdvsa headquarters for a prayer ceremony in hopes that god would help boost venezuelan oil output but not even calls to god could reverse the economic misfortune that follows when you place industry in the hands of military officials and socialist sympathizers what followed was increasing economic and political disarray throughout 2018 with little choice left the venezuelan government quietly reversed the two decade drive to nationalize the oil industry and began hiring outside firms to help maintain the last bit of operations at the state owned oil giant this comes less than a year after maduro was quoted saying i want a socialist pdvsa an ethical sovereign and productive pdvsa we must break this model of the rentier oil company while it is true that the venezuelan government and economy has grown dependent on loans from their more ideologically aligned geopolitical allies china india and russia over the past decade their ideological adversary the us has been by far the largest buyer of the oil that finances the venezuelan government the us imported nearly 500 000 barrels per day of venezuelan crude in 2018 accounting for nearly 40 percent of total venezuelan exports and up from 34 percent of total venezuelan exports in 2017 given that venezuela is greatly indebted to many of its other largest buyers like china and india exporting oil to these countries only pays down debts and does not help meet needs for additional funding as such the us is thought to account for 75 percent of the total cash that venezuela receives for their crude exports what s more venezuelan oil is far too heavy or thick to flow through pipeline and export infrastructure without having diluent or refined light oil products like gasoline to blend with its crude to reduce its viscosity in the past pdvsa created their own diluent at their own refineries but with nearly the entire refining base going offline after years of bureaucratic mismanagement in 2018 venezuela increasingly turned to refiners in the us to supply the oil products that would allow them to continue to produce and export crude the us supplied nearly 80 percent of the total diluent imported into venezuela in 2018 while venezuela can source this from elsewhere globally it would come at a higher cost than procuring the geographically proximate us supply image so what happened when socialist venezuela ran up debts to their socialist allies globally and were starved of income and the inputs their industry depends on ironically but not surprisingly they turned to the supposed evil capitalist country that maduro blames for their economic misfortune as global pressure mounts against maduro and his government we can only hope for the people of venezuela that the country will truly turn away from the anti capitalistic mentality that led them to this point the true problem in venezuela will not simply resolve with a bail out by the imf or world bank there must be a resolution from within the venezuelan people to turn away from socialism as mises so astutely observed the problem of rendering the underdeveloped nations more prosperous cannot be solved by material aid it is a spiritual and intellectual problem prosperity is not simply a matter of capital investment it is an ideological issue

taxes in canadian rate regulated pipelines notable recent developments include canadian natural gas pipelines coastal gaslink pipeline project in october 2018 we announced that we are proceeding with construction of the coastal gaslink pipeline project following the lng canada joint venture participants announcement that they had reached a positive final investment decision fid to build the lng canada natural gas liquefaction facility in kitimat b c coastal gaslink will provide the natural gas supply to the lng canada facility and is underpinned by 25 year tsas with additional renewal provisions with each of the five lng canada participants coastal gaslink will be a 670 km 416 miles pipeline with an initial capacity of approximately 2 2 pj d 2 1 bcf d with potential expansion capacity up to 5 4 pj d 5 0 bcf d all necessary regulatory permits have been received to allow us to proceed with construction activities which began in december 2018 with a planned in service date in 2023 coastal gaslink has signed project and community agreements with all 20 elected indigenous bands along the pipeline route confirming strong support from indigenous communities across the province of b c in july 2018 an individual asked the national energy board neb to consider whether the coastal gaslink pipeline should be federally regulated by the neb in october 2018 the neb advised that it would consider the question of jurisdiction granted coastal gaslink standing in the matter and reserved the right to decide on the participation of all other potentially interested parties including the individual who raised the question in december 2018 the neb issued a process letter addressing participation and set the schedule which is expected to conclude in the second half of 2019 with a decision to follow the coastal gaslink capital cost estimate is 6 2 billion with the majority of the construction spend occurring in 2020 and 2021 subject to terms and conditions differences between the estimated capital cost and final cost of the project will be recovered in future pipeline tolls as part of the coastal gaslink funding plan we are exploring joint venture partners and project financing the total capital cost includes pre fid costs incurred of 470 million in accordance with provisions in the agreements with the lng canada joint venture participants all five parties elected to reimburse us for their share of pre fid costs totaling 470 million in november 2018 in addition in january 2019 all five partners elected to make cash payments throughout the construction period with respect to carrying charges on costs incurred ngtl system in october 2018 we announced the ngtl system 2022 expansion program to meet capacity requirements for incremental firm receipt and intra basin delivery services to commence in november 2021 and april 2022 this 1 5 billion expansion of the ngtl system consists of approximately 197 km 122 miles of new pipeline three compressor units meter stations and associated facilities applications for approvals to construct and operate the facilities are expected to be filed with the neb in second quarter 2019 and pending receipt of regulatory approvals construction would start as early as third quarter 2020 the ngtl capital program excluding maintenance capital expenditures is now approximately 8 6 billion canadian mainline in december 2018 we announced the north bay junction long term fixed price service nbj ltfp which includes 670 tj d 625 mmcf d of new natural gas transportation contracts from the western canadian sedimentary basin wcsb on the canadian mainline upon neb approval of the nbj ltfp service incremental volumes under these long term fixed priced contracts will reach markets in ontario québec new brunswick nova scotia and the northeastern u s using existing capacity on the canadian mainline as well as new compression facilities customers have executed 15 year precedent agreements to proceed with the project with an estimated capital cost of 96 million we filed an application for approval of the nbj ltfp with the neb in january 2019 and expect a decision in third quarter 2019 in october 2018 we concluded the written hearing process for the canadian mainline 2018 2020 toll review with the filing of our reply evidence to the neb in december 2018 the neb 2018 decision was issued approving all elements of the application including our cost and volume forecasts higher depreciation rates and continuation of pricing discretion with the exception of the amortization period for the long term adjustment account ltaa which is now to be amortized over 2018 to 2020 the impact of the decision was reflected in lower tolls effective february 1 2019 as directed by the neb we filed a

approximately 1 4 pj d 1 3 bcf d of marcellus gas supply westbound to the gulf coast and eastbound to mid atlantic markets was placed in service in october 2018 and november 2018 for the western build and eastern build respectively mountaineer xpress and gulf xpress mountaineer xpress mxp a columbia gas project is designed to transport supply from the marcellus and utica shale plays to points along the system and to the leach interconnect with columbia gulf approximately 45 per cent of this project was placed in service on january 18 2019 with the remainder to be placed in service in february and march 2019 along with gulf xpress a columbia gulf project total estimated mxp project costs have been revised upwards to us 3 2 billion reflecting the impact of delays of various regulatory approvals from ferc and other agencies increased contractor construction costs due to unusually high demand for construction resources in the region unusually high instances of inclement weather throughout construction and modifications to contractor work plans to mitigate construction delays associated with these impacts louisiana xpress in november 2018 we sanctioned the louisiana xpress project which will connect supply directly to gulf coast lng export markets with the addition of three greenfield mid point compressor stations along columbia gulf the anticipated in service date is in 2022 and estimated project costs are us 0 4 billion bison contract terminations and asset impairment in the second half of 2018 two customers on bison elected to pay out the remainder of their future contracted revenues and terminate their associated tsas the termination of these agreements was agreed to following the receipt of us 97 million in 2018 which was recorded in revenues as the terminations released us from providing any future services this development coupled with the persistence of unfavourable market conditions which have inhibited system flows on the pipeline led us to determine that the asset s remaining carrying value was no longer recoverable and a non cash impairment charge of us 537 million was recorded in our u s natural gas pipelines segment as bison is a tc pipelines lp asset in which we have a 25 5 per cent interest this impairment charge impacts our net income by 140 million after tax and non controlling interests but is excluded from comparable earnings we continue to explore alternative transportation related options for bison tuscarora goodwill impairment in fourth quarter 2018 tuscarora finalized its regulatory approach in response to the 2018 ferc actions resulting in a reduction in its recourse rates in connection with its annual goodwill impairment analysis we evaluated tuscarora s future revenues as well as changes to other assumptions responsive to tuscarora s commercial environment in doing so we incorporated the outcome of a settlement in principle reached with its customers in january 2019 as a result of these developments we determined that the fair value of tuscarora did not exceed its carrying value including goodwill and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of us 59 million within the u s natural gas pipelines segment the remaining goodwill balance related to tuscarora at december 31 2018 was us 23 million as tuscarora is a tc pipelines lp asset in which we have a 25 5 per cent interest this impairment charge impacts our net income by 15 million after tax and non controlling interests but is excluded from comparable earnings mexico natural gas pipelines sur de texas offshore construction was completed in may 2018 and the project continues to progress toward an anticipated in service date in early second quarter 2019 an amending agreement was signed with the cfe that recognizes force majeure events and the commencement of payments of fixed capacity charges began on october 31 2018 liquids pipelines keystone xl we have secured commercial support for all available keystone xl project capacity and commenced certain pre construction activities we continue to address outstanding legal challenges regarding the project the south dakota supreme court dismissed an appeal against the certification of the project we expect the nebraska supreme court to reach a decision in the first quarter of 2019 regarding a challenge to the nebraska public service commission s route approval we continue to participate together with the u s department of justice in lawsuits commenced in montana to defend legal challenges to the u s presidential permit and the exhaustive environmental assessments that support the u s president s actions energy cartier wind in october 2018 we completed the sale of our interests in the cartier wind power facilities in québec to innergex renewable

calculate comparable measures by adjusting certain gaap measures for specific items we believe are significant but not reflective of our underlying operations in the period except as otherwise described herein these comparable measures are calculated on a consistent basis from period to period and are adjusted for specific items in each period as applicable our decision not to adjust for a specific item is subjective and made after careful consideration specific items may include certain fair value adjustments relating to risk management activities income tax refunds and adjustments to enacted tax rates gains or losses on sales of assets or assets held for sale legal contractual and bankruptcy settlements impact of regulatory or arbitration decisions relating to prior year earnings restructuring costs impairment of goodwill investments and other assets including certain ongoing maintenance and liquidation costs acquisition and integration costs we exclude the unrealized gains and losses from changes in the fair value of derivatives used to reduce our exposure to certain financial and commodity price risks these derivatives generally provide effective economic hedges but do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting as a result the changes in fair value are recorded in net income as these amounts do not accurately reflect the gains and losses that will be realized at settlement we do not consider them reflective of our underlying operations the following table identifies our non gaap measures and their most directly comparable gaap measures non gaap measure gaap

ebitda represents segmented earnings adjusted for certain specific items excluding non cash charges for depreciation and amortization we use comparable ebitda as a measure of our earnings from ongoing

comparable earnings section funds generated from operations and comparable funds generated from operations funds generated from operations reflects net cash provided by operations before changes in operating working capital we believe it is a useful measure of our consolidated operating cash flow because it does not include fluctuations from working capital balances which do not necessarily reflect underlying operations in the same period and is used to provide a consistent measure of the cash generating performance of our assets comparable funds generated from operations is adjusted for the cash impact of specific items noted above refer to the cash provided by operating activities section for a reconciliation to net cash provided by operations comparable distributable cash flow and comparable distributable cash flow per common share we believe comparable distributable cash flow is a useful supplemental measure of performance that defines cash available to common shareholders before capital allocation comparable distributable cash flow is defined as comparable funds generated from operations less preferred share dividends distributions to non controlling interests and non recoverable maintenance capital expenditures refer to the cash provided by operating activities section for a reconciliation to net cash provided by operations maintenance capital expenditures are

comparable ebitda increased by 550 million for the three months ended december 31 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 primarily due to the net effect of the following higher contribution from canadian natural gas pipelines primarily due to the recovery of increased depreciation as a result of higher rates approved in both the mainline neb 2018 decision and the ngtl 2018 2019 settlement as well as higher flow through taxes and incentive earnings higher contribution from u s natural gas pipelines mainly due to increased earnings from columbia gas and columbia gulf growth projects placed in service additional contract sales on anr and great lakes and amortization of net regulatory liabilities recognized as a result of u s tax reform higher contribution from liquids pipelines primarily due to higher volumes on the keystone pipeline system increased earnings from liquids marketing activities and earnings from intra alberta pipelines placed in service in the second half of 2017 higher

statement on the accounting and ratemaking treatment of accumulated deferred income taxes adit and treatment following the sale or retirement of an asset a policy statement excess adit policy statement addressing certain issues raised in the notice of inquiry noi issued on march 15 2018 the excess adit policy statement clarifies ferc accounts in which pipelines should record amortization of excess and or deficient adit for ferc reporting and ratemaking purposes the excess adit policy statement also addresses how to disclose reversals of adit account balances in ferc s annual financial report filings in accordance with the form 501 g filings and settlements reached with customers in response to the 2018 ferc actions the adit balances for all pipelines held wholly or in part by tc pipelines lp were eliminated from their respective rate bases therefore regulatory liabilities recorded for these assets pursuant to u s tax reform were written off resulting in a deferred income tax recovery of 115 million in fourth quarter 2018 all of our ferc regulated natural gas pipelines and storage assets have now either filed a form 501 g or an uncontested rate settlement with ferc as

president chief executive officer director thank you salli good morning and thank you to everyone for joining today s call as we begin i would like to note that we have revised our approach to our earnings call to focus more of our commentary on the factors underlying our financial results we hope you will find this helpful and as always welcome your feedback additionally we have changed our disclosure of certain guidance metrics in an effort to provide greater transparency in areas that are most relevant and predictable mark kaye will go into greater detail on the guidance changes shortly i will begin by summarizing moody s full year and fourth quarter 2018 financial results mark will then follow with comments on our outlook for 2019 after our prepared remarks we ll be happy to respond to your questions during full year 2018 moody s achieved strong results driven by robust performance at moody s analytics prudent expense management and the benefit of a lower effective tax rate offsetting weaker than expected global debt issuance in the fourth quarter full year 2018 adjusted operating margins increased across the corporation including at both moody s investor service and moody s analytics adjusted diluted eps grew 22 year over year in the fourth quarter moody s total revenue declined 9 as you are aware we experienced a difficult issuance environment with high yield bond activity the weakest since the global financial crisis ma revenue which does not correlate with debt capital markets activity grew 5 led by strong rd a performance despite top line softness in mis moody s corporation adjusted operating margin increased by 40 basis points for the quarter our improved operating leverage combined with a lower effective tax rate grew adjusted diluted eps by 8 year over year as you can see in the charts on slide 7 adjusted operating margin increased in both mis and ma by over 150 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2018 this was due to expense efficiency initiatives across both businesses lower accruals for incentive compensation in mis and the roll off of bureau van dijk s deferred revenue haircut in ma on our last earnings call we announced a restructuring plan the restructuring charge we took in the fourth quarter of 49 million exceeded our previously announced range of 30 million to 40 million due to the acceleration of staff reductions and acquisition integration which together also allowed for real estate rationalization our total restructuring program is now expected to be in the 70 million to 80 million is expected to be 70 million to 80 million through the first half of 2019 we are increasing our anticipated annualized pre tax savings to a range of 40 million to 50 million which is 10 million higher than the range we previously announced we will begin to realize the majority of the annualized run rate savings in the second half of 2019 these savings will create financial flexibility for various capital market conditions and provide options to reinvest in our business or bolster margins we believe that the restructuring charge acquisition synergies and other cost management efforts will contribute to margin stability in full year 2019 after announcing the bureau van dijk acquisition we focused on deleveraging and successfully reduced our net debt balance in 2018 in december we issued 800 million in bonds the pie chart on the right shows the 450 million was used to pay down senior notes that were coming due in july 2019 a portion of the proceeds was also used to pay down our remaining outstanding term loan in commercial paper as a result of this financing we do not have further debt maturing until september 2020 in the fourth quarter of 2018 issuance was impacted by a variety of geopolitical and macroeconomic concerns leading to market and interest rate volatility as well as widening spreads notably there was no u s high yield bond issuance activity in december even with these challenges economic fundamentals remained sound in developed markets with stable u s and european economic growth and unemployment rates at multiyear lows the drop in global debt issuance of almost 30 in the fourth quarter of 2018 led to a smaller decline in mis revenue of 18 demonstrating the strength of the business model mis revenue was buttressed ph through its recurring revenue base which was supported by increased monitoring fees from recent new mandates as well as pricing for ma total revenue grew 5 in the fourth quarter or 7 excluding the negative impact from foreign exchange rd a revenue grew 17 due to bureau van dijk strength in the core business and contribution from the reis acquisition bureau van dijk added 90 million of revenue in the fourth quarter at a 48 2 adjusted operating margin as expected ers revenue declined by 17 in the quarter as we continued the transition to a software as a service or saas operating model we anticipate ers revenue growth to resume in 2019 i would like to provide additional details about our progress with the saas transition in ers the charts on this slide illustrates 2018 s slight decline in total revenue as 15 growth in subscription revenue was offset by a 28 decline in one time revenue from software licenses and services due to the shift in product mix recurring revenue as a share of total ers as a percent of the total ers business reached 77 in 2018 up from 69 at the end of 2017 expansion of the recurring revenue base will drive ers revenue growth in 2019 despite our expectation of a further contraction in one time revenues this year s revenue outlook is supported by 12 growth in 2018 sales of subscription products which lifted aggregate ers sales by 6 despite a 10 decline in sales of one time software licenses and services the acceleration in total ers sales growth since early 2018 indicates that we have worked through the inflection point in the saas transition importantly the expansion of our subscription business enhances the profitability of ers contributing to our expectation of further improvement in ma s adjusted operating margin in 2019 in terms of business fundamentals our outlook for ers reflects solid demand from banks and insurers for analytical tools that enable adoption of new accounting standards and next generation products that support automation trends before turning the call all over to mark to discuss our full year 2019 outlook i d like to take a moment to review moody s ongoing strategic priorities we continued to defend and enhance our core ratings and research businesses while pursuing strategic growth opportunities both down the corporate credit pyramid and across into new geographies and adjacent product areas we are focused on providing information insights solutions and standards to promote market transparency and fairness both are necessary conditions for market confidence which in turn supports healthy financial markets over time underpinning these efforts we are enhancing our technology infrastructure to enable automation innovation and efficiency and remain supportive of a diverse and inclusive workforce our recent acquisition of reis which closed on october 15th 2018 is a good example of expansion into an adjacent product area reis a leading provider of u s commercial real estate or cre data has built an unique data set over 40 years we have observed growing demand from our asset management banking and insurance customers for a reliable source of integrated information and analytics to support management of their substantial exposures to cre by combining reis proprietary data with ma s specialized expertise moody s is powerfully positioned to meet the need for standards that enhance operational efficiency and analytical precision in this market i ll now turn the call over to mark to review our outlook for 2019 mark kaye senior vice president and chief financial officer thank you ray as i alluded to at an industry conference in late 2018 we are enhancing the transparency around certain of our guidance metrics while at the same time curtailing other metrics where we feel there is less value to providing them or they are inherently difficult at accurately predict for 2019 we have added mis and ma adjusted operating margin segment guidance as well as net interest expense guidance we ve removed revenue guidance at the sub segment or line of business level i want to emphasize that our reporting of actual results will remain unchanged and in particular we will keep reporting sub segment revenue results every quarter in our earnings press releases and in our sec filings moody s outlook for 2019 is based on assumptions about many geopolitical conditions and macroeconomic and capital market factors including but not limited to interest in foreign currency exchange rates corporate profitability and business investment spending mergers and acquisition and the level of their capital markets activity these assumptions are subject to uncertainty and results for the year could differ materially from our current outlook our guidance assumes foreign currency translation at the end of the fourth quarter 2018 exchange rates specifically our forecast reflects exchange rates for the british pound of 1 27 and for the euro of 1 14 slide 18 outlines a variety of drivers we considered when setting our 2019 guidance i will mention a few key items now for mis we believe that stable economic fundamentals of gdp growth of 2 to 3 in the u s and 1 to 2 in europe will underpin global debt issuance activity however market volatility may moderate the pace of new mandates and cause variability in annual global debt issuance for ma product innovations will enable sustained core rd a growth ers revenue growth should resume as the transition from licenses and services to saas based products has passed the inflection point we remain on track to achieve our bureau van dijk run rate synergy target of approximately 45 million by year end 2019 as ray outlined earlier companywide annualized pre tax savings as a result of our restructuring activities are now anticipated to be in the 40 million to 50 million range with an estimated pre tax savings of 30 million to 35 million in 2019 we will continue to strategically manage our real estate footprint and hiring activities as you can see from this slide we have been able to achieve high single digit revenue growth over the last four years and concurrently grow the adjusted operating margin by 170 basis points this has allowed us to generate incremental free cash flow for 2019 we are forecasting revenue growth in the mid single digit percent range and adjusted operating margin of approximately 48 and free cash flow in the range of 1 6 billion to 1 7 billion despite our flat to down issuance outlook listed here are additional items for moody s guidance in 2019 a complete list of moody s guidance is included in table 13 of our fourth quarter 2018 earnings press release which can be found in moody s investor relations website at ir moodys com in 2019 we forecast global debt issuance to be flat to down 5 driven by volatility and spread widening relative to 2018 we also expect moderating m a new clo formation and refinancing of leverage debt the chart on the right shows our forecast for slower pace of new mandates in 2019 relative to the past two years these headwinds will be partially offset by an expanding global economy deployment of investor cash balances and low credit defaults upcoming refinancing needs and the already announced 2019 m a transactions provide a base for upcoming issuance activity for mis we expect total revenue to increase in the low single digit percent range as we execute on our ability to grow revenue despite the issuance headwind i just spoke about we project that capital market conditions will be more constructive and in the fourth quarter of 2018 we believe that the full year 2019 market environment will be more difficult on average than 2018 overall we see positive economic fundamentals moderating declines in m a and refinancing activity tighter investment grade and speculative grade spreads along with still low albeit slightly rising default rates should support more constructive issuance markets in the second half of the year in the last few weeks issuance markets have improved following the federal reserve s recent announcement we have seen healthy u s investment grade issuance activity and the return of u s speculative grade issuers to the market following a historically slow december month we will continue to monitor monitory policy along with other macro and geopolitical factors affecting the credit markets we expect mis adjusted operating margin to be approximately 58 in 2019 we will manage our expense base and implement technology to increase efficiency in our ratings processes however we also have to account for a reset of the incentive compensation pullback to 100 assuming of course we meet our full year operating target we are investing in the mis business to support our strategy of expansion into the chinese and latin american markets pursuing opportunities in adjacencies and enhancing our technology infrastructure for ma we expect total revenue to increase in the low double digit percent range underpinned by strong sales growth in the second half of 2018 we anticipate broad based strength across all product areas and businesses the drag from fx will be offset by the acquired growth from omega performance and reis that ph constant dollar organic growth is also projected to increase in the low double digit percent range we anticipate ma s adjusted operating margin increasing 250 basis points to 350 basis points to the 29 to 30 range in 2019 this improvement has several primary drivers including a combination from strong sales growth at bureau van dijk and the ers transition to more saas based offerings which improves both recurring revenue and earnings predictability ongoing discipline in expense management further underpins ma s margin expansion which is bolstered by the role of bureau van dijk s deferred revenue haircut in 2019 we plan to return capital through 1 billion of share repurchases and an annualized dividend of 2 per share today moody s is pleased to announce a 500 million accelerated share repurchase program that will be completed during the second quarter of 2019 in addition on february 12th moody s board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of 0 50 per share of moody s common stock a 14 increase from the prior quarterly dividend of 0 44 per share this dividend will be payable on the 18th of march to stockholders of record at the close of business on the 25th of february this increased dividend is in line with our target dividend payout ratio of 25 to 30 of adjusted net income before turning to q a i would like to note a few principal takeaways we are confident in moody s ability to deliver revenue growth and drive productivity gains to support strong margins in 2019 despite the relatively weakened global debt issuance outlook we continue to invest in custom offerings of information insights and solutions and standards that enhance market transparency finally we will maintain our disciplined and thoughtful approach to capital management raymond w mcdaniel president chief executive officer director thank you mark this concludes our prepared remarks and joining mark and me for the question and answer session are mark almeida president of moody s analytics and rob fauber president of moody s investors service we d be pleased to take any questions you may have questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions and our first question comes from toni kaplan with morgan stanley please go ahead toni kaplan morgan stanley analyst hi good morning thank you rob i was hoping you could give some additional color on the issuance environment and sort of the drivers in terms of the flat to down low single that you ve called out and especially one thing i wanted was curious about was you saw some really big moves in spreads in the fourth quarter as well as at the beginning of this year in some really short periods of time and so just wanted to get a sense of in your experience what does that mean for the issuance environment so that d be super helpful thank you mark kaye senior vice president and chief financial officer toni this is mark rob and i are going to jointly share some commentary on this particular question as we think it s important to give both the bank perspective from what we re hearing as well as our internal view in terms of bank feedback that we re hearing for both u s and europe and in particular for the u s we have three key points that have been quite pervasive effective capital market conditions have obviously improved since december and the issuance activity has remained relatively modest thus far we are anticipating or at least the banks are anticipating large cash repatriated to return to the market in late 2019 and that would certainly help investment grade and then lastly in relation to the u s m a still is a driver for issuance activity in 2019 but the banks expect this to be down from elevated 2018 levels in terms of what we re hearing from the banks in terms of feedback for europe a hard brexit does remain a potential driver of downside overall investor demand does remain healthy but there is some concerned redemand for baa2 or below issuance following the ecb s halt of corporate sector repurchase program and then lastly from the banks in relation to europe strong reverse the yankee issuance and it s possible due to favorable relative value dynamic of the euro versus the u s dollar robert fauber president moody s investors service and so maybe mark let me add on to that and toni triangulating to that 0 to flat to down 5 outlook so there s a few components of that that go into our overall build so starting with corporate finance there we re expecting some slight declines in the investment grade space modest declines in bank loans and we think that ll be driven in part by less opportunistic refinancing the u s high yield market we actually think we may see an increase in issuance there given the spread tightening from the fourth quarter where the yield curve is and also some very very light 2018 comparables as mark mentioned m a we think will still be an important issuance driver but we don t think it s going to be down off of 2018 2018 i think is the third strongest year on record so we think that ll be down something in the neighborhood of 10 or so for financial institutions we d expect issuance to be slightly lower in part you may remember from the earnings calls through the course of this last year us talking about european banks building up levels of bail in able capital so we actually think that that s going to slow down and will provide some headwind to financial institution issuance we also had some very strong m a driven issuance out of the insurance sector in the past year well moving on to the ppif segment here we actually think we ll see some moderately higher issuance and that s driven primarily by the growth in issuance out of the u s public finance sector and you may recall that was effectively the issuance there was effectively rebased after the loss of all that advanced refunding volume in 2018 that was associated with the tax law changes and we re actually seeing some good activity in terms of new money transactions there and finally in structured finance looking at kind of a modest decline driven really primarily by our outlook on clo activity we ve had now two years of very strong not only new clo formation but a lot of refi activity and so we think that this decline in clo activity is going to be somewhat offset by increases in some of the other sectors really that are underpinned by economic growth and then we triangulate all this obviously with the wall street banks and we think this is pretty consistent with the outlooks across the street let me also talk about address your second point about these rapid spread moves and i guess as we saw spreads blow out in the fourth quarter and saw the leverage finance markets seize up to some extent we re scratching our heads like i think a lot of people were because we re looking at the underlying fundamentals and you still had economic growth you had low unemployment you had low default rates and so i guess our view was that this was a this was temporary this was going to pass we ve seen other quarters like this you know you think back to the first quarter of 2016 issues around china and commodities and oil prices and so on so our view is that this was going to pass this was kind of a i guess i would call a cyclical air pocket albeit a very hard air pocket operator and our next question comes from manav patnaik with barclays please go ahead manav patnaik barclays investment bank analyst thank you very much i guess my first question was more around the restructuring efforts and more than just the current restructuring you ve kind of already talked about last quarter i was just wondering how to think about it long term in terms of where all do you see the buckets of opportunity and how we should think about how you could flex that should the top line environment get tough raymond w mcdaniel president chief executive officer director yeah manav it s ray i ll start and mark may have some additional comments but what is underpinning some of the activities that have gone into our current restructuring is relates to the acquisitions we ve made and rationalizing some of the costs post acquisition so obviously if we do any more m a activity we would be looking for the same kind of rationalizations beyond that though we ve been very focused on what we can do as far as onshore and offshore labor and what we can do with automation and robotic processes those will be part of the story going forward for us as i think they will for obviously many firms and so there will be opportunities in the future but in terms of a large restructuring action i don t think we re going to be a serial restructurer we re going to be looking for efficiencies and opportunities outside of formal restructurings mark kaye senior vice president and chief financial officer i was going to add just in terms of numbers to supplement ray s remarks so firstly we anticipate the action will be substantially complete by the end of june and they will allow for an expected pre tax savings amount in 2019 of 30 million to 35 million and then starting in 2020 we do expect annualized pre tax savings of between 40 million and 50 million which is 10 million more than what we announced previously in october and then lastly as you can see in our guidance reconciliation we do estimate an approximate 0 10 per share impact from the first half 2009 restructuring charge in our full year 2019 gaap eps numbers manav patnaik barclays investment bank analyst got it and if i could just follow up on that point so i guess these efficiencies that you re talking about going forward anyway to quantify how to think about how that impacts the margin or the cost profile just any color there would be helpful thank you raymond w mcdaniel president chief executive officer director yeah i think that at a high level this is these opportunities are why we do not see any plateauing of the margin opportunities at either mis or moody s analytics over time we think that we ve got room for margin expansion it s going to be ongoing subject of course to variability in the top line but that is part of the plan operator our next question comes from alex kramm with ubs please go ahead alex kramm ubs analyst hi hello everyone just wanted to come back to the guidance and maybe this is for ray but just wondering how much how your confidence level is on the mis side around this guidance and i know it s a difficult question to answer but you think about the last few years i think you ve gotten a reputation to be very conservative and then at the end of the day the market was just a lot better and you have outperformed and most recently obviously if you just look at the fourth quarter which was i know once in a blue moon environment but clearly it was completely different than what everybody had thought so just wondering as we approach maybe the end of the cycle if the confidence level that you personally have is just a lot lower or how you would kind of gauge the range of outcomes that 2019 could actually bring raymond w mcdaniel president chief executive officer director well alex i guess one way to answer the question about my level of confidence would be that we have decided to eliminate the sub segment or line of business guidance so i ve been dealing with over the past years i ve been dealing with the fact that we have underestimated and overestimated and we re trying to focus you and ourselves on things that are more in our control and those things that are more predictable that being said we have done a lot of work in support of the outlook that we put out at the mis level there will always be more uncertainty around mis than i think we have around moody s analytics because it is very capital market sensitive and so there are just externalities driving that business that are themselves cyclical so robert fauber president moody s investors service yeah and maybe alex i could maybe add in terms of the upsides and downsides as we see them to the outlook and maybe that will help you out a little bit and maybe for a change i ll start with the potential upsides if we see some real spread tightening and that s obviously continuation of the trend that we ve seen in january i mean that could attract some more opportunistic issuance and more refinancing activity that would obviously be positive you combine now the fact that investors have got some significant cash balances and that could be constructive for the issuance environment and of course private equity firms are sitting on huge amounts of capital still to deploy and that we think is going to provide some support for the m a volumes now on the down side to some extent the inverse of what i just described but if we don t see some spread tightening from here that s clearly going to provide a headwind to what we re thinking about for the year and of course if equity market volatility picks back up that s not good for the high yield market and that is an area that we have been looking at for potential growth this year and then lastly just thinking about things like a disorderly brexit or chinese u s trade discussions of course present the opportunity to have some sort of market dislocation and we haven t factored that into our outlook alex kramm ubs analyst okay that was fair thank you i know it s uncertain and maybe just specifically rob i know this is a small business but you when you went through the kind of outlook more specifically on the public side you mentioned that you still see a little bit a very robust i guess come back in 2019 i saw a six months survey i think at the end of december where a lot of the municipals actually said that they still expect issuance to be done further in 2019 just wondering if i don t know if you saw the same thing but just wondering if you could kind of square those maybe different outlooks a little bit or what gives you confidence in that business i know it s small but just curious robert fauber president moody s investors service yeah i mean i guess in general you think about the advanced refundings and that was like 20 to 30 of total issuance volume and that got taken out of the market in 2018 so like i said you re kind of rebasing off of that we have seen some new money financings which we feel good about so i understand we you know there s a bit of a bid ask on some of these issuance outlook but in general that s what we re seeing i guess i would also say you know through the first month of the year we re seeing relatively healthy public finance volumes raymond w mcdaniel president chief executive officer director and our comments earlier were that we expect that to be moderately higher so it s not at a situation where we expect issuance to be exploding operator and our next question is with peter appert with piper jaffray please go ahead peter appert piper jaffray analyst thanks good morning so since i ve whined about the margins at ma in the last few quarters i wanted to call out kudos to mr almeida for the better results and the positive momentum going into 2019 and specifically i was hoping mark you could give us some more granularity on the drivers of that margin improvement how much is a function of the turn at ers how much is it a function of bvd any additional color you can provide mark e almeida president moody s analytics sure peter i think you ve hit on the big ones we have been doing a lot of work in the ers business over a number of years the we expect the top line to come back nicely in ers in 2019 so that ll help and we re managing expenses very rigorously there so ers is contributing the bureau van dijk business will be contributing and we ve been taking actions across the ma business for some period of time so i think all of those things are contributing to the continued margin expansion that we re delivering in 2019 and the acceleration in that expansion so it s really very much across the board peter appert piper jaffray analyst mark in terms of where you see the upside then i mean what do you think is reasonable over the next several years in terms of run rate profitability in this business mark e almeida president moody s analytics well you know we ve said for some time that pardon me that we expect continued gradual expansion in the margin i think of course it s going to depend sensitively on what we re able to do on the top line but obviously we re guiding to a very good year on the top line this year and i think we re in a good position to be able to continue to generate strong growth in the business and that should allow us to continue to deliver margin expansion operator and our next question comes from george tong with goldman sachs please go ahead george tong goldman sachs analyst hi thanks good morning given your expectations of a flat to down 5 issuance environment this year can you talk about how you expect pricing to perform in the ratings business relative to last year raymond w mcdaniel president chief executive officer director yeah i think we ve talked before about the fact that we have pricing opportunities averaging 3 to 4 and that assumes that issuance is flat so if issuance is down 2 3 4 it s going to have an impact some of our pricing adjustments are unrelated to debt issuance but some of them do relate to debt issuance so we will have to be managing that carefully if there s a decline in debt issuance from 2018 it will have some impact nonetheless we will have contribution from price this year i think regardless of whether there is a decline or not in issuance george tong goldman sachs analyst that s helpful one of your competitors recently received clearance to rate debt securities in china can you give us an update on your strategy in china and if you have similar plans to expand beyond your jv to independently rate that there raymond w mcdaniel president chief executive officer director sure happy to offer a few comments and rob may want to remark on this as well we have a different business position than other international rating agencies in china we have been there since 2006 via a very successful joint venture we are pleased with our equity position we re pleased with the position that ccxi our joint venture holds in the chinese market moody s has over 400 ratings on chinese entities that are active in the cross border market our joint venture has ratings on over 1 000 domestic market issuers in china so we feel that we re in very good position having a joint venture that is licensed already and in fact it s licensed in both the interbank and the exchange traded markets that doesn t mean that we don t want to do more in china and we have put in an application for providing global cross border ratings for the domestic market issuance and we think that this is an opportunity really not just for mis but for moody s analytics and our combined businesses to provide a whole suite of products and services to the domestic chinese market whether it s through moody s analytics moody s investor service or ccxi so i m actually quite excited about the opportunity and we are going to continue our dialogue with regulators and issuers and the investors to make sure we re offering what in fact the chinese want as part of their policy agenda and market opening operator and our next question comes from tim mchugh with william blair please go ahead timothy mchugh william blair analyst thanks on ers excuse me you talked about kind of maybe on a multiyear basis how close are you to i guess seeing the services part of that revenue mix i guess bottom out or stabilize i imagine you always have some within the mix so how far away are we from that mark e almeida president moody s analytics tim it s mark you re right we will have to continue to have some we think we re pretty much at a level that we will sustain for the foreseeable future we ll probably see a bit of contraction on that line moving forward this year but it s going to be much more shallow a decline than what we ve seen in 2018 so i guess the way i would say it is that line is stabilizing sort of flattening around the current level and so the acceleration in revenue growth from the subscription side of the business will drive overall growth in ers timothy mchugh william blair analyst and 2020 and 2021 should be even cleaner in theory i guess from that factor mark e almeida president moody s analytics yeah exactly all things being equal i would expect that that would continue to be the case over the coming years timothy mchugh william blair analyst okay and then on incentive compensation i know you talk about qualitatively on margins that there s a headwind from returning to 100 payout i guess how can you give us a q4 incentive comp number and i guess what is trying to understand how much of a headwind that is i guess what s a 100 payout or kind of normal for you now mark e almeida president moody s analytics sure very happy to provide the fourth quarter incentive compensation number was 29 million it s worth noting that was meaningfully down on a year over year basis compared to the fourth quarter 2017 by around 60 or so and so if you re thinking about looking on a go forward basis i would recommend around 50 million ish a quarter for 2019 operator and our next question comes from craig huber with huber research partners please go ahead craig huber huber research partners analyst yes good morning i ve got a couple of questions ray or rob i m just curious on your updated thoughts as you think about sort of u s markets corporate debt levels out there in terms of looking at the debt ratios in aggregate looking at the absolute debt that s outstanding there did you see anything that s in your mind that you feel is unsafe it s getting to extreme levels is a question we get a lot from investors and i have a follow up thank you raymond w mcdaniel president chief executive officer director the short answer is no we there has been some increase in leverage but there s also been a strong economic environment which has supported profitability so while there has been some additional leverage in the market i think really probably the more interesting question craig is over the last 12 24 months the opening of the market and the receptivity to increasingly low rated credits and if there were to be a hiccup in the economy a recession that s where i would be paying attention to potential problems craig huber huber research partners analyst and ray do you feel the same way about that about europe as well raymond w mcdaniel president chief executive officer director well in terms of where to look for potential problems yes although the european high yield market is not of the same scale as the u s high yield market and the issuance has not broadened as a general statement has not gone as deep in the ratings scale as it has in the united states that being said there s also been less additional leverage put on companies in europe than in the u s operator and our next question comes from joseph foresi with cantor fitzgerald please go ahead joseph foresi cantor fitzgerald analyst hi i know this is going to be a real difficult question to ask but i ll throw it out there anyways typically you ve talked about sort of gdp as being core to issuance growth but when there are quarters where there s a lot of economic volatility clearly that changes given the sort of present political climate kind of domestically and internationally i m wondering how are you able to risk adjust the numbers around that volatility maybe you could just talk a little bit about how that takes place raymond w mcdaniel president chief executive officer director yeah joe i m glad you asked the question because i think it s important to emphasize that when we talk about the growth in global debt as being roughly in line with gdp we are talking about over multiyear periods there is certainly going to be dislocations and variations on a short term basis so we have to deal with that and i really wouldn t talk about growth in debt being aligned with gdp in this quarter or even necessarily in 2019 i don t know if my colleagues have anything they want to add to that but it s a long term metric joseph foresi cantor fitzgerald analyst got it and then just in the enterprise risk business maybe mark could spend a little bit of time describing for us what this transformation from services to software feels like on a sort of a day to day basis are you canceling projects or rewriting contracts is there a certain percentage that are converting or not converting just so we can understand i know you ve kind of described how far we are through it but how do those conversations work sort of daily and maybe you can give us some color on how far we re through and then just how you see 2019 playing out mark e almeida president moody s analytics sure i mean it s really a question of product strategy where we have migrated our product from what was previously a traditional software licensing and implementation services business to much more of standard product typically delivered in a hosted environment that is typically on the cloud where we are allowing customers to subscribe to those products the works that we have to do to implement the product to put it into production for a given customer is simpler it s cheaper for the customer it s cheaper for us doesn t take nearly as much time nearly as much customization so it s a it s really migrating from what has been traditionally lots of customization of products from customer to customer installed on the customer s equipment behind their firewalls so everything was quite bespoke and moving to again much more standard product where all customers have access to the same code base so it s very consistent with our mantra of build once sell many times sell it on a subscription basis so you have a recurring revenue so it s really not i mean there is some migration of customers from old installed product to new hosted product sold on a subscription basis we do have that in certain areas and that s a process that takes place over a period of time but a lot of this is just frankly it s consistent with what customers want customers are demanding this they re expecting this increasingly and this is how our customers want to buy software solutions from people like us so it s really adapting our product offering to the needs of the market and frankly that just that fits very well with our desire to run the business on a more of a subscription basis where we find the economics much more attractive so the transition from the old to the new is a little cumbersome and you get some you get the kinds of results that we saw in 2018 where the run off in the old software licensing and services business preceded the ramp up in the revenue growth from the growing base of subscriptions that we ve got but again when we say we re through that through the transition or through the inflection point we feel like the decline in the one time revenues will now be slower than the ramp up in the acceleration in revenue from subscriptions is that responsive joseph foresi cantor fitzgerald analyst that makes sense thank you operator and our next question comes from jim ph silber with bmo capital markets please go ahead jeffrey silber bmo capital analyst thanks so much that s close enough typically every quarter somebody asks you to update your m a thoughts so i guess i would do that this quarter raymond w mcdaniel president chief executive officer director well as we talked about in our prepared remarks we are committed to expanding the business both geographically and in terms of what parts of the credit markets we serve and adjacent product areas that are looking for risk assessments of one kind or another and look like they would attract standards providers if we see good assets along any of those three dimensions we would certainly be interested in them we have been very pleased with the acquisitions that we have made over the past number of years but we ve also been very disciplined about trying to do that so we look at a lot more than we try to execute on and certainly a lot more than we successfully execute on so i don t feel like we have must acquire businesses in order to fill out our product and service portfolio but if we see attractive assets we re going to try to make them a part of moody s mark kaye senior vice president and chief financial officer and jeff just to add on to that more broadly we have a very disciplined approach that we adopt to capital allocation and certainly not just looking at m a opportunities but a number of opportunities internally to invest in our existing businesses to support organic growth and then to the extent that we don t meet our return criteria we obviously engage in the return of capital either ph through dividends which we spoke about this morning or through share repurchases jeffrey silber bmo capital analyst all right great and if i could just get into the weeds a little bit on my follow up regarding your guidance i appreciate the new way you re guiding revenues but just on the m a side excuse me the moody s analytics side if i look at the impact of reis and the omega performance acquisition is that all coming in the u s or is there some of non u s impact as well mark e almeida president moody s analytics reis is a 100 u s omega is it s quite international it has a big chunk of u s it also has a sizable business in outside the u s particularly in asia having said that bear in mind that omega performance is a relatively small business so it just it frankly it doesn t move the needle dramatically for ma overall jeffrey silber bmo capital analyst okay great thanks so much operator and our next question comes from bill warmington with wells fargo please go ahead william warmington wells fargo analyst good morning everyone and welcome back to salli so a question on the on bvd i just wanted to ask about the growth rate there and while that continues to be in the low double digits and what s been driving that in terms of products geographies is cross selling starting to play a role raymond w mcdaniel president chief executive officer director yeah bill bvd is performing very very well we took a big hit due to fx in the fourth quarter probably lost about 300 basis points on that business due to fx in the fourth quarter but the underlying business is performing quite well we talked about this before but we ve seen a very nice acceleration in sales growth in that business since we acquired it and that continues to be the case and i think it s a function of a number of things i mean frankly the business it s just a very good business the number of customer use cases to which the bureau van dijk data can be applied is expanding there are some very interesting new opportunities that we are getting good traction with in the bureau van dijk space and in addition we re starting to have some good cross selling successes as well so we re very pleased with what we re seeing there and we expect to see on the revenue line we expect to see nice acceleration this year william warmington wells fargo analyst and then for my second question i wanted to ask about new mandates in mis and whether that was whether it was still strong in the fourth quarter even during the tough december and how those are shaping up in q1 robert fauber president moody s investors service so this is rob new mandates they did decelerate in the fourth quarter from the third quarter and something in the range of about 10 and versus the fourth quarter of 2017 they were down close to 20 now that s not nearly as sharply as the decline in the leverage finance markets around the world and it was interesting so despite the slowdown we had 2018 was a very strong year for first time mandate acquisition actually we exceeded the prior year by i believe two first time mandates now not all of these first time mandates ended up topping the market because of the disruption at the end of the market but all of that sets up recurring revenue very nicely for us into 2019 and interestingly when you look at the fourth quarter of 2018 we actually saw growth in first time mandates in the united states versus the prior year quarter and then all the other regions were down fairly meaningfully we think we re going to see some contraction in first time mandate acquisition in 2019 in a range of something like 900 and that s down from just under one 1 050 this year but i think we had in the slides you can see looking even looking at the 900 and you compare back to 2016 still quite a healthy increase over those numbers raymond w mcdaniel president chief executive officer director yeah and if you go back earlier than 2016 it becomes even more stark in terms of the ramp up in new mandates operator and our next question comes from dan dolev with nomura please go ahead dan dolev nomura analyst yeah it s actually it s dan dolev thanks for taking my question so if you guys look across you re kind of guiding for about 1 billion of repurchases which is five times bigger than what you did in 2018 i mean the first question is are you kind of are you limiting your ability to sort of beat and raise by already putting in that much repurchase in the guide and then kind of as a mini follow up to that question like if you kind of look through the entire p l like where do you think there is the most conservative at this point that s baked into that thank you mark kaye senior vice president and chief financial officer sure and thank you very much for the question dan i d like to maybe reiterate in 2018 we really executed on the deleveraging or deleveraging associated with the bureau van dijk acquisition and that was principally responsible for the lower relative share amount of share repurchases in 2018 versus historical years in 2019 we re certainly returning again in the absence of investment in growth opportunity either through reinvestments back into the business or acquisitions that meet return profile to use the share repurchase as a mechanism to return cash back to our shareholders in terms of the impact to the eps growth rate from 2018 to 2019 it s around 2 ish percentage points and certainly we would see that as a best estimate while not conservative not aggressive very much down the middle of the road from our guidance dan dolev nomura analyst and then in terms of sort of the conservatism in if you look across the p l where do you think your assumption would be the most conservative where do you see yourself kind of like surprising in 2019 raymond w mcdaniel president chief executive officer director well dan just looking at if you look at the size of the different components of our business and the fact that mis has more cyclicality to it that s where you would look for upside and the largest business in mis is the corporate ratings business and in particular the speculative grade business where the market psychology becomes to get money now rather than in 2020 or 2021 that s the biggest opportunity for a pull forward of debt so that s not that i think we ve put in a conservative approach but if you re looking for where is the upside that s just the biggest pool operator and our next question comes from craig huber with huber research partners please go ahead craig huber huber research partners analyst yes hi i have a follow up ray or rob if you look back on 2018 what s your best estimate here how much of an impact do the tax law change the u s made let s say to high yield debt issuance in the year and how much of a headwind do you think that actually hurt raymond w mcdaniel president chief executive officer director i don t think that was much of a headwind craig we ve talked about before that the limits on interest deductibility really would only have an effect at the low end of the respective ph grade range and even then it only has a modest impact so it certainly didn t discourage issuance in the first half last year by low rated issuers and then in terms of cash repatriation that s pretty concentrated with large investment grade credits particularly in the tech area again does not have much of an impact on spec grade because they don t have large cash pools overseas for the most part so you d have to count it as a headwind but i would not count it as a material headwind for last year or this year robert fauber president moody s investors service maybe just to put a couple of numbers around it too if you look at investment grade issuance in the united states and this is to the tax repatriation issue from 2015 to 2017 there s big large offshore cash holders representing something like a quarter of u s investment grade issuance it was a big number that essentially all dried up in 2018 and the 15 largest cash holders closed out 2018 really without accessing the bond market in any meaningful way and they ve raised something like 130 billion in 2017 and we re not expecting in our the outlook that we re particular we re not expecting issuance out of that group in 2019 craig huber huber research partners analyst and then also guys when you think about your debt issuance for the year outlook i guess down flat to down maybe 5 i assume you re thinking they ll be tilted much better than in the back half of the year potentially worse in the first half is that a fair statement sort of cadence for the year how do you see it playing out raymond w mcdaniel president chief executive officer director yeah and certainly the comparables are much more challenging in the first half of the year than in the second half of the year so i think i would still expect to see the sawtooth pattern as we have as we typically see but with the real year on year challenges coming in the first half and so in that respect you might look back to 2016 for a comparison of issuance stuff operator and our next question comes from alex kramm with ubs please go ahead alex kramm ubs analyst yeah hey thanks for letting me on again just a couple of quick follow ups for mark sorry if i this was asked already on the tax rates did you flesh out why the tax rate is lower than i think you got it last year and then just related to that can you just outline the share based comp s benefit that you getting and how that should play out in terms of seasonality i mean last year or last few years the first quarter is usually pretty big but any sort of color you can give us from a margin perspective there would be helpful thanks mark kaye senior vice president and chief financial officer sure so i ll address the tax rate question first 2018 effective tax rate was 21 and that was probably lower especially in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2018 really driven by non u s earnings and lower u s taxes on the release of an irs notice that clarified certain elements of the u s tax reform for 2019 we are guiding to 21 to 22 which is higher than the actual tax rate in 2018 and we re doing that primarily because of the expectation of lower excess tax benefit now you ll recall in 2018 in the first quarter that around 38 million of excess tax benefit that we anticipate probably having half of that this year in 2019 and that s really what s driving the higher guided tax rate in 2019 compared to the actual rate in 2018 alex kramm ubs analyst okay great and secondly real quick also and i don t know if this came up but i think when you took over as cfo you kind of talked about corporate cost allocation and maybe your philosophy being a little bit different is there has anything changed so far as you think about now that you re breaking out the margin for the two businesses is any of that driven by maybe thinking about that a little bit different or still to come potentially mark kaye senior vice president and chief financial officer sure alex that thank you for the question that is something that we continue to think about as a management team and certainly did incorporate into our views of margin guidance expansion for both ma and mis for 2019 i would add that is it is not material to those two numbers as guided operator and mr ray mcdaniel there are no further questions at this time raymond w mcdaniel president chief executive officer director okay just want to thank everyone for joining us on the call today and we look forward to speaking to you again in the spring thank you operator this

two major divorces are in the making in march the obvious one is brexit which officially occurs on march 29 the other is the deadline for the us china trade negotiations on march 1 when us tariffs on usd 200 billion worth of chinese imports will increase from 10 percent to 25 percent even though a trade deal is likely as both sides want to have a deal and the market is expecting one this will come down to the wire as the gap in what can be achieved in the deal is still daunting both negotiations have profound implications for years to come like all divorces the disagreements are acrimonious with second and third order costs on everyone else involved so far britain seems to be bracing for a major slowdown deal or no deal the british statistics office reported that the british economy grew only 0 2 percent during the fourth quarter of 2018 with growth falling in december as bank of england governor mark carney warned in his global outlook this week the global expansion is now weakening and risks are intensifying because global monetary policy has been tightening trade tensions increasing and china is also slowing the more important risk he identified is the reversal of globalisation caused by growing imbalance on the trade side due to the continued us current account deficit in a situation when the us dollar has been more dominant than ever interesting enough the chinese are no longer major buyers of dollars as their foreign exchange reserves have remained flat whereas going forward the us current account deficit will be funded more than ever by the japanese through their quantitative easing and also the eurozone expect us trade pressure also on japan and the eurozone the second globalisation risk is social with greater imbalance in income and wealth in many countries because the benefits of free trade are shared unequally consumers overall benefit from global trade but many workers in advanced countries have either lost their jobs or seen a fall in real wages the third globalisation risk is the loss of control and trust in democracy and sovereignty in many countries part of the problem is that barriers to trade have increased three times higher for services than for products and this hurts countries that are strong in the services trade such as the united states and the united kingdom this is where the growing protectionism is going to hurt everyone the bank of england estimates that an increase in tariffs of 10 percentage points between us and its trading partners would take 2 5 percent of us output and 1 percent off global output through just the trade channel alone if non trade factors are taken into account such as tighter financial conditions greater uncertainty and permanent tariff increases the output losses could double to 5 percent for us gdp and half that for global gdp it is thus not surprising that despite the recovery in the advanced economies business sector investments have not increased commensurately indeed uk business investments growth has fallen by 3 7 percent in the last year despite a recovery in growth profits and accommodative monetary policy carney s conclusion is that it isn t easy to win a trade war what is true for brexit is also true for us china trade disputes the barriers to reconciliation are huge because there are now fundamental differences in outlook approaches and territorial sovereignty on both sides of the atlantic english channel and the pacific business confidence cannot be good because in the case of investors in britain no one can predict with any certainty what deal is going to be struck including the possibility of a no deal either way investors will take on a low risk approach by avoiding long term investments and sticking to cash there is little doubt that in the short run britain will be the loser but with a flexible exchange rate she will be able to cushion any long term trade shocks with a competitive sterling at the same time the eurozone which sells a large portion of its cars and other products to britain would also have to deal with a trade shock on top of the internal complexities of keeping the union intact the yellow vest protests in france has weakened the ability of the french government to negotiate strongly with the germans on european fiscal discipline issues at a time when the italians are now making very different noises from the other partners on austerity immigration and foreign policy issues in the pacific zone the longer the us china trade tensions persist the worse will be the investment climate overall the major trading partners of both nations do not wish to make clear partnership choices given the huge potential size of the china market and limits to the growth in the mature us market what is unspoken at the present moment is that if no deal is made exchange rate flexibility of the rmb cannot be ruled out no one wants to go this route because a competitive devaluation as the solution to a trade war can only lead to another global recession that is reminiscent of the 1930s so even though the west worries like carney about the risk of china s debt overhang the reality is that if china truly undertakes the structural reforms that almost everyone agrees on she will emerge more productive and competitive than before even in the face of higher trade tariffs with a balanced current account situation china has both the fiscal space and the monetary policy potential to undertake the necessary structural reforms and reflate domestic consumption at the same time this is because even if china buys more from the us the rest of the world would worry if that increase in imports comes at their expense all this means that not only is the trade war negative directly for us consumers it will hurt trade and jobs for the rest of the world this is why feuding parties need to be realistic and come to terms that cannot be ideologically pure on either side for the us hawks to expect that the us can enforce standards on china is as realistic as china enforcing ideas on us hawks even for the mightiest military force in the world to sit down with the taliban is to admit that the us wins by losing wars negotiations are now down to the wire without any illusion as anything will be solved in the medium term as that is the negotiation style in washington expect nothing but higher political risks in the near future

as bank of england governor mark carney warned in his global outlook this week the global expansion is now weakening and risks are intensifying because global monetary policy has been tightening trade tensions increasing and china is also slowing the more important risk he identified is the reversal of globalisation caused by growing imbalance on the trade side due to the continued us current account deficit in a situation when the us dollar has been more dominant than ever interesting enough the chinese are no longer major buyers of dollars as their foreign exchange reserves have remained flat whereas going forward the us current account deficit will be funded more than ever by the japanese through their quantitative easing and also the eurozone expect us trade pressure also on japan and the eurozone the second globalisation risk is social with greater imbalance in income and wealth in many countries because the benefits of free trade are shared unequally consumers overall benefit from global trade but many workers in advanced countries have either lost their jobs or seen a fall in real wages the third globalisation risk is the loss of control and trust in democracy and sovereignty in many countries part of the problem is that barriers to trade have increased three times higher for services than for products and this hurts countries that are strong in the services trade such as the united states and the united kingdom this is where the growing protectionism is going to hurt everyone the bank of england estimates that an increase in tariffs of 10 percentage points between us and its trading partners would take 2 5 per cent of us output and 1 per cent off global output through just the trade channel alone if non trade factors are taken into account such as tighter financial conditions greater uncertainty and permanent tariff increases the output losses could double to 5 per cent for us gdp and half that for global gdp it is thus not surprising that despite the recovery in the advanced economies business sector investments have not increased commensurately indeed uk business investments growth has fallen by 3 7 per cent in the last year despite a recovery in growth profits and accommodative monetary policy carney s conclusion is that it isn t easy to win a trade war what is true for brexit is also true for us china trade disputes the barriers to reconciliation are huge because there are now fundamental differences in outlook approaches and territorial sovereignty on both sides of the atlantic english channel and the pacific business confidence cannot be good because in the case of investors in britain no one can predict with any certainty what deal is going to be struck including the possibility of a no deal either way investors will take on a low risk approach by avoiding long term investments and sticking to cash there is little doubt that in the short run britain will be the loser but with a flexible exchange rate she will be able to cushion any long term trade shocks with a competitive sterling at the same the eurozone which sells a large portion of its cars and other products to britain would also have to deal with a trade shock on top of the internal complexities of keeping the union intact the yellow vest protests in france has weakened the ability of the french government to negotiate strongly with the germans on european fiscal discipline issues at a time when the italians are now making very different noises from the other partners on austerity immigration and foreign policy issues in the pacific zone the longer the us china trade tensions persists the worse will be the investment climate overall the major trading partners of both nations do not wish to make clear partnership choices given the huge potential size of the china market and limits to the growth in the mature us market what is unspoken at the present moment is that if no deal is made exchange rate flexibility of the rmb cannot be ruled out no one wants to go this route because a competitive devaluation as the solution to a trade war can only lead to another global recession that is reminiscent of the 1930s so even though the west worries like carney about the risk of china s debt overhang the reality is that if china truly undertakes the structural reforms that almost everyone agrees on she will emerge more productive and competitive than before even in the face of higher trade tariffs with a balanced current account situation china has both the fiscal space and the monetary policy potential to undertake the necessary structural reforms and reflate domestic consumption at the same time this is because even if china buys more from the us the rest of the world would worry if that increase in imports comes at their expense all this means is that not only is the trade war negative directly for us consumers it will hurt trade and jobs for the rest of the world this is why feuding parties need to be realistic and come to terms that cannot be ideologically pure on either side for the us hawks to expect that the us can enforce standards on china is as realistic as china enforcing ideas on us hawks even for the mightiest military force in the world to sit down with the taliban is to admit that the us wins by losing wars negotiations are now down to the wire without any illusion that anything will be solved in the medium term as that is the negotiation style in washington expect nothing but higher political risks in the near future the writer comments on global issues from an asian perspective for the

president chief executive officer director thank you salli good morning and thank you to everyone for joining today s call as we begin i would like to note that we have revised our approach to our earnings call to focus more of our commentary on the factors underlying our financial results we hope you will find this helpful and as always welcome your feedback additionally we have changed our disclosure of certain guidance metrics in an effort to provide greater transparency in areas that are most relevant and predictable mark kaye will go into greater detail on the guidance changes shortly i will begin by summarizing moody s full year and fourth quarter 2018 financial results mark will then follow with comments on our outlook for 2019 after our prepared remarks we ll be happy to respond to your questions during full year 2018 moody s achieved strong results driven by robust performance at moody s analytics prudent expense management and the benefit of a lower effective tax rate offsetting weaker than expected global debt issuance in the fourth quarter full year 2018 adjusted operating margins increased across the corporation including at both moody s investor service and moody s analytics adjusted diluted eps grew 22 year over year in the fourth quarter moody s total revenue declined 9 as you are aware we experienced a difficult issuance environment with high yield bond activity the weakest since the global financial crisis ma revenue which does not correlate with debt capital markets activity grew 5 led by strong rd a performance despite top line softness in mis moody s corporation adjusted operating margin increased by 40 basis points for the quarter our improved operating leverage combined with a lower effective tax rate grew adjusted diluted eps by 8 year over year as you can see in the charts on slide 7 adjusted operating margin increased in both mis and ma by over 150 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2018 this was due to expense efficiency initiatives across both businesses lower accruals for incentive compensation in mis and the roll off of bureau van dijk s deferred revenue haircut in ma on our last earnings call we announced a restructuring plan the restructuring charge we took in the fourth quarter of 49 million exceeded our previously announced range of 30 million to 40 million due to the acceleration of staff reductions and acquisition integration which together also allowed for real estate rationalization our total restructuring program is now expected to be in the 70 million to 80 million is expected to be 70 million to 80 million through the first half of 2019 we are increasing our anticipated annualized pre tax savings to a range of 40 million to 50 million which is 10 million higher than the range we previously announced we will begin to realize the majority of the annualized run rate savings in the second half of 2019 these savings will create financial flexibility for various capital market conditions and provide options to reinvest in our business or bolster margins we believe that the restructuring charge acquisition synergies and other cost management efforts will contribute to margin stability in full year 2019 after announcing the bureau van dijk acquisition we focused on deleveraging and successfully reduced our net debt balance in 2018 in december we issued 800 million in bonds the pie chart on the right shows the 450 million was used to pay down senior notes that were coming due in july 2019 a portion of the proceeds was also used to pay down our remaining outstanding term loan in commercial paper as a result of this financing we do not have further debt maturing until september 2020 in the fourth quarter of 2018 issuance was impacted by a variety of geopolitical and macroeconomic concerns leading to market and interest rate volatility as well as widening spreads notably there was no u s high yield bond issuance activity in december even with these challenges economic fundamentals remained sound in developed markets with stable u s and european economic growth and unemployment rates at multiyear lows the drop in global debt issuance of almost 30 in the fourth quarter of 2018 led to a smaller decline in mis revenue of 18 demonstrating the strength of the business model mis revenue was buttressed ph through its recurring revenue base which was supported by increased monitoring fees from recent new mandates as well as pricing for ma total revenue grew 5 in the fourth quarter or 7 excluding the negative impact from foreign exchange rd a revenue grew 17 due to bureau van dijk strength in the core business and contribution from the reis acquisition bureau van dijk added 90 million of revenue in the fourth quarter at a 48 2 adjusted operating margin as expected ers revenue declined by 17 in the quarter as we continued the transition to a software as a service or saas operating model we anticipate ers revenue growth to resume in 2019 i would like to provide additional details about our progress with the saas transition in ers the charts on this slide illustrates 2018 s slight decline in total revenue as 15 growth in subscription revenue was offset by a 28 decline in one time revenue from software licenses and services due to the shift in product mix recurring revenue as a share of total ers as a percent of the total ers business reached 77 in 2018 up from 69 at the end of 2017 expansion of the recurring revenue base will drive ers revenue growth in 2019 despite our expectation of a further contraction in one time revenues this year s revenue outlook is supported by 12 growth in 2018 sales of subscription products which lifted aggregate ers sales by 6 despite a 10 decline in sales of one time software licenses and services the acceleration in total ers sales growth since early 2018 indicates that we have worked through the inflection point in the saas transition importantly the expansion of our subscription business enhances the profitability of ers contributing to our expectation of further improvement in ma s adjusted operating margin in 2019 in terms of business fundamentals our outlook for ers reflects solid demand from banks and insurers for analytical tools that enable adoption of new accounting standards and next generation products that support automation trends before turning the call all over to mark to discuss our full year 2019 outlook i d like to take a moment to review moody s ongoing strategic priorities we continued to defend and enhance our core ratings and research businesses while pursuing strategic growth opportunities both down the corporate credit pyramid and across into new geographies and adjacent product areas we are focused on providing information insights solutions and standards to promote market transparency and fairness both are necessary conditions for market confidence which in turn supports healthy financial markets over time underpinning these efforts we are enhancing our technology infrastructure to enable automation innovation and efficiency and remain supportive of a diverse and inclusive workforce our recent acquisition of reis which closed on october 15th 2018 is a good example of expansion into an adjacent product area reis a leading provider of u s commercial real estate or cre data has built an unique data set over 40 years we have observed growing demand from our asset management banking and insurance customers for a reliable source of integrated information and analytics to support management of their substantial exposures to cre by combining reis proprietary data with ma s specialized expertise moody s is powerfully positioned to meet the need for standards that enhance operational efficiency and analytical precision in this market i ll now turn the call over to mark to review our outlook for 2019 mark kaye senior vice president and chief financial officer thank you ray as i alluded to at an industry conference in late 2018 we are enhancing the transparency around certain of our guidance metrics while at the same time curtailing other metrics where we feel there is less value to providing them or they are inherently difficult at accurately predict for 2019 we have added mis and ma adjusted operating margin segment guidance as well as net interest expense guidance we ve removed revenue guidance at the sub segment or line of business level i want to emphasize that our reporting of actual results will remain unchanged and in particular we will keep reporting sub segment revenue results every quarter in our earnings press releases and in our sec filings moody s outlook for 2019 is based on assumptions about many geopolitical conditions and macroeconomic and capital market factors including but not limited to interest in foreign currency exchange rates corporate profitability and business investment spending mergers and acquisition and the level of their capital markets activity these assumptions are subject to uncertainty and results for the year could differ materially from our current outlook our guidance assumes foreign currency translation at the end of the fourth quarter 2018 exchange rates specifically our forecast reflects exchange rates for the british pound of 1 27 and for the euro of 1 14 slide 18 outlines a variety of drivers we considered when setting our 2019 guidance i will mention a few key items now for mis we believe that stable economic fundamentals of gdp growth of 2 to 3 in the u s and 1 to 2 in europe will underpin global debt issuance activity however market volatility may moderate the pace of new mandates and cause variability in annual global debt issuance for ma product innovations will enable sustained core rd a growth ers revenue growth should resume as the transition from licenses and services to saas based products has passed the inflection point we remain on track to achieve our bureau van dijk run rate synergy target of approximately 45 million by year end 2019 as ray outlined earlier companywide annualized pre tax savings as a result of our restructuring activities are now anticipated to be in the 40 million to 50 million range with an estimated pre tax savings of 30 million to 35 million in 2019 we will continue to strategically manage our real estate footprint and hiring activities as you can see from this slide we have been able to achieve high single digit revenue growth over the last four years and concurrently grow the adjusted operating margin by 170 basis points this has allowed us to generate incremental free cash flow for 2019 we are forecasting revenue growth in the mid single digit percent range and adjusted operating margin of approximately 48 and free cash flow in the range of 1 6 billion to 1 7 billion despite our flat to down issuance outlook listed here are additional items for moody s guidance in 2019 a complete list of moody s guidance is included in table 13 of our fourth quarter 2018 earnings press release which can be found in moody s investor relations website at ir moodys com in 2019 we forecast global debt issuance to be flat to down 5 driven by volatility and spread widening relative to 2018 we also expect moderating m a new clo formation and refinancing of leverage debt the chart on the right shows our forecast for slower pace of new mandates in 2019 relative to the past two years these headwinds will be partially offset by an expanding global economy deployment of investor cash balances and low credit defaults upcoming refinancing needs and the already announced 2019 m a transactions provide a base for upcoming issuance activity for mis we expect total revenue to increase in the low single digit percent range as we execute on our ability to grow revenue despite the issuance headwind i just spoke about we project that capital market conditions will be more constructive and in the fourth quarter of 2018 we believe that the full year 2019 market environment will be more difficult on average than 2018 overall we see positive economic fundamentals moderating declines in m a and refinancing activity tighter investment grade and speculative grade spreads along with still low albeit slightly rising default rates should support more constructive issuance markets in the second half of the year in the last few weeks issuance markets have improved following the federal reserve s recent announcement we have seen healthy u s investment grade issuance activity and the return of u s speculative grade issuers to the market following a historically slow december month we will continue to monitor monitory policy along with other macro and geopolitical factors affecting the credit markets we expect mis adjusted operating margin to be approximately 58 in 2019 we will manage our expense base and implement technology to increase efficiency in our ratings processes however we also have to account for a reset of the incentive compensation pullback to 100 assuming of course we meet our full year operating target we are investing in the mis business to support our strategy of expansion into the chinese and latin american markets pursuing opportunities in adjacencies and enhancing our technology infrastructure for ma we expect total revenue to increase in the low double digit percent range underpinned by strong sales growth in the second half of 2018 we anticipate broad based strength across all product areas and businesses the drag from fx will be offset by the acquired growth from omega performance and reis that ph constant dollar organic growth is also projected to increase in the low double digit percent range we anticipate ma s adjusted operating margin increasing 250 basis points to 350 basis points to the 29 to 30 range in 2019 this improvement has several primary drivers including a combination from strong sales growth at bureau van dijk and the ers transition to more saas based offerings which improves both recurring revenue and earnings predictability ongoing discipline in expense management further underpins ma s margin expansion which is bolstered by the role of bureau van dijk s deferred revenue haircut in 2019 we plan to return capital through 1 billion of share repurchases and an annualized dividend of 2 per share today moody s is pleased to announce a 500 million accelerated share repurchase program that will be completed during the second quarter of 2019 in addition on february 12th moody s board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of 0 50 per share of moody s common stock a 14 increase from the prior quarterly dividend of 0 44 per share this dividend will be payable on the 18th of march to stockholders of record at the close of business on the 25th of february this increased dividend is in line with our target dividend payout ratio of 25 to 30 of adjusted net income before turning to q a i would like to note a few principal takeaways we are confident in moody s ability to deliver revenue growth and drive productivity gains to support strong margins in 2019 despite the relatively weakened global debt issuance outlook we continue to invest in custom offerings of information insights and solutions and standards that enhance market transparency finally we will maintain our disciplined and thoughtful approach to capital management raymond w mcdaniel president chief executive officer director thank you mark this concludes our prepared remarks and joining mark and me for the question and answer session are mark almeida president of moody s analytics and rob fauber president of moody s investors service we d be pleased to take any questions you may have questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions and our first question comes from toni kaplan with morgan stanley please go ahead toni kaplan morgan stanley analyst hi good morning thank you rob i was hoping you could give some additional color on the issuance environment and sort of the drivers in terms of the flat to down low single that you ve called out and especially one thing i wanted was curious about was you saw some really big moves in spreads in the fourth quarter as well as at the beginning of this year in some really short periods of time and so just wanted to get a sense of in your experience what does that mean for the issuance environment so that d be super helpful thank you mark kaye senior vice president and chief financial officer toni this is mark rob and i are going to jointly share some commentary on this particular question as we think it s important to give both the bank perspective from what we re hearing as well as our internal view in terms of bank feedback that we re hearing for both u s and europe and in particular for the u s we have three key points that have been quite pervasive effective capital market conditions have obviously improved since december and the issuance activity has remained relatively modest thus far we are anticipating or at least the banks are anticipating large cash repatriated to return to the market in late 2019 and that would certainly help investment grade and then lastly in relation to the u s m a still is a driver for issuance activity in 2019 but the banks expect this to be down from elevated 2018 levels in terms of what we re hearing from the banks in terms of feedback for europe a hard brexit does remain a potential driver of downside overall investor demand does remain healthy but there is some concerned redemand for baa2 or below issuance following the ecb s halt of corporate sector repurchase program and then lastly from the banks in relation to europe strong reverse the yankee issuance and it s possible due to favorable relative value dynamic of the euro versus the u s dollar robert fauber president moody s investors service and so maybe mark let me add on to that and toni triangulating to that 0 to flat to down 5 outlook so there s a few components of that that go into our overall build so starting with corporate finance there we re expecting some slight declines in the investment grade space modest declines in bank loans and we think that ll be driven in part by less opportunistic refinancing the u s high yield market we actually think we may see an increase in issuance there given the spread tightening from the fourth quarter where the yield curve is and also some very very light 2018 comparables as mark mentioned m a we think will still be an important issuance driver but we don t think it s going to be down off of 2018 2018 i think is the third strongest year on record so we think that ll be down something in the neighborhood of 10 or so for financial institutions we d expect issuance to be slightly lower in part you may remember from the earnings calls through the course of this last year us talking about european banks building up levels of bail in able capital so we actually think that that s going to slow down and will provide some headwind to financial institution issuance we also had some very strong m a driven issuance out of the insurance sector in the past year well moving on to the ppif segment here we actually think we ll see some moderately higher issuance and that s driven primarily by the growth in issuance out of the u s public finance sector and you may recall that was effectively the issuance there was effectively rebased after the loss of all that advanced refunding volume in 2018 that was associated with the tax law changes and we re actually seeing some good activity in terms of new money transactions there and finally in structured finance looking at kind of a modest decline driven really primarily by our outlook on clo activity we ve had now two years of very strong not only new clo formation but a lot of refi activity and so we think that this decline in clo activity is going to be somewhat offset by increases in some of the other sectors really that are underpinned by economic growth and then we triangulate all this obviously with the wall street banks and we think this is pretty consistent with the outlooks across the street let me also talk about address your second point about these rapid spread moves and i guess as we saw spreads blow out in the fourth quarter and saw the leverage finance markets seize up to some extent we re scratching our heads like i think a lot of people were because we re looking at the underlying fundamentals and you still had economic growth you had low unemployment you had low default rates and so i guess our view was that this was a this was temporary this was going to pass we ve seen other quarters like this you know you think back to the first quarter of 2016 issues around china and commodities and oil prices and so on so our view is that this was going to pass this was kind of a i guess i would call a cyclical air pocket albeit a very hard air pocket operator and our next question comes from manav patnaik with barclays please go ahead manav patnaik barclays investment bank analyst thank you very much i guess my first question was more around the restructuring efforts and more than just the current restructuring you ve kind of already talked about last quarter i was just wondering how to think about it long term in terms of where all do you see the buckets of opportunity and how we should think about how you could flex that should the top line environment get tough raymond w mcdaniel president chief executive officer director yeah manav it s ray i ll start and mark may have some additional comments but what is underpinning some of the activities that have gone into our current restructuring is relates to the acquisitions we ve made and rationalizing some of the costs post acquisition so obviously if we do any more m a activity we would be looking for the same kind of rationalizations beyond that though we ve been very focused on what we can do as far as onshore and offshore labor and what we can do with automation and robotic processes those will be part of the story going forward for us as i think they will for obviously many firms and so there will be opportunities in the future but in terms of a large restructuring action i don t think we re going to be a serial restructurer we re going to be looking for efficiencies and opportunities outside of formal restructurings mark kaye senior vice president and chief financial officer i was going to add just in terms of numbers to supplement ray s remarks so firstly we anticipate the action will be substantially complete by the end of june and they will allow for an expected pre tax savings amount in 2019 of 30 million to 35 million and then starting in 2020 we do expect annualized pre tax savings of between 40 million and 50 million which is 10 million more than what we announced previously in october and then lastly as you can see in our guidance reconciliation we do estimate an approximate 0 10 per share impact from the first half 2009 restructuring charge in our full year 2019 gaap eps numbers manav patnaik barclays investment bank analyst got it and if i could just follow up on that point so i guess these efficiencies that you re talking about going forward anyway to quantify how to think about how that impacts the margin or the cost profile just any color there would be helpful thank you raymond w mcdaniel president chief executive officer director yeah i think that at a high level this is these opportunities are why we do not see any plateauing of the margin opportunities at either mis or moody s analytics over time we think that we ve got room for margin expansion it s going to be ongoing subject of course to variability in the top line but that is part of the plan operator our next question comes from alex kramm with ubs please go ahead alex kramm ubs analyst hi hello everyone just wanted to come back to the guidance and maybe this is for ray but just wondering how much how your confidence level is on the mis side around this guidance and i know it s a difficult question to answer but you think about the last few years i think you ve gotten a reputation to be very conservative and then at the end of the day the market was just a lot better and you have outperformed and most recently obviously if you just look at the fourth quarter which was i know once in a blue moon environment but clearly it was completely different than what everybody had thought so just wondering as we approach maybe the end of the cycle if the confidence level that you personally have is just a lot lower or how you would kind of gauge the range of outcomes that 2019 could actually bring raymond w mcdaniel president chief executive officer director well alex i guess one way to answer the question about my level of confidence would be that we have decided to eliminate the sub segment or line of business guidance so i ve been dealing with over the past years i ve been dealing with the fact that we have underestimated and overestimated and we re trying to focus you and ourselves on things that are more in our control and those things that are more predictable that being said we have done a lot of work in support of the outlook that we put out at the mis level there will always be more uncertainty around mis than i think we have around moody s analytics because it is very capital market sensitive and so there are just externalities driving that business that are themselves cyclical so robert fauber president moody s investors service yeah and maybe alex i could maybe add in terms of the upsides and downsides as we see them to the outlook and maybe that will help you out a little bit and maybe for a change i ll start with the potential upsides if we see some real spread tightening and that s obviously continuation of the trend that we ve seen in january i mean that could attract some more opportunistic issuance and more refinancing activity that would obviously be positive you combine now the fact that investors have got some significant cash balances and that could be constructive for the issuance environment and of course private equity firms are sitting on huge amounts of capital still to deploy and that we think is going to provide some support for the m a volumes now on the down side to some extent the inverse of what i just described but if we don t see some spread tightening from here that s clearly going to provide a headwind to what we re thinking about for the year and of course if equity market volatility picks back up that s not good for the high yield market and that is an area that we have been looking at for potential growth this year and then lastly just thinking about things like a disorderly brexit or chinese u s trade discussions of course present the opportunity to have some sort of market dislocation and we haven t factored that into our outlook alex kramm ubs analyst okay that was fair thank you i know it s uncertain and maybe just specifically rob i know this is a small business but you when you went through the kind of outlook more specifically on the public side you mentioned that you still see a little bit a very robust i guess come back in 2019 i saw a six months survey i think at the end of december where a lot of the municipals actually said that they still expect issuance to be done further in 2019 just wondering if i don t know if you saw the same thing but just wondering if you could kind of square those maybe different outlooks a little bit or what gives you confidence in that business i know it s small but just curious robert fauber president moody s investors service yeah i mean i guess in general you think about the advanced refundings and that was like 20 to 30 of total issuance volume and that got taken out of the market in 2018 so like i said you re kind of rebasing off of that we have seen some new money financings which we feel good about so i understand we you know there s a bit of a bid ask on some of these issuance outlook but in general that s what we re seeing i guess i would also say you know through the first month of the year we re seeing relatively healthy public finance volumes raymond w mcdaniel president chief executive officer director and our comments earlier were that we expect that to be moderately higher so it s not at a situation where we expect issuance to be exploding operator and our next question is with peter appert with piper jaffray please go ahead peter appert piper jaffray analyst thanks good morning so since i ve whined about the margins at ma in the last few quarters i wanted to call out kudos to mr almeida for the better results and the positive momentum going into 2019 and specifically i was hoping mark you could give us some more granularity on the drivers of that margin improvement how much is a function of the turn at ers how much is it a function of bvd any additional color you can provide mark e almeida president moody s analytics sure peter i think you ve hit on the big ones we have been doing a lot of work in the ers business over a number of years the we expect the top line to come back nicely in ers in 2019 so that ll help and we re managing expenses very rigorously there so ers is contributing the bureau van dijk business will be contributing and we ve been taking actions across the ma business for some period of time so i think all of those things are contributing to the continued margin expansion that we re delivering in 2019 and the acceleration in that expansion so it s really very much across the board peter appert piper jaffray analyst mark in terms of where you see the upside then i mean what do you think is reasonable over the next several years in terms of run rate profitability in this business mark e almeida president moody s analytics well you know we ve said for some time that pardon me that we expect continued gradual expansion in the margin i think of course it s going to depend sensitively on what we re able to do on the top line but obviously we re guiding to a very good year on the top line this year and i think we re in a good position to be able to continue to generate strong growth in the business and that should allow us to continue to deliver margin expansion operator and our next question comes from george tong with goldman sachs please go ahead george tong goldman sachs analyst hi thanks good morning given your expectations of a flat to down 5 issuance environment this year can you talk about how you expect pricing to perform in the ratings business relative to last year raymond w mcdaniel president chief executive officer director yeah i think we ve talked before about the fact that we have pricing opportunities averaging 3 to 4 and that assumes that issuance is flat so if issuance is down 2 3 4 it s going to have an impact some of our pricing adjustments are unrelated to debt issuance but some of them do relate to debt issuance so we will have to be managing that carefully if there s a decline in debt issuance from 2018 it will have some impact nonetheless we will have contribution from price this year i think regardless of whether there is a decline or not in issuance george tong goldman sachs analyst that s helpful one of your competitors recently received clearance to rate debt securities in china can you give us an update on your strategy in china and if you have similar plans to expand beyond your jv to independently rate that there raymond w mcdaniel president chief executive officer director sure happy to offer a few comments and rob may want to remark on this as well we have a different business position than other international rating agencies in china we have been there since 2006 via a very successful joint venture we are pleased with our equity position we re pleased with the position that ccxi our joint venture holds in the chinese market moody s has over 400 ratings on chinese entities that are active in the cross border market our joint venture has ratings on over 1 000 domestic market issuers in china so we feel that we re in very good position having a joint venture that is licensed already and in fact it s licensed in both the interbank and the exchange traded markets that doesn t mean that we don t want to do more in china and we have put in an application for providing global cross border ratings for the domestic market issuance and we think that this is an opportunity really not just for mis but for moody s analytics and our combined businesses to provide a whole suite of products and services to the domestic chinese market whether it s through moody s analytics moody s investor service or ccxi so i m actually quite excited about the opportunity and we are going to continue our dialogue with regulators and issuers and the investors to make sure we re offering what in fact the chinese want as part of their policy agenda and market opening operator and our next question comes from tim mchugh with william blair please go ahead timothy mchugh william blair analyst thanks on ers excuse me you talked about kind of maybe on a multiyear basis how close are you to i guess seeing the services part of that revenue mix i guess bottom out or stabilize i imagine you always have some within the mix so how far away are we from that mark e almeida president moody s analytics tim it s mark you re right we will have to continue to have some we think we re pretty much at a level that we will sustain for the foreseeable future we ll probably see a bit of contraction on that line moving forward this year but it s going to be much more shallow a decline than what we ve seen in 2018 so i guess the way i would say it is that line is stabilizing sort of flattening around the current level and so the acceleration in revenue growth from the subscription side of the business will drive overall growth in ers timothy mchugh william blair analyst and 2020 and 2021 should be even cleaner in theory i guess from that factor mark e almeida president moody s analytics yeah exactly all things being equal i would expect that that would continue to be the case over the coming years timothy mchugh william blair analyst okay and then on incentive compensation i know you talk about qualitatively on margins that there s a headwind from returning to 100 payout i guess how can you give us a q4 incentive comp number and i guess what is trying to understand how much of a headwind that is i guess what s a 100 payout or kind of normal for you now mark e almeida president moody s analytics sure very happy to provide the fourth quarter incentive compensation number was 29 million it s worth noting that was meaningfully down on a year over year basis compared to the fourth quarter 2017 by around 60 or so and so if you re thinking about looking on a go forward basis i would recommend around 50 million ish a quarter for 2019 operator and our next question comes from craig huber with huber research partners please go ahead craig huber huber research partners analyst yes good morning i ve got a couple of questions ray or rob i m just curious on your updated thoughts as you think about sort of u s markets corporate debt levels out there in terms of looking at the debt ratios in aggregate looking at the absolute debt that s outstanding there did you see anything that s in your mind that you feel is unsafe it s getting to extreme levels is a question we get a lot from investors and i have a follow up thank you raymond w mcdaniel president chief executive officer director the short answer is no we there has been some increase in leverage but there s also been a strong economic environment which has supported profitability so while there has been some additional leverage in the market i think really probably the more interesting question craig is over the last 12 24 months the opening of the market and the receptivity to increasingly low rated credits and if there were to be a hiccup in the economy a recession that s where i would be paying attention to potential problems craig huber huber research partners analyst and ray do you feel the same way about that about europe as well raymond w mcdaniel president chief executive officer director well in terms of where to look for potential problems yes although the european high yield market is not of the same scale as the u s high yield market and the issuance has not broadened as a general statement has not gone as deep in the ratings scale as it has in the united states that being said there s also been less additional leverage put on companies in europe than in the u s operator and our next question comes from joseph foresi with cantor fitzgerald please go ahead joseph foresi cantor fitzgerald analyst hi i know this is going to be a real difficult question to ask but i ll throw it out there anyways typically you ve talked about sort of gdp as being core to issuance growth but when there are quarters where there s a lot of economic volatility clearly that changes given the sort of present political climate kind of domestically and internationally i m wondering how are you able to risk adjust the numbers around that volatility maybe you could just talk a little bit about how that takes place raymond w mcdaniel president chief executive officer director yeah joe i m glad you asked the question because i think it s important to emphasize that when we talk about the growth in global debt as being roughly in line with gdp we are talking about over multiyear periods there is certainly going to be dislocations and variations on a short term basis so we have to deal with that and i really wouldn t talk about growth in debt being aligned with gdp in this quarter or even necessarily in 2019 i don t know if my colleagues have anything they want to add to that but it s a long term metric joseph foresi cantor fitzgerald analyst got it and then just in the enterprise risk business maybe mark could spend a little bit of time describing for us what this transformation from services to software feels like on a sort of a day to day basis are you canceling projects or rewriting contracts is there a certain percentage that are converting or not converting just so we can understand i know you ve kind of described how far we are through it but how do those conversations work sort of daily and maybe you can give us some color on how far we re through and then just how you see 2019 playing out mark e almeida president moody s analytics sure i mean it s really a question of product strategy where we have migrated our product from what was previously a traditional software licensing and implementation services business to much more of standard product typically delivered in a hosted environment that is typically on the cloud where we are allowing customers to subscribe to those products the works that we have to do to implement the product to put it into production for a given customer is simpler it s cheaper for the customer it s cheaper for us doesn t take nearly as much time nearly as much customization so it s a it s really migrating from what has been traditionally lots of customization of products from customer to customer installed on the customer s equipment behind their firewalls so everything was quite bespoke and moving to again much more standard product where all customers have access to the same code base so it s very consistent with our mantra of build once sell many times sell it on a subscription basis so you have a recurring revenue so it s really not i mean there is some migration of customers from old installed product to new hosted product sold on a subscription basis we do have that in certain areas and that s a process that takes place over a period of time but a lot of this is just frankly it s consistent with what customers want customers are demanding this they re expecting this increasingly and this is how our customers want to buy software solutions from people like us so it s really adapting our product offering to the needs of the market and frankly that just that fits very well with our desire to run the business on a more of a subscription basis where we find the economics much more attractive so the transition from the old to the new is a little cumbersome and you get some you get the kinds of results that we saw in 2018 where the run off in the old software licensing and services business preceded the ramp up in the revenue growth from the growing base of subscriptions that we ve got but again when we say we re through that through the transition or through the inflection point we feel like the decline in the one time revenues will now be slower than the ramp up in the acceleration in revenue from subscriptions is that responsive joseph foresi cantor fitzgerald analyst that makes sense thank you operator and our next question comes from jim ph silber with bmo capital markets please go ahead jeffrey silber bmo capital analyst thanks so much that s close enough typically every quarter somebody asks you to update your m a thoughts so i guess i would do that this quarter raymond w mcdaniel president chief executive officer director well as we talked about in our prepared remarks we are committed to expanding the business both geographically and in terms of what parts of the credit markets we serve and adjacent product areas that are looking for risk assessments of one kind or another and look like they would attract standards providers if we see good assets along any of those three dimensions we would certainly be interested in them we have been very pleased with the acquisitions that we have made over the past number of years but we ve also been very disciplined about trying to do that so we look at a lot more than we try to execute on and certainly a lot more than we successfully execute on so i don t feel like we have must acquire businesses in order to fill out our product and service portfolio but if we see attractive assets we re going to try to make them a part of moody s mark kaye senior vice president and chief financial officer and jeff just to add on to that more broadly we have a very disciplined approach that we adopt to capital allocation and certainly not just looking at m a opportunities but a number of opportunities internally to invest in our existing businesses to support organic growth and then to the extent that we don t meet our return criteria we obviously engage in the return of capital either ph through dividends which we spoke about this morning or through share repurchases jeffrey silber bmo capital analyst all right great and if i could just get into the weeds a little bit on my follow up regarding your guidance i appreciate the new way you re guiding revenues but just on the m a side excuse me the moody s analytics side if i look at the impact of reis and the omega performance acquisition is that all coming in the u s or is there some of non u s impact as well mark e almeida president moody s analytics reis is a 100 u s omega is it s quite international it has a big chunk of u s it also has a sizable business in outside the u s particularly in asia having said that bear in mind that omega performance is a relatively small business so it just it frankly it doesn t move the needle dramatically for ma overall jeffrey silber bmo capital analyst okay great thanks so much operator and our next question comes from bill warmington with wells fargo please go ahead william warmington wells fargo analyst good morning everyone and welcome back to salli so a question on the on bvd i just wanted to ask about the growth rate there and while that continues to be in the low double digits and what s been driving that in terms of products geographies is cross selling starting to play a role raymond w mcdaniel president chief executive officer director yeah bill bvd is performing very very well we took a big hit due to fx in the fourth quarter probably lost about 300 basis points on that business due to fx in the fourth quarter but the underlying business is performing quite well we talked about this before but we ve seen a very nice acceleration in sales growth in that business since we acquired it and that continues to be the case and i think it s a function of a number of things i mean frankly the business it s just a very good business the number of customer use cases to which the bureau van dijk data can be applied is expanding there are some very interesting new opportunities that we are getting good traction with in the bureau van dijk space and in addition we re starting to have some good cross selling successes as well so we re very pleased with what we re seeing there and we expect to see on the revenue line we expect to see nice acceleration this year william warmington wells fargo analyst and then for my second question i wanted to ask about new mandates in mis and whether that was whether it was still strong in the fourth quarter even during the tough december and how those are shaping up in q1 robert fauber president moody s investors service so this is rob new mandates they did decelerate in the fourth quarter from the third quarter and something in the range of about 10 and versus the fourth quarter of 2017 they were down close to 20 now that s not nearly as sharply as the decline in the leverage finance markets around the world and it was interesting so despite the slowdown we had 2018 was a very strong year for first time mandate acquisition actually we exceeded the prior year by i believe two first time mandates now not all of these first time mandates ended up topping the market because of the disruption at the end of the market but all of that sets up recurring revenue very nicely for us into 2019 and interestingly when you look at the fourth quarter of 2018 we actually saw growth in first time mandates in the united states versus the prior year quarter and then all the other regions were down fairly meaningfully we think we re going to see some contraction in first time mandate acquisition in 2019 in a range of something like 900 and that s down from just under one 1 050 this year but i think we had in the slides you can see looking even looking at the 900 and you compare back to 2016 still quite a healthy increase over those numbers raymond w mcdaniel president chief executive officer director yeah and if you go back earlier than 2016 it becomes even more stark in terms of the ramp up in new mandates operator and our next question comes from dan dolev with nomura please go ahead dan dolev nomura analyst yeah it s actually it s dan dolev thanks for taking my question so if you guys look across you re kind of guiding for about 1 billion of repurchases which is five times bigger than what you did in 2018 i mean the first question is are you kind of are you limiting your ability to sort of beat and raise by already putting in that much repurchase in the guide and then kind of as a mini follow up to that question like if you kind of look through the entire p l like where do you think there is the most conservative at this point that s baked into that thank you mark kaye senior vice president and chief financial officer sure and thank you very much for the question dan i d like to maybe reiterate in 2018 we really executed on the deleveraging or deleveraging associated with the bureau van dijk acquisition and that was principally responsible for the lower relative share amount of share repurchases in 2018 versus historical years in 2019 we re certainly returning again in the absence of investment in growth opportunity either through reinvestments back into the business or acquisitions that meet return profile to use the share repurchase as a mechanism to return cash back to our shareholders in terms of the impact to the eps growth rate from 2018 to 2019 it s around 2 ish percentage points and certainly we would see that as a best estimate while not conservative not aggressive very much down the middle of the road from our guidance dan dolev nomura analyst and then in terms of sort of the conservatism in if you look across the p l where do you think your assumption would be the most conservative where do you see yourself kind of like surprising in 2019 raymond w mcdaniel president chief executive officer director well dan just looking at if you look at the size of the different components of our business and the fact that mis has more cyclicality to it that s where you would look for upside and the largest business in mis is the corporate ratings business and in particular the speculative grade business where the market psychology becomes to get money now rather than in 2020 or 2021 that s the biggest opportunity for a pull forward of debt so that s not that i think we ve put in a conservative approach but if you re looking for where is the upside that s just the biggest pool operator and our next question comes from craig huber with huber research partners please go ahead craig huber huber research partners analyst yes hi i have a follow up ray or rob if you look back on 2018 what s your best estimate here how much of an impact do the tax law change the u s made let s say to high yield debt issuance in the year and how much of a headwind do you think that actually hurt raymond w mcdaniel president chief executive officer director i don t think that was much of a headwind craig we ve talked about before that the limits on interest deductibility really would only have an effect at the low end of the respective ph grade range and even then it only has a modest impact so it certainly didn t discourage issuance in the first half last year by low rated issuers and then in terms of cash repatriation that s pretty concentrated with large investment grade credits particularly in the tech area again does not have much of an impact on spec grade because they don t have large cash pools overseas for the most part so you d have to count it as a headwind but i would not count it as a material headwind for last year or this year robert fauber president moody s investors service maybe just to put a couple of numbers around it too if you look at investment grade issuance in the united states and this is to the tax repatriation issue from 2015 to 2017 there s big large offshore cash holders representing something like a quarter of u s investment grade issuance it was a big number that essentially all dried up in 2018 and the 15 largest cash holders closed out 2018 really without accessing the bond market in any meaningful way and they ve raised something like 130 billion in 2017 and we re not expecting in our the outlook that we re particular we re not expecting issuance out of that group in 2019 craig huber huber research partners analyst and then also guys when you think about your debt issuance for the year outlook i guess down flat to down maybe 5 i assume you re thinking they ll be tilted much better than in the back half of the year potentially worse in the first half is that a fair statement sort of cadence for the year how do you see it playing out raymond w mcdaniel president chief executive officer director yeah and certainly the comparables are much more challenging in the first half of the year than in the second half of the year so i think i would still expect to see the sawtooth pattern as we have as we typically see but with the real year on year challenges coming in the first half and so in that respect you might look back to 2016 for a comparison of issuance stuff operator and our next question comes from alex kramm with ubs please go ahead alex kramm ubs analyst yeah hey thanks for letting me on again just a couple of quick follow ups for mark sorry if i this was asked already on the tax rates did you flesh out why the tax rate is lower than i think you got it last year and then just related to that can you just outline the share based comp s benefit that you getting and how that should play out in terms of seasonality i mean last year or last few years the first quarter is usually pretty big but any sort of color you can give us from a margin perspective there would be helpful thanks mark kaye senior vice president and chief financial officer sure so i ll address the tax rate question first 2018 effective tax rate was 21 and that was probably lower especially in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2018 really driven by non u s earnings and lower u s taxes on the release of an irs notice that clarified certain elements of the u s tax reform for 2019 we are guiding to 21 to 22 which is higher than the actual tax rate in 2018 and we re doing that primarily because of the expectation of lower excess tax benefit now you ll recall in 2018 in the first quarter that around 38 million of excess tax benefit that we anticipate probably having half of that this year in 2019 and that s really what s driving the higher guided tax rate in 2019 compared to the actual rate in 2018 alex kramm ubs analyst okay great and secondly real quick also and i don t know if this came up but i think when you took over as cfo you kind of talked about corporate cost allocation and maybe your philosophy being a little bit different is there has anything changed so far as you think about now that you re breaking out the margin for the two businesses is any of that driven by maybe thinking about that a little bit different or still to come potentially mark kaye senior vice president and chief financial officer sure alex that thank you for the question that is something that we continue to think about as a management team and certainly did incorporate into our views of margin guidance expansion for both ma and mis for 2019 i would add that is it is not material to those two numbers as guided operator and mr ray mcdaniel there are no further questions at this time raymond w mcdaniel president chief executive officer director okay just want to thank everyone for joining us on the call today and we look forward to speaking to you again in the spring thank you operator this

expenditures modestly increased from 42 3 million to 45 2 million notably in the quarter we spent 9 8 million on crown land acquisitions and infrastructure for future value creation we drilled 4 3 net wells in the quarter as compared to 9 6 net wells in the third quarter of 2018 we also executed numerous acquisitions and minor dispositions resulting in a net expenditure of 11 0 million in the fourth quarter q4 2018 production production volumes for the quarter averaged 68 011 boe per day consisting of 281 mmcf per day of natural gas 19 131 boe per day of natural gas liquids and 2 108 bbl per day of oil our 2018 fourth quarter production volumes of 68 011 boe per day was similar to our previous quarter s production of 68 036 boe per day despite the impact of approximately 1 600 boe per day of unscheduled production curtailments due to low natural gas pricing caused by maintenance on the ngtl system third party processing constraints and ethane rejection our 2018 focus of allocating capital to liquids rich projects has resulted in our oil and natural gas liquids ratio moving up modestly to 31 of total production as compared to the prior quarter of 30 q4 2018 production revenue marketing and risk management production revenues for the fourth quarter of 2018 inclusive of realized gains on financial instrument commodity contracts was 124 6 million or 19 91 per boe which was 8 6 million lower or six percent lower than the previous quarter production revenues inclusive of realized gains on financial instrument commodity contracts of 133 1 million or 21 27 per boe this variance was largely due to the impact of wide oil differentials causing a 31 erosion inclusive of realized gains on financial instrument commodity contracts in oil and condensate revenues realized pricing on natural gas volumes in the quarter was 2 91 per mcf an 88 premium over the average aeco daily spot price for the quarter of 1 55 per mcf hedging contributed to a 0 33 per mcf premium to our realized natural gas price a 3 88 per boe discount to our realized ngl price and a 7 74 per boe discount to our realized oil price q4 2018 operating and transportation expenses operating expenses in the quarter were 5 66 per boe an improvement over the prior quarter of 5 74 per boe the strachan cost structure continues to impress where we recorded operating expenses on a per boe basis of 3 93 on production volumes averaging 5 500 boe per day in the fourth quarter representing approximately six percent of our corporate operating expenses transportation expenses in the prior quarter of 2018 were 1 42 per boe relative to the 1 37 per boe in the fourth quarter of 2018 with both oil and liquids transportation expenses on a per barrel basis lower by 25 and 22 respectively in the fourth quarter of 2018 we also experienced unutilized firm natural gas transportation expenses of 888 000 or 0 03 per mcf as compared to 933 000 in the previous quarter q4 2018 general administrative and interest expenses general and administrative expenses decreased six percent in the current quarter to 5 4 million as compared to 5 8 million in the third quarter of 2018 due to lower salaries and benefits recorded in the quarter interest expenses of 8 6 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018 were similar to the third quarter of 2018 we exited the fourth quarter of 2018 with lower average borrowings on our bank facility which reduced our interest expense by 210 000 these savings were offset however by the increase in the cad us foreign exchange rate as interest on our notes are largely denominated in us dollars q4 2018 cash flow from operating activities and adjusted funds flow cash flow from operating activities in the fourth quarter of 2018 of 77 6 million increased modestly from the third quarter of 2018 at 73 7 million despite production revenues inclusive of gains on financial commodity instrument contracts declining to 19 91 per boe from 21 27 per boe improvements in operating transportation and general and administrative expenses contributed to improving cash flow from operations quarter over quarter adjusted funds flow 1 for the quarter was 61 1 million as compared to 63 7 million in the previous quarter for similar reasons as discussed above in addition to changes in working capital and lower decommissioning expenditures note 1 non gaap

2018 were 171 3 million a 39 decrease from 2017 levels at 281 7 million we remained committed to disciplined reinvestment levels preserving cash flow from operating activities to allocate towards the reduction of our net debt 1 exploration and development expenditures were 164 5 million with 122 1 million allocated to drilling 24 9 net wells and completing 28 4 net wells the remaining 42 4 million was spent on support capital primarily crown land acquisitions and infrastructure enhancements our expenditures on acquisition net of dispositions totaled 6 0 million of which property acquisition comprised 32 7 million and property dispositions comprised 26 6 million deep basin operations in 2018 35 of exploration and development expenditures were invested in our deep basin core area of the 58 million total exploration and development expenditures in this area 44 million was allocated to value capital and 14 million to support capital during the year we drilled 10 gross 7 1 net wells mainly in the wilrich notikewin falher and bluesky formations average 2018 production in our deep basin core area was 27 496 boe per day comprised of 88 natural gas although the oil and natural gas liquids production was only 12 of total deep basin production it is predominately approximately 70 oil and condensate production in 2018 we completed the initial phase of our farm in at edson and tied in the majority of the production into our ansell facility the edson area northwest of ansell is an attractive multi zone area with three prospective zones notikewin falher and bluesky successfully tested to date the notikewin formation has been the most prolific with the first well having a peak monthly raw gas rate of 9 0 mmcf per day and averaging 6 5 mmcf per day over the first ten months of production our second notikewin well was brought on in late december and is performing in a similar fashion in the first few weeks of production at a well cost of 3 2 million to drill complete equip and tie in this play has an outstanding production efficiency of approximately 3 500 per boe per day note 1 non gaap measure that does not have any standardized meaning under ifrs and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other entities reference should be made to the section entitled non gaap measures the three well bluesky program at edson has averaged 3 3 mmcf per day per well over six months with a modest decline rate of only 11 the value of these reliable bluesky production profiles are enhanced with 18 barrels per mmcf of ngls 60 of which is condensate in the current low natural gas price environment our 2018 ansell wilrich development was curtailed to the drilling of only three wells the final two wells have just recently been brought on production west central operations in 2018 61 of exploration and development expenditures were invested in our west central core area of the 100 million total exploration and development expenditures in this area 79 million was allocated to value capital and 21 million to support capital during the year we drilled completed and placed on production 18 gross wells 17 8 net wells comprised of 11 gross 10 8 net glauconite wells six gross 6 0 net falher wells and one gross 1 0 net notikewin well average 2018 production in our west central core area was 38 563 boe per day comprised of 41 oil and natural gas liquids the focus for development activity in west central core area shifted to the strachan area in 2018 where 44 of exploration and development expenditures were allocated the drilling of six gross 5 8 net wells resulted in the addition of 4 290 boe per day cumulatively in the final month of 2018 which equates to a cost to add production of 7 640 per boe per day this is a significant improvement over our 2017 program given that our cost per meter of lateral drilled has decreased by 24 from 2017 to 2018 furthermore targeting liquids rich areas of the reservoir resulted in our ngl ratio increasing 22 to 55 barrels per mmcf of raw gas 40 of which is condensate lastly the connection to the ricinus facility in june has resulted in a reduction of natural gas shrinkage from 15 to 9 the next most active area in west central was our morningside falher play where we spent 24 of our exploration and development expenditures and drilled six gross 6 0 net wells the 2018 wells averaged 4 7 mmcf per day of raw gas per well over the first month of production which was a 31 improvement over our 2017 program these results were heavily influenced by our drilling activity extending the play north of our historical development the morningside falher play continues to demonstrate excellent metrics as the six well program resulted in cumulative production additions in the last month of 2018 of 3 430 boe per day for a production efficiency of 5 540 per boe per day lastly in the hoadley glauconite play our focus in 2018 was in willesden green an area of the reservoir characterized with greater ngl content the five gross 5 0 net wells drilled in 2018 averaged 676 boe per day per well over the first three months of production a 45 improvement over our 2017 program the horizontal lateral length for the 2018 program was 17 longer with our well costs only four percent higher the five well program resulted in production additions of 3 070 boe per day in the final month of 2018 generating a production efficiency of 5 530 per boe per day acquisitions and divestitures in 2018 property acquisition expenditures amounted to 32 7 million and proceeds from property dispositions totaled 26 6 million for a net expenditure of 6 0 million the majority of these expenditures were associated with swap transactions where we conducted five swaps for undeveloped land and two swaps that involved production and cash proceeds we also closed three property acquisitions where the assets acquired were synergistic with our existing operations in total all the acquisition and dispositions activity resulted in a net gain of 402 boe per day of production and significant 2p reserve additions in the 2018 glj reserve report of 15 3 mmboe resulting in attractive reserve additions costs of 3 63 per boe including changes in fdc these acquired assets included high quality development opportunities with seven proved locations on these lands included in our 2019 budget corporate production we achieved annual average production of 69 154 boe per day in 2018 this annual average production was four percent lower than 2017 resulting from a 39 110 million reduction in net capital expenditures in 2018 relative to 2017 triggered by an uncertain commodity price outlook this spending strategy allowed us to create incremental financial flexibility with the repayment of 60 0 million of long term debt production volumes throughout the year were also impacted by various third party processing constraints and turnarounds ethane rejection and production curtailments due to ngtl maintenance and inadequate pipeline egress out of the wcsb these events resulted in a total curtailment of approximately 2 100 boe per day for 2018 production revenues marketing and risk management production revenues for the year totaled 531 0 million inclusive of 16 1 million of realized gains on financial instrument commodity contracts a decrease of approximately eight percent over the prior year of 578 6 million a majority of the 47 5 million decrease can be attributed to the four percent decrease in production volumes from the prior year production revenues inclusive of realized gains on financial instrument commodity contracts on a per boe basis decreased four percent to 21 04 from the prior year of 21 97 the decrease was primarily the result of the decline in natural gas pricing year over year due to the volatility of aeco natural gas pricing caused by maintenance on the ngtl system in alberta notwithstanding these pressures our realized natural gas price inclusive of realized gains on financial instrument commodity contracts for 2018 was 2 78 per mcf an 87 premium to the average aeco daily spot price of 1 49 per mcf hedging activities throughout the year led to a 0 60 per mcf premium in our realized natural gas price a 6 64 per boe discount to our realized ngl price and a 9 61 per boe discount to our realized oil price note 1 non gaap measure that does not have any standardized meaning under ifrs and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other entities reference should be made to the section entitled non gaap measures operating and transportation expenses aggregate operating expenses of 143 9 million declined two percent from 147 2 million in 2017 largely due to lower production volumes this was offset by per unit operating costs modestly increasing by 11 cents on the year from 5 59 per boe to 5 70 per boe the majority of the per unit cost increase was due to the temporary shut in of wells in response to low natural gas prices third party turnarounds activities and ethane rejection partially offset by our development focus on our core assets with low cost structures transportation expenses for the year were 33 7 million as compared to 24 9 million in 2017 with natural gas transportation making up approximately 90 of the 2018 total the full impact of the firm service pipeline transportation tolls for transporting natural gas to dawn placed into service in november of 2017 contributed to our 2018 transportation expenses by 12 2 million as compared to a 2 0 million impact in 2017 general administrative and interest expenses general and administrative expenses for 2018 were 24 3 million compared to 24 7 million in 2017 gross general and administrative costs were eight percent lower in the year resulting from reduced staffing levels and our continued commitment of reducing costs the cost savings garnered in 2018 however were offset by reduced capital overhead recoveries due to our reduced exploration and development spending in the year capital overhead recoveries were 2 9 million as compared to 4 8 million in 2017 this reduction in overhead recoveries offset the positive impact achieved from reducing our overall general and administrative expenditures associated with running our business interest expenses for 2018 decreased 3 0 million to 35 1 million in 2018 as compared to 38 1 million in 2017 due to lower average debt levels year over year cash flow from operating activities and adjusted funds flow cash flow from operating activities for the year ended 2018 was 291 2 million a decrease of 11 from the year ended 2017 of 325 6 million the decrease in cash flow from operating activities was largely due to the 4 decline in production volumes in addition to realized revenue declining to 21 04 per boe from 21 97 per boe inclusive of gains on financial commodity instrument contracts for the year ended december 31 2018 adjusted funds flow 1 decreased 14 to 259 6 million 1 00 per share basic from 302 0 million 1 18 per share basic for the same period of 2017 the decrease in adjusted funds flow was primarily due to lower natural gas and natural gas liquids production volumes and lower natural gas prices partially offset by an increase in natural gas liquids prices long term debt long term debt of 801 6 million increased by 1 1 million from year end 2017 of 800 5 million long term debt consists of 13 0 million cad drawn on our 500 0 million cad dollar bank credit facility and 789 7 million cad in senior unsecured notes 565 million us and 20 0 million cad with a current average remaining life of 3 5 years despite allocating 60 0 million from cash flow from operating activities to reduce long term debt in 2018 our stated long term debt levels were virtually unchanged as a result of changes to the cdn us exchange rate and the corresponding impact on the revaluation of our us denominated senior unsecured notes foreign exchange forward contracts of 400 million us have been entered into in order to protect the balance sheet from the impact of a fluctuating cdn us currency these contracts at the end of 2018 had an asset value of 17 2

the section entitled non gaap measures 2019 outlook and capital plans the western canadian natural gas sector has experienced numerous distressed pricing events throughout 2018 for 2018 canadian aeco natural gas prices averaged c 1 44 per gj a 22 year low at the aeco hub per gj a 22 year low at the aeco hub in the fourth quarter canadian natural gas prices averaged us 1 43 per mmbtu a 61 discount to the average natural gas price in the us of us 3 64 per mmbtu in the us for the same period and per mmbtu a 61 discount to the average natural gas price in the us of per mmbtu in the us for the same period and in december western canadian aeco prices averaged c 1 67 per mcf while prices immediately south and east of our western canadian borders were c 4 80 per mcf and c 4 93 per mcf respectively the quality of our abundant natural gas resources in western canada are competitive with most natural gas plays in north america the challenge we face in canada is the lack of pipeline and export egress for the product we produce our competitive supply is being constrained by exhaustive regulation creating a lack of export infrastructure to our borders this in turn is causing severe discounts in canadian pricing and providing a competitive advantage to our most fierce competitor the united states of america us this disadvantage has become clear with 50 growth in us natural gas production from 2007 to 2015 while western canadian production has shrunk during the same time period major transformations are underway for the global energy sector from growing electrification to the globalization of natural gas markets growth in global gas trade is accelerating given the accessibility of natural gas with the increasing investment in liquefied natural gas lng and policy efforts to combat air pollution both key drivers of natural gas demand as developing economies replace coal fired generation with modern and efficient gas fired generation emissions can be reduced natural gas is clearly becoming the fossil fuel of choice around the globe annual volumes of lng exported around the world has grown significantly from approximately 14 bcf per day in 2001 to approximately 46 bcf per day in 2018 current forecasts are that by 2035 world lng production will reach approximately 100 bcf per day with up to 1 800 tcf of marketable resources in place in canada clearly we as canadians have an opportunity like no other to supply the rest of the world with clean environmentally and socially responsible energy while natural gas use in advanced economies is expected to grow over the next 20 years asia is expected to remain the primary driver of demand growth with world demand for natural gas currently on the rise china is expected to outpace japan as the world s largest gas importing country this year with imports continuing to grow and expected to catch the level of the eu by 2040 there should be no other country that can compete like canada to provide lng to china a developing country looking for a reliable responsible source of clean energy the us is also responding much quicker to the growth in world demand for lng while both canada and the us began in a similar position in 2010 the us will be exporting in excess of nine bcf per day by year end unfortunately here in canada we cannot share the same success story fortunately the door has recently been opened with a positive final investment decision in late 2018 for the initial phase of lng canada on the west coast of our country the first phase of this project calling for up to two bcf per day of demand has initial exports scheduled for 2024 this announcement has provided an increased level of confidence in export markets for canadian natural gas we expect to see updates in 2019 on other lng export project proposals which if met with cooperation from our policy makers and the citizens of canada could add up to four bcf per day of incremental natural gas exports in due course in 2018 we proudly celebrated our 21st year of efficient operations in western canada creating value for our shareholders through financial stewardship sustainable development and cost effective production of high quality canadian natural resources canadian energy production standards are global benchmarks for sustainable development and environmental protection canadian natural gas is the one of the most responsible and environmentally friendly hydrocarbons in the world it is a reliable efficient and affordable source of energy developed under leading regulatory and labour standards substitution of higher carbon fuels with greater use of canadian natural gas by international consumers is a net global environmental benefit our business philosophy in 2019 will be similar to our approach in 2018 in the current subdued commodity price environment we see little economic incentive to grow our business hence we intend to allocate capital to our highest quality development opportunities whereby we maintain production from january to december we will focus on maximizing cash flow from operating activities with a goal to generate adjusted funds flow 1 in excess of what is required to maintain our forecasted production we plan to allocate these funds to reduce our net debt 1 to strengthen our balance sheet and enhance our future financial flexibility in addition we intend to continue investing in land and infrastructure in the current environment to prepare our asset portfolio for maximum value creation in the future our 2019 capital program is forecasted to range between 130 and 170 million of which approximately 110 to 130 million will be allocated to our value capital program approximately three quarters of our development capital is set to be spent in our west central area with the remainder being allocated to the deep basin core area with minimal commitments across our portfolio we intend to remain flexible with capital allocation and responsive to changing commodity prices the remaining 20 to 40 million will be allocated to support capital intended to strengthen our asset portfolio for the future our predictable asset base and reliable capital program allows us to maintain our exit production year over year between 67 000 and 69 000 boe per day continued ethane rejection forecasted in 2019 and a significant third party turnaround season negatively impacts our forecasted annual production in june we are forecasting a production curtailment of approximately 10 000 boe per day due to turnaround activity alone hence we expect annual production to be between 65 000 and 69 000 boe per day currently we have approximately 60 of our forecasted 2019 production hedged with hedges in place for all products that we produce specifically our natural gas marketing strategy has minimized our exposure to the daily aeco hub with less than 17 of our forecasted natural gas production throughout the summer of 2019 being exposed to aeco volatility lastly we have approximately 70 mmcf per day of our natural gas diversified to sales points beyond aeco the 2019 plan 2 is designed to generate approximately 170 to 200 million of adjusted funds flow 1 at current strip prices and is expected to lead to the reduction of net debt 1 reduction for the fourth consecutive year we thank our employees for their commitment and dedication our board of directors

have any standardized meaning as prescribed by ifrs and therefore may not be comparable with the calculations of similar measures for other entities management believes that the presentation of these non gaap measures provide useful information to investors and shareholders as the measures provide increased transparency and the ability to better analyze performance against prior periods on a comparable basis the non gaap measures included in this document include adjusted funds flow is based on cash flow from operating activities excluding changes in non cash working capital decommissioning expenditures and including interest expense where working capital is equal to current assets less current liabilities certain non cash charges and decommissioning expenditures have been excluded from the calculation of adjusted funds flow as management believes the timing of collection payment and incurrence is variable and by excluding them from the calculation management is able to provide a more meaningful measure of bonavista s cash flow on a continuing basis more specifically expenditures on decommissioning liabilities may vary from period to period depending on bonavista s capital programs and the maturity of its operating areas the settlement of decommissioning obligations is managed through bonavista s capital budgeting process which considers its available adjusted funds flow for the three months ended december 31 2018 the non discretionary component of bonavista s decommissioning expenditures was 0 6 million december 31 2017 1 3 million similarly for the year ended december 31 2018 the non discretionary component of bonavista s decommissioning expenditures was 3 6 million december 31 2017 3 1 million bonavista considers adjusted funds flow to be a key measure that provides a more complete understanding of bonavista s ability to generate cash flow necessary to finance capital expenditures expenditures on decommissioning obligations fund its dividend program and meet its financial obligations bonavista considers its capital structure to include working capital excluding associated assets and liabilities from financial instrument commodity contracts and decommissioning liabilities bank credit facility senior unsecured notes and shareholders equity bonavista monitors capital based on the ratio of net debt to adjusted funds flow annualized current quarter operating netback is equal to production revenues and realized gains and losses on financial instrument commodity contracts less royalties operating and transportation expenses operating netback per boe is calculated by dividing operating netback by total production volumes sold in the period bonavista s management believes that operating netback is a key industry benchmark and a measure of operating performance that assists management and investors in assessing bonavista s profitability operating netback on a per boe basis assists bonavista s management and investors in evaluating operating performance on a comparable basis cash costs are equal to the total of operating transportation general and administrative and interest expenses cash costs per boe are calculated by dividing cash costs by total production volumes sold in the period bonavista s management uses cash costs in assessing the corporation s operating efficiency and controllable cost structure bonavista s management believes that cash costs is a useful measure used by investors when evaluating bonavista s operating performance cash costs on a per boe basis also assists bonavista s management and investors in evaluating bonavista s cash costs on a comparable basis with prior periods net debt is equal to bonavista s bank credit facility and senior unsecured notes net of working capital excluding associated assets and liabilities from financial instrument commodity contracts and decommissioning liabilities bonavista considers net debt to be a key measure in assessing the liquidity of the corporation on a comparable basis with prior periods bonavista has calculated net debt based on the bank credit facility and senior unsecured notes net of working capital working capital has been adjusted to exclude the current portion of financial instrument commodity contracts and the current portion of decommissioning liabilities management has excluded the current portion of financial instrument commodity contracts as they are subject to a high degree of volatility prior to ultimate settlement similarly management has excluded the current portion of the decommissioning liability as this is an estimate based on management s assumptions and subject to volatility based on changes in cost and timing estimates the risk free discount rate and inflation rate net capital expenditures is equal to cash flow used in investing activities excluding changes in non cash working capital bonavista considers net capital expenditures to be a useful measure of

exploration and development expenditures that are associated with maintenance existing operations and to support future development production efficiency which is defined as a type of capital efficiency that measures the cost to add an incremental barrel of flowing production specifically for the average production efficiencies of our plays bonavista uses the total actual projected drill complete and tie in capital divided by the total of the wells initial production rate any reference made in this document to initial production rates are useful in confirming the presence of hydrocarbons however such rates are not determinative of the rates at which such wells will continue production and decline thereafter while encouraging readers are caution not to place reliance on such rates in calculating the aggregate production for bonavista certain information in this document may constitute analogous information as defined in ni 51 101 with respect to offset well production and drilling results from other producers with operations that are in geographical proximity to or believed to be on trend with bonavista s assets management of bonavista believes the

based on either energy content or current prices while the boe ratio is useful for comparative measures and observing trends it does not accurately reflect individual product values and might be misleading particularly if used in isolation as well given that the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil to natural gas is significantly different from the 6 1 energy equivalency ratio

more than 10 years ago some australian readers begin regaling me with the ideas of economist bill mitchell of the university of newcastle in new south wales he was teaching about something he called and he coined the term modern monetary theory i looked into it and fairly quickly dismissed it as silly actually printing money as an economic policy get serious mmt is a revival of an early 1900s idea called chartalism now it is influencing the thinking of new socialist like movements in the us and other places and cited by politicians mmt is increasingly appearing in mainstream media like this sobering financial times article since it is increasingly discussed in more public venues you should know more about it and that will be today s topic before we go into that i want to remind you that priority pricing for the strategic investment conference ends on monday february 18 you can save up to 1 000 over the final registration price on tuesday the price goes up substantially it s the best lineup of speakers i ve ever had if i have room at the end of this letter i ll mention them for you but you can look on the link and see the speakers yourself twenty nine speakers plus yours truly not including some well known names as panel moderators by popular request there will be more panels and speaker interaction this year than ever attendees all mentioned how much they enjoy discussing the conference with fellow attendees and making new friends and especially that the speakers make themselves available to attendees as much as possible frankly many of the speakers will attend most if not all of the conference it is simply that good so don t procrastinate save yourself some money by clicking on the link and registering today and make sure that we don t have to tell you we sold out again registrations are ahead of schedule so there is a real chance even with the larger venue that that could happen here is a quick video in which i tell you more i hope you catch my enthusiasm join me in dallas now on with our letter essentially mmt espouses that the public through the government owns the process of money creation and that in addition to borrowing and taxing should simply issue currency as payment for its obligations this is not the sleight of hand that quantitative easing was this is direct monetization in lieu of borrowing if that sounds like printing money that s because it is upfront and in your face as a serious economic proposal most of the time when i am talking with my fellow writers and economists when somebody mentions mmt everybody smiles maybe chuckles and shakes their heads the problem is what seems like a joke is actually getting traction let s get the official definition of mmt from wikipedia my comments inserted are in brackets in mmt vertical money money created by the government and spent in the private sector enters circulation through government spending taxation and its legal tender enable power to discharge debt and establish the fiat money as currency giving it value by creating demand for it in the form of a private tax obligation that must be met in addition fines fees and licenses create demand for the currency an ongoing tax obligation in concert with private confidence and acceptance of the currency maintains its value because the government can issue its own currency at will mmt maintains that the level of taxation relative to government spending the government s deficit spending or budget surplus is in reality a policy tool that regulates inflation and unemployment and not a means of funding the government s activities by itself proponents argue that unemployment is caused by lack of demand and lack of demand is caused by insufficient money entering the private sector a problem the government can solve by creating money and spending it in the private sector voilà demand is created and unemployment goes down inflation that can be controlled by higher taxes hey it s their theory don t ask me to explain it economists advising major presidential and congressional candidates on the progressive and even moderate left are more and more openly talking about mmt and its practical applications i have said before that economists are the modern day equivalent of shamans and priests rather than looking at sheep entrails economists look at data and tell the politician king emperor or chief what they want to hear i have been in more than one meeting where a politician is clearly shopping for a rationale for something that they would like to propose and do any serious politician is going to have more than a few economic advisors attached in one form or another to their campaign like what you re reading get this free newsletter in your inbox every saturday read our privacy policy here first name this is required email this is required subscribe for free recaptcha let me quickly state that i am not disparaging the role of economists when they act as political advisors i have done that myself it is actually one of the rationales for the discipline indeed it would be strange if that were not the case 90 of readers may wonder why we are even talking about this in a serious letter the rest of you may tell me how i m wrong and it really will work let me hasten to say that 10 years ago it was much less than 1 and it is beginning to come from readers that i recognize to be fairly serious there are multiple and growing motivations and rationales for adopting mmt into your own philosophical base why should this be on your radar let me give you just a few scenarios politicians are increasingly talking about free stuff free college guaranteed basic income more total healthcare paid for by the public basic housing and more it is almost like there will be an auction to see who can promise the most free benefits paid for by taxes on the rich they will cite economic advisors who say it is completely doable and even necessary for the general welfare the richest country in the history of rich countries can easily afford to spend more on its citizens ensuring basic income and wealth equality more or less a direct quote from several interviews forget mere income taxes the new political ante will be a wealth tax that means these ideas will be increasingly promoted in the public space more politicians will argue for increased spending and or at least different spending priorities guns and butter over the next few years this will enter the national mindset an increasingly large group of voters especially younger voters will feel a natural affinity with the idealism why shouldn t a rich nation help those who are less advantaged then somewhere while we are having this conversation there will be a recession unemployment will rise and deficits increase until we are on our way to a 30 trillion debt in just a few years this will crowd out private investment slowing whatever recovery there might be and making us vulnerable to a quick second recession not unlike the recessions of 1980 and 1982 but it will also produce the potential for a true change election the frustration noted among trump voters will still be there but it will also be shared by many on the left who will see the promises as a way to change things it is hard to argue in the middle of financial crisis and recession that we don t need change there won t be a president warren harding who essentially decided to do nothing in one of the deepest recessions depressions in american history in the early 1920s in that case severe austerity allowed markets to clear but the recovery gave us the roaring 1920s cause and effect numerous scholarly books have been written to suggest that but that will not be the case 100 years later as we face the 2020s there will be an increasing drumbeat for doing something change will be the mantra it is not far fetched to imagine a white house and congress beginning to work around the principles of mmt if not adopt it outright with sharply higher taxes and spending now here s where it gets a little bit murkier the federal reserve even if a new president could pack the board with members philosophically attuned to a new president s desire to increase public spending through monetary creation does not have the legal authority to directly create money that is a right reserved strictly for the federal government and specifically the us treasury the treasury can issue all the debt into the private sector it wants the federal reserve can then go into the private market and buy all the debt it wants adding that debt to its balance sheet this is called quantitative easing it is technically not the same thing congress has tried to create agencies which would use the federal reserve to directly create money these agencies and methods have all been ruled overwhelmingly unconstitutional by the supreme court for the federal reserve to create money as mmt advocates want you would have to amend the federal reserve act certainly a possibility but not easy confirmed speaker george w bush 43rd president of the united states of america confirmed speaker howard marks oaktree capital co chairman confirmed speaker carmen reinhart international financial system professor confirmed attendee you reserve your sic 2019 seat now at the limited time priority price proponents of mmt point to how successful japan has been in implementing what essentially looks to be the same policy they have moved 140 of their gdp under the balance sheet of the bank of japan essentially buying every bond available in the private markets their balance sheet is growing because they are buying stocks and carrying japan s entire annual deficit which is large like what you re reading get this free newsletter in your inbox every saturday read our privacy policy here first name this is required email this is required subscribe for free recaptcha why can t we do the same japan and the us are both modern countries and economies europe though not to the extent of japan also engaged in a large amount of quantitative easing if it didn t cause problems the last time why not try it again on a larger scale especially if there is a crisis the explanation for japan not having inflation or hyperinflation doesn t fit into a sound bite and mmt proponents can answer it with dismissive sound bites that will be readily consumed and believed by a public wanting change coupled with automation increasingly taking jobs and depressing wages it will be a firestorm of political backlash and calls for change the only way to really tackle the increasing deficits is to reduce medicare and medicaid benefits means test social security and at the same time raise the age of eligibility but few politicians will run on a platform of cutting medicare and social security because no matter how they propose it that will be what it means raise medicare and social security taxes or simply increase taxes on everyone or at least the rich a lot the definition of the rich would have to be lower than you might think most of my readers will be seen as the rich whether you feel rich is beside the point that will still not balance the budget but there s a high probability that it will send us into yet another recession bringing calls for more direct spending and some form of money creation as the answer that s what mmt says we should do any politician who proposes to limit entitlement spending to balance the budget will be accused of forcing austerity on those least able to afford it that is not a winning platform there will be no clinton gingrich compromise austerity has no fun and simple sound bites it requires a certain amount of pain which is generally not politically popular oh a segment of the population will embrace such but we must remember that elections are won on the margin president trump won by razor thin margins in a few midwest states a change election in the middle of a recession or its aftermath could not only see those margins evaporate but bring a wave of progressive and socialist politicians to join aoc and her friends think 1932 the country was in true turmoil and there was a huge shift to the left fdr didn t get every policy he wanted but he got a lot of them it was truly transformational and has impacted the us for the last 100 years what would this look like how do we get there we are going to have several sessions at the strategic investment conference to specifically address these issues is all this going to happen next year no but something along the above line is my base case for the 1920s that means you need to begin structuring your life and your portfolios to avoid being in a tunnel with an oncoming train these are not simple changes like simple buy and sell instructions but will require much deeper structural change in not just your portfolios but perhaps your lives it is something you want to think very seriously about while you have the luxury of time and not wait to the last minute waiting too long may mean you won t be as prepared as you will wish think about how you would deal with taxes 20 or 30 higher or more than today s and potentially more how would that change your lifestyle what can you do today to deal with whatever may come it may mean adjusting your lifestyle saving more and getting out of debt which takes time for most families these are not quick decisions but i think they will become necessary ones especially if the first wave of a change election happens in 2020 bluntly shane and i have already begun our own changes if somehow there is eventually a change back to austerity or a crisis forces it that will mean even more change you need to be prepared for and unfortunately it s not clear what will happen we will have to get much closer to the actual events and elections to get a feel for the way actual events may develop this year s sic has perhaps the widest range of topics and speakers i have ever assembled every speaker is designed to help you plan for 2020 and beyond what should you do today what should you do to begin to get ready for change what might those changes look like where are we currently in the investment cycle bull or bear market i have numerous cycle and market experts presenting there will be several panels focused specifically on government debt and deficits and more than a few sessions on china and europe the speakers on china and the panels will be eye opening the china panel will be explosive there are experts you may not be familiar with who have much different viewpoints it is a bit of a personal coup to get them all on the same stage while they will be making separate presentations i m going to have bill white and lacy hunt on the same panel talking about central banking and debt bill white for those not aware was the chief economist for the bank of international settlements and my favorite central banker housing and interest rates are critical to the us economy and i have invited john burns and barry habib my go to guys when it comes to housing and mortgages to open up that world to us who better than jeffrey sherman from doubleline to talk about interest rates i am technically not allowed to say he might be a better speaker than his boss jeff gundlach mark yusko grant williams louis gave of course george friedman will be there david rosenberg will once again be my lead off hitter and will be one of the speakers staying and mingling for the entire conference and of course you have to deal with energy in a serious way you re in texas a final closing morning with howard marks carmen reinhart and bill white talking about central banks government debt and how we deal with it i am really looking forward to the final panel seriously can it get any better we re going to do a special session with pat caddell and neil howe talking about the elections of 2020 and the political climate of the 2020s caddell was predicting a populist like trump to win years before 2016 neil was talking about the generational angst that is developing these are the two guys who got it right and have been getting it right for a long time i want to know what they re thinking now and so do you and they will also be there for the entire conference so you can access them in a break or even sit with them at one of the many dinners and lunches i am more excited about this conference than any other for the last 16 years you are simply not going to want to miss this register today and save 1 000 don t procrastinate join me

overview the snapped a four day advance yesterday and equities in the asia pacific followed suit all the markets in the region were lower bar in australia msci s regional benchmark stalled after reaching a four month high in the middle of the week european markets were mostly higher in the morning session after slipping yesterday including today s gains the jones has risen in 11 of the past 14 sessions and has only fallen one week so far this year for almost an 8 gain it is about 2 below its 200 day moving average benchmark 10 year bond yields eased lower in the asia pacific region after rates fell in the u s yesterday european bond markets are mixed with core yields mostly a little lower and peripheral yields firmer led by italy the u s yield fell five basis points yesterday after the dismal retail sales report the is firmer against most of the major currencies and on the week only the and dollars resisted the draw among emerging market currencies the thai and brazilian were the only ones to buck the broader greenback advance asia pacific china reported softer than expected but record aggregate financing january rose 0 1 year over year down from 0 9 it is the lowest in a couple of years and led by a decline in raw material prices consumer prices unexpectedly eased to 1 7 from 1 9 soft price pressures play into the economic slowdown story however a slowing of food price inflation from 2 5 to 2 0 was the main weight on the cpi as non food prices were steady at 1 7 nevertheless many expect the pboc to ease monetary policy through another reduction in the reserves requirements though a rate cut cannot be entirely ruled out either separately china reported a surge in lending aggregate financing jumped to cny4 64 trillion a record from cny1 59 in december new bank loans cny3 23 trillion from cny1 08 trillion in december drove this but the difference between new bank loans and aggregate financing is a rough and ready metric of the shadow banking sector officials had been squeezing it but now seem to have backed off in an attempt to support the economy activity in the shadow banking sector increased for the first time in eleven months japan reported yesterday 0 3 after a 0 7 contraction in q3 and this rendered today s final december industrial output 0 1 moot the mof weekly portfolio flow data showed japanese investors continue to buy foreign bonds in the first six weeks of 2019 they bought an average of jpy640 bln a week during the same period in 2018 there were net sellers of an average of jpy45 5 bln japanese investors have sold foreign equities at a slightly slower pace than last year jpy190 bln average vs jpy245 bln foreign investors have bought an average of jpy512 bln a week of japanese bonds sellers in the first six weeks of 2018 of an average jpy169 bln foreign investors have been set sellers of japanese equities after having been small buyers at the start of last year the new zealand dollar is the big winner this week if sustained the 1 5 advance this week would be the largest in three months it comes on the back of a central bank that was less dovish than the market had expected however we suspect the market s reaction is exaggerated the january pmi hints at why the headline eased to 53 1 from 54 8 but most troubling was the slump in new orders to 13 month lows the u s dollar is little changed against the after slipped to a four day low just above jpy110 25 there are options for about 3 bln struck at jpy109 95 jpy11000 that expire today initial resistance is pegged near jpy110 60 now the u s dollar recorded new 2019 highs yesterday near jpy111 15 the australian dollar is also little changed it has spent the week straddling the 0 7100 level the u s dollar gained 0 4 against the during the first week since the lunar new year holiday to close onshore at cny6 7745 europe while there may have been some seasonal distortion u k strongly surprised on the upside in january economists forecast around a 0 2 gain but instead a 1 2 rise was reported excluding fuel it appears u k shoppers were drawn by deep discounts for clothing where sales rose 2 1 on the other hand and despite discounts department stores and household goods purchases slumped 4 4 the largest decline in a little more than a year and a half the eurozone reported december figures since q4 has already been reported it did not attract much attention it was little changed at slightly more than 15 bln euros we looked at the 12 month moving average to smooth out the month to month noise and see the large picture it peaked at the end of 2016 near 22 bln euros the 12 month average last year was about 16 2 bln euros a 25 decline spain s cabinet meeting is continuing now but the outcome is expected to be an election announcement for mid april the minority socialist government was unable to get parliament s approval for its budget proposal political jitters may see the premium spain offers over germany to widen and short term participants may look to sell spain against portugal but medium and longer term investors may see any meaningful underperformance of spain as a new buying opportunity the euro has been straddling 1 13 this week though so far today is the first day this week that it has not poked above 1 13 note that the euro has not posted a weekly close below 1 13 since june 2017 there are two sets of options expiring today one is struck at 1 1275 for about 710 mln euros and the other is at 1 1250 for almost 750 mln euros look for north america try to push it lower as many short term participants see the fed s soma operations system open market account that drains liquidity today as being dollar friendly sterling is consolidating its recent losses by trading in a narrow range above yesterday s lows just above 1 28 it has fallen about 1 this week and is the third consecutive weekly loss there is an option for around gbp245 mln at 1 2790 that expires today america this round of u s china trade talks is ending the press is playing up the lack of visible signs of progress but it is not clear what it expected although there is the early march deadline it has seemed likely for more than a week that an extension was probable and the xi and trump would meet before the tariff freeze ended there are some rumors that china sought a 90 day extension but the u s is favoring 60 days we had previously suggested a 30 day extension seemed reasonable many recognize that china will be reluctant to capitulate to all of the u s demands a sense that trump wants to avoid another december like meltdown in stocks secure a political victory and is focused on short term transactional goals makes an agreement likely of course the longer term strategic competition remains president trump s claim of emergency powers to secure funding for the wall on the mexican border will likely face a legal challenge trump has done a good job of moving on issues that are important to his constituency and even if he loses the legal challenge he will make it 2020 rallying cry while it is a focus of domestic politics it does not seem to be much of a market factor the u s reports a series of economic data today but nothing will change the general view and soared in december and likely stagnated in january the december treasury international capital report is not a market mover it will be interesting though to see how investors shifted portfolios during the record bloodbath at the end of last year february data is more interesting and relevant it comes in the form of the survey look for modest improvement and the university of survey small improvement is expected here too canada reports its portfolio flows and january existing home sales looking for the fifth consecutive decline the u s dollar is consolidating yesterday s gains against the that brought it to cad1 3340 its highest level in a few weeks there is a nearly 800 mln option at cad1 3275 that expires today and could be in play the pair is little changed on the week the is off about 1 this week as political jitters and heavier em in general took a toll previous dollar resistance near mxn19 20 now serves as support the dollar index is up about 0 5 for the week and has held above 97 00 today the cyclical high from the end of last year was near 97 70
president donald trump speaks at the major county sheriffs and major cities chiefs association joint conference in washington d c on february 13 under trump the gross national debt reached 22 trillion president donald trump speaks at the major county sheriffs and major cities chiefs association joint conference in washington d c on february 13 under trump the gross national debt reached 22 trillion it s an eye wateringly large figure 22 trillion almost unfathomable but that was the size of america s national debt at the end of 2018 a record high reached under president donald trump and a figure widely cited this week that number came from the monthly treasury statement for december which was published on wednesday the full amount is 21 974 096 000 000 an annual rise of 7 2 percent and a significant acceleration from the previous year s increase of 2 6 percent however there is more to this figure than first appears it s a little misleading because that is the gross amount which includes debt that various federal government departments owe to other departments paul ashworth chief u s economist at the consultancy capital economics told newsweek in particular it includes nonmarketable debt that the federal government owes to the social security and medicare funds that is just a way of keeping up the illusion that there is a real fund when in reality that spending is funded on a pay as you go basis just as it is in nearly every other advanced country in fact the monthly treasury statement shows there is 5 87 trillion in these intragovernmental holdings bringing the debt figure held in u s treasuries government bonds at 16 1 trillion ashworth said the gross figure may also be affected by the debt ceiling which is currently suspended in this case the debt ceiling suspension is about to expire next month so the treasury is presumably issuing a bit more debt than it needs to ahead of the deadline so it has more wiggle room i e cash on hand next month ashworth told newsweek the treasury currently has almost 400 billion in its account at the federal reserve which is relatively high the lower 16 1 trillion number is still a record for the amount of debt held in u s treasuries but according to data from the congressional budget office cbo the last time this debt fell was 2001 pointing to longer term trends with every passing year under george w bush and then barack obama the debt pile rose to a new record high why the deficit since 2001 when there was last a surplus america s public finances have been in deficit essentially we re spending more than we re generating greg daco head of u s economics at the consultancy oxford economics told newsweek that owes largely to entitlement spending so spending on programs like medicare medicaid programs like social security and the tax base has not grown that rapidly on the revenue side if you assume that tax rates are constant what can generate more revenue is your base i e the income that s generated is rising but we know that over the past 10 years since the recession we ve had a fairly slow recovery by historical standards and therefore the base for taxation has not grown rapidly the deficit and what caused it long predates the trump era but president trump has quickened the rate at which the debt is growing by widening the deficit to finance his 1 5 trillion package of sweeping tax cuts called the tax cuts and jobs act which congress passed in 2017 trump promised these tax cuts would pay for themselves by spurring on economic activity but revenues have since stalled moreover the bipartisan budget act 2018 lifted a number of spending caps on the government federal spending by the trump administration is around 6 6 percent higher than it was before he took office equating to around 255 billion it is largely owing to this massive fiscal stimulus in both acts daco said that the debt is growing at a faster rate again in 2017 the national debt grew by 4 percent according to cbo data which excludes intragovernmental holdings by the following year trump s second in charge this had accelerated to 7 percent it s a similar story with the deficit when trump was elected in 2016 the size of the deficit measured as a portion of gdp was 3 2 percent by the end of 2018 this had increased to 3 9 percent despite a period of strong economic growth ashworth told newsweek the deficit is expected to hit 4 2 percent in 2019 it is on course to reach a nominal value of 1 trillion by the end of the year that increase comes despite the economy doing well and the unemployment rate declining so yes it can be attributed largely to the tax cuts which clearly aren t paying for themselves as most professional economists warned he said however daco said he does not think the deficit needs to be balanced for three reasons interest rates are low and likely to remain so keeping down the cost of borrowing for the government the dollar is the reserve currency of the world so u s treasuries are a safe haven for investors whenever there is volatility underpinning demand for government bonds and america can in theory never default on its debt because the federal reserve controls the money supply therefore the fed could print its way out of debt though there are substantial risks to inflation in doing so i think what s more important is in the case of the u s looking at how the deficit is increasing over time and if it s really exploding in an exponential way daco told newsweek what the key focus should be on is making sure that the deficit doesn t get out of hand deficit national debt and u s treasurys explained deficit a budget is in deficit if it has less money coming in than going out the size of the deficit is the difference between income and spending if you have 9 coming in and 10 in bills to pay you are in deficit by 1 national debt this is the money owed by the federal government the government borrows money from the markets on which it pays interest to the lenders how much interest it has to pay depends on a number of factors such as demand investor confidence in the borrower s ability to repay and the economic outlook u s treasurys when the government borrows money it issues bonds bills and notes known as u s treasurys these have different lifespans sometimes they are for 10 years sometimes longer sometimes shorter there are coupons attached to the bonds and notes for periodic interest payments to the lender when they reach the end of their life known as maturity the full amount is repaid to the investor plus a final installment of interest also known as treasurys securities they are also traded between investors once issued by the government how national debt has grown since the 1980s this list beginning with president

in the second quarter of 2017 ten years after the onset of the global financial crisis the euro area finally started growing again this was in contrast to countries such as the us where recovery commenced earlier already in 2009 and where it was sustained more successfully ecb 2011 in a recent paper corsetti et al 2019 we assess the reasons for europe s delayed recovery we adopt an historical perspective comparing the euro area with the european monetary system in the 1990s the parallels are suggestive in both cases countries with weak fundamentals experienced capital flight in both cases self fulfilling expectations magnified and intensified currency and financial turmoil in both cases bond spreads rose to high levels fragmenting financial markets across borders in addition the 1990s was a period of financial stress this was true not just of finland and sweden which experienced full blown banking crises but also of italy denmark and france previous analyses have underplayed the importance of banking stress in 1992 3 we seek to correct this in what follows the key difference there are a number of potential explanations for the difference in outcomes but the key was the success with which national central banks and treasuries backstopped banks and sovereign debt markets in the earlier crisis interrupting the so called diabolic loop brunnermeier et al 2016 backstopping and recapitalising the banks prevented financial stress from eroding economic activity tax revenues and debt market conditions investment and demand were not disrupted by a liquidity squeeze and binding credit constraints to the same extent as after 2009 hence the earlier crisis was resolved in a matter of years rather decades in contrast the incomplete institutional development of the euro area limited the ability of the ecb and other european institutions to take analogous action in the recent crisis constrained by the euro area s fiscal and financial rules governments were not able to backstop banking systems prior to the creation of the banking union and the european stability mechanism national central banks having become members of the european system of central banks were not able to backstop sovereign debt markets which in turn worsened the banks balance sheets and aggravated distress in the financial system nor was the ecb prepared to provide this backstopping function prior to mario draghi s do whatever it takes pledge in july 2012 more than two years after first greek bailout as a result the euro crisis was magnified by negative feedback between banks and sovereign debt markets the anatomy of crisis the shock triggering the erm crisis was monetary contraction and demand expansion in germany deficit spending on transfers to the new eastern lander following german reunification boosted domestic demand to limit inflation the bundesbank raised interest rates any positive spillover from higher german demand was thus counterbalanced by the negative effect of higher interest rates in 2008 the trigger was not an asymmetric demand shock in europe itself but the financial crisis originating in the us this time instead an asymmetric financial response followed banks in core europe lost their access to funding and incurred losses on their us asset backed securities in response they curtailed their lending to the european periphery the reversal of private capital flows which had financed the current account deficits of the euro area periphery prior to the crisis meant that those deficits now had to be reduced historically countries in similar situations had been able to achieve quick current account improvements by depreciating their currencies this obviously was not an option in the context of a currency union the doom loop in action in the 1990s a number of countries experienced substantial banking difficulties but given the relatively limited size of bank balance sheets the financial impact was with a few exceptions readily contained finland and sweden experienced the most serious crises laeven and valencia 2013 put the total fiscal costs at 13 for finland and 4 of gdp for sweden in 1993 danmarks nationalbank was forced to provide standby liquidity support for the country s second largest bank and was involved in finding solutions for five other distressed banks interventions to backstop the italian banking system between 1990 and 1996 cost the italian government about one half percent of 1996 gdp duca et al 2017 credit lyonnais was bailed out by the french government in early 1994 after having incurred substantial losses in the preceding year other than the cases of finland and sweden none of these banking problems rose to the level of systemic crises but they could have posed serious problems for financial intermediation and economic activity had they not been successfully contained in the more recent episode banks were substantially larger making for correspondingly higher costs when they had to be bailed out large core country banks were already undercapitalised prior to the crisis as a result of light touch regulation zero capital charges on investments in sovereign bonds and the ability to book investments off balance sheet where they escaped capital requirements hence banks did not have sufficient capital to cover their losses absent government support the large size of banking systems exacerbated the problem in two ways first attempts to bail out troubled banks put substantial stress on public finances recapitalisation and other restructuring costs ranged from 1 of gdp in france to 40 in ireland laeven and valencia 2013 contrast just 13 in finland in the 1990s combined with high inherited debts this created pressure for larger fiscal consolidations in subsequent years given the debt break enshrined in the european treaties and fiscal consolidation there was as shown in figure 1 figure 1 fiscal consolidation as a percent of gdp 1990s and 2010s1 second because peripheral sovereign debt was concentrated in the balance sheets of banks in the originating countries there existed a link between the condition of the public finances and the condition of the banks the worsening balance sheet condition of the banks and requisite bailouts had first worsened the fiscal situation of the government but the worsening fiscal situation of the government now worsened the balance sheets of the banks as sovereign bond prices declined requiring further fiscal injections to the banking system worsening sovereign balance sheets and raising questions about whether governments would have the capacity to continue backstopping the banks in the earlier crisis bank restructuring had substantial fiscal costs only in a handful of countries as we saw above as a result there was less upward pressure on government bond yields yields actually fell below pre crisis levels as early as 1994 figure 2 the fall in yields further limited the rise in debt ratios and had the additional benefit of protecting bank balance sheets from losses on government security holdings thus even in countries with impaired banks the doom loop between government debt and banking crises remained inactive and the operation of the financial accelerator was contained figure 2 five year government bond yield the rise in peripheral government sovereign debt yields in 2010 was both larger and more prolonged with average euro area periphery sovereign yields even excluding greece only converging to the average level of core sovereigns by the end of 2014 yields began their descent only after draghi s do whatever it takes pledge two and more years into the crisis by this time sovereign debt problems had been allowed to undermine the condition of the banks the doom loop had already been set in motion by the end of 1995 the erm crisis was effectively resolved a majority of erm members re affirmed their commitment to adopt a single currency while others notably the uk sweden and denmark opted for remaining outside the currency area and instead embraced inflation targeting as their monetary framework in contrast in 2019 the time of writing the euro crisis still remains unresolved in the limited sense that economic growth in the euro area still needs the full monetary policy support of the ecb lessons what explains the longer and deeper downturn after 2009 compared to 1992 3 our analysis suggests that the negative feedback between bank balance sheets and sovereign balance sheets was critical starting in 2009 10 the negative bank credit impulse and a negative fiscal impulse to which it gave rise reinforced one another because bank balance sheets were smaller in 1992 the adverse impact on sovereign balance sheets of bank resolution was smaller and the negative implications for the fiscal impulse were less from this observation follows the bottom line managing large shocks requires a credible backstop for banks and sovereign debt markets this backstop is required to prevent the endogenous amplification of shocks a backstop was available during the erm crisis but not the euro crisis the

this article was originally published by the foreign policy research institute fpri in january 2019 china s one belt one road obor project was late in coming to latin america and the caribbean lac first announced by president xi jinping in 2013 obor later renamed the belt and road initiative bri did not arrive in the lac until 2018 when at a meeting of the china celac community of latin america and the caribbean chinese foreign minister wang yi claimed that bri would inject new energy into the china celac comprehensive cooperative partnership and open up new prospects given the impressive rise of the people s republic of china to the world s second largest economy first by some measures and the difficulties that many lac countries were experiencing it is hardly surprising that wang s offer was greeted with enthusiasm if brought to completion the integration of the lac region into bri would comprise 65 percent of the world s population and 40 percent of global gdp origins of the belt and road bri is a breathtakingly ambitious program designed to underwrite the costs of global economic growth as first explained the road would revive the ancient silk route albeit in re imagined form that passed through central asia with an equally fanciful maritime route that extended to southeast asia and africa there is a good deal of creativity here there were actually several routes through central asia they had their heyday during the mongol i e non han chinese yuan dynasty and the name silk route s itself was coined by german geographer baron ferdinand von richthofen who wrote of seidenstrasse chinese merchants did indeed venture to japan and southeast asia but with the exception of the short lived voyages of zheng he 1405 1433 the country was basically an inward focused continental power by the time that the bri reached lac the difficulties it created elsewhere had become well known in malaysia prime minister mahathir mohamad has accused his predecessor najib razak of complicity in a 15 billion dollar scheme involving deals with chinese companies to construct infrastructure projects at wildly inflated prices the chinese malay broker jho lo educated at harrow and the wharton school is believed to be in hiding in china before failing to be re elected najib had been conducting secret talks with the chinese leadership to allow chinese navy ships to dock at two malaysian ports when information began to leak the chinese offered to bug the homes and offices of wall street journal reporters who were investigating the allegations in sri lanka the port of hambantota has become the symbol for how china s largesse can result in disaster with only a one ship a day docking there and elephants trampling the port s surrounding fences the government was unable to pay back its loans and granted china a 99 year lease for debt relief in pakistan the imran khan government is being investigated for awarding a bri related dam construction project to a consortium of a chinese company and one founded by the prime minister s adviser after disqualifying another bid chinese nationals and pakistani workers on the china pakistan economic corridor have been murdered and there is controversy over the chinese presence at the strategically important port of gwadar and in new york patrick ho chi ping a hong kong surgeon is on trial for bribery charges related to his promotion of bri marketing his scheme as globalization 2 0 ho was able to sign nearly 20 billion in deals in africa russia and the u s with the bribes being listed as charitable donations from a virginia foundation that received its funding from shanghai china s loans to africa have been accused of encouraging dependency utilizing corrupt deals and endangering its natural resources kenya is in danger of losing its port at mombasa to china if as predicted it defaults on loans in europe there are concerns with chinese management with the port of piraeus in greece and with trainloads of goods entering europe but returning to china empty one belt one way according to skeptics thereby exacerbating the imbalance of trade warning signs ignored under such circumstances lac leaders might be expected to be wary of joining the bri yet wang s initiative was eagerly received in the words of one latin american economist much was promised little was demanded initially only a few countries formally declared their membership by signing memoranda of understanding mous panama was the first soon after it broke diplomatic ties with taiwan in november 2017 but 14 others signed on subsequently with the latest being ecuador in december 2018 the majority are smaller countries in central america and the caribbean or members of the new left venezuela bolivia and ecuador larger countries like argentina brazil colombia mexico and peru have not yet signed on since little has been made public about the terms of the mous it is difficult to assess the significance of accession to the bri formal agreement is not a prerequisite for participation in the bri or for receiving chinese loans and attracting chinese investment but it has been hinted that beijing would be more generous to those who do so as a case in point when the south pacific kingdom of tonga joined the bri in late 2018 it received a five year deferral on payment of a loan that china had given the kingdom several years before tonga is one of eight island nations in the south pacific that owe significant debt to china and repayment would have put significant strain on its resources in the lac case a number of infrastructure projects undertaken with china had been in existence before the bri was announced since they were in essence folded into the agreement there are problems in determining what effect participation in bri will have on the economies of the countries involved understandably chinese interests focus on projects that are of most value to the prc s own economy meaning the extractive industries foodstuffs and atlantic to pacific infrastructure endeavors that will reduce the time and costs needed to transport these commodities to china and bring back chinese goods for sale in the lac infrastructure projects include track renewal for argentina s belgrano cargas railway construction of the bi oceanic railway in peru and brazil and the tele pires dam in brazil in chile a trans pacific fiber optic cable that would connect china and chile has been under consideration since 2015 foreign minister roberto ampuero sees this and other bri projects as increasing status as an economic powerhouse in latin america backers hope that its completion will result in increased levels of general investment in santiago it is possible however that the undertaking will be adversely affected by the recent revelation that the chinese telecommunications giant huawei which would construct the cable has engaged in spying a brief summary of developments in several of the larger countries in the lac is illustrative of current trends brazil brazil may be an example of chinese clout indicating that resistance may be futile so cooperation with the prc is the only feasible alternative during his campaign for the presidency the outspoken jair bolsonaro showed hostility to china saying most notably that china wasn t buying from brazil it was buying up brazil however a week after winning the contest the president elect met with the chinese ambassador to brasilia sounding much more friendly describing china as a great cooperation partner bolsanaro said he welcomed chinese investment and hoped that there would be more trade between the two countries he had good reason to do so beijing has been quick to use economic warfare to deal with recalcitrant partners as then argentine president cristina fernández de kirchner discovered when her government filed anti dumping charges against china in 2010 china then discovered quality control issues with argentine soya diverting its purchases to brazil until argentina withdrew the charges something similar could happen to brazil the prc has been the country s largest trading partner since 2009 indicating that a cessation of or even slowdown in trade would have serious consequences brazil s exports to china in 2018 approached 50 billion about twice what it earned from the united states since bolsonaro s administration has had a rocky start help from china will seem attractive still given beijing s interest in extractive industries cooperation with the prc seems likely to create more problems for him china s record on both the treatment of indigenous peoples and on environmental protection was already under fire before bolsonaro assumed the presidency with one focus of criticism being the aforementioned tele pires dam a group of 21 non governmental organizations from argentina brazil bolivia ecuador and peru recently filed three reports from their review of 18 projects managed by 15 chinese business consortia the group found a systematic violation of the rights to prior consultation and participation alongside forced evictions destruction of places of cultural and natural importance and the criminalization of community leaders environmentalists are likewise concerned with destruction of the amazon which they describe as simultaneously a carbon sink the earth s lungs and a rainmaker for the planet sixty percent of the amazon rain forest is in brazil venezuela venezuela has become the lac s poster child for what can go wrong by accepting chinese loans after the country ran up a debt of over 70 billion dollars and spiraled into hyperinflation beijing cut back on further lending with venezuela s oil output mortgaged to china to meet its obligations in september president nicolas maduro went to beijing to plead for additional funds which apparently were not forthcoming the president agreed to sell an additional 9 9 percent stake to a sino venezuelan joint venture to a chinese state corporation which already controlled 40 percent with oil services and procurement at the joint venture to be handled by chinese companies according to reuters it was unclear what beijing was giving in return even more worrisome is the maduro government s collaboration with the huge chinese telecom company zte on a system known as carnet de la patria fatherland cards the project involves more than technical assistance a unit of zte is embedded within the venezuelan telecom provider cantv zte is only in theory a private company and has had various problems with the u s including being fined 1 19 billion for breaking sanctions by selling electronics to iran and north korea the carnet is a national database that can set up payments for medicine pensions and food but will also enable the government to keep track of dissidents and quash dissenting views domestically there have been complaints about this infringement of privacy while international business interests point out that the card will also give china a database not only on venezuelan citizens but also on foreign companies and their non venezuelan employees ecuador ecuador s government is also facing a huge budget deficit caused largely by debts to china run up by a previous president rafael correa committed the country to ship 90 percent of its exportable crude to the prc until 2024 under terms that have never been disclosed leaving current president lenin moreno to cope with the problem speaking to ecuador s national assembly in november finance minister richard martinez described the situation as unsustainable saying that the country needs a bailout loan of 10 billion from the international monetary fund much of the money from china has been wasted on projects that are not only useless but also dangerous the coca coda sinclair dam that was supposed to lift ecuador out of poverty has developed cracks in its chinese made machinery shorting out the country s entire electricity grid the only time engineers tried to use it coca coda is located near an active volcano which geologists have said could wipe the dam away with a chinese diplomat cited by the new york times as explaining we didn t give sufficient attention to the environmental reporting bolivia bolivia under president evo morales was also a recipient if chinese largesse receiving a 7 billion credit line in 2015 that helped it to achieve a 4 percent economic growth rate however by 2017 bolivia s accumulated debt to china stood at 710 million more than nine times that of a decade before and its trade deficit with the prc was 1 5 billion a six fold increase over the same time period most of the companies who were awarded contracts for infrastructure projects are chinese and according to bolivian senator jose alberto gonzalez china is pursuing its own interests it is the bolivian people who pay for it in the future future prospects at both the apec summit and in meetings with leaders of central american states u s vice president mike pence warned about debt diplomacy and debt traps urging countries to avoid a constricting belt or a one way road while requiring transparency in their commercial partnerships with other nations although pence named no nations the prc foreign ministry spokesperson immediately rebutted that washington was indiscreetly pinning labels on china to serve its own political needs at the expense of the well being of the people in developing countries there is nothing inherently wrong with the bri many countries might welcome cooperation with china as an opportunity to play the prc off against traditional trading partners bri is also attractive since it carries potential for gain both for individual leaders several have been accused of corruption and their countries however many appear to have given too little thought to the possible disadvantages like any other shrewd business entity beijing will portray its motives as altruistic while contributing to the benefit of all a win win situation is the standard phrase as in any economic system however there will be winners and there will be losers despite bolivia s woes its space agency reported that the country s first communications satellite tupac katari 1 earned 102 million in its first five years tksat 1 was launched in china and its personnel were trained there and a panamanian fruit export company was optimistic that its products would be enthusiastically received in the prc a chinese professor at a u s university believes that many of the prc s problems in latin america are caused by a lack of experience with environmental regulations and in dealing with ngos and that they will be able to adjust to the more democratic setting there nonetheless at least currently problems seem to outweigh advantages to concerns with the lack of transparency in agreements should be added the potential for de industrialization concentration on supplying the food and energy demands of the prc has diverted attention from the industrialization that lac countries have long pursued since chinese manufactured goods typically undercut the prices of domestically produced equivalents there has been de industrialization in some sectors and a decrease in inter lac trade in favor of trade with the prc it is also necessary to remember that what the prc promises does not always materialize finally it has proved impossible for the diverse countries of the lac to speak with one voice with beijing as has been seen with purchases of argentine soya being switched to brazil after a trade spat china can play one lac state against another caveat emptor this essay draws on a talk given at fpri s miami salon on december 6 2018 note author s note the prc actually has many environmental regulations though evasion in complying with them is widespread ngos also exist but are under constant scrutiny and are closed down for seemingly minor reasons about the author june

so far britain seems to be bracing for a major slowdown deal or no deal the british statistics office reported that the country s economy grew only 0 2 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2018 with growth falling in december both negotiations have profound implications for the future like all divorces the disagreements are acrimonious with repercussions for everyone else involved two major divorces are in the making in march the obvious one is brexit which officially occurs on march 29 the other is the deadline for the us china trade negotiations on march 1 when us tariffs on us 200 billion worth of chinese imports are set to increase from 10 per cent to 25 per cent even though progress is likely as both sides want a deal and the market is expecting one the gap between the two sides is still daunting as bank of england governor mark carney warned in his global outlook this week global expansion is now weakening and risks are intensifying because worldwide monetary policy has been tightening trade tensions increasing and china s economy slowing the more important risk he identified is the reversal of globalisation caused by the growing imbalance on trade due to the continued us current account deficit even as the us dollar has been more dominant than ever interestingly china is no longer the major buyer of dollars as its foreign exchange reserves have remained flat the us current account deficit will be funded more by japan through its quantitative easing and the euro zone expect us trade pressure also on japan and the euro zone the second risk to globalisation is social with greater imbalances in income and wealth in many countries because the benefits of free trade are shared unequally overall consumers benefit from global trade but many workers in advanced countries have either lost their jobs or seen a fall in real wages the third globalisation risk is the loss of control and of trust in democracy and sovereignty in many countries part of the problem is that barriers to trade have increased three times as much for services as for products this hurts countries that are strong in the services trade such as the us and the uk the effects of growing protectionism will be widespread the bank of england estimates that an increase in tariffs of 10 percentage points between the us and its trading partners would take 2 5 per cent off us output and 1 per cent off global output through just the trade channel alone if non trade factors are taken into account such as tighter financial conditions greater uncertainty and permanent tariff increases the output losses could double to 5 per cent for us gross domestic product and half that for global gdp despite the recovery in advanced economies business sector investments have not increased commensurately uk business investment growth has fallen by 3 7 per cent in the past year despite a recovery in overall growth profits and accommodative monetary policy carney s conclusion is that it isn t easy to win a trade war mark carney governor of the bank of england warned that risks to the global economy are rising photo bloomberg what is true of us china trade disputes is also true of brexit the barriers to reconciliation are huge because there are now fundamental differences in outlook on both sides of the atlantic english channel and the pacific business confidence has suffered because in the case of investors in britain no one can predict with any certainty what deal if any is going to be struck either way investors will take a low risk approach by avoiding long term investments and sticking to cash there is little doubt that in the short term britain will be the loser but with a flexible exchange rate that keeps sterling competitive it will be able to cushion any long term trade shocks meanwhile the euro zone which sells a large portion of its cars and other products to britain will also have to deal with a trade shock on top of the internal complexities of keeping the european union intact the yellow vest protests in france have weakened the ability of the french government to meet german demands for stricter fiscal discipline at a time when italy s populist government is refusing to toe the eu line on expenditure and immigration protesters wearing yellow vests try to avoid water sprayed by the police during an anti government demonstration on january 26 in quimper france these protests add to the many challenges facing the european union photo afp in the pacific the longer the us china trade war persists the worse the investment climate will be overall the major trading partners of both nations do not wish to choose between them given the huge potential size of the china market and limited growth prospects of the mature us market what is unspoken at present is that if no deal is struck devaluation of the renminbi cannot be ruled out no one wants to go down this route because competitive devaluation as the solution to a trade war could lead to another global recession reminiscent of the 1930s so even though the west worries about the risk of china s debt overhang the reality is that if china truly undertakes the structural reforms that almost everyone agrees on it will emerge more productive than before even in the face of higher trade tariffs with a balanced current account china has both the fiscal space and the monetary policy potential to undertake the necessary reforms and boost domestic consumption at the same time however even if china buys more from the us the rest of the world would worry that the increase in imports comes at its expense thus not only will the trade war directly affect us consumers negatively it will hurt trade and jobs in the rest of the world this is why feuding parties need to be realistic and come to terms that cannot be ideologically pure on either side for american hawks to expect that the us can enforce standards on china is as realistic as china imposing ideas on us hawks negotiations are now down to the wire with no illusion that a solution will be found in the medium term expect nothing but higher political risks soon andrew sheng writes on global issues from an asian perspective
the old continent is dying the euro is on the brink of collapse this is what you can often hear in the press but is that really the case we invite you to read our todayâ s article about the development of the eurozone in the last 20 years and find out what are the real prospects for the euro â and what does it imply for the gold market in december we celebrated 40 years of market reforms in china in january there was another important anniversary 20 years of the euro area so letâ s move from east asia to europe analyzing the economic situation of the eurozone and its implications for gold after years of negotiations and preparations the euro was launched on january 1st 1999 initially the shared currency was only virtual and the national currencies were still legal tenders used in circulation for ordinary citizens little changed however the exchange rates between national currencies were locked at fixed rates against each other while the european central bank took control over their monetary policy the euro notes and coins entered the circulation three years later the first members included austria belgium finland france germany ireland italy luxembourg the netherlands portugal and spain greece joined the club in 2001 though it should not have done as it turned out later since then seven more countries â slovenia cyprus malta slovakia estonia latvia lithuania â entered the eurozone in the beginning everything was running smoothly but then the financial crisis hit the eurozone heavily revealing significant defects in its architecture the fatal flaw is that there is a currency union with several independent fiscal policies it was quite perverse as the great recession erupted in america however the us â with its unified fiscal and political system â overcame the crisis relatively quickly on the contrary the eurozone suffered a prolonged depression as the financial crisis morphed into the sovereign debt crisis only when mario draghi famously pledged the ecb would do â whatever it takesâ to preserve the euro the market turmoil calmed the truth is that europeâ s monetary union is still unfinished as there is neither a true banking union nor a capital market union this is because the euro was the political project from the beginning not an economic one it was never an optimal currency area but the idea was that the euro would push european countries toward deeper integration making wars impossible as economists we are thus a bit skeptical of the prospects of the common currency and the whole bloc indeed as the chart below shows the eurozone performed worse than the us the former economy grew 31 4 percent by q3 2018 compared to 50 5 percent for the latter chart 1 real gdp growth in the eurozone blue line and in the us red line from q1 1999 to q3 2018 as an index where q1 1999 100 however the pace of growth was also lower than in the us before the introduction of the euro and the common currency did not prevent the whole bloc from growing although the performance differed among the countries actually the euroâ s performance has been demonized its performance has not been as poor as one could expect given the moderate growth in the gdp and all those gloomy headlines just look at the chart below which presents the eur usd exchange rate since the creation of the euro chart 2 eur usd exchange rate from january 1999 to december 2018 as one can see the euroâ s value against the us dollar was initially 1 1812 from then to the end of 2018 it dropped to 1 1456 or 3 percent not so bad given the fact that it is used in several economically distinct countries what are the implications for the gold market quite important as it turns out please look at the chart above once again although the correlation is not perfect itâ s clear that the performance of the euro which is the second widely used reserve currency in the world is significantly linked to the gold prices itâ s true that the eurozone faces many problems including the still weak banking system or the rise in populism but investors should acknowledge that the euro area is more robust today than it was at the start of the greek sovereign debt crisis for example the european policymakers established the rescue fund and launched the banking union moreover despite the populist revolution almost 75 percent of the eurozoneâ s population support the euro even in italy almost 70 percent supports the common currency and funny enough when the risk premium increased italyâ s new government also started to express more sympathy towards the euro all this means that the euro is out of the danger zone at least in the short run actually the slowdown of the u s and chinaâ s expansion could push investors towards the euro denominated assets especially when the ecb starts finally hiking its interest rates if that happens and the euro strengthens against the us dollar in the second half of 2019 the price of gold may go up

on the evening of jan 28 a mysterious russian airliner without any passengers landed in caracas the capital of venezuela rumour had it the plane was there to transport to russia 20 tonnes of the nation s gold reserves worth over 1 1 billion russia claimed to know nothing about it no this was not a james bond movie so what exactly was venezuela s disputed leader nicolás maduro up to after all he d already failed trying to withdraw venezuela s gold reserves out of the bank of england no one knows at least not yet but this moment is why some say cryptocurrencies could be key to survival for people caught in the midst of a national economic meltdown like venezuela s that is a perfect advertisement of why you should use bitcoin argues bitcoin com s latin america head matt aaron not only that figuring out how to give venezuelans cryptocurrency is an exciting way to potentially reinvent not for profit work says vancouver based investor boris wertz of his related charitable efforts could they be right i was forced to check my assumptions i have been relentlessly skeptical of cryptocurrencies to me they ve seemed like vapourware traded by two types of people libertarians innately distrusting of financial institutions or speculators hoping to get rich quick in 2013 vancouver became home of the first ever bitcoin atm in the world located in a waves coffee shop next to the b c supreme court some of my friends rushed to feed stacks of their hard earned cash into the machine in exchange for prized bits of virtual coin i held off recently though because i have a friend from venezuela with family members still there i imagine myself living in a country where the currency has inflated a million per cent in less than a year and i am not sure whether to boo or cheer the many cryptocurrency startups rushing into venezuela right now i am going to refer to my venezuelan canadian friend by a made up name lola to protect her mother and other relatives still living in venezuela in vancouver lola helps organize elections and plebiscites for venezuelans living in western canada lola co founded a group called action for venezuela that fundraises with the unhcr united nations high commissioner for refugees for venezuelan refugees she advocates passionately to bring attention to the dire conditions in her homeland rich in oil reserves venezuela should be the envy of many other countries yet economic mismanagement and other destabilizing forces have devastated it its currency the bolivar named after el libertador of south america simón bolívar is worthless people can t buy medication they can t buy food your salary is worth nothing lola told me after recently returning from venezuela credit cards there are almost as useless as cash she said because card companies cannot adjust the credit limits quickly enough to keep up with inflation a single trip to the grocery store exceeds the limit set the previous month lola saw pensioners standing in line for hours they get paid in bolivars then they run and spend it because tomorrow it is going to be worthless beyond the bolivar venezuelans cope with the hyperinflation by taking two or three jobs helping each other out or by clever circumventions for example some people with access to u s dollars typically those close to the government involved in illicit trade or receiving remittances from relatives abroad can purchase on the black market everything from jewelry to surgery the problem with carrying around u s dollars in venezuela is that it s illegal and the police and military are desperate like everyone else on the highway soldiers can strip search you lola said if they stop you and find u s money they take it away there s no report and they take it for themselves some venezuelans have figured out how to get money in and out of the country via trusted intermediaries but sometimes those intermediaries betray them and run off with the money this is where virtual currencies like bitcoin can be of help bitcoin is a peer to peer currency that does not require any central party such as a central bank or a trusted person to mediate its exchange bitcoin is one form of cryptocurrency among many such as ethereum dash zcash and more to keep track of the transactions cryptocurrencies use a decentralized ledger technology called blockchain that is distributed across many computers owned by unrelated people around the world called miners these miners receive some cryptocurrency in exchange for processing energy intensive transactions for the blockchain ledger cheap electricity heavily subsidized by the socialist venezuelan government has sprouted a thriving industry of cryptocurrency miners and evangelists in the country while bitcoin s value is highly volatile it is more stable than the current bolivar this and the abundance of cryptocurrency miners in venezuela has caused a surge in bitcoin usage there some venezuelans are using bitcoin to store and hedge their savings while others are using it to receive remittances from out of state relatives without a human intermediary venezuelans with web based businesses serving foreign clients can also receive payment for their services in bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies recipients then trade their cryptocurrency for bolivars or u s dollars with cryptocurrency buyers through online peer to peer services such as localbitcoins com or an e wallet similar to venmo seemingly free from regulation and government scrutiny they can also use the online e commerce site purse io to buy products with cryptocurrency and ship the items to venezuela via miami an enterprising startup from panama called cryptobuyer is rolling out the first bitcoin atm in caracas in february to make it easier for people to buy and sell bitcoins that is if the government doesn t shut them down meanwhile a few businesses including church s chicken the department store chain traki and hotels in venezuela are accepting cryptocurrencies as payment cryptocurrency remains not generally accepted as tender by venezuelan firms but that may be changing dash a rival to bitcoin recently announced it has recruited over 2 500 merchants from bars to medical clinics to accept dash as tender most are in caracas the day i spoke to aaron of bitcoin com his firm launched its merchant adoption campaign for bitcoin cash a cryptocurrency separate from bitcoin designed for everyday transactions the st kitts and nevis based company hired a six person team on the ground in venezuela to go door to door to educate merchants our first stage is trying to get as many merchants to try to accept bitcoin cash as possible aaron said note bitcoin com is a software company that promotes bitcoin but is not the creator of bitcoin venezuela campaign is underway if you are in caracas and looking for cupcakes and or baby supplies buy them with your wallet cuchicakes and bebecitos en linea are now accepting bitcoin cash bchvenezuela bitcoincashvenezuela pic twitter com ydj8nx31jc bitcoin com official bitcoincom february 7 2019 even maduro got swept up in the cryptocurrency craze by starting a state sponsored oil backed centralized cryptocurrency called the petro which requires users to register their identities with the government before they can use it the petro seems like a desperate attempt on maduro s part to liberate his own state from bolivars and u s sanctions there have been reports the government tried to force venezuelans to pay for their passports with petro and receive pensions in petro it s a hardly welcomed alternative however lola told me that no one had petros in venezuela when she visited crypto charities and visions of liberation the financial anonymity bitcoin enables makes it attractive or dangerous depending on where you sit it allows users to avoid state surveillance interference and state levies or hefty transactions fees this makes bitcoin an ideal medium for money launderers but also handy for desperate citizens hoping to escape the prying eyes of strongman regimes some migrants fleeing venezuela are transferring their assets into cryptocurrency to easily re access their savings once they are out of the country without hassle at the border in venezuela bitcoin is proving a weapon against authoritarianism according to a writer in time magazine aaron of bitcoin com echoes that his company is aiding the freedom and well being of the country that strikes me as hyperbole given venezuelans are being killed and detained for protesting and journalists are being grabbed and kicked out of the country millions of venezuelans have fled their borders in search of real freedom but if you want modest claims don t look to cryptocurrency startups they will tell you venezuela provides the perfect opportunity to be charitable saviours and increase mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency at the same time airtm a mexico based company that allows users to save and send cryptocurrency launched a fundraiser called airdropvenezuela in partnership with bitcoin com in november they vow to raise us 1 million in cryptocurrency by may this year and distribute it to 100 000 verified venezuelans with airtm accounts airtm s website boasts a quote from simón bolívar a people that loves freedom will in the end be free coinbase a leading cryptocurrency exchange network based in san francisco donated cryptocurrency to venezuelan families in the town of barquisimeto it s given through givecrypto org a software non profit founded by one of the co founders of coinbase brian armstrong in an interview joe waltman the executive director of givecrypto org told me this was one of dozens of crypto giving charity experiments givecrypto org has conducted in venezuela and other countries to test alternative financial aid mechanisms in environments where they deem that money or government is broken on the surface givecrypto org s campaign appears to be an innovative philanthropy initiative funded by wealthy crypto donors with a genuine intention to fulfill the tech startup cliché ambition to make the world a better place boris wertz a vancouver based technology venture capitalist at version one was one of the first donors who gave us 25 000 in crypto assets to the charity version one is also an investor in coinbase wertz said he became involved in the charity as a donor and advisor because it was an interesting experiment to potentially reinvent not for profit work he lauded how the unique giving scheme provides recipients the individual agency to purchase what they want with the cryptocurrency while the crypto blockchain technology is an efficient way to track and use the money the total donation of the givecrypto org campaign is a mere us 9 000 a drop in the bucket for a charity associated with and promoted by a company currently valued at 8 billion critics called the holiday giving campaign opportunistic self promotion by coinbase nicknaming the company scroogebase this is not being cheap this is understanding how to get the money into the hands of the right people responded wertz cryptocurrency right now is a very immature technology he says so what we re trying to do is to run a few experiments to out how we can make that happen and how to use that technology add it all up and venezuela s economic mess has made it a laboratory for how to spread the use of cryptocurrencies globally in a country with extreme poverty coinciding with a high inflation currency wertz said crypto is a natural play where crypto can be very beneficial and it s a good testing ground using these people who are suffering i tried that idea on people hanging out at a vancouver based cryptocurrency club named dctrl pronounced decentral were they cheering on the venezuelan crypto boom we are using these people who are suffering who are in a miserable situation and social upheaval to see how this stuff pans out pablo duboue a computer scientist and expert on cryptocurrency told me with a tone of disgust twenty years ago duboue immigrated to canada from argentina another latin american country with high inflation and soaring cryptocurrency trading volumes in argentina he lived through a war dictatorship hyperinflation and a state debt default not unlike what venezuelans are facing today crypto is not going to solve venezuelans problems said duboue he believes the country s woes are fundamentally due to social problems with social solutions i found myself nodding in agreement yet a growing movement of international development researchers sees humanitarian crises as opportunities to experiment with new systems and technology they call what they do humanitarian innovation esther duflo a renowned development economist and a cofounder and director of the abdul latif jameel poverty action lab at the massachusetts institute of technology popularized field experimentation as an important tool to help alleviate poverty in developing countries duflo and her team travel to countries in trouble to collaborate with local organizations institutions and governments to run experiments that can inform potential policy interventions their studies are designed to comply with ethical principles and are reviewed through rigorous ethics review boards okay but how does this fit with the ethos of cryptocurrency startups who worship disruption the word innovation is typically associated with facebook s once popular mantra of move fast and break things yet the cornerstone of humanitarianism is to do no harm in humanitarian emergencies moving fast and breaking things can increase the risk of harm what to make then of the experiments being run by airtm bitcoin com and givecrypto org while pondering that question i came upon another term ethics dumping it was invented by the european union for when privileged organizations conduct research experiments on vulnerable low income populations in places where they perceive regulations and ethics governance to be more lax than their originating countries to combat ethics dumping experts have drafted a code of conduct that mandates fairness respect care and honesty see sidebar i asked wertz what consideration givecrypto org gave to the ethics of treating venezuela s distress as a test bed for growing cryptocurrency there is nothing these families have to give up in exchange for receiving the cryptocurrency he said it s free money no one is forcing them to take the money no one has to give up anything to take the money against ethics dumping in 2015 the university of oxford convened a summit at the world humanitarian conference to draft a set of principles for ethical humanitarian innovation the draft guidelines reinforce the humanitarian principle of maleficence or do no harm and the innovation ethos of experimentation but in a way that conforms with internationally recognized ethical standards for the latter this means researchers need to follow the declaration of helsinki of 1964 and the nuremberg code of 1947 that arose from the gruesome holocaust experimentation on humans and undergo institutional ethics review board assessments practices probably not top of mind for fast moving tech startups to combat ethics dumping scientific and social research that exploits people in places with low incomes and lax rights protections a coalition of researchers from europe africa and asia named trust created a code of conduct called global code of conduct for research in resource poor settings the code of conduct consists of four values fairness respect care and honesty and accompanying guidelines for each similar to the aforementioned draft principles for ethical humanitarian innovation it recommends that researchers obtain ethics approval in their home countries but further recommends researchers also obtain ethics approval from the host country melody ma i m not sure what the downside is for anyone to participate he said the intention is to try to find the most efficient way to get to people in need using crypto and to learn about that path this is not to make a profit on these people or anything like that aaron of bitcoin com was much less diplomatic and went on the defensive i d be curious to know the intellect of those people making those critiques do they fully understand what they re talking about he scoffed shortly after our phone interview he called back we re not forcing to take bitcoin cash bitcoin cash is voluntary by giving people more options of economic freedom i see no downsides to what we re doing but there is a downside a huge one the legal risks potentially faced by venezuelans who participate in the cryptocurrency experiments in an unpredictable and rapidly changing regulatory environment with a government eager to tighten control over its monetary system at duflo s mit poverty action lab researchers are urged to follow the belmont principles to design ethical social experiments one of the three key principles is beneficence researchers should seek to increase wellbeing and avoid knowingly doing harm harm as defined by the belmont report includes legal harm this isn t about who is making money or not the risk of getting on the wrong side of the authorities for participating in cryptocurrency is real and related law in venezuela is fast changing for a while the venezuelan government targeted cryptocurrency miners for charges that are allegedly unrelated to their mining activities now miners need government issued licenses to operate last august journalist robert marvin of pcmag reported that the venezuelan government sent cease and desist letters to airtm and similar services for posting unofficial exchange rates as part of a crackdown called operation paper hands nine airtm users out of 300 000 were detained by the government for unknown reasons a press release from airtm mentioned the government had also taken legal action against employees and users airtm is currently officially blocked by the venezuelan government they skirted the ban by changing their domain name still airtm and bitcoin com decided to move ahead with an even more ambitious campaign to give cryptocurrency to 100 000 venezuelans who sign up as airtm users disaster capitalism 2 0 after hurricane maria devastated puerto rico in 2017 former child actor turned cryptocurrency entrepreneur brock pierce of the bitcoin foundation moved there so did other crypto preneurs price and his peers say their goal is to rebuild the island into a cryptocurrency paradise called puertopia skeptics say puertopians are there to evade taxes while retaining their american citizenship in the u s territory if so puertopians along with airtm and bitcoin com are practicing a brave new form of disaster capitalism an idea popularized by author naomi klein where businesses and individuals rush in to capitalize on the aftermath of horrific disasters one person s plight is another person s enterprising opportunity aaron of bitcoin com made it clear to me why as he put it the cryptocurrency community is focusing on venezuela the central thesis he said is that if cryptocurrency doesn t work in venezuela it can t work anywhere it s underserved my mind went to the disturbing case of american drone companies who pledging benevolence rushed into africa to test drone deliveries for transporting medical and other supplies they could be said to have practiced ethics dumping they were there to take advantage of lax airspace regulations and perceived vacuum of ethics governance while they perfected their technology for amazon deliveries and surveillance at the same time what about givecrypto org s philanthropic campaign to give cryptocurrency to venezuelan families was it the latest twist to disaster capitalism when i put that to wertz he assured me the non profit is completely separate from the for profit coinbase even though the two shared a founder walton further emphasized that givecrypto org is only using a small part of coinbase s software and is largely focused on building out their own giving delivery software we are being very careful that we re minimizing the chance of what we re doing won t put someone in danger he said we are not aware of any legal risks posed by our service in venezuela when i asked if givecrypto org s campaign had any issues with the venezuelan government walton said candidly at the scale that we re operating at at a few dozen or a hundred people i d be really surprised if the government knows we exist he claimed the venezuelan government has been quite explicit around allowing cryptocurrencies while there s a lot of uncertainty they have been pretty clear that crypto is kosher in april 2018 the national constituent assembly of venezuela did release a legal framework that governs cryptoassets and the petro it declared that cryptocurrencies can be used as legal means of exchange in venezuela the catch is that miners exchanges and any other entities dedicated to savings and virtual intermediation of cryptoassets must register with the government further the government reserved the power to regulate the cryptocurrency market givecrypto org confirmed they have not registered with the government and bitcoin com did not disclose their status when i asked as recently as jan 30 the government swerved again releasing a new decree on crypoasset regulation to establish a national regulatory agency called sunacrip national superintendency of crypto assets and related activities it will oversee crypto mining the promotion and development of digital assets crypto financial services and audits operating issuing mining and even using cryptocurrencies without government authorization can now lead to legal consequences detailed in the decree on feb 8 sunacrip released new cryptocurrency remittance regulations including a government levy and monthly cap in other words crypto is kosher as long as the government regulates or owns it the very opposite of what crypto libertarians mean when they say cryptocurrency is freedom still if venezuelans are participating in cryptocurrency despite the potential risks they face they must find value not so apparent in canada where our currency economy and government are stable next economy bitcoin and new ways to do money read more it is true that in venezuela bitcoin and other decentralized cryptocurrencies are only accessible to those with a certain level of financial means technological know how and appetite for taking legal risks far from being the great economic equalizer or enabler of freedom but if my country s economy were to dive into the abyss as happened to lola s family i might be grateful for any different way to store value one delinked from the financial machinery crashing all around us i would be desperate to survive that makes it all the more crucial that crypto entrepreneurs acknowledge the ethical pitfalls they risk in supplying cryptocurrencies to people in crisis in the name of experimentation and all the more important that we keep a skeptical eye on their claims to be workers of charity and liberation while they push a new economic order that confirms their ideology one that would just happen to make them very rich

chairman and chief executive officer thanks patrick we re proud of our accomplishments in 2018 and looking back to when we went public in 2010 when we finished with 329 million in revenue looking forward we see significant opportunities throughout the world as we ramp up our sales force and deliver on our technology initiatives we expect to succeed we will be at conferences and investor meetings throughout the year and hope to see some of you at those now i ll turn it over to questions questions and answers operator your first question comes from rayna kumar with evercore isi your line is open rayna kumar evercore isi analyst could you pull out the organic revenue growth rate for the alternatives business in the fourth quarter and then your expectations for the first quarter and 2019 as a whole please bill stone chairman and chief executive officer i think that s patrick rahul kanwar president and chief operating officer patrick you want to take that patrick pedonti chief financial officer yes i m not sure the alternatives organic growth rate in the fourth quarter is that the question i really didn t hear it rahul kanwar president and chief operating officer yes and q1 and the guidance patrick pedonti chief financial officer in the fourth quarter the alternatives organic growth was 5 9 fourth quarter 2018 and the guidance in q1 is also 5 9 rayna kumar evercore isi analyst and if you can also talk a little bit about dst s healthcare business the client retention in that business new bookings growth and does ss c see that as is ss c looking at strategic options for the healthcare business bill stone chairman and chief executive officer we are not the business is getting stronger we brought in some great people daniel delmastro as chief revenue officer tory belgoti as the senior vice president of sales so we re optimistic and we look forward to reporting on our successes in the following quarters rayna kumar evercore isi analyst thank you operator your next question comes from alex kramm with ubs your line is open alex kramm ubs analyst hey good evening everyone just staying on the topic of organic growth for a second here if i heard you right at the guidance 1 9 to 4 1 i think 3 is the midpoint i think if i remember correctly at the analyst day you were kind of pointing everyone to maybe like a three and half percent growth rate not to be too focusing on that but like it obviously seems a little bit lower so just maybe discuss a little bit what has changed in the last few months i mean obviously everybody has seen what s going on in the fourth quarter in hedge fund land etc so has your thinking changed a little bit or what s the change here bill stone chairman and chief executive officer yes i don t think there s really a whole big change here alex i think it s just that as we get deeper and deeper into these acquisitions that a lot of that is taking a lot of time and we also are at lumpier kinds of sized businesses or deals here so i think the range we re trying to have is wider just based on the size of the deals that we have and so i just think that is how a few tenths of a percent on organic growth sell out alex kramm ubs analyst ok fair enough and then maybe just on kind of all of these deals that you re integrating right now i heard in some of the prepared remarks you talked about i think even like existing customer buyings or switching to intralinks or using intralinks now i mean are these real cross selling wins already or are these just stuff that everybody was individually working on before and then just on that same topic given that you are restructuring your dst sales team anything that you ve seen already in terms of early fruits of labor that they re doing a better job over there maybe hopeful that the organic growth at dst can improve from what s been a little bit lackluster in the past any sort of color what s happening not just on the cost but more on the revenue opportunity side bill stone chairman and chief executive officer yes you know what as i said right we and rahul commented bernie o connor came in as chief revenue officer of domestic financial services business he s already reorganized that and has people on the ground i think since january 1 i think he s increased our pipeline by 50 million i think daniel delmastro has been all over the country in the healthcare business we see opportunities everywhere as we ve spoken on the last two to three calls we really see an opportunity in the mid market otherwise the mid market has to go to one of their big behemoth competitors so we think that s a tremendous opportunity for us and we plan on exploiting it so we re pretty optimistic about where we sit and we hope to report similar progress in 90 days or so alex kramm ubs analyst thanks very much operator your next question comes from dan perlin with rbc capital markets your line is open dan perlin rbc capital markets analyst thanks guys and good evening i m obviously happy to see the synergies for dst getting raised here i m my question i guess is twofold one is kind of what did you get what led you to be able to kind of crank them up so fast from your original guide like it was it s clearly been significant and secondly to kind of put that bogey out there all the way out to 2021 i m wondering why what it s going to take to get the incremental 55 million or so bill stone chairman and chief executive officer again dan it s a pretty big place right 14 400 employees 1 600 contractors when we took them over 2 2 billion or so in revenue we were we re trying to be somewhat sober and conservative about what we were doing and want to make sure that we weren t stepping on trapdoors right so the more we got our sea legs the more mike sleightholme have made a nice contribution the people at dst whether it s terry metzger in domestic financial services or willie slattery internationally or john geli in retirement or jonathan boehm in healthcare they re smart capable hard working people and i think we kind of released them to go after the opportunities that we have and i think that they ve done a really good job nick wright who s willie s right hand guy and a number of other ones have really participated in ways that have really helped us anthony caiafa our chief technology officer is getting his arms around the big data centers and they had a big spend and they still have a big spend it s just not quite as big dan perlin rbc capital markets analyst understood can i just get you to update just so we re clear you re at four and a half times leverage right now your target i thought was to get down to kind of four by the end of 19 has that changed in any way i mean the pace of deleveraging has been pretty significant patrick pedonti chief financial officer based on our current plan certainly we use all free cash flow to pay down debt in 19 we ll be around 3 9 times so we ll be below four times dan perlin rbc capital markets analyst ok and then just on that same vein can you just remind us your appetite i know you got a lot going on and you ve already done a lot of acquisitions but it is part of your dna to do more deals and so as you get down toward that should we be expecting kind of that to be the leverage that you got to get to before you d step back in and look at other additional opportunities in the market or is there appetite to do so and how does that pipeline look bill stone chairman and chief executive officer yes so i wouldn t say that we re glued on the sidelines we would certainly buy anything that s been in our strategic radar we may not use as much debt as we did in the past and while that s unfortunate that s what happens when you get leverage to the point of four and a half times but we re going to do what s best for our shareholders and that s increase our earnings and hopefully increase our cash flow and we re going to pay down debt quickly as we ve said 926 million since april 16 2018 that s a pretty good number and i think that tuck in acquisitions we re looking at all the time we probably we have four five of them that we re in some semblance of possibly purchasing now larger ones there s a few that are out there that are 100 million in revenue 30 million in ebitda you we re not spending a billion and a half for one of those so we ll have to see what kind of properties are out there and whether or not we can get what we believe is a disciplined price dan perlin rbc capital markets analyst thank you guys operator your next question comes from brad zelnick with credit suisse your line is open kevin ma credit suisse analyst hi it s kevin ma on for brad can you give us any update on progress of intralink and eze so far in terms of synergy targets and i know it s still early into those acquisitions but what sort of cross sell opportunities are you seeing that maybe become more apparent now that weren t so obvious early rahul kanwar president and chief operating officer yes so this is rahul we re really positive about both intralinks and eze and leif o leary at intralinks and jeff shoreman and their teams have done a nice job of starting the integration process we have already implemented some synergies we re certainly on target or on plan for the time lines that we had at the start of the process and as you pointed out the thing that we re most focused on is the joint revenue creation opportunities so in conjunction with eze we ve already sold some deals where as is the order management system and we re doing middle and back office services we expect that to continue we re also looking at our development plans for eze and their new product eclipse and trying to that closer to things that we re building and then intralinks has some of the biggest private equity firms and real asset firms in the world in their customer base and those are many of the same firms that we re providing fund administration services or seek to provide fund administration services to so there s a natural cross sell and overlap and that process is getting started so good progress so far kevin ma credit suisse analyst and i might have missed it but would you mind breaking down what the cost synergies that were achieved in the quarter for each of the acquisitions patrick pedonti chief financial officer so we re these implemented right annual run rate synergies kevin ma credit suisse analyst that s right patrick pedonti chief financial officer so dst was at 245 million and intralinks and eze combined are at about 14 million kevin ma credit suisse analyst thank you operator your next question comes from hugh miller with buckingham your line is open hugh miller buckingham analsyt hi there you guys had mentioned about the dst opportunity in the middle market i was wondering if you could flesh that out a bit more and maybe provide a little color on the current revenue for dst in that segment and kind of how you re viewing the addressable market opportunity for that business bill stone chairman and chief executive officer well the current revenue is approximately 450 million in revenue 450 million to 470 million i think and again it s obviously a national business we have any number of large opportunities in our pipeline we have closed some additional businesses in our pharmacy business and we re optimistic about that and we just think that there s lots of health plans around the country and right now most of the health insurance and health administration pharmacy benefit management businesses are dominated by unitedhealthcare with optum or cvs with aetna or cigna and express scripts so we think we have a great shot if we execute to be no 4 in a short relatively short period of time over the next two to three years and currently we re about no 10 hugh miller buckingham analsyt and then one other follow up just the diluted share count guidance for 2019 was just a bit below where we were looking for is there any assumption for share repurchase in that number patrick pedonti chief financial officer there s no share repurchase in that number hugh miller buckingham analsyt thank you operator your next question comes from peter heckmann with davidson your line is open peter heckmann d a davidson analyst thanks for taking my call just for clarification and i apologize if you ve gone through this patrick i think you had said that organic growth implied in first quarter guidance is 5 9 did you mean that 5 9 is for admin and so what would be the overall organic growth patrick pedonti chief financial officer yes the 5 9 in q1 of 19 was for the alternatives business for q1 19 the midpoint is 3 3 organic growth and the range is 5 to 1 7 on the low end peter heckmann d a davidson analyst great that s helpful and then if i remember correctly dst had some attrition in the u k and that was going to hit this year how are you thinking about that and how are you treating it from an organic growth calculation basis rahul kanwar president and chief operating officer so i think sorry patrick go ahead go ahead patrick pedonti chief financial officer i mean dst becomes organic right in mid april right so not in the first quarter still acquisition revenue and at this point in the calculations that we gave you we re not making any adjustment for business that they might have lost before we acquired them so this is just a straight calculation right now peter heckmann d a davidson analyst got it got it ok and then rahul you did make a comment that black diamond was seeing strong growth can you talk about that advisor space seems like an area that s benefiting from several secular trends haven t really seen as much acquisition activity from ss c in that space in terms of expanding the breadth of solutions how are you thinking about that space right now are valuations prohibited rahul kanwar president and chief operating officer i think that we re really focused on our own growth opportunities we ve looked at some things and i think we ll continue to look at some things and we will look at deals particularly as they re complementary to our solution set but i think in general we ve got a really good business with the combination of core growth in our customer base so the things we do now as well as new products that we re building out such as rebalancer black diamond link and a couple other ones and we have done some small acquisitions we bought salentica and we bought modestspark and that s primarily a way to extend the capability and we ll keep doing that peter heckmann d a davidson analyst that s helpful thank you operator your next question comes from chris shutler with william blair your line is open andrew nicholas william blair analyst hi guys this is actually andrew nicholas on for chris a lot of my questions have been asked but i did have one about the alts business i think you said around 6 or 5 9 organic growth that you expect in the first quarter which is particularly strong at least from my perspective given negative fourth quarter market so just wondering if you could expand a little bit on where you re seeing strength in that business and where you expect that growth to come from whether it be from net new assets new fund launches pricing or something else rahul kanwar president and chief operating officer yes so i think 5 9 is what we did in q4 right and that s i think in the middle of those choppy markets as well so we really do have very good momentum from a sales standpoint right that s the primary source for new revenue where we re competing every day for new mandates and a lot of them are competitive takeaways and as people look at our technology and services capability relative to those of our competitors we ve got some pretty good opportunities so i would say that s the predominant source for kind of growth and that s true in our hedge business it s also very true in our private equity and real assets business real assets in particular has been growing very strong and i think we think we re going to keep continuing that throughout 2019 so that s the basis for the guidance andrew nicholas william blair analyst and then maybe one for patrick looking at the p l it looks like license and maintenance revenue grew about 10 million 11 million in each of the last two quarters looking at it quarter over quarter but the cost of licensing and maintenance revenue actually went down a touch over that same period can you help me understand why that might be the case patrick pedonti chief financial officer there were several onetime license deals in the dst business that helped that growth over the last couple of quarters and i think their cost structure is down as we ve implemented the synergies so i think that s the biggest impact there andrew nicholas william blair analyst ok so primarily relates to dst ok thank you very much operator your next question comes from mayank tandon with needham company your line is open mayank tandon needham and company analyst thank you good evening bill can you talk about any of the regulatory changes globally that might be a tailwind or headwind for you over time i think in the past it s been more of a tailwind but would be curious to see if there s anything out there in the horizon that investors might not be focused on that could be a driver for your business over time bill stone chairman and chief executive officer well i think mayank that we have a really good regulatory and analytics business mike megaw runs that for us and there s a number of things that we re rolling out such as gdpr and some other ones along those lines whether or not the dol rules on rias how that finally gets flushed out is a little hard to tell same with what s going on with the changes in dodd frank but we think on either side right whether or not there s going to be more regulatory which means we re going to sell into that or there s going to be an easier regulatory environment which means there s going to be more start ups and we ll get our fair share of that too mayank tandon needham and company analyst got it and then a couple of housekeeping items what was the aua levels at year end i think i may have missed that if you ve already mentioned it and also for patrick what is the fx headwind you re expecting on revenue for 19 and also is there any expense item that is impacted by fx and how we should account for that rahul kanwar president and chief operating officer so aua at the end of q4 was 1 69 trillion patrick pedonti chief financial officer and on fx there s about we re currently our forecast is currently using average january 2019 fx rate and if you compare those to the 2018 rates so it s about 11 million of negative fx in the year of which majority is in the first six months of the year so it s about 2 million in q1 and when dst comes on as organic in q2 there s about 7 to 8 million of fx since they have a lot of business in british pounds so right now the current estimate is about 2 million 7 million to 8 million in the second 2 million in the third and kind of flat in the fourth that s based on current fx rates mayank tandon needham and company analyst is that offset on the expense side from hedges or should we expect some expense items to be also affected by fx in the same vein patrick pedonti chief financial officer we dst has some legacy hedges on the indian rupee that are going to terminate in march but other than that we don t have any expense hedges so we had i think a 3 5 million benefit in q4 for expenses and based on where rates are today it d probably be pretty similar in q1 and then would taper down mayank tandon needham and company analyst great thank you operator your next question comes from chris donat with sandler o neill your line is open chris donat sandler o neill analyst patrick want to ask one question about the 2019 guidance and putting the first quarter in there with it because with simple math it implies you d pick up about 0 05 a quarter in eps over the course of the year i m just wondering if you expect faster eps growth in the front half of the year back half of the year is there anything notable in terms of expense synergies we should be thinking about just as we make our quarterly estimates for the course of 19 patrick pedonti chief financial officer i mean we do expect growth to be a little stronger in the second half of the year especially in q4 when eze becomes organic and intralinks becomes organic for a partial quarter so we think we ll see a little bit of a jump in q2 in revenue and then see stronger growth in q3 and q4 chris donat sandler o neill analyst ok and on the expense side anything notable in terms of i don t know facility like duplicative facility costs eliminate or anything like that we should just be aware of or nothing big patrick pedonti chief financial officer i don t think anything big i mean we re going to do we re going to transition some of dst s india operations to contractors to in house i mean we ll have some double costs for a while but it probably won t be significant it might be 2 million 4 million or something like that as we transition from contractors to in house operations and we ve got kind of duplication of facilities so there ll be a little bit of that the first quarter is seasonally a higher cost because benefit costs are higher in the first quarter when you ve got payroll related taxes that are much higher until employees hit the cap so you ve got we typically have higher expenses in the first quarter and then we might have 2 million or 4 million of duplicate costs in facilities in india as we transition to in house operations chris donat sandler o neill analyst ok and then bill wanted to ask one question about the dividend and how the board looked at it i m sure most equity holders are happy to have a higher dividend but i m wondering if they had a look at the trade off between the paydown of debt was the board looking at the year end 2019 leverage ratio and saying ok we re below our threshold so we can afford another 0 01 on the quarterly dividend or did that factor into your thought process bill stone chairman and chief executive officer i think chris the whole q2 q3 and q4 i think the outperformance created tremendous amount of confidence in our ability to generate cash flow i think we ve thought we were going to end q4 at 4 7 and we ended 4 54 on a 0 2 of a turn that s a couple of hundred million dollars and i think the increase in our dividend s about 20 million yes we re trying to be good custodians of the shareholders money and try to allocate that money in ways that the vast majority of our shareholders would applaud chris donat sandler o neill analyst ok thanks very much operator your next question comes from andrew schmidt with citi andrew schmidt citi analyst just a clarification when you talk about lumpy deal pipeline is that mostly a comment on dst and then correspondingly if we think about the organic revenue outlook for fy 19 what does the low and high end of the outlook assume for dst performance bill stone chairman and chief executive officer well first on the lumpy side i would say it s both our fund administration businesses and the dst businesses the size of the deals are getting larger the as we expand our capabilities both from a breadth standpoint and a depth standpoint we become an increasingly capable competitor so the size of the deals that we get asked to bid on have become larger and then the size of the deals that we win have become larger so i think that s going to create some lumpiness as we swallow these bigger deals and i would say that s really what i m talking about on the lumpy deals and then maybe patrick you can take the second half of that question patrick pedonti chief financial officer yes let me try to answer that question so i think for the year we ve got about 100 million in a range of revenue ok and in that guidance the range for the acquisitions which is mostly dst a large portion of it acquisition revenue is probably about 25 million so out of the 100 million 25 million is acquisitions does that answer your question andrew schmidt citi analyst it was more around in terms of just the variation between the low end and the high end what s the assumption for dst growth patrick pedonti chief financial officer well i think at the midpoint of the range dst is up 0 5 or so for the year right and there s probably it s probably something like another 1 shift between the ranges andrew schmidt citi analyst ok that s really helpful appreciate the color and then just if you could discuss hedge fund performance in the fourth quarter and then i guess at a high level how revenue retention performed that would be helpful and then just a follow up to that just expectations for hedge fund performance into 19 rahul kanwar president and chief operating officer yes so i ll talk about hedge fund performance look in general right we re not as focused on hedge fund performance as we are on sales execution and how many of our products and services we can cross sell into clients we already have because ultimately that s far more correlated to our revenue so i think we had a mix of different kinds of performance we certainly had choppy markets and funds that didn t fare as well and then we had winners right and we don t really have a assumption for what future performance is going to be when we guide toward 2019 because once again we don t really view that as being extremely material to how we re going to do patrick maybe you can talk about client retention patrick pedonti chief financial officer yes so we on client retention we ended the full year so if you look at client retention in the last 12 months at 95 for the full year andrew schmidt citi analyst ok that s good to hear all right thanks guys appreciate it operator your next question comes from brian essex with morgan stanley your line is open brian essex morgan stanley analyst hi good afternoon thank you for taking the question bill just a quick one maybe for you i think you mentioned some you re ramping up sales force and i guess i d just like to know kind of what have the changes been post dst eze intralinks what kind of how is that ramping and i guess what is your outlook for productivity into 2019 bill stone chairman and chief executive officer well as we ve pointed out in our remarks earlier we ve brought in bernie o connor in the domestic financial services business of dst and we brought in daniel delmastro in the healthcare business and tory belgoti we have some great people in our sales organization already and so we re adding to that group and we are building pipelines and we re pretty excited about what our opportunities are and i will hopefully report to you as we begin to close those opportunities brian essex morgan stanley analyst any meaningful changes say in the oms business versus maybe what you had in terms of better productivity on one side of the house versus the other bill stone chairman and chief executive officer well i mean obviously eze is a big oms provider and we think that they have a brand new product coming out called eclipse that s gotten some pretty good traction as with all of our acquisitions we re in a hurry and i think jeff shoreman and mike hutner are quite aware of that and they re doing a good job as is the our head of europe mr quinlan so we re that s just the way we operate let s see if we can go faster and at the same time pay attention to our customers in a way that maybe improves our opportunities because it improves our references brian essex morgan stanley analyst got it that s helpful and then maybe one quick follow up for patrick i think alternatives organic growth was mentioned in the quarter but overall organic growth maybe just if we could tick that off patrick pedonti chief financial officer in the fourth quarter brian essex morgan stanley analyst right patrick pedonti chief financial officer the 3 3 was overall organic growth in the fourth quarter and 4 3 for the full year of 2018 brian essex morgan stanley analyst super helpful thank you very much operator your next question comes from jackson ader with jp morgan your line is open jackson ader j p morgan analyst thanks for taking my question guys bill first for you i know that it s only been about a year that you ve had dst and we re already to 33 margins but is there anything structurally as you look at that business that may that would keep it from getting to that kind of 40 target you ve always talked about for ss c bill stone chairman and chief executive officer well i don t think i think that the key to our ability to generate our margins is to make sure that the first job is customer satisfaction right so we re the 40 margin really means that we hire talented people we train them very well and generally we can use one person versus a lot of places use two or three people so we also run our foreign operations with foreigners right so in general we don t use hardly any ex pats not that we don t think that they re talented but they re expensive so we just as well not do that we also don t tend to break leases we stay in those places until the leases expire and then we move the people and other people they jam them all together because it s easier to do kumbaya we do remote kumbaya and try to get the people to realize that breaking that lease is going to hit that bonus pool and people are generally pretty agreeable to that jackson ader j p morgan analyst ok and then a follow up question for either rahul or patrick any particular geographical pockets of strength to call out within the alternatives business kind of around that 5 9 growth rahul kanwar president and chief operating officer i think asia pac has been growing pretty fast for us right still a smaller part of the business so that obviously gets mitigated a little but we expect that to continue to be very strong in 19 jackson ader j p morgan analyst ok thank you operator your next question comes from alex kramm with ubs your line is open alex kramm ubs analyst oh hey hello again my follow up was actually asked already but just while i m here real quick any bigger picture comments on kind of like dst s end markets and what you re expecting there i think when we talk to i guess executives there it sounds like there s still an expectation for a lot of spending are you hearing the same thing and then i think in that market we ve also seen a little bit more m a so maybe just talk about how that may impact you i mean invesco oppenheimer for example is an example that i think may actually benefit you i don t know how specifically you can talk about that but any bigger picture thought on that end market and what s happening there bill stone chairman and chief executive officer well as you know that those end markets are they re great end markets right the world s getting wealthier there s a lot of money to manage and of course there s some headwinds of passive to active but it is not that doom s day scenario that some people paint we have a lot of new products and services that come out to those groups of clients of ours and we re getting very close to them about really delivering technology more rapidly our advanced workstation our advanced work distributor which is a workflow product is highly highly functional and we re really building out a whole new generation and in a hurry our walletshare product which was going to be rolled out in the first quarter of 2020 we rolled out in europe we rolled out in the fourth quarter of 18 so as you start to accelerate the technological advances for your clients it s going to help them accelerate their businesses and it s both going to accelerate their businesses on a revenue standpoint but also in their ability to manage their costs alex kramm ubs analyst all right thanks again operator your next question comes from ken hill with rosenblatt securities your line is open ken hill rosenblatt securities analyst good evening i think you might have just touched on this a couple of questions back but with dst but kind of on overall margins you ve seen nice progress here over the past couple of quarters hit 37 how are you thinking about the trajectory throughout the rest of this year as you get 40 and kind of what things would you note maybe on the revenue side or expense side that could push that higher or a little bit lower for you guys bill stone chairman and chief executive officer well i mean i think we have teams of people looking at all kinds of things obviously we have data processing centers that are used by dst the data processing centers are used by intralinks we have data processing centers that are used by eze and obviously we have historic data processing centers so i think anthony caiafa who s our new chief technology officer who s probably been with us 10 months very talented very capable came out of bloomberg and he s doing a great job for us that s a lot of expense and so understanding how to really make that redundant and highly performing and very cost effective are 3 objectives he has and so far he s done a great job and he has a number of very talented people working with him ken hill rosenblatt securities analyst ok that s helpful and i guess just one modeling one from an interest expense question just given all the debt issued and the aggressive paydown you guys have any guidance you can provide for the next couple of quarters as far as interest expense coming up patrick pedonti chief financial officer well we re we ll use all free cash flow to pay down debt typically our first quarter is a little slower because that s when we pay our employee annual bonuses but then it ll pick back up in the second third and fourth quarter we re currently in our plan expecting interest rates to stay fairly stable from where they are today at about 4 75 4 8 those we re at libor plus 2 25 so we re currently assuming that interest rates stay pretty stable for the year and then other than the first quarter first quarter will be the slowest debt paydown quarter and then it will pick up in the next three quarters operator there are no further questions at this time i will now turn the call back over to bill stone bill stone chairman and chief executive officer ok thanks everybody for listening to our call and we look forward to

proud of our accomplishments in 2018 and looking back to when we went public in 2010 when we finished with 329 million in revenue looking forward we see significant opportunities throughout the world as we ramp up our sales force and deliver on our technology initiatives we expect to succeed we will be at conferences and investor meetings throughout the year and hope to see some of you at those now i ll turn it over to questions questions and answers operator your first question comes from rayna kumar with evercore isi your line is open rayna kumar evercore isi analyst could you pull out the organic revenue growth rate for the alternatives business in the fourth quarter and then your expectations for the first quarter and 2019 as a whole please bill stone chairman and chief executive officer i think that s patrick rahul kanwar president and chief operating officer patrick you want to take that patrick pedonti chief financial officer yes i m not sure the alternatives organic growth rate in the fourth quarter is that the question i really didn t hear it rahul kanwar president and chief operating officer yes and q1 and the guidance patrick pedonti chief financial officer in the fourth quarter the alternatives organic growth was 5 9 fourth quarter 2018 and the guidance in q1 is also 5 9 rayna kumar evercore isi analyst and if you can also talk a little bit about dst s healthcare business the client retention in that business new bookings growth and does ss c see that as is ss c looking at strategic options for the healthcare business bill stone chairman and chief executive officer we are not the business is getting stronger we brought in some great people daniel delmastro as chief revenue officer tory belgoti as the senior vice president of sales so we re optimistic and we look forward to reporting on our successes in the following quarters rayna kumar evercore isi analyst thank you operator your next question comes from alex kramm with ubs your line is open alex kramm ubs analyst hey good evening everyone just staying on the topic of organic growth for a second here if i heard you right at the guidance 1 9 to 4 1 i think 3 is the midpoint i think if i remember correctly at the analyst day you were kind of pointing everyone to maybe like a three and half percent growth rate not to be too focusing on that but like it obviously seems a little bit lower so just maybe discuss a little bit what has changed in the last few months i mean obviously everybody has seen what s going on in the fourth quarter in hedge fund land etc so has your thinking changed a little bit or what s the change here bill stone chairman and chief executive officer yes i don t think there s really a whole big change here alex i think it s just that as we get deeper and deeper into these acquisitions that a lot of that is taking a lot of time and we also are at lumpier kinds of sized businesses or deals here so i think the range we re trying to have is wider just based on the size of the deals that we have and so i just think that is how a few tenths of a percent on organic growth sell out alex kramm ubs analyst ok fair enough and then maybe just on kind of all of these deals that you re integrating right now i heard in some of the prepared remarks you talked about i think even like existing customer buyings or switching to intralinks or using intralinks now i mean are these real cross selling wins already or are these just stuff that everybody was individually working on before and then just on that same topic given that you are restructuring your dst sales team anything that you ve seen already in terms of early fruits of labor that they re doing a better job over there maybe hopeful that the organic growth at dst can improve from what s been a little bit lackluster in the past any sort of color what s happening not just on the cost but more on the revenue opportunity side bill stone chairman and chief executive officer yes you know what as i said right we and rahul commented bernie o connor came in as chief revenue officer of domestic financial services business he s already reorganized that and has people on the ground i think since january 1 i think he s increased our pipeline by 50 million i think daniel delmastro has been all over the country in the healthcare business we see opportunities everywhere as we ve spoken on the last two to three calls we really see an opportunity in the mid market otherwise the mid market has to go to one of their big behemoth competitors so we think that s a tremendous opportunity for us and we plan on exploiting it so we re pretty optimistic about where we sit and we hope to report similar progress in 90 days or so alex kramm ubs analyst thanks very much operator your next question comes from dan perlin with rbc capital markets your line is open dan perlin rbc capital markets analyst thanks guys and good evening i m obviously happy to see the synergies for dst getting raised here i m my question i guess is twofold one is kind of what did you get what led you to be able to kind of crank them up so fast from your original guide like it was it s clearly been significant and secondly to kind of put that bogey out there all the way out to 2021 i m wondering why what it s going to take to get the incremental 55 million or so bill stone chairman and chief executive officer again dan it s a pretty big place right 14 400 employees 1 600 contractors when we took them over 2 2 billion or so in revenue we were we re trying to be somewhat sober and conservative about what we were doing and want to make sure that we weren t stepping on trapdoors right so the more we got our sea legs the more mike sleightholme have made a nice contribution the people at dst whether it s terry metzger in domestic financial services or willie slattery internationally or john geli in retirement or jonathan boehm in healthcare they re smart capable hard working people and i think we kind of released them to go after the opportunities that we have and i think that they ve done a really good job nick wright who s willie s right hand guy and a number of other ones have really participated in ways that have really helped us anthony caiafa our chief technology officer is getting his arms around the big data centers and they had a big spend and they still have a big spend it s just not quite as big dan perlin rbc capital markets analyst understood can i just get you to update just so we re clear you re at four and a half times leverage right now your target i thought was to get down to kind of four by the end of 19 has that changed in any way i mean the pace of deleveraging has been pretty significant patrick pedonti chief financial officer based on our current plan certainly we use all free cash flow to pay down debt in 19 we ll be around 3 9 times so we ll be below four times dan perlin rbc capital markets analyst ok and then just on that same vein can you just remind us your appetite i know you got a lot going on and you ve already done a lot of acquisitions but it is part of your dna to do more deals and so as you get down toward that should we be expecting kind of that to be the leverage that you got to get to before you d step back in and look at other additional opportunities in the market or is there appetite to do so and how does that pipeline look bill stone chairman and chief executive officer yes so i wouldn t say that we re glued on the sidelines we would certainly buy anything that s been in our strategic radar we may not use as much debt as we did in the past and while that s unfortunate that s what happens when you get leverage to the point of four and a half times but we re going to do what s best for our shareholders and that s increase our earnings and hopefully increase our cash flow and we re going to pay down debt quickly as we ve said 926 million since april 16 2018 that s a pretty good number and i think that tuck in acquisitions we re looking at all the time we probably we have four five of them that we re in some semblance of possibly purchasing now larger ones there s a few that are out there that are 100 million in revenue 30 million in ebitda you we re not spending a billion and a half for one of those so we ll have to see what kind of properties are out there and whether or not we can get what we believe is a disciplined price dan perlin rbc capital markets analyst thank you guys operator your next question comes from brad zelnick with credit suisse your line is open kevin ma credit suisse analyst hi it s kevin ma on for brad can you give us any update on progress of intralink and eze so far in terms of synergy targets and i know it s still early into those acquisitions but what sort of cross sell opportunities are you seeing that maybe become more apparent now that weren t so obvious early rahul kanwar president and chief operating officer yes so this is rahul we re really positive about both intralinks and eze and leif o leary at intralinks and jeff shoreman and their teams have done a nice job of starting the integration process we have already implemented some synergies we re certainly on target or on plan for the time lines that we had at the start of the process and as you pointed out the thing that we re most focused on is the joint revenue creation opportunities so in conjunction with eze we ve already sold some deals where as is the order management system and we re doing middle and back office services we expect that to continue we re also looking at our development plans for eze and their new product eclipse and trying to that closer to things that we re building and then intralinks has some of the biggest private equity firms and real asset firms in the world in their customer base and those are many of the same firms that we re providing fund administration services or seek to provide fund administration services to so there s a natural cross sell and overlap and that process is getting started so good progress so far kevin ma credit suisse analyst and i might have missed it but would you mind breaking down what the cost synergies that were achieved in the quarter for each of the acquisitions patrick pedonti chief financial officer so we re these implemented right annual run rate synergies kevin ma credit suisse analyst that s right patrick pedonti chief financial officer so dst was at 245 million and intralinks and eze combined are at about 14 million kevin ma credit suisse analyst thank you operator your next question comes from hugh miller with buckingham your line is open hugh miller buckingham analsyt hi there you guys had mentioned about the dst opportunity in the middle market i was wondering if you could flesh that out a bit more and maybe provide a little color on the current revenue for dst in that segment and kind of how you re viewing the addressable market opportunity for that business bill stone chairman and chief executive officer well the current revenue is approximately 450 million in revenue 450 million to 470 million i think and again it s obviously a national business we have any number of large opportunities in our pipeline we have closed some additional businesses in our pharmacy business and we re optimistic about that and we just think that there s lots of health plans around the country and right now most of the health insurance and health administration pharmacy benefit management businesses are dominated by unitedhealthcare with optum or cvs with aetna or cigna and express scripts so we think we have a great shot if we execute to be no 4 in a short relatively short period of time over the next two to three years and currently we re about no 10 hugh miller buckingham analsyt and then one other follow up just the diluted share count guidance for 2019 was just a bit below where we were looking for is there any assumption for share repurchase in that number patrick pedonti chief financial officer there s no share repurchase in that number hugh miller buckingham analsyt thank you operator your next question comes from peter heckmann with davidson your line is open peter heckmann d a davidson analyst thanks for taking my call just for clarification and i apologize if you ve gone through this patrick i think you had said that organic growth implied in first quarter guidance is 5 9 did you mean that 5 9 is for admin and so what would be the overall organic growth patrick pedonti chief financial officer yes the 5 9 in q1 of 19 was for the alternatives business for q1 19 the midpoint is 3 3 organic growth and the range is 5 to 1 7 on the low end peter heckmann d a davidson analyst great that s helpful and then if i remember correctly dst had some attrition in the u k and that was going to hit this year how are you thinking about that and how are you treating it from an organic growth calculation basis rahul kanwar president and chief operating officer so i think sorry patrick go ahead go ahead patrick pedonti chief financial officer i mean dst becomes organic right in mid april right so not in the first quarter still acquisition revenue and at this point in the calculations that we gave you we re not making any adjustment for business that they might have lost before we acquired them so this is just a straight calculation right now peter heckmann d a davidson analyst got it got it ok and then rahul you did make a comment that black diamond was seeing strong growth can you talk about that advisor space seems like an area that s benefiting from several secular trends haven t really seen as much acquisition activity from ss c in that space in terms of expanding the breadth of solutions how are you thinking about that space right now are valuations prohibited rahul kanwar president and chief operating officer i think that we re really focused on our own growth opportunities we ve looked at some things and i think we ll continue to look at some things and we will look at deals particularly as they re complementary to our solution set but i think in general we ve got a really good business with the combination of core growth in our customer base so the things we do now as well as new products that we re building out such as rebalancer black diamond link and a couple other ones and we have done some small acquisitions we bought salentica and we bought modestspark and that s primarily a way to extend the capability and we ll keep doing that peter heckmann d a davidson analyst that s helpful thank you operator your next question comes from chris shutler with william blair your line is open andrew nicholas william blair analyst hi guys this is actually andrew nicholas on for chris a lot of my questions have been asked but i did have one about the alts business i think you said around 6 or 5 9 organic growth that you expect in the first quarter which is particularly strong at least from my perspective given negative fourth quarter market so just wondering if you could expand a little bit on where you re seeing strength in that business and where you expect that growth to come from whether it be from net new assets new fund launches pricing or something else rahul kanwar president and chief operating officer yes so i think 5 9 is what we did in q4 right and that s i think in the middle of those choppy markets as well so we really do have very good momentum from a sales standpoint right that s the primary source for new revenue where we re competing every day for new mandates and a lot of them are competitive takeaways and as people look at our technology and services capability relative to those of our competitors we ve got some pretty good opportunities so i would say that s the predominant source for kind of growth and that s true in our hedge business it s also very true in our private equity and real assets business real assets in particular has been growing very strong and i think we think we re going to keep continuing that throughout 2019 so that s the basis for the guidance andrew nicholas william blair analyst and then maybe one for patrick looking at the p l it looks like license and maintenance revenue grew about 10 million 11 million in each of the last two quarters looking at it quarter over quarter but the cost of licensing and maintenance revenue actually went down a touch over that same period can you help me understand why that might be the case patrick pedonti chief financial officer there were several onetime license deals in the dst business that helped that growth over the last couple of quarters and i think their cost structure is down as we ve implemented the synergies so i think that s the biggest impact there andrew nicholas william blair analyst ok so primarily relates to dst ok thank you very much operator your next question comes from mayank tandon with needham company your line is open mayank tandon needham and company analyst thank you good evening bill can you talk about any of the regulatory changes globally that might be a tailwind or headwind for you over time i think in the past it s been more of a tailwind but would be curious to see if there s anything out there in the horizon that investors might not be focused on that could be a driver for your business over time bill stone chairman and chief executive officer well i think mayank that we have a really good regulatory and analytics business mike megaw runs that for us and there s a number of things that we re rolling out such as gdpr and some other ones along those lines whether or not the dol rules on rias how that finally gets flushed out is a little hard to tell same with what s going on with the changes in dodd frank but we think on either side right whether or not there s going to be more regulatory which means we re going to sell into that or there s going to be an easier regulatory environment which means there s going to be more start ups and we ll get our fair share of that too mayank tandon needham and company analyst got it and then a couple of housekeeping items what was the aua levels at year end i think i may have missed that if you ve already mentioned it and also for patrick what is the fx headwind you re expecting on revenue for 19 and also is there any expense item that is impacted by fx and how we should account for that rahul kanwar president and chief operating officer so aua at the end of q4 was 1 69 trillion patrick pedonti chief financial officer and on fx there s about we re currently our forecast is currently using average january 2019 fx rate and if you compare those to the 2018 rates so it s about 11 million of negative fx in the year of which majority is in the first six months of the year so it s about 2 million in q1 and when dst comes on as organic in q2 there s about 7 to 8 million of fx since they have a lot of business in british pounds so right now the current estimate is about 2 million 7 million to 8 million in the second 2 million in the third and kind of flat in the fourth that s based on current fx rates mayank tandon needham and company analyst is that offset on the expense side from hedges or should we expect some expense items to be also affected by fx in the same vein patrick pedonti chief financial officer we dst has some legacy hedges on the indian rupee that are going to terminate in march but other than that we don t have any expense hedges so we had i think a 3 5 million benefit in q4 for expenses and based on where rates are today it d probably be pretty similar in q1 and then would taper down mayank tandon needham and company analyst great thank you operator your next question comes from chris donat with sandler o neill your line is open chris donat sandler o neill analyst patrick want to ask one question about the 2019 guidance and putting the first quarter in there with it because with simple math it implies you d pick up about 0 05 a quarter in eps over the course of the year i m just wondering if you expect faster eps growth in the front half of the year back half of the year is there anything notable in terms of expense synergies we should be thinking about just as we make our quarterly estimates for the course of 19 patrick pedonti chief financial officer i mean we do expect growth to be a little stronger in the second half of the year especially in q4 when eze becomes organic and intralinks becomes organic for a partial quarter so we think we ll see a little bit of a jump in q2 in revenue and then see stronger growth in q3 and q4 chris donat sandler o neill analyst ok and on the expense side anything notable in terms of i don t know facility like duplicative facility costs eliminate or anything like that we should just be aware of or nothing big patrick pedonti chief financial officer i don t think anything big i mean we re going to do we re going to transition some of dst s india operations to contractors to in house i mean we ll have some double costs for a while but it probably won t be significant it might be 2 million 4 million or something like that as we transition from contractors to in house operations and we ve got kind of duplication of facilities so there ll be a little bit of that the first quarter is seasonally a higher cost because benefit costs are higher in the first quarter when you ve got payroll related taxes that are much higher until employees hit the cap so you ve got we typically have higher expenses in the first quarter and then we might have 2 million or 4 million of duplicate costs in facilities in india as we transition to in house operations chris donat sandler o neill analyst ok and then bill wanted to ask one question about the dividend and how the board looked at it i m sure most equity holders are happy to have a higher dividend but i m wondering if they had a look at the trade off between the paydown of debt was the board looking at the year end 2019 leverage ratio and saying ok we re below our threshold so we can afford another 0 01 on the quarterly dividend or did that factor into your thought process bill stone chairman and chief executive officer i think chris the whole q2 q3 and q4 i think the outperformance created tremendous amount of confidence in our ability to generate cash flow i think we ve thought we were going to end q4 at 4 7 and we ended 4 54 on a 0 2 of a turn that s a couple of hundred million dollars and i think the increase in our dividend s about 20 million yes we re trying to be good custodians of the shareholders money and try to allocate that money in ways that the vast majority of our shareholders would applaud chris donat sandler o neill analyst ok thanks very much operator your next question comes from andrew schmidt with citi andrew schmidt citi analyst just a clarification when you talk about lumpy deal pipeline is that mostly a comment on dst and then correspondingly if we think about the organic revenue outlook for fy 19 what does the low and high end of the outlook assume for dst performance bill stone chairman and chief executive officer well first on the lumpy side i would say it s both our fund administration businesses and the dst businesses the size of the deals are getting larger the as we expand our capabilities both from a breadth standpoint and a depth standpoint we become an increasingly capable competitor so the size of the deals that we get asked to bid on have become larger and then the size of the deals that we win have become larger so i think that s going to create some lumpiness as we swallow these bigger deals and i would say that s really what i m talking about on the lumpy deals and then maybe patrick you can take the second half of that question patrick pedonti chief financial officer yes let me try to answer that question so i think for the year we ve got about 100 million in a range of revenue ok and in that guidance the range for the acquisitions which is mostly dst a large portion of it acquisition revenue is probably about 25 million so out of the 100 million 25 million is acquisitions does that answer your question andrew schmidt citi analyst it was more around in terms of just the variation between the low end and the high end what s the assumption for dst growth patrick pedonti chief financial officer well i think at the midpoint of the range dst is up 0 5 or so for the year right and there s probably it s probably something like another 1 shift between the ranges andrew schmidt citi analyst ok that s really helpful appreciate the color and then just if you could discuss hedge fund performance in the fourth quarter and then i guess at a high level how revenue retention performed that would be helpful and then just a follow up to that just expectations for hedge fund performance into 19 rahul kanwar president and chief operating officer yes so i ll talk about hedge fund performance look in general right we re not as focused on hedge fund performance as we are on sales execution and how many of our products and services we can cross sell into clients we already have because ultimately that s far more correlated to our revenue so i think we had a mix of different kinds of performance we certainly had choppy markets and funds that didn t fare as well and then we had winners right and we don t really have a assumption for what future performance is going to be when we guide toward 2019 because once again we don t really view that as being extremely material to how we re going to do patrick maybe you can talk about client retention patrick pedonti chief financial officer yes so we on client retention we ended the full year so if you look at client retention in the last 12 months at 95 for the full year andrew schmidt citi analyst ok that s good to hear all right thanks guys appreciate it operator your next question comes from brian essex with morgan stanley your line is open brian essex morgan stanley analyst hi good afternoon thank you for taking the question bill just a quick one maybe for you i think you mentioned some you re ramping up sales force and i guess i d just like to know kind of what have the changes been post dst eze intralinks what kind of how is that ramping and i guess what is your outlook for productivity into 2019 bill stone chairman and chief executive officer well as we ve pointed out in our remarks earlier we ve brought in bernie o connor in the domestic financial services business of dst and we brought in daniel delmastro in the healthcare business and tory belgoti we have some great people in our sales organization already and so we re adding to that group and we are building pipelines and we re pretty excited about what our opportunities are and i will hopefully report to you as we begin to close those opportunities brian essex morgan stanley analyst any meaningful changes say in the oms business versus maybe what you had in terms of better productivity on one side of the house versus the other bill stone chairman and chief executive officer well i mean obviously eze is a big oms provider and we think that they have a brand new product coming out called eclipse that s gotten some pretty good traction as with all of our acquisitions we re in a hurry and i think jeff shoreman and mike hutner are quite aware of that and they re doing a good job as is the our head of europe mr quinlan so we re that s just the way we operate let s see if we can go faster and at the same time pay attention to our customers in a way that maybe improves our opportunities because it improves our references brian essex morgan stanley analyst got it that s helpful and then maybe one quick follow up for patrick i think alternatives organic growth was mentioned in the quarter but overall organic growth maybe just if we could tick that off patrick pedonti chief financial officer in the fourth quarter brian essex morgan stanley analyst right patrick pedonti chief financial officer the 3 3 was overall organic growth in the fourth quarter and 4 3 for the full year of 2018 brian essex morgan stanley analyst super helpful thank you very much operator your next question comes from jackson ader with jp morgan your line is open jackson ader j p morgan analyst thanks for taking my question guys bill first for you i know that it s only been about a year that you ve had dst and we re already to 33 margins but is there anything structurally as you look at that business that may that would keep it from getting to that kind of 40 target you ve always talked about for ss c bill stone chairman and chief executive officer well i don t think i think that the key to our ability to generate our margins is to make sure that the first job is customer satisfaction right so we re the 40 margin really means that we hire talented people we train them very well and generally we can use one person versus a lot of places use two or three people so we also run our foreign operations with foreigners right so in general we don t use hardly any ex pats not that we don t think that they re talented but they re expensive so we just as well not do that we also don t tend to break leases we stay in those places until the leases expire and then we move the people and other people they jam them all together because it s easier to do kumbaya we do remote kumbaya and try to get the people to realize that breaking that lease is going to hit that bonus pool and people are generally pretty agreeable to that jackson ader j p morgan analyst ok and then a follow up question for either rahul or patrick any particular geographical pockets of strength to call out within the alternatives business kind of around that 5 9 growth rahul kanwar president and chief operating officer i think asia pac has been growing pretty fast for us right still a smaller part of the business so that obviously gets mitigated a little but we expect that to continue to be very strong in 19 jackson ader j p morgan analyst ok thank you operator your next question comes from alex kramm with ubs your line is open alex kramm ubs analyst oh hey hello again my follow up was actually asked already but just while i m here real quick any bigger picture comments on kind of like dst s end markets and what you re expecting there i think when we talk to i guess executives there it sounds like there s still an expectation for a lot of spending are you hearing the same thing and then i think in that market we ve also seen a little bit more m a so maybe just talk about how that may impact you i mean invesco oppenheimer for example is an example that i think may actually benefit you i don t know how specifically you can talk about that but any bigger picture thought on that end market and what s happening there bill stone chairman and chief executive officer well as you know that those end markets are they re great end markets right the world s getting wealthier there s a lot of money to manage and of course there s some headwinds of passive to active but it is not that doom s day scenario that some people paint we have a lot of new products and services that come out to those groups of clients of ours and we re getting very close to them about really delivering technology more rapidly our advanced workstation our advanced work distributor which is a workflow product is highly highly functional and we re really building out a whole new generation and in a hurry our walletshare product which was going to be rolled out in the first quarter of 2020 we rolled out in europe we rolled out in the fourth quarter of 18 so as you start to accelerate the technological advances for your clients it s going to help them accelerate their businesses and it s both going to accelerate their businesses on a revenue standpoint but also in their ability to manage their costs alex kramm ubs analyst all right thanks again operator your next question comes from ken hill with rosenblatt securities your line is open ken hill rosenblatt securities analyst good evening i think you might have just touched on this a couple of questions back but with dst but kind of on overall margins you ve seen nice progress here over the past couple of quarters hit 37 how are you thinking about the trajectory throughout the rest of this year as you get 40 and kind of what things would you note maybe on the revenue side or expense side that could push that higher or a little bit lower for you guys bill stone chairman and chief executive officer well i mean i think we have teams of people looking at all kinds of things obviously we have data processing centers that are used by dst the data processing centers are used by intralinks we have data processing centers that are used by eze and obviously we have historic data processing centers so i think anthony caiafa who s our new chief technology officer who s probably been with us 10 months very talented very capable came out of bloomberg and he s doing a great job for us that s a lot of expense and so understanding how to really make that redundant and highly performing and very cost effective are 3 objectives he has and so far he s done a great job and he has a number of very talented people working with him ken hill rosenblatt securities analyst ok that s helpful and i guess just one modeling one from an interest expense question just given all the debt issued and the aggressive paydown you guys have any guidance you can provide for the next couple of quarters as far as interest expense coming up patrick pedonti chief financial officer well we re we ll use all free cash flow to pay down debt typically our first quarter is a little slower because that s when we pay our employee annual bonuses but then it ll pick back up in the second third and fourth quarter we re currently in our plan expecting interest rates to stay fairly stable from where they are today at about 4 75 4 8 those we re at libor plus 2 25 so we re currently assuming that interest rates stay pretty stable for the year and then other than the first quarter first quarter will be the slowest debt paydown quarter and then it will pick up in the next three quarters operator there are no further questions at this time i will now turn the call back over to bill stone bill stone chairman and chief executive officer ok thanks everybody for listening to our call and we look forward to talking to you some of you in person and then the rest of you on the call next quarter thanks operator duration 58 minutes call participants justine stone investor relations bill stone chairman and chief executive officer rahul kanwar president and chief operating officer

strategic priorities chris will then provide a detailed review of our financial performance and our outlook for 2019 before we open it up for your questions let me start by saying that our performance is beginning to turn the corner and for the second consecutive quarter we ve made good progress we made a series of organization leadership changes starting in may that have served us well been right for the organization and with strong leadership increasingly in key positions and investable teams in place our progress should accelerate through 2019 some of our leaders are own grown like laurel hurd in writing rich wuerthele in home fragrance tom russo in connected home and david hammer in appliances cookware in some who have come to us from the outside like chris peterson our new cfo and mike donohoe who runs outdoor rec having joined us from kraft heinz where he led the flagship cheese and meat business and russ torres who has driven the cost work over the last couple of years establishing our new supply chain organization while simultaneously leading our baby business through the turbulence of the toys r us bankruptcy and dennis senovich our company s new supply chain transformation leader who has recruited and built a team of professionals who will in partnership with our talented leaders in the division transform our supply chain over the coming years this blend of owned grown and new talent are driving our transformation and they and their teams have exhibited the grade and determination to deliver results through adversity over the last six months they believe in our capacity to transform while simultaneously we igniting our growth and performance and are busy driving that commitment into action advertisement advertisement their work is focused in five core areas first we are turning the business to a consistent pattern of delivery this means setting appropriate milestones and delivering against them and strengthening our operating discipline to make the business more predictable and efficient second they re working hard to optimize our cost structure by delivering on our ongoing savings programs and extracting the retained corporate costs related to the accelerated transformation plan divestitures we ve made good progress on costs over the summer and into the fall with more actions to follow in 2019 third they are focused on increasing cash flow by driving profitable growth in transforming our working capital by reducing complexity across our business system over the next two years we expect to reduce our continuing operations sku count by over 35 this effort coupled with other working capital initiatives should yield significantly improved working capital ratios and free cash flow productivity fourth they are shaping and focusing our portfolio on the most attractive businesses executing the divestitures as described in the accelerated transformation plan and perhaps more importantly they re making sharp choices allocating the most resource to the most attractive businesses deploying more a p and innovation activity to those businesses with the greatest potential for accelerated growth and performance advertisement advertisement and fifth they are repositioning the organization for more consistent and sustained operating performance restructuring division and function designs while simultaneously strengthening and upgrading talent in the fourth quarter we made progress in all five of these areas specifically we delivered sequential improvement in core sales growth in all segments learning development growth strengthened in the fourth quarter driven by writing excellent holiday merchandising of sharpie and elmer s gift sets the launch of glow in the dark line from elmer s and new metallic colors from sharpie coupled with the expansion of slime around the world and good growth on fine writing in the us and asia yielded strong core sales growth baby continue to make progress against year ago competitors that include toys r us delivering innovation and distribution led share growth on graco s swings and high chairs and nuk sippy cups and bottles food appliances results also improved substantially driven by the launch of new a new line of calphalon appliances year two ph support on calphalon space saving cookware distribution driven share gains on rubbermaid takealongs and oster growth in blending in the us and brazil new crock pot innovations in express cooking solidified our number two share position in the express cooking segment however we were late to this segment and face formidable competition more progress is needed here home outdoor living made good progress in the fourth quarter as a result of strong share growth on yankee candle chesapeake and woodwick in the us ftm channels our return to growth on home fragrance in europe excellent innovation driven growth in contigo behind the launch of couture thermal beverage containers and continued strong growth on first alert these gains were offset by the impact of lost distribution on coolers and air beds which we will continue to face into through the second quarter of 2019 and home fragrance was also burdened by yankee candle s mall based retail store footprint which continues to be a drag on growth and margins we intend to exit unprofitable mall based retail stores as their leases expire and expect to end 2019 with just over 400 stores advertisement advertisement beyond our sequential progress on growth we delivered increased normalized gross margins and operating margin percentages versus prior year in the fourth quarter despite higher inflation related to resins and transportation the imposition of tariffs on many of our businesses and the increasingly negative impact of foreign exchange the operating margin increase was delivered in the context of our highest a p investment levels of the year at nearly 5 of revenue pricing and productivity were positive contributors in the quarter with particularly good progress in securing sourced finished goods cost concessions in the face of tariffs and strong value engineering cost reduction impact particularly in packaging materials we also made substantial progress on overheads we were pleased with this outcome but our progress needs to continue as we expect the headwinds we faced in q4 to step in in the first half of 2019 on cash we delivered about 500 million of operating cash flow bringing our second half operating cash flow to nearly 1 1 billion this result was less than what we forecast driven in part by the completion the completion timing of the jostens and pure fishing yields higher cash taxes and transaction related costs as well as lower accounts payable balance we expect to deliver more sustainable performance on payables going forward as we re making very good progress integrating extended payment terms into our sourced finished goods contracts this work began in earnest in late 2017 through our procurement organization with measurable progress in 2018 and more to come over the next two years with respect to portfolio changes in the quarter we completed the divestitures of jostens inc passing back over 1 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends while reducing debt and exiting the year at our targeted leverage ratio of 3 5 times on our fifth priority we ve action the difficult but necessary decision to restructure the organization and those changes contributed to our professional headcount on the continuing businesses being down by about 14 compared to prior year at the end of 2018 there is more work to do particularly in our back office operations were global business services implementation should drive significant cost reduction in the transactional areas of finance it and hr over the next few years chris and his team will lead this work on behalf of the company advertisement advertisement we are laser focused on strengthening the operational performance and financial flexibility of the company while we know we have much more work to do the fourth quarter was another quarter of sequential progress let me pass the call now to chris to walk through a deeper review of our financial results and our outlook for 2019 then i ll return for some closing comments chris christopher peterson chief financial officer thanks mike and good morning everyone i m pleased to have joined newell brands as the company s cfo and look forward to connecting with many of you over the coming weeks advertisement advertisement over the past 2 5 months i ve taken a very aggressive onboarding approach which included meetings with each of the seven continuing divisions in atlanta boca raton and deerfield massachusetts visiting key manufacturing plants in merrillville wichita mogadore and juarez mexico visiting distribution centers in broomfield shelbyville and el paso texas visiting stores for each of the companies our top 10 retail customers investor meetings with the number of both buy and sell side analysts meeting with each member of the company s board of directors and finalizing the 2019 budgeting process with each business unit and corporate function while it s still early days for me i come to quickly appreciate both the complexity of the organization as well as the opportunity for significant shareholder value creation overtime at a high level my initial observations are as follows the continuing business comprises a leading group of brands with strong market share positions and brand equities in their respective categories with the right to win relative to subscale competition a disruptive external business environment in combination with significant organization change within the company have weighed on the underlying performance with the full potential of the company yet to be seen there is an opportunity for operational discipline improvements in areas including sales and operations planning working capital management and it infrastructure to name a few the ultimate goal is to return the company to consistent and sustainable core sales growth accompanied by operating margin expansion and improved cash conversion cycle i m committed to partnering with mike and the team to drive improvements in these areas moving on to financial results net sales from continuing operations in the fourth quarter were down 6 year over year to 2 3 billion driven by headwinds from foreign currency the adoption of the 2018 revenue recognition standard and a decline in core sales for the year net sales came in at 8 6 billion modestly below the company s expectations due to a stronger than anticipated dollar in q4 core sales from continuing operations declined 1 2 year over year in line with the outlook with sequential progress made in each of the company s three segments normalized gross margin increased 170 basis points versus last year to 34 7 as the benefits from the company s productivity efforts pricing actions and the impact of the revenue recognition standard more than offset inflationary pressures including the effect of tariffs normalized operating margin improved 70 basis points versus last year to 11 4 reflecting the improvement in gross margin as well as the benefits of ongoing cost management these benefits were partially offset by increased levels of incentive compensation as well as currency headwinds consistent with the plans to drive consumption a p spending moved up sequentially in q4 both on an absolute basis and as a percent of sales in the second half of 2018 the company delivered normalized operating margin at the midpoint of the guidance range advertisement advertisement net interest expense of 104 million was down from 116 million a year ago as we ended the year with a net debt balance of 6 5 billion as compared to approximately 10 1 billion a year ago in 2018 we made significant progress strengthening the balance sheet by deleveraging the normalized tax rate was negative 30 favorable relative to the year ago rate of 3 7 reflecting discrete tax items normalized net income from discontinued operations was 107 million down from 196 million in the year ago quarter largely due to the loss of contribution from businesses that have been divested throughout the year including waddington rawlings goody pure fishing and jostens we purchased 44 million shares during the fourth quarter the weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was 452 million down 7 6 year over year at the end of the year the company s share count approximated 423 million shares normalized diluted earnings per share were 0 71 versus 0 68 a year ago normalized diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were 0 47 up from 0 28 last year normalized diluted earnings per share from discontinued operations were 0 24 versus 0 40 last year let s now switch gears to segment results net sales for the learning development segment decreased 3 2 versus the prior year to 707 million core sales inflected back into positive territory and grew 1 7 driven by healthy growth in writing which cycled against significant retailer inventory de stocking in the office superstore and distributive trade channels in the year ago period the baby business remained under pressure reflecting continued headwind from the tru bankruptcy net sales for food appliances declined 7 2 year over year to 824 million as core sales contracted 1 7 largely reflecting reduced promotional activity in food partially offset by appliances growth in latin america and the early impact from new appliance innovation in the us revenues for the home outdoor living segment were down 7 2 versus last year to 809 million with core sales falling 3 continued strength in the connected home security business and a return to growth in home fragrance in europe were more than offset by the ongoing headwind from yankee retail stores and distribution losses on coolers and air beds in the us in q4 the business generated operating cash flow of 498 million compared to 990 million a year ago largely due to loss of cash flow from businesses that have already been divested higher cash taxes in transaction related costs as well as the lower accounts payable balance during the fourth quarter we announced and closed on two transactions jostens and pure fishing and applied the proceeds to share buyback as well as deleveraging we successfully completed tender offers for over 2 6 billion of debt and reached the company s targeted leverage ratio of 3 5 times in 2018 during q4 we also returned 1 1 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends with the full year figure at over 1 9 billion before moving on to the outlook for 2019 i wanted to briefly discuss two new practices that we are adopting this year first in order to offer more visibility particularly in light of the moving parts associated with the divestiture program during 2019 we will provide guidance both for the full year as well as the upcoming quarter once we complete the asset sales we will revisit whether to continue quarterly guidance second we are updating the company s normalization practice effect of first quarter 2019 thus far the company has excluded from normalized results the cost of its transformation office consisting of employees fully dedicated to executing the integration of the merger of newell rubbermaid and jarden and other costs associated with the integration and start up of the combined entity such as advisory costs for process transformation and optimization initiatives now that nearly three years have passed since the transaction beginning in 2019 the company will no longer exclude these expenses from its normalized results please note that for ease of comparability our commentary for 2019 will refer to the year over year metrics adjusting the reported normalized 2018 figures for the new methodology in 2018 for the continuing operations these expenses amounted to 96 million or approximately 110 basis points as a percentage of sales the discontinued operations included additional 12 million of such expenses you can find the quarterly split in the press release tables issued today as we look out to 2019 we expect to stabilize and then reignite core business executing on an aggressive cost savings agenda and improving the company s working capital metrics although we generally see healthy macros in the us they are accompanied by continued disruption in the retail landscape headwinds from currency uncertainty stemming from tariffs and related price increases as well as continuation of commodity and transportation inflation we are planning the business prudently for the year to account for these factors this morning we issued an initial outlook for 2019 which calls for net sales of 8 2 billion to 8 4 billion which represents a decline of 3 to 5 underpinned by a low single digit decrease in core sales as well as an approximately 150 basis point headwind from foreign exchange we expect normalized operating margin to expand 20 basis points to 60 basis points year over year versus the adjusted normalized operating margin of 9 1 from 2018 despite higher investment in the business and significant headwinds from inflation currency as well as bonus true up this forecast assumes that the inflationary pressures from tariffs commodity and transportation cost as well as unfavorable foreign exchange amount to approximately 200 million we plan to mitigate this by pricing actions productivity and reduced overhead cost as we optimize the company s cost structure normalized effective tax rate for the continuing operations is anticipated to be in the high single digit range in 2019 normalized diluted earnings per share for the total company are expected to be between 1 50 and 1 65 for the year the earnings per share outlook also reflects an updated timeline from asset sales we ve made considerable progress on the divestiture front throughout 2018 and have completed transactions that have generated over 5 billion of after tax proceeds as we embark upon the final wave of divestitures we have decided to split up the consumer and commercial solutions business and sell the mapa and spontex businesses in a separate transaction from the remainder of consumer and commercial solutions which is largely rubbermaid commercial products along with rubbermaid outdoor closet and garage and quickie as a result of this decision we now expect the divestiture timeline to extend until the end of 2019 and our guidance assumes these two businesses are sold in the second half of the year current plans assume that the remaining transactions which include us playing cards rexair and process solutions are completed by the end of the second quarter we ve also modified assumptions surrounding the total expected proceeds to reflect recent market movements and valuations for commercial assets and other conditions we now expect the combined after tax proceeds from all of the atp divestitures to be approximately 9 billion the earnings per share outlook that we shared reflects the aforementioned timing of asset sales and the expected deployment of the proceeds toward further debt pay down and share repurchases given the expected timing of the transactions we currently anticipate a modest reduction in diluted shares outstanding in 2019 relative to the year end position of 423 million shares in 2018 we currently forecast 300 million to 500 million in cash flow from operations for the total company for 2019 within this outlook we are accounting for a meaningful year over year loss of cash flow from the assets that have been sold or will be sold throughout 2019 approximately 200 million in cash taxes and transaction costs related to divestitures and over 200 million of restructuring and related cash costs one of our key priorities is to make significant progress on working capital by improving the cash conversion cycle turning to q1 2019 it is important to keep in mind that it is a seasonally the smallest quarter of the year both from the top line and profitability perspectives and the business typically uses cash during the quarter company s guidance contemplates the following assumptions for q1 net sales of 1 66 billion to 1 7 billion which represents a decline of 6 to 8 with core sales down 2 to 4 and an approximately 300 basis point drag from foreign exchange recall that toys r us announced the complete liquidation of its stores in the us in late march 2018 which means the company will not fully lap this disruptive event until the second quarter normalized operating margin is expected to improve 10 basis points to 50 basis points relative to the adjusted normalized operating margin of 2 5 from q1 2018 normalized effective tax rate for the continuing operations is anticipated to be around 10 normalized diluted earnings per share for the total company are expected to be within a 0 04 to 0 08 range with share count similar to the year end position we are assuming full quarter contribution from the businesses that have not been sold yet given the reshaping of the portfolio and significant changes in the external environment we have started a category and company strategy update process which we expect to complete later this year as such we believe it is premature for us to provide specific long term financial goals our long term goal remains to drive shareholder value improvement through our return to consistent and sustainable core sales growth operating margin expansion and improved cash conversion cycle as we reshape the portfolio and create a more focused company while 2018 was a challenging year for newell brands we are encouraged and energized by early signs of a turnaround as the organizations continues to execute the accelerated transformation plan i am excited about the opportunity to help mike and the team create a simpler faster and stronger newell brands we expect to make further progress in 2019 through completing the divestiture program deliver delivering sequentially improved core sales and operating margin results versus 2018 while continuing to support the company s brands and innovation in the marketplace and overcoming significant external headwinds strengthening the company s working capital metrics and driving operational discipline across the organization i ll now turn the call back to mike for closing remarks michael b polk president chief executive officer thanks chris we entered 2019 with building confidence but also a pragmatic view of the complexity of executing such a broad transformation agenda in the turbulent environment as chris laid out in his comments our outlook for 2019 contemplates a couple of key challenges the tariff impact on margins in the toys r us impact on our top line on tariffs we priced in taking actions through procurement to mitigate some of the negative margin impacts of tariffs and will complement this with further work on overheads and aggressive complexity reduction on top line we prudently guided core sales growth with the negative consequence of toys r us bankruptcy to our top line in q1 2019 embed in our outlook tru creates an unavoidable 250 basis point headwind for our total company core sales growth in q1 2019 despite these challenges we re confident in our agenda and our vision for the company we have leading brands in large global in growing categories that positively impact hundreds of millions of consumers lives every day where they live learn work and play we ve invested to build advantaged capabilities and innovation design in e commerce to further strengthen these brands we ve funded strategic research and done the product development work to significantly strengthen our innovation bundle and our ideas for growth we ve proven that our brand and innovation led strategy coupled with strong commercial selling capabilities that reach consumers where they shop can yield further market share growth in our home markets we have much more opportunity to release the trapped capacity for investment in our brands and margin development that s tied up in overheads in working capital and we have a massive opportunity to deploy our portfolio outside our home markets and the development of new channels of distribution make the cost of deployment much lower than it s ever been in my time in this industry and we re strengthening our leadership team at newell so that we successfully operationalize this broad agenda and unlock the value creation potential of the company my underlining underlying optimism is grounded in the power of our brands in the green shoots of growth we see in many of our businesses the strength of our innovation funnel and the increasing capacity to spend behind these ideas our leading e commerce footprint relative to our competition and others in the consumer goods space which should mix our growth rates up relative to others our strengthening supply chain capability with their very aggressive cost and cash agenda which should fuel investment while simultaneously driving margin and cash flow improvements and the unwavering determination and desire to win of our people this is a powerful formula for growth and performance while we play for that future our focus today is on doing what we say we re going to do both the third and fourth quarters of 2018 were good examples of this commitment in action we are confident we re on the right path to reigniting growth in driving operating performance with that i ll turn it back to nancy to set up the q a nancy o donnell senior vice president of investor relations and communications thanks mike technical difficulty turn it over to the operator i d like to remind you that we re asking each caller to limit yourself to just one question we re going to try to manage

re ready to take questions questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions and your first question comes from bill chappell with suntrust william chappell suntrust robinson humphrey analyst thanks good morning michael b polk president chief executive officer good morning bill william chappell suntrust robinson humphrey analyst hi just a question around kind of your top line outlook for 19 on the core business i just want to understand what s baked in in terms of pricing in terms of sku rationalization how that impact the outlook and does that carry on for beyond this year and with tariffs and kind of pricing related tariffs you anticipated i m not saying it s going to happen but if there is any rollback of tariff but you have the roll back pricing or there is just still in general what do you expect on price versus volume for this year and what is new rationalization impact on that top line outlook michael b polk president chief executive officer i ll answer part of that question and then chris can build on pricing we are pricing to cover the absolute tariff impact dollar for dollar and we ve had reasonably good success in landing in landing that and so well that will create an issue for us from a margin percentage standpoint from a dollar for dollar standpoint i think we re going to be ok and that pricing is built in to the plan right now we ve got the 10 tariff rate on category three tariffs in place for january through march and we re currently planning to increase again on march 1st our customers are aware of that we ve communicated that if the tariffs get delayed we will push that price increase out in double price we ll price appropriately when the tariff increase occurs if it occurs we ve built into our modeling for top line the volume impact as best we can of what is a substantial amount of pricing that s a bit of uncertainty that we have because the kinds of price increases we are talking about typically go beyond the model tolerances for predictability but we ve done our best job of estimating that on sku rat i d pass this that onto to chris maybe to kind of build on my comments christopher peterson chief financial officer yeah i guess the thing i would add to mike s comments are in the prepared remarks i mentioned that we have 200 million of headwind from fx commodities and tariffs combined and so in addition to the pricing that mike s talking about on tariffs we re also pricing for commodity inflation and transactional fx so when you put the three of those factors together we ve got a fairly significant amount of pricing built into the guidance we re not pricing for margin on top of that so there is a bit of a margin headwind from the pricing baked in but that s included in the guidance if the tariffs did get roll back i think it would be a benefit to us as a company but hard to say how that would flow through because we probably we wouldn t take the pricing for the tariff but the tariff gets rolls back as mike said on sku rationalization we re working very hard from a sales and operations planning standpoint we think there s a big opportunity to unlock cash conversion productivity and the supply chain through this sku rationalization opportunity and we re working very hard to manage the phase in and phase out of that sku rationalization effort and i think that ll be a theme that we ll be talking about for the next 18 months to two years or so michael b polk president chief executive officer thanks bill operator your next question comes from wendy nicholson with citigroup wendy nicholson citigroup analyst hi good morning just following on that exact line of questioning one of the pressures i know that you ve seen on the top line has been choices that you have made to leave some distribution either unprofitable distribution or channels that you didn t thing represented good partners for the future so can you talk about the impact of those choices from a distribution perspective how much distribution forget about toys r us but ongoing other retailers you ve left than retail on the appliance side how much of a headwind is that because i guess just looking at the guidance i totally get the first quarter guidance for core sales but i m a little bit surprised that you re not expecting more of a ramp up in core sales growth in the back half when you lab some of that thanks michael b polk president chief executive officer well let me just give you some of the details on the things that are in the base that we need to lab there is two there is two areas where we ve got lost distribution and that s business that we didn t pursue aggressively through line reviews because of the margin structure in our need to cover inflation and price and price the businesses but there really are a few areas one is in the outdoor category where in coolers and in air beds we chose not to price down those businesses because of the margin consequences they would have been nearly unprofitable gross margin had we chosen to do that so we took the hit on top line we have lap that it those choices in particular have turned out to be good ones as we come into 2019 because the alternatives that our customers chose to pursue haven t worked out for them and so there is likely to be some benefits flowing back to us later in the year but we have the lap those who losses through the second quarter the way the outdoor category works is the seasonal selling will happen in that march april time frame and until we get to that you don t get to the resets of the aisles and so we ve got that that issue to lap into the second quarter on appliances we continue to look at the tail of that business and ask questions about whether these are businesses we should be in at the margins they currently have and we certainly stepped away from some of the lower end opening price point offerings that existed in non strategic product families last year again the timing of that is those choices were q2 we will continue to prune this business there just are portions of that portfolio that don t make sense from either a cash generative standpoint or from a margin perspective and that will be an ongoing headwind that s contemplated in our guidance but the big changes we made last year we lap in the second quarter and we ll have a little bit longer tail that drags on through the back half of the year our goal our long term goal is to drive profitable core sales growth ahead of our markets and build market share and we think we can do that we want to simultaneously increase our margins and also significantly improve the cash flow productivity in the business some of these choices that we ve made on distributions are designed to enable those outcomes and so yes we ve been prudent on our guidance and we think that s the right posture to take and where we will do everything we can to do better than that but for now given the uncertainty regarding tariff pricing impact on volumes we think this is the right posture to take wendy nicholson citigroup analyst got it thank you very much michael b polk president chief executive officer thanks wendy operator your next question comes from steve powers with deutsche bank steve powers deutsche bank analyst good morning everybody welcome aboard chris christopher peterson chief financial officer thank you steve powers deutsche bank analyst so i don t i m not sure how far you can go here on the fly but i guess i m wondering if there s any way for you to break out the anticipated cash flow guidance continued versus discontinued ops maybe allocating the pro forma interest expense you expect to pay down through the divestiture program to the discontinued bucket i mean even some directional commentary will help you because just it s really hard to unpack it all and contemplate the cash earnings power of the remainco business without having that detail so any further transparency there whether today or just going forward would be really helpful thanks christopher peterson chief financial officer yeah let me try to provide a little bit of help in this regard so the operating cash flow guidance that we issued of 300 million to 500 million for the year is the total company operating cash flow within that guidance there s 200 million of costs that are related to divestitures which are basically the tax and deal costs related to the divestitures and there s over 200 million of restructuring costs so those two things are effectively one time ish a nature so if you were to back those out that would give you the operating cash flow to the company excluding those two things of 700 million to 900 million if you look at what s embedded in that guidance we expect operating cash flow from continuing operations in 2019 to be significantly better than operating cash flow from the continuing operations was in 2018 and that s because we see an opportunity for cash conversion improvement when we look at the cash conversion cycle our benchmark versus our competitors our days sales outstanding are relatively high our days of inventory are relatively high and our days payable are relatively low and so we are putting and have put but are putting a aggressive push on each of those areas and we think that there is opportunity to go after each of them we think we can do better at resolving deductions with customers and ensuring that customers comply better with our terms which will drive our days sales outstanding improvement we think on inventory the sku rationalization program that we ve talked about and cutting some of the tail can drive significant improvement in days inventory and on payables we think that we ve got an opportunity to negotiate extended payment terms that are more in line with what the competitive set has been able to do and when you put that together i think we ve got a multi year cash opportunity on working capital so michael b polk president chief executive officer steve the only thing i d build is i think chris brings a real energy to the space and his partnership with russ in the supply chain leadership teams on strengthening our working capital metrics i think it s going to make a huge difference for us going forward so it s i think the disciplines around these three areas of the things that chris will drive into the organization and i m really excited about the possibilities for progress here operator your next question comes from kevin grundy with jefferies kevin grundy jefferies analyst thanks good morning everyone hey good morning mike i hope i can sneak in just two but the first one is just a data point mike what do you think the category growth rate is for the business at this point in time understanding the core business declining we had destocking issues et cetera et cetera but i think that s really important for folks in terms of when you can get back to sort of the normal rhythm here and then but the broader question is really how you d like investors to think about productivity and the cost savings opportunity because mike as you re well aware i mean it was the key reason to own the stock once upon a time with the 500 million synergies going up to 1 billion but given the challenges it s frankly it s been loss and really there s nothing just to count in the stock i would argue for any sort of material upside from it and if i m not mistaken the number now is like 750 million that is like 600 million from synergies and renewal 150 million stranded overhead which is a huge number it s greater than 8 of sales but it also doesn t seem like there s much commitment in terms of getting after it in any sort of flow through for investors that they can rely upon in a meaningful way so after being a bit for both but maybe if you can kind of help us think about that that d be helpful thank you michael b polk president chief executive officer sure kevin i ll start and then i think it would be helpful for you to get to hear chris s perspective on what s going on in this area so just on your first question on category growth as you know we only measure category growth in the us we really don t have a good way to measure it outside the us historically you know these categories have grown in line with the gdp growth but there are things that can happen in a market that create catalytic events that drive either expansion or decline we it s interesting in our numbers in the us in 2018 we see the sort of bifurcated profile where we got some categories with really excellent category growth and that s generally connected to broaden category distribution for flagship brands or it s driven by provocative innovation that drives consumer interest in a product family or segment best example for that on us is if you look at the calphalon appliances launch in the fourth quarter and you look at the category growth in the toaster oven product family you see massive shifts in category growth because of the power of that hero item and we re getting share growth on top of that coupled with that category expansion that sort of the model in this space when you bring news and it s an exciting consumer idea you can create market growth and we see that on home fragrance as we make yankee and woodwick and chesapeake more broadly available we see that when we nail an innovation like we have on the toaster oven platform between what we re doing on oster and what we re doing on calphalon and so the key in most of our businesses is for us to accept because of our leadership position from a brand perspective we have to accept our responsibility to drive market expansion and where we ve done that well with good ideas executed well in the marketplace we can do really interesting things and so i think that s in our hands when we ve had a sort of a bifurcated year where in baby gear you ve got market contraction because of the shifts going on with toys r us bankruptcy and then on the other side you have really vibrant market growth in some categories like home fragrance where there s a lot of activity going on but i think the way to plan the business is to think about our category growth globally weighted for our sales based on gdp growth and that s historically how this is how this has played out as we come through next year and as we continue to work on margin development we ll have more capacity to spend and that shouldn t enhance our category growth dynamics as well on cost i ll pass it to chris to give you his impressions i personally think there s an awful lot of stuff going on here and you see it in the way we ve overcome some of the headwinds on fx and on inflation but chris s fresh eyes in the i think you benefit from his perspective christopher peterson chief financial officer yeah i think the i think the company has a very aggressive focus on productivity in the cost of goods area as well as overhead cost reduction and let me take them sort of each in turn from the productivity in the supply chain we think we ve got opportunities that we re actioning on manufacturing plant consolidation distribution center consolidation we have opportunities to increase forecast accuracy of the sku level which will allow us to plan better and take cost out of the system we ve got opportunities in automation of lines that drive cost savings we ve got opportunities through the sku rationalization work that we ve talked about and i think that embedded in our guidance is a fairly significant help from that already in 2019 it s being masked as mike mentioned by the inflationary pressure of commodities foreign exchange and tariffs but i think as we as those items get behind us i think you ll start to see the gross productivity work come through in a much more meaningful way on overheads the company likewise has a very aggressive plan at cost reduction and right sizing the organization for the size of the company post the atp plan and that really is looking at a lot of different areas we mentioned in the prepared remarks some of the opportunities of the company has on implementing things like gbs rationalizing our it system for example when newell bought jarden the company went from one to i think 43 erp systems we have a plan to get from the 43 erp systems down to three by the middle of next year and so that drives significant opportunity and the three that we re going to that we re going to have our sap across the majority of the business oracle for the home fragrance business and sap retail for marmot because it s a retail oriented business so i think we ll be in a much better place to drive scale synergies through a lot of the activities that we re moving on across the organization michael b polk president chief executive officer and the only thing that i would build is to call your attention to the guidance which if you look at the operating margin guidance that we provided on the continuing operations and reflect on chris comments in the script where he laid out the fact that we have 200 million of headwind connected to tariffs fx and inflation you see us committing through guidance to operating margin progression in that context and so i think that s sort of the lead indicator of progress from my perspective but i think it s an important question kevin and it is really going to be one of the centerpiece of what we have to focus on not just in 19 but in 20 and 21 as we continue to take the retained costs out of the business but more importantly give ourselves room in the p l to invest at higher levels for growth and that i think we re on the right track but i think it s right to continue to challenge us with those types of questions operator your next question comes from bonnie herzog with wells fargo bonnie herzog wells fargo securities analyst thank you good morning michael b polk president chief executive officer hi bonnie bonnie herzog wells fargo securities analyst hi i wanted to ask about divestiture proceeds you extended the timing and the total proceeds now you re expecting to be slightly lower but i guess help me understand if your priorities for debt paydown versus buybacks have changed at all and then just wanted to clarify that your eps guidance does consider both of these and how we should think about maybe the phasing first half versus second half thanks christopher peterson chief financial officer sure so we have updated our guidance on the total proceeds from 10 billion previously to 9 billion is what we re expecting in total to date our after tax proceeds that the company has received has been 5 2 ph through the end of last year and our eps guidance does contemplate the update of the divestiture timing and as i mentioned in my prepared remarks because we re separating out the mapa spontex business from the ccs business we re expecting those two deals to happen in the back half of the year so the guidance reflects that the us playing cards rexair and process solutions business effectively we re expecting to happen by the end of the second quarter and as a result that changes the timing of when the proceeds are coming in versus what the original plan assumed which is why we are guiding the share count to be only modestly lower this year because we re expecting a significant amount of the proceeds from ccs and mapa spontex toward the end of the calendar year so all of that is embedded in the guidance but that s that s the update on where we are on the divestiture program bonnie herzog wells fargo securities analyst and then just quickly to clarify the split between the proceeds is it still 45 55 in terms of debt paydown versus buybacks christopher peterson chief financial officer yeah so on that if you look at what we ve done through 2018 i think we ve used about 30 of the proceeds for share repurchase we re committed to investing in the business and we re committed to returning excess cash to shareholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet i think we re continually looking at the company s capital structure and i think we will make progress on both debt paydown and share repurchase but given the moving parts here it may not be a straight line as what it was previously bonnie herzog wells fargo securities analyst thank you operator your next question comes from lauren lieberman with barclays lauren lieberman barclays capital analyst oh great thank you good morning michael b polk president chief executive officer hi lauren lauren lieberman barclays capital analyst hi so you guys mentioned that you are kind of starting this strategic review process so two questions off of that recognizing it s early days one is to what degree you thinking through geography i feel like when you d acquired jarden part of the conversation was around the geographic opportunities it opened up for some scaling of entry in some markets so to what degree geography still sort of an interesting vector if there is a likelihood of kind of scaling some of that back and then the second piece is just to think about the longer term margin profile of the continuing businesses because i understand there s the big headwind that you ve called out for 2019 on in commodity costs and so on and then lower share count but it also if you like there s implication that there is now a view that the margin structure of the continuing businesses is probably lower than you might have thought previously so if you could just comment on that or maybe my math is kind of often and it s too early to pass judgment on that thanks michael b polk president chief executive officer great question lauren so with respect to the future development of our business there are really three things that we re focused on one is continuing to build out our brand and innovate brand building and innovation agenda for each one of these each one of the product families that has the best potential to contribute to both our growth in our margin development and we are obviously investing to shift our selling capabilities to reach consumers where they shop and then clearly there is a huge market product deployment or category deployment opportunity for some of our categories around the world and so if you think about this the three drivers of growth going forward it s brands and innovation it s leveraging our selling capabilities both in brick and mortar but also increasingly in e commerce as a result of the scale we have there and the capability we ve invested to create and then deploying the portfolio in my comments i mentioned that that s a huge opportunity and that the cost of deployment is coming down as a result of the emergence of new ways to deploy your portfolio and its a function also of consumers ability to get to know brands prior to them arriving onshore and so we are committed to deploying the portions of our portfolio that make the most sense to deploy into the markets where the people in the economic development of the world is going to occur and so we ve begun that process particularly with the focus on writing we will do that with baby over time and there s opportunity in the balance of our portfolio is well to look to look forward and make some of those choices chris referred to the category strategy work that we re doing we call it cat strat activity in the divisions that s a process that we ve launched that will culminate with the board in the summer that will help us make a series of choices that is below the division level that product family level on which categories are most attractive and offer the greatest potential in which categories deserve disproportionate resourcing and so that work is under way it s going to be division led with insight and help from some of our corporate resources but it s essential to road mapping the next thee to five years of the company and it cuts across it s not just a growth oriented discussion it s what kind of supply change you need to be able to support the ambition what kind of capabilities you re going to need to be able to strengthen the potential outcomes that come through some of those choices and so chris rich mathews russ torres the division leaders will really drive that process through the summer and i think it s going to be really exciting for our people to begin to do this kind of thinking and work an important work for us as we define the roadmap forward christopher peterson chief financial officer yeah i guess what i would add lauren just on the numbers is the company reported i think in 2018 an operating margin for the year of 10 2 when you adjust that for the normalization practice change that becomes 9 1 because of the 110 basis point differential in the normalization practice and we re guiding to 20 basis points to 60 basis points up from the 9 1 for 2019 given the work that we re doing on the category strategy work as mike mentioned and how that ladders into the company strategy work we think it s premature for us to issue long term guidance so we are not issuing margin guidance for 2020 or beyond at this point because we think that that work will help us have better visibility into that that being said we see a clear opportunity to take the operating margin on the continuing business higher over time the pace and path of that i think is what will be informed by the strategy update work that we re doing michael b polk president chief executive officer and the two levers for that will be in overheads which are still quite high for the company as a percent of revenue some of that due to the retained costs associated with the disposals and the other being gross margin development which in today s environment is pretty tough although i was pleased with what we saw in q4 and we will work hard next year to overcome the headwinds we ve talked about but if you look backwards lauren at the period between 2011 and 2015 for newell rubbermaid and look at that story you saw really meaningful gross margin improvement in that window through innovation and through smarter deployment of our programming against the businesses with the best potential for growth which tended to be the higher margin businesses you should be looking for us to demonstrate that same dynamic which has been difficult over the last two years to do as a result of the negative mix effect of the writing reset that occurred in 18 and because of the challenges now that the business has with the retained costs associated with the divestitures but our orientation is going to be to drive those very similar sets of outcomes operator your next question comes from olivia tong with bank of america merrill lynch olivia tong bank of america merrill lynch analyst great thanks michael b polk president chief executive officer hi olivia olivia tong bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi good morning one to talk a little bit more about cash flow and first in terms of investors how you re feeling even with the amended 9 billion expected after tax proceeds and i guess if you don t end up seeing offers at what you believe are fair prices what would you consider in terms of other levers to cash especially given that the dividend is well above market first goal still 30 to 35 payout and then just as you think about cash longer term after fiscal 19 where do you think sort of the right level to get that michael b polk president chief executive officer yeah so thanks olivia so i think our focus is on driving shareholder value and so to your question if we don t get a deal value that we believe drive shareholder value for the company we re not going to sell the assets at fire sale prices so we ve done the analysis to look at what the keep value is for the assets and our 9 billion assumes that we get valuations that exceed that keep value valuation is the first point there so that could change if we get offers that are below what we think the value of the enterprises because we re focused on shareholder value creation relative to how we deploy the proceeds for our debt repayment versus share repurchase i think it s the same answer which is we re focused on shareholder value creation we continue to be committed to having a sustainable balance sheet and leverage ratio and returning excess cash to shareholders and we ll make those decisions as we go along through the process here olivia tong bank of america merrill lynch analyst and then just on the dividend michael b polk president chief executive officer we have no plans to change the dividend olivia tong bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it thank you operator your next question comes from nik modi with rbc capital markets michael b polk president chief executive officer hi nik russell miller rbc capital markets analyst hey good morning mike this is russ miller on for nick we just want to ask on writing and specifically now with the staples and essendant deal closed is there any more perspective you can provide on the impact that may have to the writing business thank you michael b polk president chief executive officer we are very pleased with the progress in writing laurel hurd and her team have done a remarkable job russ torres on the sidelines sort of providing some guidance and input to them as they ve come through a very very turbulent period of time as you know that whole landscape reset in the middle of started in the middle of 2017 and through the first half of 2018 under new leadership and new ownership the traditional channels within writing established a new set of inventory targets for themselves which we have worked with them to make progress on achieving and we have a little bit more work to do there in 2019 but the real pain of that transition is behind us and we start to see the kind of opportunity you would hope to see in this business businesses made very good margin progression recovering the step down from 17 and the team is mobilized now on reigniting growth and you start to see some of that occurring over the last two quarters so we re quite optimistic about where the writing business is very proud of the team for fighting through that adversity and delivering very very good 2018 in that context and are excited about the future they ve got some great innovations coming in the back half of 2019 that will serve us well into 20 and we ve got very good momentum on slime now around the world so if you want to create slime in europe you can if you want to do it in australia you can and we re looking at new markets every day for that opportunity so look i love this business i think it s a great business i think it s an important business in terms of the role it plays in social and economic development in the emerging markets and we re very committed to making this business bigger and does and building the equities of these brands around the world russell miller rbc capital markets analyst thank you operator your final question comes from joe altobello with raymond james michael b polk president chief executive officer hi joe joe altobello raymond james associates analyst good morning so welcome chris welcome aboard christopher peterson chief financial officer thank you joe altobello raymond james associates analyst looking forward to working with you i suppose to go back to earlier line of question and i know mike you mentioned that newell earlier was turning the corner but the core sales outlook for 19 obviously doesn t really show that at least on the top line i would think that if i can ask you that question six or even three months ago what your 2019 core sales guys would be it wouldn t be down low singles and i m guessing that delta s probably call four points from where we are today versus where we would have been maybe six months ago how much of the change is macro and how much of the change is the decision you guys have made i know you ve mentioned lapping qrq and the lost distribution in appliances and outdoor but you know knows for a couple of quarters now so i m just trying to figure out what s changed from a macro level and what are you guys doing differently that has caused that outlook to come down thanks michael b polk president chief executive officer yeah we don t have a different view on the macros i mean there is some slowdown in europe and in parts of asia but we don t have a big footprint in those geographies that would cause me to have that factor into our guidance on core sales we ve got the realities of what we described which is toys r us in the first half of the year and we ve got the realities of the distribution issues which will continue to govern the upside we felt coming into this year this was the right way to plan the year it will enable the continued progress on margin development and set the stage for grocery ignition on this business going forward the year will be a little different in terms of its flow q1 obviously steps down from the sequential result improvement in q4 and q3 before it and we ve guided 2 to 4 that is an art to fact of toys r us there s really nothing we can do around overcoming 250 basis points of top line headwind but from that point forward once we lapped the distribution you should see sort of the normal progression you would expect to see in our business we will always ask questions about relative attractiveness of businesses and we re going to give ourselves the room in our guidance to be able to make choices around some of those activities an example of a choice we ve made that impacts top line not really core sales but impacts top line that is the right choice to make it s the choice to exit about 100 stores on yankee out of mall based retail from yankee candle that s those are not attractive stores they lose money as the leases expire there s an efficient way to get out of those businesses that will help us in our margin development going forward and it s the right choice to make irrespective of the consequences of the top line and so we re going to do the right thing our long term goal is to drive profitable core sales growth ahead of our markets to build market share to increase our margins and to significantly improve the cash flow productivity in the business and we have a tremendous opportunity on all of these fronts joe altobello raymond james associates analyst that s helpful thank you guys operator we have reached the end of the time allotted for our question and answer session i will now turn the call back to mr polk for closing remarks michael b polk president chief executive officer well thank you everyone for all

as of january 31 2019 pedro heilbron chief executive officer thank you raul good morning to all and thanks for participating in our fourth quarter earnings call first i want to recognize all of our coworkers for their efforts during the year their ongoing dedication and commitment keep us at the forefront of latin american aviation as expected during the fourth quarter we faced a soft unit revenue environment driven mostly by the continued yield weakness in brazil and argentina furthermore we only saw a small benefit from the softening fuel prices as our effective jet fuel price started to decrease very late in the quarter when compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 we had close to 30 million of additional expenses due to fuel prices alone among the main highlights for the quarter passenger traffic grew almost 5 year over year on a capacity growth of 5 5 this resulted in an 82 8 load factor 0 4 percentage points lower year over year yields came in at 0 118 or 7 7 lower than in the fourth quarter of 2017 unit revenues or rasm decreased 7 7 year over year to 0 102 cents on the cost side our casm excluding the one time non cash fleeting per min charge came in at 0 093 0 5 higher year over year due to higher fuel costs however adjusted ex fuel casm came in at 0 062 or 5 8 lower year over year the resulting operating margin excluding special items came in at 9 on the operational front copa airlines delivered an on time performance of 87 7 and a completion factor of 99 8 again industry leading results now turning to our main highlights for the full year 2018 unit revenues at 0 104 came in close to 1 6 lower year over year driven by a 2 1 decrease in yields partly offset by a 0 2 percentage point increase in load factor adjusted casm ex fuel decreased 4 1 to 0 061 among the lowest very full service airline despite the headwind of a soft unit revenue environment and higher than expected fuel prices we reached an operating margin excluding special license of 12 5 for the year as for our network expansion during 2018 we added five new destinations porto alegre and salvador in brazil bridgetown barbados puerta vallarta mexico and salta in argentina ending the year with 80 destinations in north central south america and the caribbean strengthening our position as the most complete and convenient hub in latin america in terms of fleet during 2018 we returned one leased embraer 190 and we took delivery of six aircraft two boeing 737 800s and four 737 max9 aircraft ending the year with 105 aircraft within production of the 737 max9 we also launched our new business class product green with lie flat seats and other amenities for our longest flights which should help us increase yields in the front cabin in those routes on the operational front we delivered an on time performance of 89 7 for the year and were recently recognized by flightstats for the sixth consecutive year as the most on time airline in latin america and by oag as the most on time airline in the world i d like to take this opportunity to thank our more than 9000 employees for everything they do to be number one and continuously deliver a great travel experience to our customers finally wingo continues to do well both operationally and financially as mentioned in the third quarter earnings call later in 2019 will be swapping their four 737 700s for four 737 800s which will further lower their unit cost and increase profitability we also expect to transfer a fifth 737 800 to the wingo fleet and most likely basin in panama turning now to 2019 were still operating a soft yield environment driven mainly by brazil and argentina so we expect to continue seeing weak unit revenues in the first half of 2019 driven by low yields especially when compared to a very strong first quarter in 2018 the currencies in these countries have been stable recently and at least in the case of brazil the economic prospects are improving as a matter of fact the imf is projecting for brazil gdp growth of 2 5 compared to 1 3 in 2018 there has also been some rationalization of capacity in both markets so we expect the demand environment to improve but probably not sooner than the second half of the year as a matter of fact our recent sales data is showing improvement in yields across the network including positive year over year numbers for the second half of the year also fuel prices are lower than in 2018 so if this continues it should certainly help our results for the year as always josé will provide a detailed update on our 2019 guidance while we re confident that the demand environment will continue to improve we remain very focused on initiatives to make us even more resilient during these downturns we continue driving initiatives to strengthen our top line and are focusing more than ever on maintaining extremely competitive unit cost we continue to make progress in ancillary revenues and loyalty program initiatives including selling seat assignments and expanded second bag fee program the selling of miles and upgrades among others we have also made significant progress in deploying new technology tools which would help us enhance and accelerate these results by the end of the year our current plan includes implementing basic economy fares in the fourth quarter regarding our fleet during january we received one boeing 737 max9 originally scheduled for december 2018 and close the sale of one embraer 190 during the remainder of the year we expect to receive eight 737 max9s and finalize the sale of four embraer 190s to end the year with 109 aircraft more than 10 will be max9 this should help us improve fuel efficiency decrease our overall unit cost and increase our yields on longer haul routes thanks to the dreams business class program finally we recently announced a new destination paramaribo in suriname starting in july by the end of the year copa provides service to 81 destinations in 33 countries in north central south america and the caribbean by far the most complete and efficient network for intra america travel to summarize we expect a challenging revenue environment in the first part of 2019 based mostly on continued yield softness in brazil and argentina we are being proactive in taking steps to moderate our growth to accommodate current market conditions our team continues to deliver world leading operational results we continued delivering efficiencies and savings which have further lowered our unit industry leading unit cost we also continue focusing on revenue opportunity including ancillary initiatives our aim at strengthening our results lastly we re confident as ever in our business model and our financial strength even during a challenging year we continued delivering a great product leading unit cost and double digit margins making us the best positions consistently delivering industry leading results especially as the market conditions in our region continue to normalize now i ll turn it over to josé who will go over our financial results in more detail jose montero chief financial officer thank you pedro good morning everyone and thanks for joining us as always i d like to join pedro in acknowledging our great copa team for all their achievements during a challenging year i will start by going over our full year highlights we delivered a load factor of 83 4 on an 8 capacity growth yields however came under pressure in the second half of the year due to continued weakness in the brazilian real and argentine peso pushing unit values down 1 6 to 0 104 we decreased our ex fuel unit cost by 4 1 to 0 061 cents one of the lowest in the world for a full service carrier however fuel prices increased about 25 year over year offsetting all of our ex fuel casm efficiencies and putting pressure in our operating margin which came in at 12 5 net of special items on the operational front we strengthen our network by adding five new destinations we took delivery of our first 737 max aircraft we continued delivering a world class operating product and were recognized as the most on time airline in the world we ve been closed before so it is gratifying for the entire team to achieve the number one spot reporting net income for the full year 2018 came in at 88 1 million which translates to earnings per share of 2 07 excluding special items mainly the non cash and the non recurring per min charge 188 6 million related to the embraer 190 fleet adjusted net income came in at 276 7 million for an adjusted earnings per share of 6 52 23 5 lower than the adjusted net income of 361 2 million or adjusted earnings per share of 8 25 in 2017 now turning to our fourth quarter results we grew capacity by 5 5 year over year while revenue passenger miles increased 4 9 year over year which resulted in a consolidated load factor of 82 8 an 8 4 percentage point decrease versus q4 2017 use was also weaker coming in 7 7 below last year this year over year decline was mostly driven by the continued weakness in the brazilian real and the argentine peso our q4 2018 rasm came in 0 102 or 7 7 lower than the 0 11 reported for q4 2017 consolidated revenues decreased 2 7 year over year to 656 million on the expense side excluding special items our fourth quarter operating expenses increased 6 year over year on the 5 5 capacity growth which resulted in our cost per available seat mile increasing 5 to 0 093 specifically as a function of higher jet fuel prices for the quarter are effective volume fuel price average 2 38 per gallon an increase of 17 5 versus the 2 03 per gallon that we averaged q4 of 2017 our total fuel expense for the quarter was 36 7 million above q4 2017 of which 29 million are related to the fuel price increase and the rest due to the additional capacity flown during the quarter for the fourth quarter our unit cost excluding fuel ex fuel casm came in 5 8 lower year over year excluding special items coming down from 0 066 in q4 2017 to 0 062 in this quarter this reduction in our unit cost for the fourth quarter came mainly due to lower maintenance expenses related to the return of leased aircraft as well as to the continued focus in the reduction of overhead expenses and lower bearable compensation expenses consolidated operating earnings for the quarter came in 47 lower at 58 9 million resulting in operating margin of 9 7 5 percentage points lower than the 16 4 generated in q4 2017 looking at nonoperating income expense and excluding special items the fourth quarter generated a net nonoperating expense of 10 9 million compared to a 9 8 million loss reported in q4 2017 mainly as a result of a firm currency fluctuation loss of 7 3 million realized in q4 2018 compared to a 5 7 million loss in 2017 in terms of net results the quarter generated a net loss of 156 million or a loss per share of 3 67 compared to earnings per share of 2 39 in q4 2017 excluding special items mainly the 188 6 million non cash and nonrecurring per min charge related to the e190 fleet and an 11 4 million one time foreign currency adjustment that was included as part of our restated 2017 results adjusted net income came in at 44 million or 1 02 per share compared to 2 11 per share in q4 2017 according to the balance sheet we closed the quarter with a very strong financial position assets total 4 1 billion owner s equity totaled 1 8 billion debt plus capitalized leases total 2 1 billion and our adjusted net debt to ebitda ratio came in at a very strong 2x by far the lowest in our peer group keep in mind that starting in 2019 the nature of this calculation will change with the adoption of the leasing standard ifrs 16 we closed the quarter with approximately 1 3 billion in debt more than 60 of which is fixed with a blended rate including fixed and floating rate debt over approximately 3 4 in regard to cash short and long term investment we closed the quarter with close to 860 million the reduction in cash balance during the quarter was driven primarily by the early retirement of a portion of our debt related to the e190 aircraft our cash balance at the end of the quarter represents approximately 32 of the last 12 months revenues in terms of fleet we received three 737 max9 aircraft during the quarter ending the year with a total of 105 aircraft the fifth max9 originally scheduled for december as per our fleet plan was delivered early in january also in january we executed the sale of the first embraer 190 to azores aviation during the rest of 2019 we expect to take delivery of eight additional max9s and finalize the sale of four additional embraer 190s to end the year with a fleet of 109 aircraft 13 737 max9s 68 737 800s 14 737 700s and 14 embraer 190s it is important to note that we have already secured the financing for all the aircraft we will take delivery of during 2019 finally i m pleased to announce that our board of directors has approved a quarterly dividend of 0 65 per share corresponding to our dividend policy of 40 of prior years adjusted net income the first quarterly dividend will be paid on march 15 to all shareholders of record as of february 28 so to summarize the fourth quarter performance was affected by the weakness in some of the currencies in the region as well as the increase in the price of jet fuel however we continue to deliver industry leading unit costs and we continue pursuing our cost savings initiatives our network continues being the most convenient for travel within the americas with world class operational indicators we have one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry and we continue to return value to our shareholders today we are also providing guidance for 2019 based on our operating plan and expectations for air travel demand for the year we re co producing our capacity growth in terms of asms two approximately 2 and given the lower fuel price curve for the year we re increasing our operating margin range to 12 to 14 our 2019 for your guidance is based on the following assumptions load factor of approximately 84 rasm of approximately 0 102 casm ex fuel of approximately 0 062 and a lower effective fuel price per gallon including 0 28 of interplane and expenses of approximately 2 15 thank you and what that will open the call to some questions questions and answers operator ladies and gentlemen if you have a question at this time please press 1 on your telephone keypad if your question has been answered or you wish to remove yourself from the queue please press once again that s 1 for questions 1 our first question from the line of bruno amorim from goldman sachs you may begin bruno amorim goldman sachs analyst yes hi good morning i have a question on your cash position i just like just to check with you if there is any of the countries where the currency has depreciated significantly in 2018 like argentina venezuela or brazil where you have a significant cash position and if this is the case what was the impact market to markets in the cash position and also i have a second question on your capacity growth you have reduced your capacity growth guidance for this year is lively now together with the results have you already made the adjustments that you had to make in the network now that you ve reached this new capacity level or is this something that you re gonna do throughout the year and therefore could have an impact not immediately but throughout the year on your pricing and power thank you very much jose montero chief financial officer hello bruno this is josé here so in terms of cash basically all of our cash is in us dollars so we don t really maintain amounts of cash in our currencies once we perform our sales we repatriate the currencies very quickly so there is very little impact in our cash balance related to that where you see the variation in our fx line mostly its translational aspects related to payables and receivables in the particular countries more than specifically cash transactions related to the currencies and in terms of the capacity we ve already started making some adjustments to the network mostly for the first half of the year related to frequencies and markets in south america we did reduce some of our exposure to some of the deep south markets again mostly driven by frequency into markets that we already serve and so yeah the 2 at least for the first half which is kind of the first part of the year has artie been out there and published bruno amorim goldman sachs analyst thank you so much operator thank you enter next question comes from the line of savi syth from raymond james you may begin savanthi syth raymond james associates analyst hey good morning i was wondering if you could share with us the rasm decline for brazil and argentina in the fourth quarter and can i pick up the in 1q filled out so much stronger at tax levels what s the trend that you re seeing currently assuming nothing changes pedro heilbron chief executive officer yeah hi savi it s pedro so in the fourth quarter in both markets we saw in argentina industry sales were around 40 down year over year and that was mostly yield systems same with brazil with brazil it was around 20 industry sales agency sales down in brazil i mean in that range and that was very similar to what we ve been seeing in the first quarter also and again mostly yield however we have seen in our current sales for future travel we have seen networkwide improvement in yields a gradual improvement in yields and more recently were starting to see actually positive yields year over year but that could have an impact mostly in the second half of 2019 savanthi syth raymond james associates analyst okay and then if i just regarding venezuela have you seen any changes in the demand or supply there and just how your thinking about it given the latest developments pedro heilbron chief executive officer right so as usual it s like a roller coaster ride so since the most recent crisis started we have seen demand suffer quite a bit and in fact we had scheduled additional capacity toward the end of last year beginning of this year and we took out that additional capacity and this month of february to react to the lower demand due to what s going on there savanthi syth raymond james associates analyst okay got it thank you pedro jose montero chief financial officer hey savi one more thing here this is josé here so venezuela just in total in terms of asms represents around 2 of our asms so it s a minor portion of the total capacity that we have savanthi syth raymond james associates analyst i was just wondering if there was opportunity there given that potentially things could improve but it sounds like it s not there yet pedro heilbron chief executive officer yeah not right now yeah hopefully it will improve in the future savanthi syth raymond james associates analyst thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of duane pfennigwerth from evercore isi you may begin duane pfennigwerth evercore isi analyst hey guys thanks i wonder if you could just expand a little bit on what you expect in the first quarter do you expect a similar decline a greater decline or less of the decline into the march quarter and if you could size the easter shift as you see that in the first quarter jose montero chief financial officer hey duane i d say that the first quarter it s going to be a difficult comp because q1 of 2018 was very strong and so we re seeing a gap in a year over year basis in the low double digits kind up the low teens in terms of rasm on a year over year basis so that s how are seeing it having said that as pedro mentioned i think we re starting to see especially i think toward the latter part of the second quarter some better forward yields in the bookings that we re seeing so i think that we re at least optimistic in the sense that perhaps toward the second half of the year we ll start seeing improvement on a year over year basis duane pfennigwerth evercore isi analyst i appreciate that detail and then just for my follow up on the 190 fleet if you had to guess how much longer will you be operating those 19 aircraft and what is the carrying value on the fleet today after the writedown and thanks for taking the questions pedro heilbron chief executive officer right so i ll take the first part this is pedro by the end of the year the embraer fleet will be down to 14 aircraft we re selling five or we have sold five of which we have delivered one and there are four more to be delivered so we should end the year with 14 embraer s we have not made that decision a firm decision yet in terms of how long we re gonna keep the embraer s or if they re going to be replaced by similar hundred seaters or just operate a single boeing fleet of 737s we have not made that decision we re looking closely at the numbers and we will make a decision that is positive to our net results but we re not there yet jose montero chief financial officer yeah and in terms of the carrying book value of the fleet it s basically between the high 80s in terms of millions of dollars so that s kind of how it s left but there s spare parts and spare engines etc as well in there so there s some other components as well in there the figure that i just mentioned is purely aircraft duane pfennigwerth evercore isi analyst okay guys thank you operator and our next question comes from the line of hunter keay from wolfe research you may begin mike gunn wolfe research analyst hi this is actually mike gunn for hunter so on basic economy you said that s going to be coming 4q just a couple thoughts if that s good to be limited to certain geographies if it ll come out all at once if it s good to be all the buckets are just a couple of them any thoughts you d be willing to share thanks pedro heilbron chief executive officer yeah we haven t finalized what exactly it s gonna look like so we know are going to have the right technology and were implementing forward logic technology which should be implemented by the fourth quarter that s going to allow us to implement the basic affairs and that something we re going to do we don t know exactly how it s gonna look but i would expect it to be in most markets for sure and we also expect a kind of very positive impact from being able to upsell promote upselling but also more effectively sell ancillary mike gunn wolfe research analyst great thank you operator in our next question comes from the line of helane becker from cowan you may begin conner cunningham cowen and company analyst hey guys it s actually conner cunningham in for helane is it safe to assume that the capacity adjustments are happening on the off days and if so can you just talk about the unit revenue trends for peak versus off peak thanks jose montero chief financial officer yeah you can make an assumption that we are very aggressive in our capacity management during the low season periods what we ve also done is shifted some of the capacities away from some of the brazilian and argentinian markets and put it to fly in other parts of the network so there s also a little bit of that as well so that s part of the asm shift that s been driven by simply the shift in the shape of the network but also indeed there is a very active management of our capacities during low season periods pedro heilbron chief executive officer and i would add to that that some of our secondary brazilian and argentinian markets five of those markets in both countries have capacity reductions in q1 year over year in the 20 range conner cunningham cowen and company analyst okay and that actually kinda speaks to my follow up if you exclude brazil and argentina how is the rest of the year network performing i mean obviously you re putting more capacity into new markets so is there a unit revenue headwind that you re kinda seeing their overall thanks pedro heilbron chief executive officer so two things or maybe three things so in terms of capacity we are actually slowing growth and that 2 asm growth we are guiding to for 2019 is pretty much across the board i mean we are reinforcing capacity in some markets that are stronger but not by a significant amount so it s pretty much kind of a network thing there are certain other markets that have not obviously a collapse like brazil and argentina they have not been subject to the currency devaluations and economic conditions but that are under more capacity pressure like for example in and out of columbia columbia to north america to south america to the caribbean there has been a lot of capacity growth not by us by others also from north america to central america there has been quite a bit of capacity growth and we re talking from the middle of last year at including this first quarter so those markets are under more competitive pressure and of course yields have suffered conner cunningham cowen and company analyst okay and then just a quick follow up on duane s question about the e190 fleet can you just talk about the earnings drag of operating two separate fleet types and if you do make a decision for that to go away what with the positive impact be thank you jose montero chief financial officer yeah so when we issued notice of the embraer leasing embraer s leaving we were talking about there is a cash positive benefit about at least 10 million per year related to the replacement of those aircraft with 737 capacity so we re very bullish about that and of course there are further opportunities once the fleet is if we decided the fleet goes away we go to a sole fleet yeah there s some complexity costs that will go away as well so yeah those are certainly advantages we will seek to do while operating just 737 fleet conner cunningham cowen and company analyst great thank you operator and our next question comes from a line of mike linenberg from deutsche bank you may begin michael linenberg deutsche bank analyst yeah hey everybody just a couple here i guess josé you just highlighted the cash benefits of removing the 190s and the reduction in complexity are there any markets though that you serve of the 80 markets today where if you get rid of the e190 that the 737 700 is just not suited for that market you know i don t know if it s a now some of these flights that are less than daily jose montero chief financial officer yeah i think that the first thing i have to say is that is that we have not made the decision the final decision yet to exit the fleet so these are things that we are looking at very closely right now and of course in light of what you mentioned of what is the impact of the 190 in certain secondary markets where that is the right size of aircraft so we are very carefully evaluating what the particular impact will be of that and it could be that if we decide you know you have to take into account that if you decide to replace the 737 700 for an e190 you have to look at how demand would act on where the per trip benefit or profitability for a particular flight would improve or not with a 737 so these are very thorough analyses that we perform audit ongoing basis and we haven t finalized a decision so i would have to say that that s something that we re still looking at michael linenberg deutsche bank analyst okay great and then just assort a second strategic type question why the shift from the 737 700 to the 800 for wingo or was the 800 may be the right airplane from day one but you needed max9s to come in to free up enough 800 s to go into that business and sort of a related question you indicated that you re going to base one of the wingo airplanes in panama now is that panama pacifico or are you actually going to put a wingo aircraft at tucuman pedro heilbron chief executive officer right so this is pedro mike michael linenberg deutsche bank analyst hi pedro pedro heilbron chief executive officer yeah the 800 we always knew the 800 was the right aircraft for wingo it has the right seat capacity and more importantly had the right unit cost for an airline like wingo we started with a 700 for two reasons one that it would reduce the risk the downside risk of an alpha start up and it did so the first year we did not have load factors that were so high that the 700 was not enough so it did reduce the risk and reduce losses during the first year and the second reason we started with the 700 because we knew we could switch fleets at any time because we have enough 800s and we have use for our 700s especially now that we ve sold embraer s so the embraer s we are selling we are replacing with the wingo 700s so it s not a big growth in capacity so yes the 800 is the right aircraft for wingo and we re doing it now when we are confident about the load factors in the future demand for wingo in terms of basing an aircraft in panama it s going to be in panama pacifico where wingo has all of its operations and it s actually going to take registering a new airline in panama so i can operate in and out of panama pacifico with its own route rights michael linenberg deutsche bank analyst okay should we assume this that that airplane is going to be used for panama to routes to the south which is mostly wingo i mean i know i think you do fly wingo up to cancún and i believe mexico city or is this something where you re going to be looking more northward with the panama based aircraft pedro heilbron chief executive officer right so we think i won t be able to give you a firm answer but what i can say is it s not an exact answer but there are a few markets that can sustain nonstop point to point service from panama the rest depends on connectivity which is what we do so only a few can sustain that s our opinion so wingo is going to start operating a few of those markets and you know it could be to the north it could be to the south that s totally open where we see opportunity in those markets where nonstop can be sustained then wingo might fly it michael linenberg deutsche bank analyst okay great if i could just squeeze in just one more as it relates to ifrs16 i know most airlines are going to be moving over to that convention in 2019 presumably you will be doing that as well i know for some airlines because of the punitive nature of capitalizing it seven times some carriers have actually seen an improvement in their balance sheet and leverage moving over to the new accounting standard i m not sure josé if you ve done any early work on this what your initial read whether or not you re coming out with a potential benefit from a deleveraging perspective by moving to ifrs16 any thoughts or comments or is it still too early jose montero chief financial officer yeah that s a great question actually ifrs16 is a mandated standard so everybody is good to have to move even regardless if you are under ifrs or under us gaap asset comparable accounting standard as well so all companies are going to have to go into it it s not only airlines by the way yeah for us we are doing still the work preliminarily and having discussions with the auditors there is a lot of debate in the industry related to the application of the standard but in our case case preliminarily we are seeing yes a deleveraging effect on the balance sheet related to the capitalization of the leases michael linenberg deutsche bank analyst that s great to hear thanks josé thanks everyone operator and our next question comes from the line of joseph denardi from stifel you may begin joseph denardi stifel financial analyst yeah hey good morning everybody pedro can you just talk about as it relates to brazil some of the key milestones politically or from a reform standpoint that your kind of keeping an eye on over the next few months kind of gauge whether some of the enthusiasm down there is actually going to yield good positive results longer term pedro heilbron chief executive officer well i think you could probably tell me we are obviously hopeful and we ve seen how the currency has stabilized actually sounds like the middle of last year it has been pretty stable and the economic growth prospects for this year are close to double what it was in 2018 so we think brazil is going to recuperate much faster than maybe some people think we are seeing a little bit of that right now but you know we are cautiously optimistic there is still a lot going on and i don t want to be a brazilian expert but we are cautiously optimistic right now joseph denardi stifel financial analyst okay yeah fair enough and then pedro if you look out three or four years it seems like a significant amount of capacity between the us and south america is good to be controlled by three or so joint ventures and i m just wondering if you talk about how you think you fit into that longer term whether that s good for you or bad for you yeah just kinda what your thoughts it seems like a very significant change occurring years and i m just wondering how you fit into that thank you pedro heilbron chief executive officer so as you know and as we announced in the latter part of last year we joined and we signed a jba a joint business agreement with united and avianca from columbia that has to go for approval the approval process has not yet started but it will start sometime this year and it usually takes upwards to year and a half or so to get approved so we re talking and of 2020 maybe the beginning of 2021 it s hard to predict but we re going to be part of one of three major jbas in latin american and we think that will level the playing field and given our strategic position in panama right in the middle of latin america we think it s going to be net positive for us joseph denardi stifel financial analyst yeah ok pedro i mean if you think about the potential benefits of it do you think it s stability does it improve the returns that you get going to north america does it allow you to grow more in north america you mentioned it kinda levels the playing field maybe you can expound on that just because your returns are kind of better than everybody else s so i m not sure what leveling of the playing field means for you guys pedro heilbron chief executive officer well what i meant by leveling the playing field is not being left out and not having let s say a united who is our major partner even before we both joined star alliance working with someone else and then the other us major carriers working with some of our competitors and having that advantage of working together in the us market and being able to cooperate in expanding your networks and offering more advantages to the passengers so we will probably given the way our network is structured which is basically international hub and spoke full service we would be in a way left out of the benefits of working together and the benefits for the passengers also they would find probably more and more options in the other joint venture agreements or joint business agreements so that s what i mean by leveling the playing field not having to work against a much greater entity so we re gonna be at par but we retain and this only applies to latin america to us not the rest of our networks and we will also retain our cost advantage and other efficiencies including our world leading on time performance so we will still be out of that but network wise and marketing wise we ll be able to have some advantages that we think are going to be positive going forward joseph denardi stifel financial analyst that s helpful thank you operator enter next question comes from the line of josh milberg from morgan stanley you may begin josh milberg morgan stanley analyst good morning everyone thank you for the call just two quick ones from me the first is that you mentioned a shifting capacity away from brazil and argentina and some markets within those countries seeing cuts biggest 20 early in the year if i m not mistaken i was hoping you would just give a little more detail on that and also maybe give an indication on what might be the full your capacity evolution in those two markets because i was just trying to reconcile your point about potential cuts with the other message that the overall growth should be uniform across different markets pedro heilbron chief executive officer yeah so this is pedro i ll start and maybe josé can pitch in so in terms of argentina and brazil most of our asm reductions or capacity reductions have been in secondary markets so like three secondary markets in brazil two in argentina with cuts about 20 asm in the first quarter of this year versus first quarter of the year before and overall in those markets is even adding the other the trunk routes which are doing better capacity is down in brazil it s down in the high single digits in argentina it s flat but i should say that right before the crisis and argentina and currency devaluation we had grown quite a bit opening destinations and adding frequencies so we have pretty much brought back down all of that additional capacity and we will have flat growth this year jose montero chief financial officer and i think that complementing that the growth that we are seeing or that we are shifting away from these south america from the brazil argentina secondary markets and granted these are all frequencies that we fly into these markets the capacity that we re placing is mostly in the northern parts of south america so the fact that these are shorter stationed flights creates a net reduction or a very slight growth in terms of essential flat year over year asms and that s kinda how we project the overall behavior of the asms throughout the year actually for example in the first half of the year for the first quarter we re expecting overall asm growth to be kind of in line with that 2 that we are guiding to for the full year and then q2 might be flattish to slightly down to basically that one point flat range so that s kinda how the year is gonna be overall josh milberg morgan stanley analyst okay that was very clear and my second question relates to the embraer fleet impairment charge it looks like the impairment itself was boosted to around 190 million from the 160 million level and they just wanted to make sure that that was right and also if it is right understand what drove that jose montero chief financial officer yeah josh so the prior figure that we had issued back was a preliminary figure and we were still performing a very detailed analysis around it and everything we had concurrent with that was of aircraft analysis related to the maintenance policy so once we concluded both analyses the impact on the 190 fleet was higher than what we had calculated initially so it was a little bit of kinda win both calculations were performed a little bit more came into e190 impairment versus the adjustment that we had to make as well so that was the reason for it it was mostly a preliminary figure and still under adjustment josh milberg morgan stanley analyst understood thank you operator and our next question comes from the line of dan mc kenzie from buckingham research you may begin daniel mckenzie buckingham research group inc analyst hey thanks guys just going back to the revenue commentary the failure revised outlook for 2019 was a hair weaker than the last outlook and given the trend capacity i would ve expected it to be just a little stronger so his incremental weakness tied to some of the prior q a that you ve already answered or is this something new or is it really just a rounding error jose montero chief financial officer i d say that it s mostly related just dan to this specific performance report 2019 of q1 and yeah workshop changes that we saw but yeah the performance very close into the beginning of 2019 has been a challenging q1 but as we mentioned before at this time we re seeing our bookings in the years that are coming with our bookings especially during the second part of the second quarter improving and even though they won t close the year over year gap for the rasm for q2 definitely for the second half of the year the potential for improvement right now pedro heilbron chief executive officer so basically the sales are coming and right now for future travel are coming at better year over year yields but obviously we have sold a good percent of the second quarter at lower yield but we ve seen that throughout this year we have seen a gradual improvement in yields year over year closing the gap we had at the beginning of the year and we are seeing positive trends for the second half of the year daniel mckenzie buckingham research group inc analyst got it and then with respect to those positive trends in the back of the year that you are seeing is that broad or widespread across all the network or is that simply tied primarily to brazil and argentina pedro heilbron chief executive officer it s overall it s pretty much the whole network there s always going to be ups and downs and positives and not so positives but it s pretty much throughout the network daniel mckenzie buckingham research group inc analyst very good and then if i could just squeeze one last one here with respect to the commentary on lie flat seats and the positive impact to yields that you referenced in the opening remarks i m wondering if you could just help us peel back the onion a little bit there i m just kinda wondering what percent of the flying to the premium seats represent today and what percent with a represent at the end of the year and what percent with a represent once you re fully up and running i m just trying to get at trend rate you know for how this premium revenue would come in pedro heilbron chief executive officer so right now it s very little i think it s 1 or 2 something like that very little it will be 10 by year end and it will grow year after year but it won t be let s say the whole premium network that will happen like in three or four years and even then it s can it be maybe that will be a third of our flying four years down the line so by the end of this year it will be 10 daniel mckenzie buckingham research group inc analyst thanks pedro perfect operator in our next question comes from the lineup victor mizusaki from braseco bbi you may begin victor hi thank you i have two questions about your guidance for 2019 the first one how much are you paying for jet fuel in the first quarter in the second question also about fuel cost how does this compare your guidance i mean for the year you re assuming 2 15 per gallon so i d like to understand how much you are paying today how does this compare with your guidance jose montero chief financial officer yeah i think that that is really close to where we are right now i think it s in line with the full year the 2 15 we re seeing so it s not it might be a little higher than what we had but it s not just significantly higher than what we are guiding for the full year yeah they are telling me i ve just seen here it s basically about a nickel below the full year so if q1 is basically about 2 10 and the full year is about 2 15 but it s not significantly different from what we ve guided to victor mizusaki bradesco bbi analyst okay and i don t know i don t know if you can disclose this but what s the w tariff forecast to support the 2 15 per gallon for the year jose montero chief financial officer yeah so the fuel you re talking about the jet fuel basis that we are using for the 2 15 is about 1 87 of jet fuel per gallon and add to that 0 28 of interplane fees and that creates the 2 15 guidance for fuel victor mizusaki bradesco bbi analyst okay thank you operator thank you and our last question comes from the line of stephen trent from citi you may begin stephen trent citigroup analyst thanks very much guys and i appreciate the time just one or two from me actually the first is a follow up from mike linenberg s question when we think about ifrs16 and we look at your margin guidance for this year versus last year s any indication as to whether the accounting adjustment made a material difference or can we assume that there s basically no margin difference because of the accounting jose montero chief financial officer yeah steve there is a tiny portion of the lease expenses that will come non operating but it is really very tiny so i would assume or i would just say that the guidance for 2019 has that the ifrs16 included in there but it s very very minor on an operating versus non operating basis stephen trent citigroup analyst okay jose i appreciate that and just one other last question can you give us an update as to where we are now with tucuman airport s south wing jose montero chief financial officer okay steve so we have seen some progress over the last several months and we expect the first four gates to be operational in the month of april and we expect the terminal right now it s still under construction and there s still some milestones to be completed but we re talking about something for the latter part of the year q4 of this year for the terminal to be fully operational stephen trent citigroup analyst okay i appreciate that jose thank you raul pascual director of investor relations okay i think that concludes our earnings call thank you all and thank you for being with us and

ubiquity of mobile money whilst growing discomfort with cash queues will see more customers sign up for mobile financial services nyasha chingono tinashe kairiza the reserve bank of zimbabwe rbz shot down an urgent request by commercial banks to raise interest rates and transaction charges at a crisis meeting held in harare last week arguing the move would trigger inflationary pressures the zimbabwe independent can report in the face of rapidly rising costs after bank workers demanded and won a 42 hardship allowance to cushion them from the spiralling cost of living the banking sector approached the central bank for permission to increase fees some banks have backdated allowances to january after the zimbabwe banks and allied workers union zibawu threatened to withdraw labour citing biting economic pressures prompted by concern that the 42 wage increase would eat into banks static earnings the financial institutions called an urgent meeting with the central bank banks income emanates from core lending activities and other non funded sources such as fees and commissions sources close to the developments say the rbz was firm in its stance and shot down the proposal from banks to increase fees and interest rates noting that such a move would result in spiralling inflation currently hovering above 40 although the central bank is yet to give monetary policy direction on interest rates exchange rate and the currency crisis judging by its decision on banks requests interest rates may remain flat central banks tend to tweak interest rates and other monetary policy tools to achieve various economic objectives the rbz in march 2017 capped key interest rates at 18 set mortgages at 12 and lowered charges on electronic transactions a key source of income productive loans attract 12 interest per annum the static interest comes against a background of a rising rate of annual inflation currently officially computed at 42 although leading economist steve hanke says it is way above 230 that had eroded purchasing power bankers fear the failure to tame inflation could threaten the viability of the financial services sector inflation is mostly being fuelled by the weakening of the bond note against the united states dollar that has seen retailers adjusting prices in line with the parallel market rate the central bank created a huge stock of electronic money issued treasury bills and other instruments clocked up massive domestic and foreign debt and ran a current account deficit resulting in the weakening of the bond note in light of rising costs banks felt they could cushion themselves by addressing income lines in the volatile economic environment although bankers association of zimbabwe baz president webster rusere denied that banks had requested an interest rate increase and a hike in charges highly placed sources in the banking sector maintain a request was indeed made the rbz s position is that it was not advisable for banks to hike charges and interest rates the rbz was of the view that inflation would be kept under control the idea was to keep interest rates and charges at current levels although the position is subject to review a senior banker told the independent this week while the proposal was not approved bankers insisted that they would continue to lobby the central bank to increase bank charges the sources added another banker said obviously it will put pressure on the banks interest rates have to go up there is a bit of a squeeze remember banks are holding on to treasury bills which are fixed income instruments so banks have to take losses banks are hoping the rbz will review its position on the interest rates cap and bank charges generally charges and rates are capped yet inflation is going up so it is going to be a challenge for most banks to remain profitable we therefore implore the central government to look into a possible review in the upcoming monetary policy statement the banker said central bank chief john mangudya said he had not received any formal proposal from the banks we have not seen any form of proposal from the banks i would welcome any bank which wrote to us to present that proposal mangudya told the independent yesterday

march 15 now i ll turn the call over to michael arougheti who will start with some quarterly and full year financial and business highlights michael arougheti co founder chief executive officer president great thank you carl good afternoon everyone and happy valentine s day our fourth quarter s results concluded a record year for ares we grew our fee related earnings and realized income in excess of 17 and increased our aum over 20 driven by a record year of fundraising as carl mentioned we ve increased our regular quarterly dividend by 14 to 0 32 per share which annualized represents 1 28 per share based on our positive outlook for continued growth in our core fee related earnings mike mcferran will provide more color on that when he walk us through the financial results a little bit later before i get into the specifics and review the 2018 key highlights i would like to start with just a few comments on the recent market volatility and the implications for our business as you all know the fourth quarter saw significant equity market volatility which bled into parts of the credit markets in our view the technical selling pressure was disconnected from otherwise healthy corporate fundamentals while we are seeing some modest deceleration of earnings growth credit performance in general remains stable default rates remained low and below historical average levels and i remind everybody that oftentimes a slow growth choppy environment can be very good for our investing it extends the duration of credit portfolios without compromising already strong debt service levels and could provide more lender friendly pricing in terms on the pe side it may reduce competition for assets and if we were to see a more significant dislocation this could also create separation between stronger and weaker credit managers and meaningful consolidation opportunities also on the pe side it also enhances rescue financing and distressed for control opportunities so while the markets have recovered most of their december losses the q4 environment was a great reminder to everyone that markets can be fragile and that many geopolitical and global macro risks still remain our strong inflows and performance against the volatile q4 backdrop is evidence of the stability and strength of our business model we invest with a flexible relative value approach and since we have locked up capital we have a long time frame for value creation and are never forced sellers our clients trust us to invest aggressively during periods of dislocation and to exit investments as appropriate during more constructive times so unlike many traditional asset managers that experienced severe outflows in q4 we saw a near record inflows to our firm illustrating this dynamic and that leaves us well positioned for opportunities that future volatility may bring in q4 we had gross inflows of 10 4 billion in new capital bringing the full year to a record of over 36 billion all this fundraising was organic and does not include assets acquired or any material amounts raised through partnerships or joint ventures our growing client base continues to reward our consistent performance even in volatile markets by giving us more capital and over the past several years we ve been fortunate to experience strong fundraising in each of our business lines from ever larger subsequent vintages and well established commingled fund families like ace and acof and our real estate private equity funds through launching new commingled funds as we demonstrated with pcs sdl energy ops and real estate debt by growing our managed account business across our credit strategies by securing certain strategic partnerships such as the insurance company jv we talked about on last quarter s call and strategic mandates with large institutional investors and importantly the ongoing efforts outside of our institutional fundraising channel in places like arcc and our growing clo franchise this fundraising momentum also demonstrates the valuable partnerships that we continue to build with our lps the expanding reach of our marketing infrastructure and our ability to offer a growing array of innovative and attractive investment strategies across the platform over the past several years we ve added significant resources across our marketing strategy product development and ir teams and extended our coverage across the globe today we have approximately 95 professionals across these groups compared to 64 just three years ago and we re really starting to see the benefits of these investments over the past 12 months we added 139 new direct fund investors to the platform and 57 of all money raised came from investors outside of north america illustrating our increasingly global footprint we believe that we re just scratching the surface growing in all major investor categories particularly with global pension funds insurance companies sovereign wealth funds and private banks our total number of direct investors has now increased to over 900 up more than 15 over the past year and five fold since 2011 and our existing investors continue to reup with us in new funds or across the platform at an impressive rate during 2018 the 131 existing lps who invested directly with us invested 2 7 times more capital than our new investors this reinforces the industry trend of lps placing more of their capital with fewer managers and we believe that it demonstrates the growing desire to invest more with ares so maybe now turning to more specifics on the fourth quarter and full year results we had first closings in two first time commingled funds over 750 million in our energy opportunities private equity strategy and 600 million in our real estate debt core plus strategy we also held multiple final fund closings including our first time senior direct lending fund or sdl at 3 billion of equity which we expect will grow to over 5 billion of aum with leverage and in our 9th us real estate value add fund with over 1 billion of capital commitments in our market leading european direct lending business we added over 2 billion in new capital across new and existing strategic accounts and we added over 1 4 billion to ace iv s total capital bringing total equity and debt in that strategy and fund to over 9 billion as we ve discussed on prior calls another exciting growth area for us is in our asset backed and structured credit strategies we renamed the strategy alternative credit to better reflect the breadth of the strategies that we offer across a wide spectrum of non traditional corporate consumer and real estate credit assets we believe that our alternative credit strategy has an addressable market of over 3 trillion in assets across the globe as discussed over the past year we ve added and we ll continue to add significant talent to our team and have enhanced our capabilities across a wide range of assets and during q4 alone we added 1 4 billion in new alternative credit funds bringing full year fundraising to 2 6 billion of gross commitments these record levels of fundraising drove aum growth of 23 for full year 2018 positioning us to meaningfully grow fee related earnings and realized income in the years ahead and our fundraising momentum is continuing as we expect another above average year in 2019 with several larger flagship funds either launching this year and into 2020 i think most importantly we continue to perform well for our fund investors our direct lending strategies generated exceptional relative returns in both the us and europe as evidenced by arcc s strong earnings results and stable credit reported earlier this week including a 12 net return for 2018 in europe our third european direct lending fund ace iii had gross returns in excess of 16 for 2018 our real estate funds had yet another strong year with our major us and european private equity funds generating gross returns between 16 and 20 for 2018 and from a private equity standpoint while still down for q4 our corporate private equity fund composite outperformed the public equity markets for the quarter down 5 7 versus the s p 500 which was down 13 5 i remind everybody that our three year gross appreciation for our corporate pe composite remains in the high teens and our longer term aggregate gross irr since inception remained well over 20 from an investing and deployment standpoint we had an active year as we scaled our teams and broadened our investing reach across various market segments and strategies total drawdown deployment was over 17 billion in 2018 up from nearly 13 billion in 2017 with growth across all three investment groups given the market environment the key theme for us in 2018 was quality we continue to focus on franchise businesses with top management teams where we could add value over time and protect our downside risk in direct lending we largely stayed senior secured and defensively positioned industries with a strong emphasis on backing incumbent borrowers and larger more durable companies about 90 of our 2018 transactions and direct lending included financial covenants and more than half of those new commitments were to incumbent borrowers in that business we closed only 4 of the transactions we reviewed with significant overweighting to non cyclical and recession resistant industries in pe given the challenging environment for regular way private equity we invested our flexible capital selectively in high quality platform companies with compelling growth dynamics and an attractive energy investments where we were seeing interesting relative value and lastly in real estate we took advantage of favorable demand demographics and local supply demand trends to invest across multi family and industrial logistics properties in strong growth markets and finally before i turn it over to mike i think as everyone knows in 2018 we made an important change to our corporate structure as we converted to a c corp for tax purposes in march and for legal governance purposes in november these changes were designed to increase the liquidity in and broaden the universe of potential buyers of our stock and while still early we ve already seen the benefits of these actions between march and year end our public float increased from approximately 10 to about 30 our average daily trading volumes increased more than fourfold and our institutional ownership has tripled in addition we are also included in several well known stock industries for the first time which facilitated nearly 6 million shares purchased by index funds late last year we would also expect to be added to at least another large index later this year and while our stock price was not immune to the year end market pressures we do believe that as a c corp we re now better positioned to capture value for our stockholders over the long term and with that i ll turn the call over to mike mcferran who will walk through the q4 results in detail and describe our expected growth michael mcferran executive vice president chief financial officer chief operating officer thanks mike i ll start with the review of our fourth quarter and full year results and conclude with a discussion on our dividends and capital management activities as mike stated ares is benefiting from the strongest fundraising year in its history as existing investors provide us additional capital to manage and as new investors are attracted to our leading strategies and expanding platform we had gross inflows of more than 36 billion for the year which drove acceleration in our aum growth to 23 year over year this growth sets us up very nicely for aum conversion of fee related earnings as we invest our capital not yet earning fees our aum reached 130 7 billion on the heels of another strong quarter of fundraising our fee paying aum increased 13 year over year driven by deployment as a meaningful amount of our aum converts to fee paying aum once it is invested management fees and fee related earnings both increased 16 from the fourth quarter of 2017 were up 12 and 18 respectively for the full year compared to the same period in 2017 looking forward our corporate objective is to continue to grow our aum and fee related earnings annually in the low to high teens consistent with our historical rates our fourth quarter realized income of 123 9 million up 66 was a record which helped drive full year of realized income to 395 4 million up 21 compared to 2017 levels in addition to the growth in our underlying fee related earnings the strength in the fourth quarter realized income included 15 1 million from succeeding and earning the capital gains fee this year at arcc also known as part ii fees along with several real estate private equity fund monetizations our fourth quarter after tax realized income per common share of 0 41 increased 78 year over year and on a full year basis was 1 42 per share a 31 increase over 2017 levels our steady stable growth in our fee related earnings continues to account for about two thirds of our realized income and provides a solid and growing foundation for realized income growth our realized net performance income and realized net investment income collectively have averaged about 117 million annually over the past five years and we believe the aggregate amount will continue to track higher over time as our underlying incentive generating aum increases our business provides visibility on future management fee growth through the embedded management fees we expect to generate from capital already raised but not yet deployed also known as our shadow aum we ended the fourth quarter with record amounts of dry powder and shadow aum and our shadow aum is more diverse and more global at any point in our history our available capital totaled 38 1 billion up 52 from prior year and our shadow aum increased 94 from prior year to 28 2 billion of this 28 2 billion approximately 24 8 billion is available for future deployment with corresponding annual management fees totaling 245 5 million or approximately 29 of our last 12 months management fees based on the underlying strategies we would expect deployment horizons ranging from 18 months to 36 months please note that the 245 5 million in incremental management fees does not include the impact of any potential arcc part i fees we expect to earn in the future any additional management fees we would expect to earn if arcc is above its 0 75 times debt to equity ratio or the expiration of the 10 million per quarter arcc part 1 fee waiver at the end of the third quarter of 2019 assuming arcc s leverage reaches the midpoint of its previously announced new target debt to equity range beginning in the second quarter of 2019 we estimate that our future management and part i fees from arcc could provide an additional 50 million of incremental fees on an annualized basis above the amount included in the 245 5 million i already referenced therefore while there can be no assurance the 245 5 million the 50 million of incremental fees and the 40 million in annual part 1 fee waivers totals approximately 336 million of potential future annual management fees or 40 of our last 12 months management fees incentive eligible aum also reached a record high in the fourth quarter of 78 4 billion up 26 1 year over year of that amount 31 6 billion is not yet invested and available for future deployment which is more than 83 of our fourth quarter incentive generating total which implies material potential upsize to our realized performance income in future years our incentive generating aum of 38 billion which is comprised of 73 in credit strategies and 18 in private equity strategies increased 67 year over year of the amount of incentive eligible aum that is currently invested over 81 is generating performance fees as mike stated based on the market volatility we witnessed in the fourth quarter it s good to remind everyone about the nature of our revenues and aum our management fees continue to represent more than 80 of our total fees and are derived from locked up long dated capital including permanent vehicles approximately 90 of our fourth quarter management fees were generated from permanent capital or funds with closed end structures we derive only about 5 of our management fees from liquid credit funds based on market values since many of you asked about our clo exposure in december we thought we will provide you some updated statistics as a reminder a clo is simply a type of highly diversified institutional loan fund that holds primarily senior secured syndicated bank loans managed by asset managers like ares or many of our peers we derive about 7 of our management fee from clos and we only have approximately 75 million of recourse exposure in clo tranches on our balance sheet clos have been tested throughout the past two decades the multiple credit cycles and the result has been cumulative loss rates near zero our experience to clo investing in down credit cycles has also been strong for example our 2004 to 2007 clo vintages which we managed through the great financial crisis generated a weighted average annual distribution to the equity of 19 7 finally turning to our dividend we declared a new quarterly dividend of 0 32 per common share for our first quarter which represents an increase of 14 over our dividend levels in 2018 as a reminder in early 2018 we moved to a level qualifying quarterly dividend as we said that we would reassess the dividend annually at the beginning of each year our new dividend is pegged to the expected trajectory of our after tax fee related earnings we expect to retain the excess realized income above our dividends to either reinvest our management fee business for potential stock repurchases or for any cash required in acquisitions or other strategic ventures on the topic of share repurchases this morning we announced a new 150 million stock repurchase program the primary objective of this program is to have the flexibility to use our free cash flow to manage our share count from the vesting of employee equity awards mike will now close with his thoughts and our future outlook michael arougheti co founder chief executive officer president great thanks mike reflecting on 2018 and looking ahead to 2019 i couldn t be more excited and i don t think that we ve ever been better positioned we operate a balance sheet light business model with modest net debt relative to our core earnings and our business is growing at a double digit pace we expect this growth to continue as we invest in new products people and operating infrastructure to support our expansion as mike talked about we believe our future is bright as the levers of future growth already exist in our shadow and incentive eligible aum and current fundraising pipeline our clients continue to give us a greater share of their capital and with our expanding product suite we just had our best fundraising year in our history with new growth initiatives and adjacent strategies launched in every business group we re poised to continue our growth and expansion in the years ahead we have world class investment capital raising and business ops teams and a cycle tested investment approach and the shines through and our excellent investment performance we re starting the year with over 38 billion of dry powder to invest which puts us in a great position as evidenced by our strong growth in management fees and aum during the financial crisis volatile markets have always been good to ares and provide us the chance to really showcase the power of our platform in past cycles we ve been able to differentiate our investment performance make accretive strategic acquisitions and grow faster than our peers and i m confident that the next dislocation whenever it comes we ll also provide strong opportunities for ares our fund investors and our shareholders so in closing i want to thank the entire ares team for all of the hard work and effort in delivering incredible results in 2018 and to our shareholders as always we appreciate your time and support for our company and operator we d like to now open up the line for questions questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions and our first questioner today will be ken worthington with jp morgan please go ahead ken worthington jpmorgan analyst hi good afternoon and thank you for taking my questions and so first one 2018 was obviously a tremendous year for capital raising you gave some high level comments in the prepared remarks i was hoping you could share more the outlook for capital raising in 19 maybe by the asset class so kind of thoughts on credit thoughts on private equity and real estate and you mentioned in the prepared remarks the flagships and flagship funds in pipeline for 2019 maybe just help us understand how big the prior vintages were in terms of aum michael arougheti co founder chief executive officer president sure ken it s mike i ll try to answer that somewhat succinctly i think look 2018 was an incredible year but i d highlight if you go back our historical average over the last couple of years it s been about 17 billion and so while the 36 billion stands out these numbers have been increasing sequentially and to your point as we talked about in the prepared remarks we ve gotten into a rhythm now where the growth is coming not only from sequentially larger flagship funds but it s coming from our ability to launch new strategies alongside those flagship fund families open up new geographies open up new distribution channels like private banks and non traded retail developing strategic partnerships so our whole approach to fundraising as we talked about has gotten more global more systematic and we re now able given the track record of investment performance here able to launch new strategies more quickly and get them scaled we won t give you a projection into 2019 but as i mentioned i think our 2019 gross fundraising should be at or above the historical averages and again that s going to come from a combination of flagship funds and new strategies on the private equity side we are in the market with a special opportunities fund that is a first time fund in a strategy that we ve been executing on since the inception of the firm our expectation is that can be a multi billion dollar product in 2019 and a significant growth area going forward as i mentioned we have launched an energy opportunity strategy again as a quote unquote first time fund but sitting alongside our core energy capabilities within private equity and as we sit here today our acof v fund is in and around 40 deployed and so within the next maybe even more within the next 12 to 18 months i think those teams will begin to think about what acof vi could look like with regard to credit the fundraising tends to be much more broad based we re obviously coming off of a significant fundraising year in credit i think the story in credit for 2019 will be much more about continued deployment than large flagship fundraises but you should expect to see us growing in each of our credit categories with an emphasis on the alternative credit strategies i referenced in the prepared remarks and then in real estate as i mentioned we are in the market with our fifth european flagship fund the prior fund size there was about eur1 billion we would expect this fund to exceed that and we will likely be back in the market based on the exceptional performance we ve had in our us opportunistic equity strategies and that prior fund was about 800 million operator and our next questioner today will be robert lee with kbw please go ahead pell bermingham kbw analyst yes this is actually pell bermingham on for robert lee i just kind of volunteered as to unset the fre margin which has remained relatively flat over the past few quarters i was wondering if you guys had any guidance on when we can expect an acceleration in that fre margin michael mcferran executive vice president chief financial officer chief operating officer as we said we ve targeted 30 this year it s what we ve delivered we find 30 staff ph is sustainable on the call we highlighted the amount of management fees tied to capital has been raised but will be recognized as we invest that capital so i think over the coming years as management fees grow the deployment of capital is raised and where a lot of the expense is tied to raise and manage that capital already embedded in our numbers you will see progressive expansion i think the important thing is i wouldn t necessarily view this as a quarter to quarter exercise but view it over a longer time horizon i think we ve mentioned on past calls that we think in the years ahead we would expect our margin to expand past 30 into the low and then eventually in the mid 30s michael arougheti co founder chief executive officer president i think one other comment which echoes some things we ve talked about on prior calls ares is a growth company we ve been delivering growth between 15 and 20 for 15 years and while we are focused on driving economies of scale as we grow folks should appreciate that there are a number of meaningful investments in the p l that allow us to continue to sustain that type of growth into the future and i think we committed on past calls and i think over the course of this year we ll try to give folks better transparency into what those investments look like and the impact on the margin but we really want people to understand if you want to grow at 15 to 20 for 15 years you have to reinvest in growth and people and infrastructure which is what we continue to do so so when you see our margins going up 500 basis points over the last 3 5 years that s inclusive of all of the growth investments that we ve made pell bermingham kbw analyst great thank you for taking my question operator and our next questioner today will be gerry o hara with jefferies please go ahead gerald o hara jefferies analyst thanks and good morning maybe a question on the backlog and pipeline metrics that were provided in the supplemental slide appreciate the additional disclosure but perhaps you can maybe help us think a little bit about how we should model this kind of going forward in terms of realizations or flow through into realized income and perhaps kind of mark to market swings that these metrics might be might be susceptible to thank you michael mcferran executive vice president chief financial officer chief operating officer why don t we inaudible if the make sure we understand the question gerry if the question is how should you be thinking about monetizations in realized and unrealized maybe we ll let mike walk through the unrealized component a good place to look historically is we ve averaged about 120 million annually since our ipo below the fre line if you will and incentive income and investment income as mike mentioned in the prepared remarks the pool of incentive eligible aum continues to scale quite aggressively as we raise more capital so those historical averages while big numbers should scale with the aum base but it s probably worthwhile dissecting the unrealized just to get a sense for how that plays with the realized income piece michael arougheti co founder chief executive officer president yeah and i think mike hit on it probably speaking about the realized as the incentive eligible aum grows or that notional amount expands you expect over the longer term realized income would have the opportunity to expand with that the unrealized piece just stepping back for a second if you recall we led the industry away from viewing eni as a key metric during the course of this year i think all of our peers have now dropped eni and the reason we did that was we felt unrealized gains and losses was an appropriate reflection of value creation and portfolios and that s most apparent when you remember we ve said this in our prepared remarks that we managed these assets in either permanent or a long dated closed end fund vehicles where we control the timing of exits so when prices go up or prices go down doesn t mean we would manage we would actually monetize at those prices so i think looking at the unrealized to us was a distraction for the public and i think our industry has agreed and followed suit when you look then going specific to unrealized you have to remember that when you think about unrealized gains or losses that number reflects the actual change that happened during the period so if your assets went up 1 one quarter and the next quarter you monetize those that gain and book a realized gain of 1 in that same quarter you ll show an unrealized loss of 1 all else being equal so i think that s when you think about the unrealized function you have to remember it s not necessarily asset declines or gains it s also netted against the activity of realizations that answer your question gerald o hara jefferies analyst it does that s helpful color appreciate it michael arougheti co founder chief executive officer president and the other thing we talked about too is if you look at where we are in fund life we have talked on prior calls in our private equity franchise acof iii and acof iv are seasoned and you ve been seeing us monetize as appropriate there you saw a meaningful pickup in monetization activity within some of our older vintage real estate funds which drove some of the exceptional performance in q4 so we are in a healthy harvesting cycle across the platform and i think you ll continue to see us focused on that throughout 2019 operator and our next questioner today will be michael carrier with bank of america merrill lynch please go ahead mike needham bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi thank you this is mike needham in for mike carrier just two quick items first on the fee rate it was higher again in the fourth quarter is there anything particular driving that higher and the second item on acof v can you just touch on how that funds doing pretty significant fund hoping we could get an update thank you michael arougheti co founder chief executive officer president so i ll start with the fee rate and david kaplan can give you an update on acof v on the fee rate it has ticked up in most that s really a function of you think about the capital raising it s mostly around real estate private equity and illiquid credit strategies that have fee rates higher than some of what we call the lower fee rates assigned to our liquid credit business which was more probably in the historical 50 bp range and most of the capital we raised today is north of a point so as we re deploying that capital and raising it you re actually seeing our average fee rate tick up a little bit david you want to give some color on acof v david kaplan co head of private equity group sure so just to remind folks it s a 7 85 billion fund it is a february 2017 vintage which is when the fee clock started working or was turned on mike mentioned that we re 40 plus invested committed we re actually very very happy with that pace of deployment in what is a tightly priced private equity environment the composition of the portfolio is a very good mix reflective of our flexible capital approach inclusive of more distressed rescue opportunities as well as straight plain vanilla buyouts of more growth oriented company so we feel very good about where the funds are today mike needham bank of america merrill lynch analyst thank you operator and our next questioner today will be alex blostein with goldman sachs please go ahead alex blostein goldman sachs analyst hey thanks guys for taking the question i was hoping to dig into a couple of fundraising trends that you highlighted particularly in the us direct lending and european direct lending side of things if you kind of look at the year to date numbers are very strong and those are the areas obviously that it sounds like you might continue to see some growth so i was wondering if you could spend a minute on where the momentum is coming from still and maybe talk a little bit about kind of the nature of that capital so duration any sort of lock ups does that have a similar kind of longer duration characteristics as we know the rest of your credit business has michael arougheti co founder chief executive officer president so as we ve talked about before the demand for private credit strategies broadly defined whether it s corporate direct lending privately originated asset backed privately originated commercial real estate the investor appetite is coming for a couple of reasons it was initially spread because of the low interest rate environment and frustration with the yields and coupled with volatile global equity markets which forced folks to rethink how they would generate excess return what we ve seen over the last 10 years is while that may have catalyzed the growth the growth is now being sustained because of the nominal relative value and relative performance within the private credit asset classes so when people find their way to private credit and they re allocating away from private equity or traditional fixed income they re basically looking to de risk try to move up the capital structure position into floating rate loans as a hedge against rising interest rate environment and candidly shortened duration because weighted average most private credit asset classes are going to have an average life somewhere between two years and four years once folks have now tried the product and seen how the asset class performs when you look at how it s been performing against liquid alternatives we would expect the demand to continue so just to put that in perspective as i mentioned in fiscal 2018 our european direct lending business delivered 16 2 gross rates of return across that composite if you look at our us direct lending business as we talked about arcc but it s true across the platform 12 plus type rates of return and when you compare that against the liquid leverage finance benchmarks whether it s the credit suisse leveraged loan index which was scrapped by with a 1 annual return or that baml high yield index which was down 2 for the year people are beginning to see the durability of the return opportunity in private credit it s a large large addressable market that demand for credit continues to grow and so we would expect to continue to see growth there in terms of how investors are accessing the growth we offer arcc as a daily liquidity public vehicle for folks to get access to private credit strategies we offer commingled funds to your specific question that are locked up gp lp structures that typically have a life of eight to 10 years with extension and on average have an investment period between four and six years so when people are allocating into the space it s with an expectation that you will be investing that fund over a four year to six year period the nice thing is not only they locked up but most of these private credit funds have recycled so to the extent that that velocity in the portfolio of two to four years that i mentioned comes through that capital stays on the platform to reinvest maybe stating the obvious because these are private illiquid securities it s very hard to own and manage them in anything other than a long dated locked up commingled fund or permanent capital structure alex blostein goldman sachs analyst got it great thanks for that and then mike just a follow up question for you just around the capital obviously nice to see dividend increase and the buyback here can you talk a little bit about the pace of buyback and whether or not you plan to be more opportunistic and more kind of systematically to be in the market and also i guess the follow up to that looks like your debt balances picked up a little bit on the balance sheet anything we need to be mindful of in terms of potential m a michael mcferran executive vice president chief financial officer chief operating officer sure on the why don t we start the last part of that first on the debt balance in the balance sheet revolver ph had more on it at year end and prior quarter that was really a function of timing for the most part year end compensations done at december a lot of management fees and year end fees are collected in january so there s been no fundamental changes in our use of debt or debt profile we still remain frankly pretty low levered as a firm on the first part of buyback we had a program in place so the point we will be more active we definitely can t be any less active so i think with that we announced what we said in the call was our intention of the buyback program primarily is to try and pursue our share count neutrality strategy where we would intend to opportunistically repurchase shares as they have asked from employee awards and again while we haven t committed to any specific range the 150 million program size gives us flexibility to do so and look if market conditions warranted it we would consider opportunistic buybacks in excess of those michael arougheti co founder chief executive officer president yes so the way we probably structured the program is we would have both 10b 5 and 10b 18 in place to allow us to accomplish both objectives that s something that we re thinking through in terms of the execution of the plan but as you saw in the fourth quarter the market sometimes overreacts and that overreaction shows up in our stock and i think with the plan we would absolutely be in the market acquiring shares to the extent that we saw that kind of dislocation again mike needham bank of america merrill lynch analyst yes no doubt thanks so much michael arougheti co founder chief executive officer president thank you operator and our next questioner today will be craig siegenthaler with credit suisse please go ahead craig siegenthaler credit suisse analyst thanks good morning michael and mike michael arougheti co founder chief executive officer president good morning michael mcferran executive vice president chief financial officer chief operating officer good morning craig craig siegenthaler credit suisse analyst so correct me if i m wrong but it doesn t look like any of your products are near capacity constraints and also because your investment performance is broadly strong what is your view of long term aum growth here and also just kind of a follow up to that what is the economic what is the economic sensitivity to that aum growth because in 2008 in the financial crisis your aum growth actually accelerated during that period michael arougheti co founder chief executive officer president yes i think you actually answered the question for us craig the nice thing about the addressable markets that we operate in are they re massive and they re global and while we have leading market shares in certain of those markets even where we have a market leading position it s probably in the sub 5 range so we re going to continue to experience growth across the platform as we penetrate these large addressable markets but it should not in any way feel capacity constrained we do not put forward long term asset objectives we re investment managers and we focus on delivering great investment performance and have always had a view that when we deliver great investment performance our assets grow but what we can tell you is based on the breadth of product that we have here and the forward view on fundraising i think you should continue to expect the same type of growth from us that you ve seen historically and that s been 15 plus type rate of growth in most of the metrics that you guys are following for the foreseeable future craig siegenthaler credit suisse analyst got it and then just if i can have one follow up here given that arcc now is planning to releverage up in the 0 9 to 1 25 zone could you remind us what level of management fees and incentive fee level ones this will translate into and also how quickly will it take you to get up in that zone because i don t think you can actually start until june of this year michael arougheti co founder chief executive officer president yes so one thing to clarify arcc i would encourage both to go look at what that company accomplished in q4 and through 2018 speaking maybe for my partners who are a little modest the other day was nothing short of remarkable in terms of monetizing the acas acquisition and rotating that portfolio they recently announced another dividend increase a meaningful special dividend and i think are demonstrating to the market that there s still a lot of embedded earnings growth as the company relevers the origination platform that exists here should allow arcc to get higher and to leverage pretty quickly we were roughly 0 6 to 1 net of cash at the end of q4 that number is moving up as we approach the june that is 0 7 moving up as we approach the june transition date and i think as kipp and penny and mitch talked about on that call we ll be slowly moving the leverage up as we approach june and then through the june date we would expect to keep investing into leverage in terms of the dollar value of investing those funds as mike mentioned i think if we were to go to the midpoint of that range it would represent about 50 million of incremental fee coming out of arcc and that is in addition to the roll off of the acas fee waiver which is another 40 million of gross fee so pretty meaningful when you think of it in terms of the percentage of existing revenues coming off the arcc platform craig siegenthaler credit suisse analyst thank you michael michael arougheti co founder chief executive officer president thanks operator and our next questioner today will be kenneth lee with rbc please go ahead kenneth lee rbc analyst hi thanks for taking my question just within the credit business wondering if you could give us a little bit more detail into what drove the elevated realized performance income in the quarter thanks michael arougheti co founder chief executive officer president sure the biggest driver of that was actually this arcc outperformance i just referenced there is a significant amount of realized gains that were monetized throughout the course of 2018 largely out of the legacy american capital book and if you look at the contribution that was about 15 million of the 48 million of realized performance fee came from that single fund we had some credit realizations within some of our alternative credit strategies which also drove it and then the bulk of the remainder came out of our real estate portfolio as i mentioned earlier our opportunistic strategies in the us have been very actively monetizing what has been a fantastic portfolio kenneth lee rbc analyst got you very helpful and just one follow up within the direct lending franchise maybe some updated commentary on what you re seeing in terms of competitive activity whether you re seeing rational behavior among the new entrants into the marketplace and also i think you briefly touch upon this in the prepared remarks maybe a little bit more details on terms of how you saw the lending terms change in the fourth quarter thanks michael arougheti co founder chief executive officer president sure so i never like to say that people are acting rationally or irrationally because i don t know of any investment manager who makes an investment believing thing that they re taking inappropriate risk on behalf of their investors so i would maybe phrase it differently which is given the attractiveness of the asset class that i highlighted we are seeing more capital in the market and we re seeing more capital in the hands of people who frankly have not been investing in the asset class as long as we have and that probably leads them to take certain risks that may be other more seasoned investors won t but we ll only know that when we come through the next dislocation and we can see the dispersion in return the other thing that we talk a lot about in direct lending and i mentioned in the script it s worth highlighting again is when you look at our deployment throughout 2018 in us and europe and that gross deployment was probably close to 17 billion in direct lending across those two geographies in our drawdown funds and arcc 50 of that deployment was to incumbent borrowers which means that if those are high quality companies that we re investing behind it s likely that new market entrants are not seeing that and i d venture to say that the other large market participants see a similar type of incumbency benefit so that available market for that new entrant who doesn t have the competitive advantages of scale and origination and balance sheet et cetera is probably already fishing in a much smaller available market than we are and that does run the risk of adverse selection i think the good news is while q4 as i said was primarily technical it did bring some sobriety back into the market in terms of pricing and structure generally speaking we ve seen spreads increase in the new year somewhere between 50 basis points and 75 basis points in our direct lending strategies generally speaking we re seeing better documentation in things around covenant levels and definitions of ebitda and ebitda adjustments so there has been a dose of conservatism put back into the market as a result of the volatility we saw in q4 i would expect that to persist i think the market has kind of absorbed that and settled out at a new level which we re happy about obviously because we re generating higher returns we were a couple of months ago kenneth lee rbc analyst great thank you very much michael arougheti co founder chief executive officer president thanks ken operator and the next questioner today will be chris harris with wells fargo please go ahead chris harris wells fargo analyst hey can you guys talk to us a little bit about what you re seeing in europe the economic conditions over there seems to be a lot worse than they are here and then related to that your performance in europe continues to look really good so again can you square that with what appears to be much more difficult macro environment there michael mcferran executive vice president chief financial officer chief operating officer sure so just to remind folks where we where we are in europe in terms of geographies the bulk of our business in europe today is in our direct lending business in our real estate private equity business and in our liquid credit strategies buying euro bank loans and bonds we tend to focus predominantly on western europe and we predominantly focus on what i would call more healthy geographies as opposed to iberia and the periphery so with that framework we tend to be much more active investing in the german market french market the uk market which i ll come back to in a second and less so in some of the developing eastern european economies although we re seeing great relative gdp growth there and then it depends on the business in the real estate market the bulk of that gdp is concentrated in the gateway cities and so the strategies there tend to have us focusing in and around gateway cities in real estate and in the private credit business it s much more broadly distributed across europe and geography what i will say is following unlike the us central bank continues to be accommodating in europe which has been constructive for liquidity in the market and asset prices despite commentary to the contrary we think that that will continue bank liquidity and bank competition has changed dramatically so we re seeing much less competition from the bank market across the board that s been constructive for our business and generally i said this in our prepared remarks in the credit business which is where the bulk of the deployment comes from low and slow gdp growth tends to be very constructive for private credit extends duration allows you to maintain high asset spreads et cetera et cetera so the kind of low and slow growth gdp is good for the private credit business the uk is probably been the one area where we ve seen meaningful market changes as you would expect given the uncertainty around brexit and that s played out in a couple of ways we ve seen deal flow shifting out of the uk market and more broadly into the continent in places like france and germany we have seen some reduction in asset and property values in the core uk markets but generally that market has slowed appropriately just given all of the uncertainty and i don t think that we will see deal flow return to prior levels until we get clarity as to what the path for brexit will be and what the ultimate economic impact will be in the uk market so if you look at our deployment we ve seen a meaningful shift out of that core uk market to more of a pan european slant chris harris wells fargo analyst thank you operator and the next questioner today will be michael cyprys with morgan stanley please go ahead michael cyprys morgan stanley analyst okay good morning thanks for taking the question so you guys continue to raise record amounts of capital and investing back into business just hoping you could help flesh out where specifically you re investing back in the business today and as you look out over the next three years what would you say is on your to do list in terms of incremental investments in the business if you could speak about investment capabilities you re thinking about distribution technology just hoping you could help flesh all of that out thank you michael arougheti co founder chief executive officer president sure we ve talked about some of these in the past that i ll reiterate it just to give some context so one strategy that i reference was our opportunity fund special opportunities fund we began talking about adding people there i guess now two years ago we ve since hired about 18 new professionals into that part of our business out ahead of the launch of this very exciting product that we just talked about and our p l had been burdened with all of those additions and people let alone the infrastructure to support those people a good 12 months to 18 months before we formally launch to fund there we re making similar investments in and around our real estate credit business continue to add people and capabilities to support what we think is a very high growth area for us and so while our aum continues to ramp we re not seeing a dollar for dollar impact on the profitability of that business just yet and then lastly which we mentioned this in the prepared remarks we continue and will continue to add meaningful resources and infrastructure around our alternative credit businesses which is really everything we re doing in non corporate lending across a whole host of interesting asset classes we have as you ve seen continued to invest in geographic expansion europe was non existent for us 10 or 11 years ago that now represents probably 25 of the firm s aum and growing we have a full pan european office footprint we continue to grow that we just actually opened up an office in amsterdam so i think you ll continue to see us increasing our geographic footprint as we push into some local markets that we think are interesting and then in distribution we actually quantified some of that in the prepared remarks three years ago across our distribution and ir groups we had about 64 people that number is 95 and continuing to grow and it s growing globally and i think some of the results you re seeing in fundraising are just a direct reflection of those investments that we ve been making over the last three years to five years and then on retail distribution we did talk about it in prior calls but it s worth mentioning we have put meaningful investment into the development of our non traded retail distribution and integral fund business as well as our private bank distribution capability and we re starting to see significant momentum in both of those channels as well michael cyprys morgan stanley analyst great thanks for that and just a follow up question maybe shifting gears to the broader exit environment just curious if you could talk a little about how you see that shaping up and then if you look at your accrued carry balance nearly 250 million in accrued carry receivable today i guess just what period would you expect that to be realized over i think if you look back historically it looks like you ve kind of monetized the receivable balance over about 2 5 years on average how does that sound to you with respect to where you see the funds today and you could touch upon the backdrop of should that be a little bit slower or faster thanks michael arougheti co founder chief executive officer president i ll give you a broad response then maybe david wants to just chime in terms of what we re seeing from realization and monetization backdrop within the pe portfolios but look we have such a diverse pool of funds and investments that we re consistently in deployment and harvest mode and so obviously certain market environments are more conducive and constructive for exit than others but every quarter just given where funds are in their lives and given where various strategies are you re going to see fairly consistent level of deployment and monetization i think your assumption around our historical pace is probably accurate as mike mentioned we would expect our shadow aum to be deployed somewhere between 18 months and 36 months depending on the shape of the market i think the same would hold through therefore for realizations and if you go back to the 120 million number that i referenced earlier and you look at the accrued balance which by the way has gone up as the markets have rebounded that would correlate also to that kind of 18 month to 36 month timeframe david you want to give any specifics just on what we re seeing generally in the market and liquidity for quality assets david kaplan co head of private equity group for quality assets there is no shortage of a bid if you will maybe a couple of quick statistics which is there is somewhere around 900 billion of private equity dry powder in the market today and as of the third quarter i believe in 2018 we hit as we monitor purchase multiples over last 20 years we hit an all time high on average of about 11 times so if you have a quality asset there is capital absolutely available with multiple folks chasing it so we continue to see a reasonably constructive exit environment today michael cyprys morgan stanley analyst any notable or large exits in the pipeline at this point to speak of in terms of where the pipeline stands at exits today versus a quarter ago michael arougheti co founder chief executive officer president yes mike we can talk specifically about individual companies other than to say as we mentioned some of our legacy pe funds are at that stage of their life cycle where we re continually looking for opportunities to monetize michael cyprys morgan stanley analyst great thank you very much michael arougheti co founder chief executive officer president thank you operator and this will conclude our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks michael arougheti co founder chief executive officer president i don t think we have any we appreciate all the time you spent with us and again happy valentine s day i hope you enjoy a wonderful day with your loved ones

superior plus corp announces record fourth quarter and full year results and confirms 2018 results at the higher end of the aocf per share and adjusted ebitda guidance tweet superior plus corp superior tsx spb announced today its financial and operating results for the fourth quarter ended december 31 2018 unless otherwise expressed all financial figures are expressed in canadian dollars superior achieved aocf before transaction and other costs of 1 91 per share and adjusted ebitda of 374 3 million which were at the higher end of the 2018 financial outlook and adjusted ebitda guidance we achieved record results in 2018 driven by strong contribution and integration work related to the ngl canwest and tuck in acquisitions in our energy distribution business and improved chlor alkali results in our specialty chemicals business the record fourth quarter results demonstrate the benefits of the acquisition of ngl propane and our larger scale u s propane distribution business in the eastern u s we also ended the year exceeding our 2018 run rate synergy target related to the canwest propane acquisition and we were able to realize higher than expected synergies related to the acquisition of ngl propane said luc desjardins superior s president and chief executive officer we continue to gain momentum on finishing at the higher end of our evolution 2020 initiatives and we are focused on lowering our leverage as well as achieving double digit adjusted ebitda growth in 2019 business and financial highlights superior achieved record results in the fourth quarter reporting adjusted ebitda of 153 0 million a 43 9 million or 40 increase over the prior year quarter primarily due to higher energy distribution ebitda from operations and lower corporate costs partially offset by lower specialty chemicals ebitda from operations and realized losses on foreign currency hedging contracts compared to a gain in the prior year adjusted ebitda during 2018 was 374 3 million 26 higher than 2017 and at the higher end of the financial outlook range of 345 0 375 0 million primarily due to the increase in energy distribution ebitda from operations aocf per share before transaction and other costs during the fourth quarter was 0 76 10 higher than the prior year quarter primarily due to an increase in adjusted ebitda and a decrease in cash taxes partially offset by an increase in interest expense and weighted average shares outstanding the increase in interest expense and weighted average shares outstanding was a result of the debt and equity financing for the ngl transaction aocf per share before transaction and other costs during 2018 was 1 91 9 higher than 2017 and towards the top of the financial outlook range of 1 75 1 95 per share net cash flows from operating activities in the fourth quarter were 17 6 million lower than the prior year quarter primarily due to income taxes refunded in the prior year partially offset by higher cash generated from operations in the current year superior generated a net loss of 48 3 million in the fourth quarter which was 93 6 million lower than the net earnings of 45 3 million in the prior year quarter the decline was primarily due to an unrealized loss on derivatives financial instruments in the quarter an increase in selling distribution and administration costs as a result of the ngl acquisition including increased amortization and depreciation expenses and was offset in part by an increase in gross profit gross profit increased 81 4 million primarily due to the contribution from ngl canwest and tuck in acquisitions as well as colder weather selling distribution and administrative costs increased 97 2 million primarily due to the incremental expenses from the ngl and tuck in acquisitions energy distribution ebitda from operations for the fourth quarter was 129 0 million an increase of 47 7 million or 59 compared to the prior year quarter primarily due to the contribution from ngl propane ngl and the tuck in acquisitions completed in 2018 as well as colder weather in the northeast u s and eastern canada u s propane distribution residential sales volumes increased 193 million litres or 224 primarily due to incremental volumes from ngl and the tuck in acquisitions average sales margin for u s propane distribution increased to 34 0 cents per litre in the fourth quarter an increase of 139 compared to the prior year quarter the increase reflects the contribution from ngl and the tuck in acquisitions which have a higher mix of residential customers and the positive impact from the divested lower margin wholesale distillate assets and related business specialty chemicals ebitda from operations for the fourth quarter was 33 3 million a decrease of 2 2 million or 6 compared to the prior year quarter due to lower sodium chlorate and sodium chlorite gross profit partially offset by higher chlor alkali gross profit sodium chlorate gross profit decreased primarily due to higher electricity costs coupled with lower sales volumes sodium chlorite gross profit decreased due to lower demand from the oil and gas and municipal sectors chlor alkali gross profit

include supply chain efficiencies through leveraging the scale and existing supply relationships as well as operational expense savings the expected additional run rate synergies of us 16 7 million

increase compared to 2018 using the mid point of guidance energy distribution ebitda from operations is anticipated to be higher than 2018 primarily due to full year results from ngl as well as the

ebitda by approximately 5 in 2019 ifrs 16 is expected to increase total debt by the end of 2019 by approximately 150 million primarily due to railcar leases previously treated as operating leases and excluded from debt debt management update superior remains focused on managing both its total debt and its total net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio superior s total debt to adjusted ebitda ratio for

defined by international financial reporting standards non gaap financial measures but are used by management to evaluate the performance of superior and its business aocf before and after transaction and other costs earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda from operations and adjusted ebitda these measures may also be used by investors financial institutions and credit rating agencies to assess superior s performance and ability to service debt non gaap financial measures do not have standardized meanings prescribed by gaap and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies securities regulations require that non gaap financial measures are clearly defined qualified and reconciled to their most comparable gaap financial measures except as otherwise indicated these non gaap financial measures are calculated and disclosed on a consistent basis from period to period specific items may only be relevant in certain periods see non gaap financial measures in the md a for a discussion of non gaap financial measures and their reconciliations to gaap financial measures the intent of non gaap financial measures is to provide additional useful information to investors and analysts and the measures do not have any standardized meaning under ifrs the measures should not therefore be considered in isolation or used in substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with ifrs other issuers may calculate non gaap financial measures differently investors should be cautioned that aocf ebitda from operations and adjusted ebitda should not be construed as alternatives to net earnings cash flow from operating activities or other measures of financial results determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of superior s performance non gaap financial measures are identified and defined as follows adjusted operating cash flow and adjusted operating cash flow per share aocf is equal to cash flow from operating activities as defined by ifrs adjusted for changes in non cash working capital other expenses non cash interest expense current income taxes and finance costs superior may deduct or include additional items in its calculation of aocf these items would generally but not necessarily be infrequent in nature and could distort the analysis of trends in business performance excluding these items does not imply they are non recurring aocf and aocf per share are presented before and after transaction and other costs aocf per share before transaction and other costs is calculated by dividing aocf before transaction and other costs by the weighted average number of shares outstanding aocf per share is calculated by dividing aocf by the weighted average number of shares outstanding aocf is a performance measure used by management and investors to evaluate superior s ongoing performance of its businesses and ability to generate cash flow aocf represents cash flow generated by superior that is available for but not necessarily limited to changes in working capital requirements investing activities and financing activities of superior aocf is also used as one component in determining short term incentive compensation for certain management employees the seasonality of superior s individual quarterly results must be assessed in the context of annualized aocf adjustments recorded by superior as part of its calculation of aocf include but are not limited to the impact of the seasonality of superior s businesses principally the energy distribution segment by adjusting for non cash working capital items thereby eliminating the impact of the timing between the recognition and collection payment of superior s revenues and expenses which can differ significantly from quarter to quarter aocf is reconciled to cash flow from operating activities adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda represents earnings before interest taxes

0 102 cents on the cost side our casm excluding the one time non cash fleeting per min charge came in at 0 093 0 5 higher year over year due to higher fuel costs however adjusted ex fuel casm came in at 0 062 or 5 8 lower year over year the resulting operating margin excluding special items came in at 9 on the operational front copa airlines delivered an on time performance of 87 7 and a completion factor of 99 8 again industry leading results now turning to our main highlights for the full year 2018 unit revenues at 0 104 came in close to 1 6 lower year over year driven by a 2 1 decrease in yields partly offset by a 0 2 percentage point increase in load factor adjusted casm ex fuel decreased 4 1 to 0 061 among the lowest very full service airline despite the headwind of a soft unit revenue environment and higher than expected fuel prices we reached an operating margin excluding special license of 12 5 for the year as for our network expansion during 2018 we added five new destinations porto alegre and salvador in brazil bridgetown barbados puerta vallarta mexico and salta in argentina ending the year with 80 destinations in north central south america and the caribbean strengthening our position as the most complete and convenient hub in latin america in terms of fleet during 2018 we returned one leased embraer 190 and we took delivery of six aircraft two boeing 737 800s and four 737 max9 aircraft ending the year with 105 aircraft within production of the 737 max9 we also launched our new business class product green with lie flat seats and other amenities for our longest flights which should help us increase yields in the front cabin in those routes on the operational front we delivered an on time performance of 89 7 for the year and were recently recognized by flightstats for the sixth consecutive year as the most on time airline in latin america and by oag as the most on time airline in the world i d like to take this opportunity to thank our more than 9000 employees for everything they do to be number one and continuously deliver a great travel experience to our customers finally wingo continues to do well both operationally and financially as mentioned in the third quarter earnings call later in 2019 will be swapping their four 737 700s for four 737 800s which will further lower their unit cost and increase profitability we also expect to transfer a fifth 737 800 to the wingo fleet and most likely basin in panama advertisement advertisement turning now to 2019 were still operating a soft yield environment driven mainly by brazil and argentina so we expect to continue seeing weak unit revenues in the first half of 2019 driven by low yields especially when compared to a very strong first quarter in 2018 the currencies in these countries have been stable recently and at least in the case of brazil the economic prospects are improving as a matter of fact the imf is projecting for brazil gdp growth of 2 5 compared to 1 3 in 2018 there has also been some rationalization of capacity in both markets so we expect the demand environment to improve but probably not sooner than the second half of the year as a matter of fact our recent sales data is showing improvement in yields across the network including positive year over year numbers for the second half of the year also fuel prices are lower than in 2018 so if this continues it should certainly help our results for the year as always josé will provide a detailed update on our 2019 guidance while we re confident that the demand environment will continue to improve we remain very focused on initiatives to make us even more resilient during these downturns we continue driving initiatives to strengthen our top line and are focusing more than ever on maintaining extremely competitive unit cost we continue to make progress in ancillary revenues and loyalty program initiatives including selling seat assignments and expanded second bag fee program the selling of miles and upgrades among others we have also made significant progress in deploying new technology tools which would help us enhance and accelerate these results by the end of the year our current plan includes implementing basic economy fares in the fourth quarter regarding our fleet during january we received one boeing 737 max9 originally scheduled for december 2018 and close the sale of one embraer 190 during the remainder of the year we expect to receive eight 737 max9s and finalize the sale of four embraer 190s to end the year with 109 aircraft more than 10 will be max9 this should help us improve fuel efficiency decrease our overall unit cost and increase our yields on longer haul routes thanks to the dreams business class program finally we recently announced a new destination paramaribo in suriname starting in july by the end of the year copa provides service to 81 destinations in 33 countries in north central south america and the caribbean by far the most complete and efficient network for intra america travel advertisement advertisement to summarize we expect a challenging revenue environment in the first part of 2019 based mostly on continued yield softness in brazil and argentina we are being proactive in taking steps to moderate our growth to accommodate current market conditions our team continues to deliver world leading operational results we continued delivering efficiencies and savings which have further lowered our unit industry leading unit cost we also continue focusing on revenue opportunity including ancillary initiatives our aim at strengthening our results lastly we re confident as ever in our business model and our financial strength even during a challenging year we continued delivering a great product leading unit cost and double digit margins making us the best positions consistently delivering industry leading results especially as the market conditions in our region continue to normalize now i ll turn it over to josé who will go over our financial results in more detail jose montero chief financial officer thank you pedro good morning everyone and thanks for joining us as always i d like to join pedro in acknowledging our great copa team for all their achievements during a challenging year i will start by going over our full year highlights we delivered a load factor of 83 4 on an 8 capacity growth yields however came under pressure in the second half of the year due to continued weakness in the brazilian real and argentine peso pushing unit values down 1 6 to 0 104 advertisement advertisement we decreased our ex fuel unit cost by 4 1 to 0 061 cents one of the lowest in the world for a full service carrier however fuel prices increased about 25 year over year offsetting all of our ex fuel casm efficiencies and putting pressure in our operating margin which came in at 12 5 net of special items on the operational front we strengthen our network by adding five new destinations we took delivery of our first 737 max aircraft we continued delivering a world class operating product and were recognized as the most on time airline in the world we ve been closed before so it is gratifying for the entire team to achieve the number one spot reporting net income for the full year 2018 came in at 88 1 million which translates to earnings per share of 2 07 excluding special items mainly the non cash and the non recurring per min charge 188 6 million related to the embraer 190 fleet adjusted net income came in at 276 7 million for an adjusted earnings per share of 6 52 23 5 lower than the adjusted net income of 361 2 million or adjusted earnings per share of 8 25 in 2017 now turning to our fourth quarter results we grew capacity by 5 5 year over year while revenue passenger miles increased 4 9 year over year which resulted in a consolidated load factor of 82 8 an 8 4 percentage point decrease versus q4 2017 use was also weaker coming in 7 7 below last year this year over year decline was mostly driven by the continued weakness in the brazilian real and the argentine peso our q4 2018 rasm came in 0 102 or 7 7 lower than the 0 11 reported for q4 2017 consolidated revenues decreased 2 7 year over year to 656 million advertisement advertisement on the expense side excluding special items our fourth quarter operating expenses increased 6 year over year on the 5 5 capacity growth which resulted in our cost per available seat mile increasing 5 to 0 093 specifically as a function of higher jet fuel prices for the quarter are effective volume fuel price average 2 38 per gallon an increase of 17 5 versus the 2 03 per gallon that we averaged q4 of 2017 our total fuel expense for the quarter was 36 7 million above q4 2017 of which 29 million are related to the fuel price increase and the rest due to the additional capacity flown during the quarter for the fourth quarter our unit cost excluding fuel ex fuel casm came in 5 8 lower year over year excluding special items coming down from 0 066 in q4 2017 to 0 062 in this quarter this reduction in our unit cost for the fourth quarter came mainly due to lower maintenance expenses related to the return of leased aircraft as well as to the continued focus in the reduction of overhead expenses and lower bearable compensation expenses consolidated operating earnings for the quarter came in 47 lower at 58 9 million resulting in operating margin of 9 7 5 percentage points lower than the 16 4 generated in q4 2017 looking at nonoperating income expense and excluding special items the fourth quarter generated a net nonoperating expense of 10 9 million compared to a 9 8 million loss reported in q4 2017 mainly as a result of a firm currency fluctuation loss of 7 3 million realized in q4 2018 compared to a 5 7 million loss in 2017 in terms of net results the quarter generated a net loss of 156 million or a loss per share of 3 67 compared to earnings per share of 2 39 in q4 2017 excluding special items mainly the 188 6 million non cash and nonrecurring per min charge related to the e190 fleet and an 11 4 million one time foreign currency adjustment that was included as part of our restated 2017 results adjusted net income came in at 44 million or 1 02 per share compared to 2 11 per share in q4 2017 according to the balance sheet we closed the quarter with a very strong financial position assets total 4 1 billion owner s equity totaled 1 8 billion debt plus capitalized leases total 2 1 billion and our adjusted net debt to ebitda ratio came in at a very strong 2x by far the lowest in our peer group keep in mind that starting in 2019 the nature of this calculation will change with the adoption of the leasing standard ifrs 16 we closed the quarter with approximately 1 3 billion in debt more than 60 of which is fixed with a blended rate including fixed and floating rate debt over approximately 3 4 in regard to cash short and long term investment we closed the quarter with close to 860 million the reduction in cash balance during the quarter was driven primarily by the early retirement of a portion of our debt related to the e190 aircraft our cash balance at the end of the quarter represents approximately 32 of the last 12 months revenues advertisement advertisement in terms of fleet we received three 737 max9 aircraft during the quarter ending the year with a total of 105 aircraft the fifth max9 originally scheduled for december as per our fleet plan was delivered early in january also in january we executed the sale of the first embraer 190 to azores aviation during the rest of 2019 we expect to take delivery of eight additional max9s and finalize the sale of four additional embraer 190s to end the year with a fleet of 109 aircraft 13 737 max9s 68 737 800s 14 737 700s and 14 embraer 190s it is important to note that we have already secured the financing for all the aircraft we will take delivery of during 2019 finally i m pleased to announce that our board of directors has approved a quarterly dividend of 0 65 per share corresponding to our dividend policy of 40 of prior years adjusted net income the first quarterly dividend will be paid on march 15 to all shareholders of record as of february 28 so to summarize the fourth quarter performance was affected by the weakness in some of the currencies in the region as well as the increase in the price of jet fuel however we continue to deliver industry leading unit costs and we continue pursuing our cost savings initiatives our network continues being the most convenient for travel within the americas with world class operational indicators we have one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry and we continue to return value to our shareholders today we are also providing guidance for 2019 based on our operating plan and expectations for air travel demand for the year we re co producing our capacity growth in terms of asms two approximately 2 and given the lower fuel price curve for the year we re increasing our operating margin range to 12 to 14 our 2019 for your guidance is based on the following assumptions load factor of approximately 84 rasm of approximately 0 102 casm ex fuel of approximately 0 062 and a lower effective fuel price per gallon including 0 28 of interplane and expenses of approximately 2 15 advertisement advertisement thank you and what that will open the call to some questions questions and answers operator ladies and gentlemen if you have a question at this time please press 1 on your telephone keypad if your question has been answered or you wish to remove yourself from the queue please press once again that s 1 for questions 1 our first question from the line of bruno amorim from goldman sachs you may begin bruno amorim goldman sachs analyst yes hi good morning i have a question on your cash position i just like just to check with you if there is any of the countries where the currency has depreciated significantly in 2018 like argentina venezuela or brazil where you have a significant cash position and if this is the case what was the impact market to markets in the cash position and also i have a second question on your capacity growth you have reduced your capacity growth guidance for this year is lively now together with the results have you already made the adjustments that you had to make in the network now that you ve reached this new capacity level or is this something that you re gonna do throughout the year and therefore could have an impact not immediately but throughout the year on your pricing and power thank you very much jose montero chief financial officer hello bruno this is josé here so in terms of cash basically all of our cash is in us dollars so we don t really maintain amounts of cash in our currencies once we perform our sales we repatriate the currencies very quickly so there is very little impact in our cash balance related to that where you see the variation in our fx line mostly its translational aspects related to payables and receivables in the particular countries more than specifically cash transactions related to the currencies and in terms of the capacity we ve already started making some adjustments to the network mostly for the first half of the year related to frequencies and markets in south america we did reduce some of our exposure to some of the deep south markets again mostly driven by frequency into markets that we already serve and so yeah the 2 at least for the first half which is kind of the first part of the year has artie been out there and published bruno amorim goldman sachs analyst thank you so much operator thank you enter next question comes from the line of savi syth from raymond james you may begin savanthi syth raymond james associates analyst hey good morning i was wondering if you could share with us the rasm decline for brazil and argentina in the fourth quarter and can i pick up the in 1q filled out so much stronger at tax levels what s the trend that you re seeing currently assuming nothing changes pedro heilbron chief executive officer yeah hi savi it s pedro so in the fourth quarter in both markets we saw in argentina industry sales were around 40 down year over year and that was mostly yield systems same with brazil with brazil it was around 20 industry sales agency sales down in brazil i mean in that range and that was very similar to what we ve been seeing in the first quarter also and again mostly yield however we have seen in our current sales for future travel we have seen networkwide improvement in yields a gradual improvement in yields and more recently were starting to see actually positive yields year over year but that could have an impact mostly in the second half of 2019 savanthi syth raymond james associates analyst okay and then if i just regarding venezuela have you seen any changes in the demand or supply there and just how your thinking about it given the latest developments pedro heilbron chief executive officer right so as usual it s like a roller coaster ride so since the most recent crisis started we have seen demand suffer quite a bit and in fact we had scheduled additional capacity toward the end of last year beginning of this year and we took out that additional capacity and this month of february to react to the lower demand due to what s going on there savanthi syth raymond james associates analyst okay got it thank you pedro jose montero chief financial officer hey savi one more thing here this is josé here so venezuela just in total in terms of asms represents around 2 of our asms so it s a minor portion of the total capacity that we have savanthi syth raymond james associates analyst i was just wondering if there was opportunity there given that potentially things could improve but it sounds like it s not there yet pedro heilbron chief executive officer yeah not right now yeah hopefully it will improve in the future savanthi syth raymond james associates analyst thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of duane pfennigwerth from evercore isi you may begin duane pfennigwerth evercore isi analyst hey guys thanks i wonder if you could just expand a little bit on what you expect in the first quarter do you expect a similar decline a greater decline or less of the decline into the march quarter and if you could size the easter shift as you see that in the first quarter jose montero chief financial officer hey duane i d say that the first quarter it s going to be a difficult comp because q1 of 2018 was very strong and so we re seeing a gap in a year over year basis in the low double digits kind up the low teens in terms of rasm on a year over year basis so that s how are seeing it having said that as pedro mentioned i think we re starting to see especially i think toward the latter part of the second quarter some better forward yields in the bookings that we re seeing so i think that we re at least optimistic in the sense that perhaps toward the second half of the year we ll start seeing improvement on a year over year basis duane pfennigwerth evercore isi analyst i appreciate that detail and then just for my follow up on the 190 fleet if you had to guess how much longer will you be operating those 19 aircraft and what is the carrying value on the fleet today after the writedown and thanks for taking the questions pedro heilbron chief executive officer right so i ll take the first part this is pedro by the end of the year the embraer fleet will be down to 14 aircraft we re selling five or we have sold five of which we have delivered one and there are four more to be delivered so we should end the year with 14 embraer s we have not made that decision a firm decision yet in terms of how long we re gonna keep the embraer s or if they re going to be replaced by similar hundred seaters or just operate a single boeing fleet of 737s we have not made that decision we re looking closely at the numbers and we will make a decision that is positive to our net results but we re not there yet jose montero chief financial officer yeah and in terms of the carrying book value of the fleet it s basically between the high 80s in terms of millions of dollars so that s kind of how it s left but there s spare parts and spare engines etc as well in there so there s some other components as well in there the figure that i just mentioned is purely aircraft duane pfennigwerth evercore isi analyst okay guys thank you operator and our next question comes from the line of hunter keay from wolfe research you may begin mike gunn wolfe research analyst hi this is actually mike gunn for hunter so on basic economy you said that s going to be coming 4q just a couple thoughts if that s good to be limited to certain geographies if it ll come out all at once if it s good to be all the buckets are just a couple of them any thoughts you d be willing to share thanks pedro heilbron chief executive officer yeah we haven t finalized what exactly it s gonna look like so we know are going to have the right technology and were implementing forward logic technology which should be implemented by the fourth quarter that s going to allow us to implement the basic affairs and that something we re going to do we don t know exactly how it s gonna look but i would expect it to be in most markets for sure and we also expect a kind of very positive impact from being able to upsell promote upselling but also more effectively sell ancillary mike gunn wolfe research analyst great thank you operator in our next question comes from the line of helane becker from cowan you may begin conner cunningham cowen and company analyst hey guys it s actually conner cunningham in for helane is it safe to assume that the capacity adjustments are happening on the off days and if so can you just talk about the unit revenue trends for peak versus off peak thanks jose montero chief financial officer yeah you can make an assumption that we are very aggressive in our capacity management during the low season periods what we ve also done is shifted some of the capacities away from some of the brazilian and argentinian markets and put it to fly in other parts of the network so there s also a little bit of that as well so that s part of the asm shift that s been driven by simply the shift in the shape of the network but also indeed there is a very active management of our capacities during low season periods pedro heilbron chief executive officer and i would add to that that some of our secondary brazilian and argentinian markets five of those markets in both countries have capacity reductions in q1 year over year in the 20 range conner cunningham cowen and company analyst okay and that actually kinda speaks to my follow up if you exclude brazil and argentina how is the rest of the year network performing i mean obviously you re putting more capacity into new markets so is there a unit revenue headwind that you re kinda seeing their overall thanks pedro heilbron chief executive officer so two things or maybe three things so in terms of capacity we are actually slowing growth and that 2 asm growth we are guiding to for 2019 is pretty much across the board i mean we are reinforcing capacity in some markets that are stronger but not by a significant amount so it s pretty much kind of a network thing there are certain other markets that have not obviously a collapse like brazil and argentina they have not been subject to the currency devaluations and economic conditions but that are under more capacity pressure like for example in and out of columbia columbia to north america to south america to the caribbean there has been a lot of capacity growth not by us by others also from north america to central america there has been quite a bit of capacity growth and we re talking from the middle of last year at including this first quarter so those markets are under more competitive pressure and of course yields have suffered conner cunningham cowen and company analyst okay and then just a quick follow up on duane s question about the e190 fleet can you just talk about the earnings drag of operating two separate fleet types and if you do make a decision for that to go away what with the positive impact be thank you jose montero chief financial officer yeah so when we issued notice of the embraer leasing embraer s leaving we were talking about there is a cash positive benefit about at least 10 million per year related to the replacement of those aircraft with 737 capacity so we re very bullish about that and of course there are further opportunities once the fleet is if we decided the fleet goes away we go to a sole fleet yeah there s some complexity costs that will go away as well so yeah those are certainly advantages we will seek to do while operating just 737 fleet conner cunningham cowen and company analyst great thank you operator and our next question comes from a line of mike linenberg from deutsche bank you may begin michael linenberg deutsche bank analyst yeah hey everybody just a couple here i guess josé you just highlighted the cash benefits of removing the 190s and the reduction in complexity are there any markets though that you serve of the 80 markets today where if you get rid of the e190 that the 737 700 is just not suited for that market you know i don t know if it s a now some of these flights that are less than daily jose montero chief financial officer yeah i think that the first thing i have to say is that is that we have not made the decision the final decision yet to exit the fleet so these are things that we are looking at very closely right now and of course in light of what you mentioned of what is the impact of the 190 in certain secondary markets where that is the right size of aircraft so we are very carefully evaluating what the particular impact will be of that and it could be that if we decide you know you have to take into account that if you decide to replace the 737 700 for an e190 you have to look at how demand would act on where the per trip benefit or profitability for a particular flight would improve or not with a 737 so these are very thorough analyses that we perform audit ongoing basis and we haven t finalized a decision so i would have to say that that s something that we re still looking at michael linenberg deutsche bank analyst okay great and then just assort a second strategic type question why the shift from the 737 700 to the 800 for wingo or was the 800 may be the right airplane from day one but you needed max9s to come in to free up enough 800 s to go into that business and sort of a related question you indicated that you re going to base one of the wingo airplanes in panama now is that panama pacifico or are you actually going to put a wingo aircraft at tucuman pedro heilbron chief executive officer right so this is pedro mike michael linenberg deutsche bank analyst hi pedro pedro heilbron chief executive officer yeah the 800 we always knew the 800 was the right aircraft for wingo it has the right seat capacity and more importantly had the right unit cost for an airline like wingo we started with a 700 for two reasons one that it would reduce the risk the downside risk of an alpha start up and it did so the first year we did not have load factors that were so high that the 700 was not enough so it did reduce the risk and reduce losses during the first year and the second reason we started with the 700 because we knew we could switch fleets at any time because we have enough 800s and we have use for our 700s especially now that we ve sold embraer s so the embraer s we are selling we are replacing with the wingo 700s so it s not a big growth in capacity so yes the 800 is the right aircraft for wingo and we re doing it now when we are confident about the load factors in the future demand for wingo in terms of basing an aircraft in panama it s going to be in panama pacifico where wingo has all of its operations and it s actually going to take registering a new airline in panama so i can operate in and out of panama pacifico with its own route rights michael linenberg deutsche bank analyst okay should we assume this that that airplane is going to be used for panama to routes to the south which is mostly wingo i mean i know i think you do fly wingo up to cancún and i believe mexico city or is this something where you re going to be looking more northward with the panama based aircraft pedro heilbron chief executive officer right so we think i won t be able to give you a firm answer but what i can say is it s not an exact answer but there are a few markets that can sustain nonstop point to point service from panama the rest depends on connectivity which is what we do so only a few can sustain that s our opinion so wingo is going to start operating a few of those markets and you know it could be to the north it could be to the south that s totally open where we see opportunity in those markets where nonstop can be sustained then wingo might fly it michael linenberg deutsche bank analyst okay great if i could just squeeze in just one more as it relates to ifrs16 i know most airlines are going to be moving over to that convention in 2019 presumably you will be doing that as well i know for some airlines because of the punitive nature of capitalizing it seven times some carriers have actually seen an improvement in their balance sheet and leverage moving over to the new accounting standard i m not sure josé if you ve done any early work on this what your initial read whether or not you re coming out with a potential benefit from a deleveraging perspective by moving to ifrs16 any thoughts or comments or is it still too early jose montero chief financial officer yeah that s a great question actually ifrs16 is a mandated standard so everybody is good to have to move even regardless if you are under ifrs or under us gaap asset comparable accounting standard as well so all companies are going to have to go into it it s not only airlines by the way yeah for us we are doing still the work preliminarily and having discussions with the auditors there is a lot of debate in the industry related to the application of the standard but in our case case preliminarily we are seeing yes a deleveraging effect on the balance sheet related to the capitalization of the leases michael linenberg deutsche bank analyst that s great to hear thanks josé thanks everyone operator and our next question comes from the line of joseph denardi from stifel you may begin joseph denardi stifel financial analyst yeah hey good morning everybody pedro can you just talk about as it relates to brazil some of the key milestones politically or from a reform standpoint that your kind of keeping an eye on over the next few months kind of gauge whether some of the enthusiasm down there is actually going to yield good positive results longer term pedro heilbron chief executive officer well i think you could probably tell me we are obviously hopeful and we ve seen how the currency has stabilized actually sounds like the middle of last year it has been pretty stable and the economic growth prospects for this year are close to double what it was in 2018 so we think brazil is going to recuperate much faster than maybe some people think we are seeing a little bit of that right now but you know we are cautiously optimistic there is still a lot going on and i don t want to be a brazilian expert but we are cautiously optimistic right now joseph denardi stifel financial analyst okay yeah fair enough and then pedro if you look out three or four years it seems like a significant amount of capacity between the us and south america is good to be controlled by three or so joint ventures and i m just wondering if you talk about how you think you fit into that longer term whether that s good for you or bad for you yeah just kinda what your thoughts it seems like a very significant change occurring years and i m just wondering how you fit into that thank you pedro heilbron chief executive officer so as you know and as we announced in the latter part of last year we joined and we signed a jba a joint business agreement with united and avianca from columbia that has to go for approval the approval process has not yet started but it will start sometime this year and it usually takes upwards to year and a half or so to get approved so we re talking and of 2020 maybe the beginning of 2021 it s hard to predict but we re going to be part of one of three major jbas in latin american and we think that will level the playing field and given our strategic position in panama right in the middle of latin america we think it s going to be net positive for us joseph denardi stifel financial analyst yeah ok pedro i mean if you think about the potential benefits of it do you think it s stability does it improve the returns that you get going to north america does it allow you to grow more in north america you mentioned it kinda levels the playing field maybe you can expound on that just because your returns are kind of better than everybody else s so i m not sure what leveling of the playing field means for you guys pedro heilbron chief executive officer well what i meant by leveling the playing field is not being left out and not having let s say a united who is our major partner even before we both joined star alliance working with someone else and then the other us major carriers working with some of our competitors and having that advantage of working together in the us market and being able to cooperate in expanding your networks and offering more advantages to the passengers so we will probably given the way our network is structured which is basically international hub and spoke full service we would be in a way left out of the benefits of working together and the benefits for the passengers also they would find probably more and more options in the other joint venture agreements or joint business agreements so that s what i mean by leveling the playing field not having to work against a much greater entity so we re gonna be at par but we retain and this only applies to latin america to us not the rest of our networks and we will also retain our cost advantage and other efficiencies including our world leading on time performance so we will still be out of that but network wise and marketing wise we ll be able to have some advantages that we think are going to be positive going forward joseph denardi stifel financial analyst that s helpful thank you operator enter next question comes from the line of josh milberg from morgan stanley you may begin josh milberg morgan stanley analyst good morning everyone thank you for the call just two quick ones from me the first is that you mentioned a shifting capacity away from brazil and argentina and some markets within those countries seeing cuts biggest 20 early in the year if i m not mistaken i was hoping you would just give a little more detail on that and also maybe give an indication on what might be the full your capacity evolution in those two markets because i was just trying to reconcile your point about potential cuts with the other message that the overall growth should be uniform across different markets pedro heilbron chief executive officer yeah so this is pedro i ll start and maybe josé can pitch in so in terms of argentina and brazil most of our asm reductions or capacity reductions have been in secondary markets so like three secondary markets in brazil two in argentina with cuts about 20 asm in the first quarter of this year versus first quarter of the year before and overall in those markets is even adding the other the trunk routes which are doing better capacity is down in brazil it s down in the high single digits in argentina it s flat but i should say that right before the crisis and argentina and currency devaluation we had grown quite a bit opening destinations and adding frequencies so we have pretty much brought back down all of that additional capacity and we will have flat growth this year jose montero chief financial officer and i think that complementing that the growth that we are seeing or that we are shifting away from these south america from the brazil argentina secondary markets and granted these are all frequencies that we fly into these markets the capacity that we re placing is mostly in the northern parts of south america so the fact that these are shorter stationed flights creates a net reduction or a very slight growth in terms of essential flat year over year asms and that s kinda how we project the overall behavior of the asms throughout the year actually for example in the first half of the year for the first quarter we re expecting overall asm growth to be kind of in line with that 2 that we are guiding to for the full year and then q2 might be flattish to slightly down to basically that one point flat range so that s kinda how the year is gonna be overall josh milberg morgan stanley analyst okay that was very clear and my second question relates to the embraer fleet impairment charge it looks like the impairment itself was boosted to around 190 million from the 160 million level and they just wanted to make sure that that was right and also if it is right understand what drove that jose montero chief financial officer yeah josh so the prior figure that we had issued back was a preliminary figure and we were still performing a very detailed analysis around it and everything we had concurrent with that was of aircraft analysis related to the maintenance policy so once we concluded both analyses the impact on the 190 fleet was higher than what we had calculated initially so it was a little bit of kinda win both calculations were performed a little bit more came into e190 impairment versus the adjustment that we had to make as well so that was the reason for it it was mostly a preliminary figure and still under adjustment josh milberg morgan stanley analyst understood thank you operator and our next question comes from the line of dan mc kenzie from buckingham research you may begin daniel mckenzie buckingham research group inc analyst hey thanks guys just going back to the revenue commentary the failure revised outlook for 2019 was a hair weaker than the last outlook and given the trend capacity i would ve expected it to be just a little stronger so his incremental weakness tied to some of the prior q a that you ve already answered or is this something new or is it really just a rounding error jose montero chief financial officer i d say that it s mostly related just dan to this specific performance report 2019 of q1 and yeah workshop changes that we saw but yeah the performance very close into the beginning of 2019 has been a challenging q1 but as we mentioned before at this time we re seeing our bookings in the years that are coming with our bookings especially during the second part of the second quarter improving and even though they won t close the year over year gap for the rasm for q2 definitely for the second half of the year the potential for improvement right now pedro heilbron chief executive officer so basically the sales are coming and right now for future travel are coming at better year over year yields but obviously we have sold a good percent of the second quarter at lower yield but we ve seen that throughout this year we have seen a gradual improvement in yields year over year closing the gap we had at the beginning of the year and we are seeing positive trends for the second half of the year daniel mckenzie buckingham research group inc analyst got it and then with respect to those positive trends in the back of the year that you are seeing is that broad or widespread across all the network or is that simply tied primarily to brazil and argentina pedro heilbron chief executive officer it s overall it s pretty much the whole network there s always going to be ups and downs and positives and not so positives but it s pretty much throughout the network daniel mckenzie buckingham research group inc analyst very good and then if i could just squeeze one last one here with respect to the commentary on lie flat seats and the positive impact to yields that you referenced in the opening remarks i m wondering if you could just help us peel back the onion a little bit there i m just kinda wondering what percent of the flying to the premium seats represent today and what percent with a represent at the end of the year and what percent with a represent once you re fully up and running i m just trying to get at trend rate you know for how this premium revenue would come in pedro heilbron chief executive officer so right now it s very little i think it s 1 or 2 something like that very little it will be 10 by year end and it will grow year after year but it won t be let s say the whole premium network that will happen like in three or four years and even then it s can it be maybe that will be a third of our flying four years down the line so by the end of this year it will be 10 daniel mckenzie buckingham research group inc analyst thanks pedro perfect operator in our next question comes from the lineup victor mizusaki from braseco bbi you may begin victor hi thank you i have two questions about your guidance for 2019 the first one how much are you paying for jet fuel in the first quarter in the second question also about fuel cost how does this compare your guidance i mean for the year you re assuming 2 15 per gallon so i d like to understand how much you are paying today how does this compare with your guidance jose montero chief financial officer yeah i think that that is really close to where we are right now i think it s in line with the full year the 2 15 we re seeing so it s not it might be a little higher than what we had but it s not just significantly higher than what we are guiding for the full year yeah they are telling me i ve just seen here it s basically about a nickel below the full year so if q1 is basically about 2 10 and the full year is about 2 15 but it s not significantly different from what we ve guided to victor mizusaki bradesco bbi analyst okay and i don t know i don t know if you can disclose this but what s the w tariff forecast to support the 2 15 per gallon for the year jose montero chief financial officer yeah so the fuel you re talking about the jet fuel basis that we are using for the 2 15 is about 1 87 of jet fuel per gallon and add to that 0 28 of interplane fees and that creates the 2 15 guidance for fuel victor mizusaki bradesco bbi analyst okay thank you operator thank you and our last question comes from the line of stephen trent from citi you may begin stephen trent citigroup analyst thanks very much guys and i appreciate the time just one or two from me actually the first is a follow up from mike linenberg s question when we think about ifrs16 and we look at your margin guidance for this year versus last year s any indication as to whether the accounting adjustment made a material difference or can we assume that there s basically no margin difference because of the accounting jose montero chief financial officer yeah steve there is a tiny portion of the lease expenses that will come non operating but it is really very tiny so i would assume or i would just say that the guidance for 2019 has that the ifrs16 included in there but it s very very minor on an operating versus non operating basis stephen trent citigroup analyst okay jose i appreciate that and just one other last question can you give us an update as to where we are now with tucuman airport s south wing jose montero chief financial officer okay steve so we have seen some progress over the last several months and we expect the first four gates to be operational in the month of april and we expect the terminal right now it s still under construction and there s still some milestones to be completed but we re talking about something for the latter part of the year q4 of this year for the terminal to be fully operational stephen trent citigroup analyst okay i appreciate that jose thank you raul pascual director of investor relations okay i think that concludes our earnings call thank you all and thank you for being with us and thank you for your continued support have a great day operator ladies and gentlemen thank you for your participation that concludes the

news national by staff reporter get latest news by email subscribe powered by the reserve bank of zimbabwe rbz shot down an urgent request by commercial banks to raise interest rates and transaction charges at a crisis meeting held in harare last week arguing the move would trigger inflationary pressures the zimbabwe independent can report in the face of rapidly rising costs after bank workers demanded and won a 42 hardship allowance to cushion them from the spiralling cost of living the banking sector approached the central bank for permission to increase fees some banks have backdated allowances to january after the zimbabwe banks and allied workers union zibawu threatened to withdraw labour citing biting economic pressures prompted by concern that the 42 wage increase would eat into banks static earnings the financial institutions called an urgent meeting with the central bank banks income emanates from core lending activities and other non funded sources such as fees and commissions sources close to the developments say the rbz was firm in its stance and shot down the proposal from banks to increase fees and interest rates noting that such a move wouldresult in spiralling inflation currently hovering above 40 although the central bank is yet to give monetary policy direction on interest rates exchange rate and the currency crisis judging by its decision on banks requests interest rates may remain flat central banks tend to tweak interest rates and other monetary policy tools to achieve various economic objectives the rbz in march 2017 capped key interest rates at 18 set mortgages at 12 and lowered charges on electronic transactions a key source of income productive loans attract 12 interest per annum the static interest comes against a background of a rising rate of annual inflation currently officially computed at 42 although leading economist steve hanke says it is way above 230 that had eroded purchasing power bankers fear the failure to tame inflation could threaten the viability of the financial services sector inflation is mostly being fuelled by the weakening of the bond note against the united states dollar that has seen retailers adjusting prices in line with the parallel market rate the central bank created a huge stock of electronic money issued treasury bills and other instruments clocked up massive domestic and foreign debt and ran a current account deficit resulting in the weakening of the bond note in light of rising costs banks felt they could cushion themselves by addressing income lines in the volatile economic environment although bankers association of zimbabwe baz president webster rusere denied that banks had requested an interest rate increase and a hike in charges highly placed sources in the banking sector maintain a request was indeed made the rbz s position is that it was not advisable for banks to hike charges and interest rates the rbz was of the view that inflation would be kept under control the idea was to keep interest rates and charges at current levels although the position is subject to review a senior banker told the independent this week while the proposal was not approved bankers insisted that they would continue to lobby the central bank to increase bank charges the sources added another banker said obviously it will put pressure on the banks interest rates have to go up there is a bit of a squeeze remember banks are holding on to treasury bills which are fixed income instruments so banks have to take losses banks are hoping the rbz will review its position on the interest rates cap and bank charges generally charges and rates are capped yet inflation is going up so it is going to be a challenge for most banks to remain profitable we therefore implore the central government to look into a possible review in the upcoming monetary policy statement the banker said central bank chief john mangudya said he had not received any formal proposal from the banks we have not seen any form of proposal from the banks i would welcome any bank which wrote to us to present that proposal mangudya told the independent yesterday

conclude without substantial progress us china trade talks look set to conclude without substantial progress us treasury secretary steven mnuchin and trade representative robert lighthizer didn t comment on the discussions as the final day of close door session starts today but it s reported that both sides are still far apart on the core issues which would need a meeting between trump and xi to make the agreement subsidies on state owned enterprises that create unfair competition is one of the deadlocks as it s considered fundamental policy of the chinese government that couldn t be touched reuters reported that china has pledged to adjust the industrial subsidy program to comply with wto rules but without any details the us side rightfully is skeptical on enforcement of chinese government s promises white house economic adviser larry kudlow fold fox news that the vibe in beijing is good and negotiators in beijing are soldiering on kudlow also said meeting with chinese president xi on friday is a very good sign and the us delegation is getting the job done kudlow was cautiously optimistic on the outcome meanwhile there is no decision on the trade truce by 60 days yet but as we argued before extending the period while keeping the current tariffs is just prolonging the damage to the economies trump to declare national emergency and sign the shutdown averting bill white house spokesperson sarah sanders confirmed that trump will sign the bill that avert another government shut down however as the bill doesn t include the full sum of the funding that trump demands for the border wall he s going to declare national emergency sanders said president trump will sign the government funding bill and as he has stated before he will also take other executive action including a national emergency top democrat in the congress house of representatives speaker nancy pelosi said she might file a legal challenge to trump s action and that s an option senate democrat leader chuck schumer also criticized trump of a gross abuse of the power of the presidency fed brainard downside risks have definitely increased and gathering fed governor lael brainard warned yesterday that downside risks have definitely increased relative to that modal outlook for continued solid growth she added that back in december she had already noted that crosscurrents were increasing and that tailwinds were dying down and i think that is even more true today because of those downside risks that are gathering brainard pointed to external risks including china s economy us china trade conflicts and brexit and we are a very international economy our financial system in particular has shown itself to be very responsive to earnings abroad to financial conditions and volatility abroad so yeah i m very attentive to the international outlook domestically she believed that momentum has been pretty solid but today s retail sales numbers caught my eye though she didn t want to make too much of one month s numbers on monetary policy she s comfortable waiting and learning and the current policy is in a good place and she would weigh what move if any later in the year meanwhile she added that the balance sheet normalization process should probably come to an end later this year rba kent markets expect next rba move to be down than up rba assistance governor christopher kent delivered a speech on financial conditions and the australian dollar recent developments today there he acknowledged that developments in australian financial markets have been similar to those offshore with falling equity prices rising credit spreads and increased volatility such development is a story of risk premia increasing from low levels and were associated with rising concerns about downside risks both internationally and domestically the outlook for domestic economy has also shifted with downward revision in both growth and inflation forecasts and market expectations for the next move in cash rate have switched signs too kent noted that markets have assessed that the next move is more likely to be down than up and that s reflected in lower bond yields fall in australian bond yields is likely to have contributed somewhat to the modest depreciation of the australian dollar of late on the other hand higher commodity prices appear to have worked to limit the extent of australian dollar depreciation on the data front new zealand businessnz manufacturing pmi dropped to 53 1 in january down from 54 8 china cpi slowed to 1 7 yoy in january ppi

jpy daily outlook daily pivots s1 110 26 p 110 69 r1 110 92 more usd jpy s decline from 111 13 extends today but stays above 110 00 resistance turned support intraday bias remains neutral first at this point focus remains on whether usd jpy could sustain above 61 8 retracement of 114 54 to 104 69 at 110 77 if yes further rise could be seen back to 114 54 resistance however break of 110 00 will suggest that it s actually rejected after the rebound from 104 69 was skewed slightly upwards in that case the original bearish view will be revived and further fall should be seen through 108 49 support in the bigger picture the stronger than expected rebound from 104 69 mixed up outlook we d turn neutral for now first on the upside firm break of 110 77 resistance will suggest that fall from 114 54 has completed at 104 69 already such decline is seen as a leg in the corrective pattern from 118 65 which might be finished too decisive break of 114 54 will confirm this case and target 118 65 and above on the downside break of 108 49 support will turn focus back to 104 62 9 support zone instead economic indicators update

fourth quarter and full year in more detail and then i ll come back and share our progress on the company s strategic priorities in 2018 based on the geopolitical and vehicle volume and mix dynamics around the world our results fell short of expectations the global team worked to offset these factors as much as possible with increases in operating efficiency and lean initiatives that yielded 80 million in operating cost reductions as well as significantly lower sga e expense in addition our continued focus on workplace safety resulted in 28 of our facilities achieving perfect safety performance with zero reported incidents for the year these metrics are even more meaningful given that we launched a record 196 new programs in the year and that was an increase of 16 over 2017 our superior products innovative technologies and high level of customer satisfaction continue to drive new orders for the full year 2018 we booked over 440 million in net new business awards which is a strong indicator of our future growth notably sales awards related to our new innovative product offerings totaled 287 million for the year and that s up 30 compared to 2017 so this shows that our customers are valuing the technology we re bringing to the market which is creating substantial competitive advantage and margin expansion opportunities going forward overall even though our results in the second half of the year were weighed down by challenging economic and market conditions we continued to perform well in 2018 in the areas of our business that we can directly control and we made considerable progress in the execution of our long term strategy for profitable growth now let me turn the call over to jon jonathan p banas executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks jeff and good morning everyone in the next few slides i ll provide some additional detail on our quarterly and full year financial results and put some context around some of the key items that impacted our earnings on slide seven we show a summary of our results for the fourth quarter and full year 2018 with comparisons to the prior year the year over year comparisons were challenging given the record quarter we had for both sales and ebitda achievement in the fourth quarter of 2017 fourth quarter 2018 sales were 872 million down 7 versus the fourth quarter of last year the year over year change was driven by unfavorable volume and mix foreign exchange and customer price adjustments partially offset by acquisitions adjusted ebitda for the fourth quarter was 76 4 million or 8 8 of sales compared to 131 million or 14 of sales in the fourth quarter of 2017 the change was a result of unfavorable volume mix in all regions customer price adjustments higher raw material costs and general inflation partially offset by improved operating efficiency and restructuring and other cost saving initiatives implemented during the year on a us gaap basis we incurred a net loss of 23 million in the quarter this included the net impact of 39 8 million in non cash goodwill impairment charges in our europe and asia segments 43 7 million in non cash impairment charges related to certain intangible and fixed assets in asia and europe as well as the net tax benefit related to deferred tax assets in france and in the us among other special items on an adjusted basis net income for the quarter was 27 5 million or 1 53 per diluted share for the full year sales of 3 63 billion were up 0 3 over last year we had positive contributions to sales from acquisitions improved volume and mix in north america and the net impact of foreign exchange these positive drivers were partially offset by customer price adjustments of approximately 2 of sales and unfavorable volume and mix in europe and asia adjusted ebitda at 376 5 million was down 16 7 year over year the key drivers of the decline were customer price adjustments unfavorable volume and mix and higher raw material costs partially offset by lower sga e and our cost saving and lean initiatives full year net income was 107 8 million or 5 89 per diluted share adjusted for the net impact of impairments tax adjustments and other special items net income for the year was 160 7 million or 8 79 per diluted share this compares to 208 million or 11 08 per diluted share in 2017 from a capex perspective we ended the year at 218 million or 6 of sale this was in line with our guidance and plans for the year as increased launch activity continued investment in innovation expansion of our spartanburg plant in advance of new fortrex launches and investment in our non automotive businesses drove higher capital demand capex for our core business was approximately 5 of sales while investments related to innovation and diversification added the other 1 moving to slide eight these charts quantify the significant drivers of the year over year change in our adjusted ebitda for the fourth quarter and full year in the quarter we achieved 23 million in cost savings through improved operating efficiency and we also reduced sga e expense by 5 million compared to the fourth quarter of last year these savings were more than offset by the negative impacts of 52 million from weaker volume and mix net of price 16 million in higher material costs and 15 million in higher expense related to wages and general inflation for the full year we achieved 80 million in cost savings through improved operating efficiency and 38 million of cost reductions in sga e these savings were again more than offset by the negative impacts of 126 million in unfavorable volume and mix net of price higher material costs of 44 million and wage increases general inflation and other items totaling 23 million in terms of adjusted ebitda margin company driven cost savings and improvements in our underlying performance resulted in positive contribution to margins of 70 basis points for the year however market factors negatively impacted margins by 280 basis points moving to slide nine our balance sheet and credit profile remain strong despite lower earnings and cash flow during the year we ended 2018 with 265 million of cash on hand this was after investing nearly 172 million in strategic acquisitions and returning more than 60 million to shareholders in the way of share repurchases during the year our total debt at year end was 831 million and net debt was 566 million this compares to total debt of 758 million and net debt of 242 million last year our gross debt was 2 2 times adjusted ebitda at year end on a net basis our leverage ratio was just 1 5 times with cash on hand and availability under revolver we had total liquidity of 409 million at year end and as a reminder we expect the sale of our avs business to provide approximately 200 million in cash at closing early in the second quarter of this year when combined with our current cash position and credit profile we expect to have more than adequate liquidity support our near term operating requirements as well as our longer term strategic plans and priority moving to slide 10 we issued our initial full year guidance for 2019 a few weeks ago and those same numbers and assumptions are provided again this morning we expect sales in the range of 3 4 billion to 3 6 billion in 2019 the net impact of divestitures and acquisitions is expected to reduce sales by approximately 160 million or around 4 versus 2018 other assumptions affecting the top line are continued weakness in asia and europe for the year and ongoing customer price adjustments albeit at a rate substantially lower than we experienced in 2018 capex is expected to be between 180 million and 190 million down from 218 million in 2018 we expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 16 to 18 for the year given the lower statutory rate in the us and plan geographic mix of earnings we expect our operations will again be successful in improving operating efficiency and lean savings we also anticipate incremental savings from recent restructuring activities combined these represent 360 basis points of margin improvement over 2018 however we also anticipate continuing headwinds from market driven factors given our outlook on commodity prices and assuming currently announced tariffs remain in effect for the year we would expect to see an adverse 180 basis points in raw material cost pressure this assumes no further tariff actions are implemented general inflation on wages energy rent and utilities is expected to drive 150 basis points of margin headwind and all other items are expected to add another 160 basis points of pressure our margin guidance assumes volume and mix essentially in line with 2018 levels moving to slide 11 free cash flow for the quarter and full year 2018 was weaker than in 2017 and short of our expectations this was primarily due to lower cash earnings the non recurring positive benefit at the start of our pan european factoring program in q4 of 2017 and higher capex losses we also made a discretionary pension contribution to our us plan in 2018 to benefit from the then current tax rate while we don t provide specific guidance our global team is committed and aligned to improving free cash flow in 2019 we have already taken proactive steps beginning in 2018 through reduced sga e and fixed overheads last year targeted actions reduced sga e expense and headcount saving 27 million with expected carryover benefit in 2019 we also expect to see the benefit of a recent voluntary separation program that is expected to drive further savings with less than a one year payback on the capital side our global team will centrally manage equipment specs and sourcing decisions better enabling us to evaluate and facilitate equipment redeployment opportunities similarly we now have centralized global leaders who are driving working capital optimization and are focused on reducing days inventory on hand in summary while we expect continued margin pressure in the near term we are committed to making 2019 one of our better years for free cash flow improvement and the good news is that this process of driving improved free cash flow has already begun now let me turn the call back over to jeff jeffrey s edwards chairman and chief executive officer okay thanks john so before wrapping up our discussion this morning i just want to take a few minutes to review our longer term strategic outlet and some of the reasons why we believe the next five years will provide greater opportunity for our company than the last five did so let s move to slide 13 we have many reasons to be positive about the future of our company and product innovation is just one this is an important year for fortrex in the automotive industry it s the year we launch our first major fortrex production program which will be on the 2020 ford explorer it is also the first year we expect to see a significant revenue impact from this important material science innovation our customers will soon be able to experience the difference fortrex makes and the overall advantages it provides on their vehicles as well as in the assembly process we ll be launching the new explorer sealing program in our plant in spartanburg south carolina where we recently completed a major expansion project focused specifically on fortrex production so following two years of planning execution significant capital investment the construction is now complete the equipment is in place and the training of production personnel is under way turning to slide 14 this chart shows our projected growth in innovation related revenue as you can see we have significant growth planned in each of our product categories so our innovations include much more than just the fortrex technology applied to our sealing products as our innovations go into production and ramp up we anticipate margin expansion opportunities as we set prices in accordance with the incremental value they provide our customers moving on to slide 15 another key reason to be positive about our outlook is the progress we ve made in our strategy to diversify the business building on the formalized structure we put in place in 2018 our advanced technology group is poised to deliver strong growth and margin enhancement going forward the industrial and specialty group will aggressively pursue share in a fragmented non automotive market estimated at approximately 3 2 billion globally this business will leverage our traditional technologies as well as our core product innovations to drive value in near adjacent industrial markets such as recreational vehicles power sport vehicles commercial trucks agriculture and off road equipment and appliances among others the applied materials science business will employ a license based business model to expand penetration of our fortrex chemistry platform into a broad range of high volume industrial and consumer applications with limited additional capital requirements for our company existence existing licensees inoac and polyone are progressing toward initial production and commercialization and we ve advanced our discussions and negotiations with several additional potential licensees in various market segments moving on to slide 16 the chart on slide 16 shows our plans for the growth of the advanced technology group the cumulative average growth rate of 21 takes into account book business as well as planned replacement and targeted new business within the industrial and specialty group it also assumes a number of new licensees within the applied materials science business it does not assume any further m a activity although this will continue to be part of our strategic growth plan for this business while we re not providing definitive guidance on the potential margins for this combined non automotive group we are confident that this business can eventually deliver ebitda margins similar to our north american core automotive business and significantly higher roic so it certainly makes for a very exciting part of our growth strategy going forward turning to slide 17 this chart provides a look at our overall growth expectations for the next five years with a significant portion of our future sales already booked over this period and the competitive advantages provided by our innovation we believe that our sales growth will significantly outpace the forecasted growth in light vehicle production we also expect china will continue to be a growth driver for us in our core automotive business and that s despite the current projections for slower growth in the near term it s the largest automotive market in the world china remains a tremendous opportunity for us to grow our top line and improve margins as we launch record numbers of new programs in the country and ultimately fill up our existing manufacturing plants the plan to strong revenue growth within our advanced technology group as i just discussed will also be key to our ability to outpace the growth of the global light vehicle market turning to slide 18 so to conclude our prepared comments this morning i really want to return our focus to the action plans and the opportunities to deliver improved value here in the short term on slide 18 we highlight a number of these opportunities including the further leveraging of our innovations to help offset price pressure and material cost increases optimizing cash flow as jon described and successfully concluding the sale of our avs business underlying all of this we re committed to continued improvements in operating efficiency and further cost savings estimated at a combined 130 million in 2019 to offset as much of the market headwinds as possible so in spite of our lower sales and earnings projections we expect to deliver significantly higher free cash flow in 2019 and as we do we will continue to be prudent yet opportunistic as it relates to the deployment of capital for strategic acquisitions as well as further share repurchases importantly we want to thank our global team of employees for their commitment to continuous improvement and dedication to delivering value to our customers and stakeholders in challenging market conditions we also want to thank our customers around the world for their continued trust and confidence in the cooper standard team this concludes our prepared comments so we can move on to the q a questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from john murphy with bank of america merrill lynch please go ahead john murphy bank of america merrill lynch analyst good morning guys and thanks for taking the time so a first question on the outlook on slide 10 and i appreciate the walk on the margins but if you were to look back at page eight which is sort of an absolute walk year over year in 2018 and obviously inaudible margin one is absolute dollars so i understand it s a little bit mixed up here but if we look back at slide eight the volume and mix was a negative 126 million i don t see any bar like that in slide 10 for that margin walk and once again no one s absolute ph no one s margins were not perfect but when you think about volume and mix in 2019 how are you kind of thinking about that headwind or maybe not such a big headwind is what we saw in 2018 and if we think about that bar in 2018 i mean how much of that was just pure volume as opposed to mix because mix doesn t seem like it should have been too negative in 2018 jonathan p banas executive vice president and chief financial officer hey john thanks for the question this is jon as far as the 2019 walk in my prepared remarks i kind of alluded to the fact that we expect the same mix profile throughout 2019 that we do in 2018 so that s why you don t see an incremental bar on that margin walk for the guidance levels so the same kind of profile for volume and mix that we saw in q3 and q4 that continues all the way throughout 2019 in our planning process so with respect to the 2018 impact it really was the story of the european footprint for us with some platforms that drove a true mix profile and then the china volumes being down there were where concentrated 90 of our sales go to global oems and detroit three oems so as they were significantly challenged in 2018 that impacted our volumes and mix profile during the year so again those two stories continue on into the 2019 that we foresee in the near future jeffrey s edwards chairman and chief executive officer john this is jeff let me continue that so back in mid january when we issued our guidance we talked about the uncertainty in the market in asia primarily china and also in europe obviously some of that is a result of the conversations going on right now around trade and we happen to believe that ll probably resolve itself hereby early summer at least that s our optimistic view we didn t put that into our guidance we felt that there was too much uncertainty to do that so we took the back half of 18 which was obviously significantly down from what anybody thought and that s what we put into the entire 2019 year so obviously that s a conservative approach but it s the one that we decided to go in john murphy bank of america merrill lynch analyst got you and so for section 301 you guys are assuming the 10 stays in place we don t go up to 25 and then here is an assumption that 232 in the us doesn t get put into place is that a or gets enacted as sort of a net zero is that a fair statement jeffrey s edwards chairman and chief executive officer yes john that s exactly right we re not assuming any additional tariffs come on board john murphy bank of america merrill lynch analyst got you okay and then just real quickly on europe the rde i mean it sounds like wltp like for everybody creates some disruption particularly at audi and vw have you heard anything about the rde testing sort of in the second half of this year and how far ahead of that your customers may or may not be jonathan p banas executive vice president and chief financial officer this is john jeff no we don t have an opinion there i can tell you that our concern in europe is a little different in terms of some of the uncertainty the geopolitical uncertainty obviously the trade discussion with china is having impact on europe i think the paris activity that existed back last year when we pulled out of that it s just driving some very unique behaviors across some segments in europe for us that were being impacted by so frankly that s more of the issue for cooper standard than the issues that you raised john murphy bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay and then just another question on the 440 million of net new business that you booked this year just curious sort of the cadence of the flow of that flowing on to the books and then also as we look at slide 14 kind of thinking about that business flowing on plus the innovative revenue flowing on i mean how should we think about sort of the net new business backlog over the next three or five years and what kind of growth above market so first really how fast does the 440 million flow on just so we can gauge how quickly you can win and grow the top line and then also sort of just a thought process around the next three to five years on net backlog jeffrey s edwards chairman and chief executive officer yeah john this is jeff so regarding how long it takes typically from the time we book an order do we go into production is somewhere between two and three years at this rate of change that s going on in the industry so it s not sort of four to five like it was in the old days so a lot faster and as we go forward i think we expect that we will continue to see similar opportunities that we have this year in terms of net new business john murphy bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it and then just lastly on the licensing side should we think about sort of 5 licensing fees on whatever dollar revenue that your partners sell or is that way too simplistic i mean how should we think about that licensing flow jeffrey s edwards chairman and chief executive officer yeah i think it s fair to say that as we do more of these john going forward we ll have more transparency around it so it would be premature for us to talk about specific numbers but in general terms the licensee approach that you ve described is pretty typical john murphy bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay great thank you very much guys jeffrey s edwards chairman and chief executive officer thanks john operator our next question comes from david tamberrino with goldman sachs please go ahead mariel kennedy goldman sachs analyst hi this is mariel on for david so our first question is just kind of on the industry production assumptions in your 2019 guidance you guys said that you were expecting weakness in asia and europe but it looks like in industry kind of assumptions you re pointing to a little bit of growth year over year is this in line with what you re seeing from customers or is the weakness just something more particular with your customer base jonathan p banas executive vice president and chief financial officer mariel this is jon thanks for the question yeah it s more particular to the customer base as we discussed on our last call the impact in the european story is really a mix discussion around a few significant platforms for our business there is some luxury suvs being produced in the european markets that we have some nice business with that was it was down in q3 and q4 of last year as well as some other premium vehicles and some b segment vehicles that really drove the mix decline for us so it s not so much the overall volume market in 2019 that we re concerned about it s that mix story continuing for that year mariel kennedy goldman sachs analyst okay and then more particularly with china is that sort of the same thing where you could still see it up year over year for the region or jonathan p banas executive vice president and chief financial officer are you talking about the overall production environment or cooper standard specific mariel kennedy goldman sachs analyst overall production and then cooper standard specific jonathan p banas executive vice president and chief financial officer okay well i guess i ll leave it to more experts in the china market to predict where that s going but the way the ihs looks china specific looks to be down year over year as far as in terms of production so we kind of model and follow through that but again with our heavy concentration on global oems and the detroit three oems our story is going to be a little bit more significant than the market decline mariel kennedy goldman sachs analyst okay jeffrey s edwards chairman and chief executive officer this is jeff i ll just add this for you this is additional information that we provided few weeks ago if you look at the mix related to western oems in china as jon just talked about that obviously in the short term that mix is hitting us pretty significantly but when you go out over the course of the next several years you ll see that our china business becomes much more diversified than it is today so by 2023 in fact 30 of the revenue in china will be with the chinese domestic automakers so as we go forward each year we ll have less and less dependence on the western companies and will shift a lot more balance over to the local chinese and our innovation is driving a lot of that they re very interested in the new products new innovation that we have to create a competitive advantage for them mariel kennedy goldman sachs analyst okay thanks for that detail and then just on the 70 million in innovation awards in the quarter how much of this was replacement versus new business can you break that out jonathan p banas executive vice president and chief financial officer we don t really have a specific breakout at hand it s little bit of a complicated mix but we can address that over the past period of time if you were to look at the last year or so on the innovation sales it s roughly 50 50 i just don t have the specific detail on the quarter at hand mariel kennedy goldman sachs analyst okay and then just the last question from us it seem like pricing again was negative in the quarter and it looked like it stepped up a little bit from 3q how is this kind of comparing to your expectations for pricing going forward and like i think the 2 range jeffrey s edwards chairman and chief executive officer yeah it s good question so just historically we ve been in the 1 5 to 1 7 just to frame that 2018 was definitely a year that we anticipated more pricing pressure and we got it we were in the 2 range as you just mentioned for 2019 that number is going to be a lot closer to 1 mariel kennedy goldman sachs analyst okay thanks so much for taking our questions jeffrey s edwards chairman and chief executive officer okay operator our next question comes from matt koranda with roth capital partners please go ahead matt koranda roth capital partners analyst hey guys good morning jeffrey s edwards chairman and chief executive officer good morning matt jonathan p banas executive vice president and chief financial officer hey matt matt koranda roth capital partners analyst in terms of the eu mix issue that you guys were referencing earlier i guess without getting too far over your skis and spring ph for customers why are those programs seeing headwinds in particular is that demand related in your view or is that sort of trade and production issues around brexit just a little more color would be helpful jeffrey s edwards chairman and chief executive officer sure matt this is jeff i was trying to allude to that with john s question earlier and it is difficult as you know to not talk specifically about our customers challenges there i tried to avoid that but clearly there are five vehicles matt that are affecting us one of them is a larger suv that s really a high end vehicle produced in the uk another is a large luxury passenger car produced in germany and then we have issues around what i would call small to mid cycle or mid segment vehicle that s produced in europe by a north american manufacturer that s high content per vehicle for us there s another one in italy that s an issue for us and this comes back to what we think is really driving the issue more of a geopolitical more of an environment focus obviously the diesel scandal had a lot to do with creating an awareness on top of the already existing environmental awareness in europe certainly the rhetoric around the paris discussions and ultimately the us pulling out of that i think all has led to some type of the challenge within the market on these larger upscale vehicles it just happened to be ones that we re producing large content per vehicle large profit per vehicle our customers make a lot of money on those vehicles therefore the supply base tends to follow so that s what s going on for us in europe and we ve assumed that that will continue through 2019 and that was the back half of 18 issue when this really started for us matt koranda roth capital partners analyst okay understandable and then just maybe a little help with the quarterly cadence for the year for 2019 i mean you guys did a good job with the bridge and explaining some of the headwinds but are there any launches that are going to drive some choppiness quarter to quarter i know you guys mentioned the explorer fortrex program in your slides for an example of a launch but how should we be sort of thinking about the sales and ebitda progress through the years as the quarters progress jeffrey s edwards chairman and chief executive officer yeah i think the good news there is that we ve got almost 200 new programs that we will be launching we are very confident in our ability to continue to do that and to do it well we historically last couple of years each year has been a record launch year for us 19 will also be a record launch year our teams are executing very well we don t have concerns matt that we ll have costs above what we ve already baked into our plans i mean statistically we re pretty good at predicting how much it s going to cost us to reach launch and if the last two years being any indication we re confident that 19 is covered with what we showed you jonathan p banas executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah matt and i won t break out the actual revenues for you specifically but i can give you a flavor of the launch cadence as jeff indicated there it s a record launch year and we re going to have over 250 launches in 2019 around 50 of those hit in q1 but then q2 and q3 are over 80 new launches and then it tails off at the end of the year so you can kind of get a feel for that launch cadence compared to how the business results are coming matt koranda roth capital partners analyst okay that s helpful and then just in terms of licensing and how that impacts the 2019 outlook i don t think you guys necessarily covered that i mean i m guessing it s de minimis or whatever you may get is mostly upside to the ebitda outlook but if you could clarify that that would be helpful and then maybe just also level set us on maybe the number of additional licensing agreements that you d expect to sign in the year jonathan p banas executive vice president and chief financial officer hey matt this is jon on the actual financial impact during the year we call that immaterial at this point and i don t want to give you any specific information just because we only have two deal signed right now because that would kind of give away an indication of commercial sensitivity there so we are nearing or i should say we re in discussions and nearing and hope to have about three to four new license agreements signed here in the coming months matt koranda roth capital partners analyst okay that s helpful guys i ll jump back in queue operator our next question comes from glenn chin with buckingham research please go ahead glenn chin buckingham research analyst good morning gentlemen jeffrey s edwards chairman and chief executive officer hey glenn jonathan p banas executive vice president and chief financial officer hey glenn glenn chin buckingham research analyst just a quick follow up on the customer pricing dynamics so you mentioned it ramped up in 2018 but then is expected to moderate in 2019 is that a function of i guess your negotiations for raw material recovery jeffrey s edwards chairman and chief executive officer hi glenn this is jeff yes glenn chin buckingham research analyst okay and then in the presentation jeff you mentioned opportunity to optimize your china manufacturing footprint what needs to be done to optimize that other than just filling up the plants jeffrey s edwards chairman and chief executive officer yeah the biggest thing glenn is the vertical integration for our fuel and brake business so we re in the early stage of launching a brand new tube plant there with our magalloy technology so that s for 2019 that s the biggest factor other than just launching product and putting it into the existing factories so this is a significant investment that we made during the 2018 year and it will come up to production here as we head into 2019 glenn chin buckingham research analyst okay and then in china and europe even excluding the non cash impairment charge so the way you guys disclosed the results by region it looks like even excluding those non cash impairment charges that profitability took a bit of a step down sequentially did anything accelerate or deteriorate in the quarter from third quarter to fourth quarter jonathan p banas executive vice president and chief financial officer hey glenn it s jon there it is just the further exacerbation of the mix story that we talked about earlier this is the big the big impact there in q4 glenn chin buckingham research analyst okay very good that s it for me thanks operator our next question comes from michael ward with seaport global please go ahead michael ward seaport global securities analyst thank you good morning just a follow up on that when you re referring to volume and mix customer mix is part of that correct jeffrey s edwards chairman and chief executive officer yes michael ward seaport global securities analyst okay and can you break down you just got 50 million of volume and mix hit in the fourth quarter can you break down how much of that was china and how much of that was europe is it about 50 50 or is it more tilted toward china jonathan p banas executive vice president and chief financial officer actually for q4 we had negative volume and mix in all regions even the north american footprint based on our customer mix profile took a bit of a hit but europe and asia kind of were equally weighted as far as that 40 million or 50 million you mentioned michael ward seaport global securities analyst okay when you talked about jeff you were just mentioning the commercial negotiations and if the math was right it s roughly 30 million of a help and jon when you alluded to the 60 million raw material pressures in 2019 is that net of the 30 million savings from commercial negotiations or is the 30 million negotiations a payback from 2018 in the negative impact jonathan p banas executive vice president and chief financial officer hey mike this is jon again the material economic numbers i gave you were the gross impact before going back for the price michael ward seaport global securities analyst okay so then and help out on the price sales for 2019 is that more of a payback for the pain you took in 2018 or is that exactly jonathan p banas executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah exactly that s exactly right mike michael ward seaport global securities analyst okay so when you re looking at that 60 million number for 2019 there is a chance we could get some positive commercial negotiations at some point jonathan p banas executive vice president and chief financial officer it s possible but typically those happen on a lag as is commodity inflation occurs during the year and the year closes out and then we kind of rack things up and go back to our customers with the overall scorecard and present at that time a minor amount there is actually indexed so you would get it on that two to three months lag but for the most part it s all based on negotiations michael ward seaport global securities analyst okay and as a ballpark figure for what you re spending on raw materials from out of these about 1 billion jonathan p banas executive vice president and chief financial officer good question i don t have that in hand but i think direct materials are about 50 of our overall cost of goods sold michael ward seaport global securities analyst goods sold jonathan p banas executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah michael ward seaport global securities analyst right so that s ballpark okay jonathan p banas executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah michael ward seaport global securities analyst thanks very much jeffrey s edwards chairman and chief executive officer okay mike jonathan p banas executive vice president and chief financial officer okay mike thanks operator it appears that there are no more questions i would now like to turn the call back over to roger hendriksen roger hendriksen director investor relations okay thanks everyone we appreciate your participation

financial outlook and adjusted ebitda guidance we achieved record results in 2018 driven by strong contribution and integration work related to the ngl canwest and tuck in acquisitions in our energy distribution business and improved chlor alkali results in our specialty chemicals business the record fourth quarter results demonstrate the benefits of the acquisition of ngl propane and our larger scale u s propane distribution business in the eastern u s we also ended the year exceeding our 2018 run rate synergy target related to the canwest propane acquisition and we were able to realize higher than expected synergies related to the acquisition of ngl propane said luc desjardins superior s president and chief executive officer we continue to gain momentum on finishing at the higher end of our evolution 2020 initiatives and we are focused on lowering our leverage as well as achieving double digit adjusted ebitda growth in 2019 business and financial highlights superior achieved record results in the fourth quarter reporting adjusted ebitda of 153 0 million a 43 9 million or 40 increase over the prior year quarter primarily due to higher energy distribution ebitda from operations and lower corporate costs partially offset by lower specialty chemicals ebitda from operations and realized losses on foreign currency hedging contracts compared to a gain in the prior year adjusted ebitda during 2018 was 374 3 million 26 higher than 2017 and at the higher end of the financial outlook range of 345 0 375 0 million primarily due to the increase in energy distribution ebitda from operations aocf per share before transaction and other costs during the fourth quarter was 0 76 10 higher than the prior year quarter primarily due to an increase in adjusted ebitda and a decrease in cash taxes partially offset by an increase in interest expense and weighted average shares outstanding the increase in interest expense and weighted average shares outstanding was a result of the debt and equity financing for the ngl transaction aocf per share before transaction and other costs during 2018 was 1 91 9 higher than 2017 and towards the top of the financial outlook range of 1 75 1 95 per share net cash flows from operating activities in the fourth quarter were 17 6 million lower than the prior year quarter primarily due to income taxes refunded in the prior year partially offset by higher cash generated from operations in the current year superior generated a net loss of 48 3 million in the fourth quarter which was 93 6 million lower than the net earnings of 45 3 million in the prior year quarter the decline was primarily due to an unrealized loss on derivatives financial instruments in the quarter an increase in selling distribution and administration costs as a result of the ngl acquisition including increased amortization and depreciation expenses and was offset in part by an increase in gross profit gross profit increased 81 4 million primarily due to the contribution from ngl canwest and tuck in acquisitions as well as colder weather selling distribution and administrative costs increased 97 2 million primarily due to the incremental expenses from the ngl and tuck in acquisitions energy distribution ebitda from operations for the fourth quarter was 129 0 million an increase of 47 7 million or 59 compared to the prior year quarter

34 0 cents per litre in the fourth quarter an increase of 139 compared to the prior year quarter the increase reflects the contribution from ngl and the tuck in acquisitions which have a higher mix of residential customers and the positive impact from the divested lower margin wholesale distillate assets and related business specialty chemicals ebitda from operations for the fourth quarter was 33 3

trends in business performance excluding these items does not imply they are non recurring aocf and aocf per share are presented before and after transaction and other costs aocf per share before transaction and other costs is calculated by dividing aocf before transaction and other costs by the weighted average number of shares outstanding aocf per share is calculated by dividing aocf by the weighted average number of shares outstanding aocf is a performance measure used by management and investors to evaluate superior s ongoing performance of its businesses and ability to generate cash flow aocf represents cash flow generated by superior that is available for but not necessarily limited to changes in working capital requirements investing activities and financing activities of superior aocf is also used as one component in determining short term incentive compensation for certain management employees the seasonality of superior s individual quarterly results must be assessed in the context of annualized aocf adjustments recorded by superior as part of its calculation of aocf include but are not limited to the impact of the seasonality of superior s businesses

news national by staff reporter get latest news by email subscribe powered by the reserve bank of zimbabwe rbz shot down an urgent request by commercial banks to raise interest rates and transaction charges at a crisis meeting held in harare last week arguing the move would trigger inflationary pressures the zimbabwe independent can report in the face of rapidly rising costs after bank workers demanded and won a 42 hardship allowance to cushion them from the spiralling cost of living the banking sector approached the central bank for permission to increase fees some banks have backdated allowances to january after the zimbabwe banks and allied workers union zibawu threatened to withdraw labour citing biting economic pressures prompted by concern that the 42 wage increase would eat into banks static earnings the financial institutions called an urgent meeting with the central bank banks income emanates from core lending activities and other non funded sources such as fees and commissions sources close to the developments say the rbz was firm in its stance and shot down the proposal from banks to increase fees and interest rates noting that such a move wouldresult in spiralling inflation currently hovering above 40 although the central bank is yet to give monetary policy direction on interest rates exchange rate and the currency crisis judging by its decision on banks requests interest rates may remain flat central banks tend to tweak interest rates and other monetary policy tools to achieve various economic objectives the rbz in march 2017 capped key interest rates at 18 set mortgages at 12 and lowered charges on electronic transactions a key source of income productive loans attract 12 interest per annum the static interest comes against a background of a rising rate of annual inflation currently officially computed at 42 although leading economist steve hanke says it is way above 230 that had eroded purchasing power bankers fear the failure to tame inflation could threaten the viability of the financial services sector inflation is mostly being fuelled by the weakening of the bond note against the united states dollar that has seen retailers adjusting prices in line with the parallel market rate the central bank created a huge stock of electronic money issued treasury bills and other instruments clocked up massive domestic and foreign debt and ran a current account deficit resulting in the weakening of the bond note in light of rising costs banks felt they could cushion themselves by addressing income lines in the volatile economic environment although bankers association of zimbabwe baz president webster rusere denied that banks had requested an interest rate increase and a hike in charges highly placed sources in the banking sector maintain a request was indeed made the rbz s position is that it was not advisable for banks to hike charges and interest rates the rbz was of the view that inflation would be kept under control the idea was to keep interest rates and charges at current levels although the position is subject to review a senior banker told the independent this week while the proposal was not approved bankers insisted that they would continue to lobby the central bank to increase bank charges the sources added another banker said obviously it will put pressure on the banks interest rates have to go up there is a bit of a squeeze remember banks are holding on to treasury bills which are fixed income instruments so banks have to take losses banks are hoping the rbz will review its position on the interest rates cap and bank charges generally charges and rates are capped yet inflation is going up so it is going to be a challenge for most banks to remain profitable we therefore implore the central government to look into a possible review in the upcoming monetary policy statement the banker said central bank chief john mangudya said he had not received any formal proposal from the banks we have not seen any form of proposal from the banks i would welcome any bank which wrote to us to present that proposal mangudya told the independent yesterday

now turn the call over to our president and chief investment officer dallas tanner dallas b tanner president and chief executive officer director thank you greg we are excited to report a strong finish to 2018 and favorable momentum into 2019 our location scale and platform continued to create a best in class experience for our residents evidenced by our industry leading resident turnover rates blended rent growth as accelerated for each of the past three months to level significantly higher than last year and solid occupancy positions us well to continue capturing acceleration in the 2019 peak leasing season we are also driving better efficiency on the r m side of our business which resulted in fourth quarter performance that exceeded our guidance our strong finish to the year brought core ffo per share growth for the full year 2018 to 14 before discussing what this momentum may translate to in 2019 i want to take a moment to review our performance on the 2018 operational priorities that we communicated to you at the beginning of the year our first objective was to deliver strong consistent operational results across our core portfolio we met our expectations for the top line with 4 5 same store core revenue growth which outpaced residential peers however we can execute better on the expense side of the business after identifying opportunities to be more efficient with repairs and maintenance last summer our teams have done a great job of starting to capture some of these opportunities we have more work to do but are pleased with how our performance improved in the second half of 2018 our next objective was to further enhance the quality of service we provide to our residents the ultimate scorecard on service comes when it is time for residents to make a renewal decision and we are thrilled that our turnover rate on a trailing 12 month basis improved each quarter in 2018 to new all time lows our third operational priority was to execute on our integration plan in addition to finding an incremental 5 million of projected and state synergies we also beat expectations for 2018 achievement by capturing 46 million of annualized run rate synergies in the year with respect to investments our priority was to continue increasing the quality of our portfolio by recycling capital in total in 2018 we sold roughly 500 million of primarily lower rent band homes that no longer fit our long term strategy we recycled capital from dispositions in both the purchase of almost 300 million of homes in more attractive sub markets with higher expected total returns and prepayments of debt finally we made progress on our path to an investment grade balance sheet we reduced net debt to adjusted ebitda to below 9 times compared to approximately 11 times at our ipo in early 2017 we also improved our weighted average maturity and cost of debt looking ahead to 2019 we are excited about our opportunity for growth let me address these three opportunities in particular revenue growth expense controls and capital allocation with respect to revenue growth fundamentals are strong as they ve ever been for single family rental in our markets household formation in 2019 are forecasted to grow at almost 2 or 90 greater than the us average construction of new single family homes is not keeping pace with this demand and has recently slowed further in addition affordability has become a bigger challenge for potential home buyers due to a combination of home price appreciation and higher mortgage rates compared to last year we are seeing this play out in our portfolio today with same store move outs to home ownership down 17 year over year in 2018 inaudible economist john burns estimates that the cost to run a single family home is lower than the cost to own a comparable home in 15 of our 17 markets today by an average discount of 16 we believe our product provides an attractive solution for customers who want to live in a high quality single family home without making the financial commitment of homeownership furthermore we believe the location of our homes in attractive neighborhoods close to jobs and great schools and high touch service we provide differentiate invitation homes and make the choice lease with us even more compelling regardless of what the broader economy may bring in the coming years we feel that our business is well positioned even if we were to experience a cooling of the economy our portfolio could continue to benefit from demographics that are shifting more and more in our favor and from a sticky single family resident base that would likely find homeownership incrementally less attractive under more challenging economic conditions we are also excited about our opportunity on the expense side of the business and are focused in 2019 on adding to the progress we made in the second half of 2018 newly implemented changes to our repairs and maintenance workflow and route optimization systems are paying dividends already but we still have plenty of opportunity to be more efficient we also believe the integration of our field teams and property management platform in 2019 will be a positive catalyst for expense improvement if one team operating on one platform we will be better positioned to find new ways to refine our business and take resident service to higher levels with respect to capital allocation our plan in 2019 remains focused on the dual objective of refining our portfolio and reducing leverage on our balance sheet the markets we re in remain healthy providing compelling opportunities on both the acquisition and disposition sides for us to achieve our capital recycling goals abundant capital from potential buyers and limited inventory in our markets create an attractive opportunity for us to prune our portfolio we also have multiple uses for these proceeds including buying homes in more attractive submarkets reinvesting in our portfolio through value enhancing capex and prepaying down debt before we move on i want to say a few quick words about our team it is a thrill to have the opportunity to lead the company i founded with my partners a company that is full of talented people from top to bottom i m fortunate to be stepping into the ceo role at the company in an outstanding place thanks in part to the leadership of fred tuomi fred helped guide invitation homes through what has been a very successful merger and integration has positioned us to move forward better than we ve ever been before we thank fred for his leadership and wish him the absolute best moving forward we will continue to stay true to our dna and the strategic path we ve been on since day one we will put residents first we will drive organic growth and an outstanding living experience by leveraging our competitive advantage of location scale and high touch service we will be opportunistic with respect to external growth we ll progress toward an investment grade balance sheet and we will do all of this with the best team in the business i am fortunate to be surrounded by true experts and industry pioneers on our field and corporate teams as well as in our boardroom to all of our associates thank you for a great finish to 2018 and let s continue to build on our momentum in 2019 with that i ll turn it over to charles young our chief operating officer to provide more detail on our fourth quarter operating results charles d young executive vice president and chief operating officer thank you as dallas said the fourth quarter of 2018 was a great one for us operationally our teams did a fantastic job capturing rent growth and occupancy to put us in a strong position going into 2019 drove better r m efficiency resulting in out performance of our guidance in the fourth quarter and most importantly we continue to provide outstanding resident service i ll now walk you through our fourth quarter operating results in more detail same store core revenues in the fourth quarter grew 4 6 year over year this increase was driven by average monthly rental rate growth of 3 8 and a 70 basis point increase in average occupancy to 96 for the quarter same store core expense growth in the fourth quarter was better than expected core controllable costs were down slightly year over year even with the tough r m comparison versus the fourth quarter of 2017 due to that year s hurricanes property taxes increased 15 1 year over year in line with our expectation expectations due to the timing items discussed on last quarter s call as a result overall same store expense growth was 7 4 year over year this brought our fourth quarter 2018 same store noi growth of 3 2 for the full year 2018 same store noi growth was 4 4 to 65 basis points ahead of the midpoint of guidance provided on our last earnings call importantly we have made steady progress on improving our r m efficiency by implementing numerous changes to systems and processes after opportunities for improvement were identified with these changes we have improved how work orders are allocated between in house technicians and third parties our corresponding service trips are scheduled and the routes the technicians follow to optimize their time in the fourth quarter we also rolled out an important update to our technology platform that enabled all of our internal technicians to perform work on any home in our portfolio not just the homes associated with the legacy organization this made a material difference in the productivity of our maintenance technicians in the fourth quarter we still have work to do though and we ll continue implementing process improvements and procare enhancements in the months leading up to 2019 peak service season next i ll provide an update on integration of our field teams after successful results in the testing phase we began market implementation of our unified operating platform in november as of today we have teams in five markets representing almost 40 of our homes functioning under our go forward structure and platform transitions have been smooth and feedback from the field teams have been extremely positive we plan to roll out the platform to our remaining markets in waves over the next several months this rollout is expected to unlock the remainder of the 50 million to 55 million of total run rate synergies we have guided to by mid 2019 as of year end 2018 our run rate synergy achievement was 46 million next i ll cover leasing trends in the fourth quarter of 2018 and january 2019 fundamentals in our markets remain as strong as ever and we are executing well both renewal rent growth and new lease rent growth have increased sequentially in each of the last three months renewals averaged 4 7 in the fourth quarter of 2018 and new leases averaged 2 1 notably new lease rent growth is now exceeding prior year levels and with a full 70 basis points ahead of last year in the fourth quarter of 2018 this resulted in blended rent growth of 3 7 in the fourth quarter of 2018 up 20 basis points year over year same time resident turnover continue to decrease driving occupancy to 96 in the fourth quarter of 2018 up 70 basis points year over year each of these leasing metrics improved further in january lender rent growth averaged 4 3 in january 2019 up 90 basis points year over year and occupancy averaged 96 2 in january 2019 also up 90 basis points year over year the fundamental tailwinds at our back and occupancy in a strong position we are confident as we start a new year our field teams are focused on execution and are excited to leverage our integrated platform to deliver even more efficient resident service with that i ll turn the call over to our chief financial officer ernie freedman ernest m freedman executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you charles today i will cover the following topics balance sheet and capital markets activity financial results for the fourth quarter and 2019 guidance first i ll cover the balance sheet and capital markets activity where we had a very active and successful year let me start with a few highlights about where we started 2018 versus where we ended it net debt 9 1 billion to start the year 8 8 billion to end the year net debt to ebitda 9 5 times to start the year 8 8 times to end the year pro forma in the conversion of our 2019 convertible notes weighted average years to maturity 4 1 to start the year 5 5 to end the year unencumbered homes 42 of homes to start the year 48 to end the year in weighted average interest rate 3 4 to start the year 3 3 to end the year in a rising rate environment we accomplished all of this by prioritizing free cash flow in bulk disposition proceeds for debt prepayment and by refinancing debt in 2018 with 4 2 billion of proceeds from our four new securitizations while we remain opportunistic we anticipate less refinancing activity in 2019 with no secured debt maturing in 2019 or 2020 and only 373 million maturing in 2021 however we will continue to prioritize debt prepayments as part of our efforts to pursue an investment grade rating and have made incremental progress already with the pre payment of 70 million of secured debt in january we will continue our deleveraging strategy by electing to settle conversions of our 230 million of 2019 convertible notes in common shares we view this decision as a way to reduce net debt to ebitda by approximately 0 25 turns while incurring minimal incremental dilution to core ffo per share our liquidity at quarter end was over 1 1 billion through a combination of unrestricted cash and undrawn capacity on our credit facility i ll now cover our fourth quarter 2018 financial results core ffo and affo per share for the fourth quarter increased year over year to 0 30 and 0 25 respectively primary drivers of the increases were growth in noi and lower cash interest expense per share for the full year 2018 core ffo and affo per share increased 13 7 and 8 1 respectively as a result of our anticipated growth in affo per share in 2019 we have increased our quarterly dividend to 0 13 from 0 11 per share we continue to target a low dividend payout ratio as we believe a beneficial use of cash is to further pay down debt the last thing i will cover is 2019 guidance as dallas and charles discussed we believe that we continue to have strong fundamental tailwinds at our back and entered the year from a strong occupancy position with accelerating rate growth as such we expect to grow same store revenue by 3 8 to 4 4 in 2019 home price appreciation in our markets over the last year or two suggest that growth in real estate taxes in 2019 is likely to remain elevated albeit lower than the growth we saw in 2018 as a result we expect overall same store core expense growth to moderate from 2018 levels to 3 5 to 4 5 in 2019 core controllable expenses are likely to grow less than that as we believe we have positioned ourselves to better control r m cost in 2019 but we still have work to do this brings our expectation for same store noi growth to 3 5 to 4 5 full year 2019 core ffo per share is expected to be 1 20 to 1 28 and affo per share is expected to be 0 98 to 1 6 representing year over year increases of greater than 5 and 7 at the mid points respectively primary driver of these expected increases is growth in same store noi lower property management and g a expenses and lower interest expense are also expected to contribute to growth a detailed bridge of our 2018 core ffo per share to the midpoint of 2019 core ffo per share guidance can be found in our earnings release there are a handful of items likely to impact the progression of same store growth in core ffo and affo growth from a timing perspective over the course of the year with respect to revenue growth occupancy comps are easier at the start of the year versus later regarding expenses core expense growth is likely to be highest in the first quarter first while we have made great progress addressing items related to our integrated r m system that drove inefficiency in 2018 we still have work to complete as part of our plan we do not expect to be fully optimized in the first quarter of 2019 second as we discussed last year other income and resident recoveries in the first quarter of 2018 were higher than normal as a result of post merger alignment of the resident utility bill back timing across the two legacy companies this will create a more difficult comparison for core expense growth in the first quarter of 2019 these two items are expected to more than offset the favorable impact of comping against a period in the first quarter of 2018 with higher than normal work order volume as a result of 2017 hurricanes also regarding expenses the year over year increase in real estate taxes is likely to be materially lower in the fourth quarter of 2019 then in the first three quarters of the year as discussed previously we booked an unfavorable real estate tax catch up in the fourth quarter of 2018 for tax assessments that came in higher than expected this creates an easier comp for the fourth quarter of 2019 finally the 2019 convertible notes are expected to convert to common shares on july 1 2019 this will impact the interest expense and share count used to calculate core ffo and affo per share by treating the notes as debt for the first half of 2019 and as equity for the second half of 2019 assuming that the notes converted as expected i ll wrap up by reiterating how much we are looking forward to 2019 fundamentals are in our favor and we have multiple levers we believe we can pull to create value we are excited to move on to one platform across the entire organization and to execute on that platform to deliver outstanding results to both our residents and our shareholders with that operator would you please open up the line for questions questions and answers operator thank you mr freedman we will now begin the question and answer session operator instructions the first question will come from nick joseph of citi please go ahead nick joseph citi analyst thanks as you roll out the unified operating platform across the portfolio what lessons have you learned from the process are you making any adjustments for the other markets based on them charles d young executive vice president and chief operating officer yeah this is charles we ve made really good progress in implementing the combined portfolio roll out as i said in my remarks we ve implemented in about five markets which equals about 40 of our total homes we ve been really thoughtful based on what we learned in 2018 that we ve taken really measured pace and how we roll it out we expect to be done around mid 2019 we ve made a decision to implement in the slower time of the year which is working in our favor and we are careful also around the timing in which we roll it out during the month to make sure that we re not impacting the field teams we went through multiple rounds of testing to make sure that things were working as expected before we went we have great training we ve learned from each of the rollouts to get better in our training and implementation has been great the feedback from our field teams have been very positive and as i said we expect that we ll be there by mid year bottom line is the teams are really excited to get on one combined platform because they were working in multiple systems before so that we see this as a really positive thing nick joseph citi analyst thanks then dallas congratulations on the promotion when you took over as interim president in august the board formed a special committee to work with you and the team during fred s absence is that committee is still in place and what s the board s role today dallas b tanner president and chief executive officer director yeah hi thanks for the question excuse me the complement yeah the board is still functioning in a similar fashion as we were and that executive committee will stay in place through 2019 as you guys know we have a very supportive board with a ton of excellent experience behind it so we ll continue to use that it s been strategic for us as we ve vetted out some of these things that charles just discussed in terms of how we would integrate going forward and we thought through some of the processes so they ve been very supportive in that capacity and we would anticipate them to continue doing so nick joseph citi analyst thanks operator the next question will be from drew babin of baird please go ahead drew babin robert w baird analyst hey good morning as it pertains to the ffo guidance i m also thinking if you could talk about the direction of recurring capex per home in 19 understanding that 18 would be the starwood waypoint merger there might have been a little bit of noise there can you just give us a little more color on the trends in that number as well as how you think about our revenue enhancing capex this year ernest m freedman executive vice president and chief financial officer sure drew this is ernie with regard specifically to our recurring capex we expect overall net cost to maintain which is both our operating expenses associated with repairs and maintenance as well as turnover as well as the capital associated with that that would be our recurring capex and that s going to be up approximately about 3 year over year we definitely have some easier comps to go up against in and we certainly had some improvements but as we talked about in the prepared remarks we re not fully optimized today and of course we want to be cautious before we get into peak leasing season before getting too far ahead of ourselves where think we end up or where we sit today and where we re at with the progress we made we feel like we re back to a more normal type growth rate with the opportunity maybe do better as we go forward so i would expect plus or minus in the 3 range for net cost to maintain to grow drew remind me what the second part of your question was drew babin robert w baird analyst it s revenue enhancing capex whether we can expect any kind of directional change from last year there dallas b tanner president and chief executive officer director hey drew this is dallas i ll answer this we continue to expect our focus to continue to find ways to optimize these assets on a like for like basis as they turn now some of that allows us these opportunities with revenue enhancing capex i would expect that program to continue to develop if not maybe be a little bit more active as we spread in some of our west coast markets we certainly see a number of different opportunities outside of just the smart home functionality with which we re continually adding into the portfolio today we re finding that our customers they are sticky by nature but what s been really interesting over the past year as we ve piloted revenue enhancing capex and gotten better at how we implement that process is how many times our customers on a renewal on a new lease want to actually pay up to optimize parts or sections of their house this is a win for both us and the customer because we re able to harden the asset in theory and also get a better risk adjusted return on the revenue increase and that s outside of the way we would normally underwriter property so expect us to do more of it we re looking in getting smarter charles and team have done a terrific job on the procurement side to find ways that we can continually enhance that experience for the customer drew babin robert w baird analyst thank you that s helpful and then i m lastly just on the guidance expectations non cash interest and share based comp i have hopping you could kind of give us those numbers i m just given the accounting kind of how those play into the core ffo calculation charles d young executive vice president and chief operating officer yeah drew we have not provided guidance for those in the past and so let me think about we can doing and get something out there for folks to help with modeling but don t have anything i can share with that with you today drew babin robert w baird analyst okay we can follow up on that that is all from me thank you operator then the next question will be from douglas harter of credit suisse please go ahead douglas harter credit suisse analyst i was hoping you could talk about where you are in the process of optimizing the portfolio and kind of how you think about the home count as we move through 2019 dallas b tanner president and chief executive officer director yeah hi doug this is dallas we ve been pretty vocal about our desire to continually refine and optimize the portfolio the nice thing about the merger is we ve had enough time and distance we knew there were some homes initially both with which we wanted to sell and also some areas where you wanted to scale up and could find and drive greater efficiencies in the portfolio by acquiring expect us to do more of the same we had a pretty busy year in terms of what we were selling and it comes in a variety of shapes and sizes to why we sold we certainly were active in parts of florida where we now on a combined basis had over 25 000 homes post merger expect us to continually look for areas like that where we can continue to refine the portfolio create efficiencies for the operating teams and build on the scale and density that we have in those markets in addition we also have outlier locations or geographies where we ll at times or seasons look for ways to refine and improve the way that those parts of the portfolio is behaving and lastly i d just add there are occasions and we re starting to see this a little bit in some of our west coast properties where if a home just becomes too valuable and ultimately we think it s better suited for an end user we ll sell that home and take those gains and recycle capital in the parts of markets where we see still significant opportunities for good risk adjusted return douglas harter credit suisse analyst just following up on that what are the markets where you see the best opportunities to kind of recycle capital into dallas b tanner president and chief executive officer director well funny enough we were pretty active in 2018 in still lot of west coast markets we ve been pretty vocal about the fact that we love seattle we love the growth that s going on there it s evidenced in some of the new lease and renewal rates that we re seeing in the business today we also still are finding really good opportunities in the southeast and if we could we would buy more in california and markets if those opportunities were available to us we just see limited supply in today s environment as we ve stated household formation in our markets today it s almost two times than the national average and we re feeling that in the parts of our business specifically around new lease growth and renewals but generally speaking you ve seen that we ve been getting out of parts of the midwest over time and we ve continued to recycle coastal where the majority of our footprints are today douglas harter credit suisse analyst great thank you dallas operator the next question will be from shirley wu of bank of america merrill lynch please go ahead shirley wu bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi guys thanks for taking the question so in your expense guidance of 4 do you think you could break out like different markets in terms of growth or personnel or r m for 19 dallas b tanner president and chief executive officer director yes really we were comfortable providing today is because taxes are almost half of our expense number i can provide some guidance around what we think would happen with taxes and what s going to happen for everything else which is a greater inaudible other half i think as everyone knows home price appreciation continues to be pretty strong in our markets and it is run over 6 across the board on a weighted average basis across our markets and with that and we do expect that property taxes in 2019 will be up somewhere in the fives for us and of course prop 13 in california helps mute that a little bit for us with having 20 of our portfolio in california so the real estate taxes being up we think somewhere in the fives we think everything else will be less than 3 to get to our at the midpoint to get to our guidance range of 3 5 to 4 5 and as the year plays out is different things we ll see some things flow through on those other expense items but from a guidance perspective we re comfortable providing guidance in that way shirley shirley wu bank of america merrill lynch analyst that s helpful so recently mortgage rates have really pulled back especially in the last couple of months but your move outs to home buying has still have continued to shutdown is that something that you concerned about or moving forward how do you think about that dallas b tanner president and chief executive officer director well we are certainly not concerned about it because it s been fairly consistent over the past couple of years less than 10 of our overall portfolio on an annual basis moves out of our business to go buy a home at least that s what we ve seen over the first few years as a public company we look at it a couple of ways i mentioned it in my earlier comments we are seeing a real shift in terms of affordability to your point and we re picking up some of the net benefit of that quite frankly in our business today as we mentioned before 15 markets of our 17 markets based on the research that we look at and follow are now more affordable to lease call in an entry level product than it is to buy in today s environment so we think interest rates there actually maybe push people into a longer term lease with us or maybe offer an opportunity for consideration to choose the leasing lifestyle and there are some markets to your point that are a bit more dislocated i mean in seattle washington for example that differential can be as high as 30 and so we look at that as also an opportunity to make sure that we re providing a best in class service and an experience the people are willing to pay for we look at that as an opportunity shirley wu bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it thanks for the color guys operator the next question will be from derek johnston of deutsche bank please go ahead derek johnston deutsche bank ag analyst hi everybody can you discuss how turn times trended in 4q and where you d like to see them in 2019 and really if the new r m platform drives any benefit there charles d young executive vice president and chief operating officer yes so this charles turn times have been kind of mid teens for us and we d like to bring that down again we ve been consolidating the teams the offices and the platforms as we get all into one platform as we talked about and finalize that integration at the first half of the year here i think we ll be in a much better shape to bring those times down as we think around turn it really is the kind of quality and location of our homes and we make sure that we are delivering a high quality product that delivery of product will relate to the r m in terms of any work orders that may come afterwards part of what we want to implement in 2018 that s important is our procare service and that s a follow on after the turn when the resident moves in to make sure that they understand their responsibility but also we bundle some of those work orders to a 45 day visit that will allow us to kind of manage that process with the resident on r m side so that s where the overlap and the transition happens but ultimately they are two separate portions of the business and as i said we d like to bring those turn times down and we expect that we ll start getting into the low teens as we get consolidated derek johnston deutsche bank ag analyst great and last one for me how many customers are now subscribed to the smart technology and what other ancillary income drivers have you guys identified charles d young executive vice president and chief operating officer yes so right now we have about a third of our homes have the smart home installed so a little over 30 000 about half of those are paying customers and that builds every time that we move a resident in 70 to 80 of those residents are opting into the service which is great adoption rate in terms of other ancillary with integration we ve really been focusing on finalizing that but once we get through the integration we see there s opportunities whether it s in moving services or pet services pest control items that we can think around filters there are a number of items that we want to attack but right now we re focused in on making sure that we finalize the integration derek johnston deutsche bank ag analyst good stuff thanks operator the next question will be from richard hill of morgan stanley please go ahead richard hill morgan stanley analyst hey guys wanted to just ask a maybe a couple of questions about how you think about 2019 where you didn t give guidance you had some success with bulk sales so dallas i m wondering if you can give us any sort of color around those bulk sales cap rates breadth of buyers and then do you think that s going to continue in 2019 how are we supposed to think about that going forward dallas b tanner president and chief executive officer director sure thanks rich a number of things as i mentioned earlier in my comments we still see a quite a bit of demand in the marketplace for stabilized product being sold from an institutional operator like ourselves so i would expect that we ll still explore some bulk opportunities this year and really quite frankly any year where our scale and density allow us to facilitate those types of transactions in terms of what we did in 2018 we sold homes on average that were much cheaper than the homes that we are acquiring i think if you look at the fourth quarter as an example the 1600 plus homes we sold in q4 we had call it an average price per home around 175 000 we re recycling that money into homes that were well north of 300 000 on a per property basis so as you think about what those cap rates are you would certainly when you re selling cheaper product generally on a pro forma basis you re going to see cap rates that are a little bit higher just because your denominator being so low in terms of your asset price pricing and so we sold over the majority of 18 were homes that were closer to 6 cap and recycling the homes that were well within the mid fives now that doesn t tell you the whole story as you think about the way we ve recycled in terms of what we bought and what we sold on average we re buying homes that were renting for about 500 more or less more than the homes that we were selling so that additional 6 000 in revenue is a really smart way to operate on the long term when you think about all the incremental costs that can go into this business richard hill morgan stanley analyst that s great detail hey guys you guys put up a really impressive margin number this quarter so how are we thinking about that sort of near term and long term so i guess the question is that 65 plus margin is that sustainable near term and do you think you can still get that into the high 60s i m going to push it 70 area what are you thinking about there ernest m freedman executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah rich i think the answer is it really all depends on how things move forward with some capital allocation and other things as we recall as you know fourth quarter first quarter typically are our highest margin quarters but for the entire year of 2018 and here we certainly had some challenges we put up 64 5 margin whatever we re pleased to do with the challenges that we had and as we continue to refine the portfolio from a capital allocation perspective and importantly as charles continues to refine when he s doing an operating standpoint and our guidance implies that the margins will be pretty similar from 2018 to 2019 based on what we put out there for a midpoint of revenue expense and noi guidance we think there s opportunity for that to continue to increase to somewhere certainly in the higher 60s we do have i think half a dozen markets today that are in the 70s and certainly as dallas looks to do some things on the capital allocation especially that the homes are selling out of in some of the markets where it had been disproportionately selling those markets do have lower margins so you could certainly see you could for force a way to a 70 type margin but i think for where we are at we want to have our homes in the portfolio i think increasing it by a few 100 basis points from where it is now into the higher 60s is certainly a very achievable goal over the next period of time richard hill morgan stanley analyst great thank you just one final question dallas going back to your prepared remarks on affordability when you think about affordability are you sort of doing an apples to apples rent to mortgage payment or do you guys think about affordability relative to the cost of owning a home differently dallas b tanner president and chief executive officer director yeah i think we like to look at it a couple different ways i think the way to really look at it and so that you keep everything constant as you got to think about housing costs as not only your mortgage but also some ongoing maintenance expense that a normal homeowner would incur or ordinary course and that s the way burns and a number of other economists tend to look at it we ve looked at a couple of different pieces we ve done some of our own research obviously with the data we have and you re certainly seeing that dislocation we talked about earlier now there is time and seasons where that s your fred ph and there are time and season where maybe it isn t but right now it certainly feels like we re positioned to capture some of that affordability demand that people are looking for some relief specifically in the west coast where we re seeing rising home prices as well as the rising rate environment not helping the homeownership story richard hill morgan stanley analyst perfect thanks guys that s it dallas b tanner president and chief executive officer director thanks richard operator the next question will be from jason green of evercore please go ahead jason green evercore analyst good morning on the deceleration in same store revenue growth that your guidance implies is that kind of due to conservatism on occupancy slowing rent growth or a combination of the two ernest m freedman executive vice president and chief financial officer yes if you look on page 23 of our earnings release i think that will help guide what happen at 2018 i can give you a sense what we think is going to happen with regards to 2019 you see in 2018 our revenue growth of 4 5 was made up of 3 9 rental rate growth 50 bps increase in occupancy and in other income was a little bit better than those and so that s how you get to a 4 5 to get to the midpoint of our 4 1 revenue growth we think would have similar rental type growth maybe a tick lower than at the midpoint but very similar as you recall we have accelerating rent growth here starting in the fourth quarter of 18 and we saw that in january as charles talked about but for the first three quarters of 2018 it was a deceleration year over year so we need to earn that in and then on occupancy growth we do expect occupancy to be better than it was in 2019 versus 2018 but not necessarily 50 bps better now that said charles is off to really good start in january up 90 basis points and we are off to a good start on rental rate as well and so when you factor that in that s why we don t think we could get to 4 5 with regards to our the midpoint of our guidance but certainly pass for us to do better than that certainly seen how well we started off the year with january jason green evercore analyst got it and then the synergies that you guys had mentioned from the merger are those factored in the same store guidance or those represent additional upside ernest m freedman executive vice president and chief financial officer no those are factored into our guidance and so about 90 of the synergies that hit the field hit same store the rest of the total portfolio about 90 of our homes in same store so those are factored in so in regards to gain to numbers we expect to from an expense perspective it s taking into account synergies that we earned in 2018 as well as we anticipate the timing on those synergies and to be clear that those synergies aren t going to be earned on january 1st and as charles talked it s going to be until mid year and we got the whole portfolio ruled out and as we do that it s about 60 days after that where we get to that final numbers and we want to have some overlap period to make sure things are working right in the field and so those take a little while to earn here in 2019 but that s all factored into our guidance jason green evercore analyst got it and then last one from me total cost to maintain came in for the year at about 3 200 per home you re talking about that increasing potentially around 3 in 19 previously you d said the long term rate is probably somewhere between 2 600 and 2 800 so i guess first is that still the long term rate that you guys feel will be necessary for a total cost to maintain homes and then how long is it going to take for you guys to get there ernest m freedman executive vice president and chief financial officer and so we came in i think close to 3 100 and 3 200 i think it s 3 109 for the year but notwithstanding we first came out with our ipo way back a couple of years ago we did say adjusting for inflation we expect to be at 2 600 to 2 800 so those numbers are going to move on us those guidepost ph if there is inflation in the rm world and we ve actually seen probably more inflation in that than in other areas just on what s been going on with broader products and services that we always need to reset that that said we re not quite where we think we re going to be in getting back on that track and as we further optimize and get things rolled out on the r m side and we ve talked about in the prepared remarks we had a good fourth quarter it came in stronger than we thought and we re excited about that with regards to what would have with r m to bring us down to that 3 100 number that we came in for the year we are going to be cautious as we come out this year to make sure things are going as we expect and move forward i think once we re fully optimized everyone is working on the same platform that s when we have the real opportunity to get back to numbers that were more like where we thought we would end up with regards to the longer term growing for inflation where we thought cost to maintain would be jason green evercore analyst got it thank you ernest m freedman executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks operator the next question will be from jade rahmani of kbw please go ahead jade rahmani keefe bruyette woods inc analyst thanks very much are you seeing a pickup in interest from home builders in partnering with you dallas b tanner president and chief executive officer director hi jade it s dallas it s interesting we ve certainly had a number of discussions around opportunities and we re looking at a couple of different things as i ve mentioned before we ve really are channel agnostic and we just want to make sure that we re focused on the right locations so we re interested we like the fact that i think home builders are getting more and more comfortable with the idea of single family owners being in their neighborhoods and buying product i certainly could see it becoming more and more of an opportunity for us going forward i don t think we have to take on any of that development risk ourselves i mean we ve been pretty clear about that but we certainly want to look for strategic partners that we can then be potential buyer for we think that there is definitely opportunity for us there to grow jade rahmani keefe bruyette woods inc analyst and what s your view toward master plan communities that feature apartments and stand alone single family rental communities with high amenities targeted toward millennials dallas b tanner president and chief executive officer director well it s an interesting concept that continues to evolve we certainly know some of the operators and the owners that are building that product today i think it s kind of a shift quite frankly i think it plays into some of the same demographics that we ve been talking about there is the 65 million person core between the ages of 20 and 35 that are coming our way that want quality of choice it s no different than the business we run today i think where you got to be careful though jade in some of those opportunities is you got to still stay location specific in terms of where you want to invest capital that s a it s a small boutique opportunity in an infill location with really good rents and that the square footages are similar to what we would normally own it would be something we look at what i ve seen across a broad spectrum of some of that product is it s typically been much smaller footprints between 800 and 1300 square feet and that s not really our sweet spot more or less but if we saw an opportunity it was infill that made sense we d certainly want to look at it and we re encouraged by the fact that people are recognizing that leasing is a real choice right now for people jade rahmani keefe bruyette woods inc analyst and just on the influence of eye buyers on the market are you competing directly with them with respect to acquisitions are they distorting pricing or impacting the market in any way and is there a potential opportunity to enter into joint ventures to provide centralized property management services since they are active in many of your markets dallas b tanner president and chief executive officer director let me answer kind of those in part i think you re thinking about the world the right way jade in terms of being an entrepreneur this is an interesting moment in time with these eye buyers it certainly feels like there s a new company popping up every day who knows what will actually stick or last or who will be the king pins in the long term this is public record we ve been supportive of companies like opendoor and offer inaudible that are out there making the home buying and selling experience much easier for the customer now 5 5 million transactions in the us occur every year so you should think about that i mean there s plenty of space for both brokers eye buyers and individual investors to be buying and selling homes in the us we certainly want to look for strategic partners that we can partner with to help grow our footprint in our portfolio we get the question a lot about would you want to do third party management you could certainly see a day where that could be interesting but now for us it s just not really our focus our focus is on growing our own footprint we see plenty of opportunity within our own book of business but we can continue to grow the invitation homes product along with the invitation homes fit and finish standards as well as the service levels that our customers are wanting to expect so it s not in our near term horizon by any stretch jade rahmani keefe bruyette woods inc analyst thanks so much douglas harter credit suisse analyst thanks jade operator your next question will be from wes golladay of rbc capital markets please go ahead wes golladay rbc capital markets analyst hey good morning guys i can appreciate that there s a lot of moving parts last year on the expense side volatility to the upside and the downside but this year you have a 1 range on your same store expenses should we take that as a sense that all the moving parts are behind us that would be more of a normal environment this year charles d young executive vice president and chief operating officer yea wes we certainly think so we want to be cautious and you want to set a range that we thought was appropriate at the end of the day if you feel lot better sitting today with the lessons learned over the last 12 months you recall last year at this time where we provided guidance the merger just closed about 60 days ahead of that and actually closed ahead of schedule we all thought they would actually close early january but fortunately we re able to get done quicker we re bringing two companies together we run on the same platform we re learning how each of the companies were doing things and in hindsight we got a lot of things right but a couple of things we didn t unfortunately and that caused some noise we definitely feel much more confident but again we re not 100 of the way there as we talked about a couple other things but we re certainly so much further along so we are feeling better for sure than we were last year certainly as the year progressed wes golladay rbc capital markets analyst okay and then you made the comment about the r m being a little bit lower from the leasing from early last year but looking at this year what are your expectations for blended rent growth for each of the quarters and not by quarter but just in general do you expect to continue to modestly accelerate throughout the year based on the supply and demand you re seeing charles d young executive vice president and chief operating officer yeah we want to be careful with that i did mention in the prepared remarks inaudible comp does get harder throughout the year so we ll make sure people realize that that means you re likely to see higher revenue growth earlier in the year because we won t have an easy and inaudible comp later in the year we ll have to see how it plays out it s january it s early in the year we make our hay starting in mid march that s kind of when peak season starts for us and goes through end july or early august so certainly when we re talking to you guys in about 90 days about first quarter results we ll have a much better feel for whether we seeing that acceleration continue at the pace it did in january or not wes golladay rbc capital markets analyst okay that s all from me thanks for taking the questions ernest m freedman executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks operator the next question will be from hardik goel of zelman associates please go ahead hardik goel zelman associates analyst hey guys thanks for taking my question as i look across the guidance range my first question is would you consider the low end of guidance to be as likely as the high end of guidance and as a follow up to that what are the components of guidance that you look to as being drivers of potential downside to guidance the midpoint and drivers of potential upside as well ernest m freedman executive vice president and chief financial officer sure hardik i think by definition we think it s equally likely whereas we put out our guidance at the low side could be hit as well as the high side we re certainly optimistic that we think we can do better but that s the point of the range is we think that they re kind of equal weighted but we are certainly are excited about how january came out and we ll do our best to get more toward the high end of those ranges in terms of looking to influence our ability to have upside to that or not again peak leasing season on the revenue side will be the key and we re real pleased with how january came out for sure and so i think that s going to be little swing us in terms of rental rate achievement and then we are always rate focused first but we ve been successful especially with lower turnover we thought the lowest we d be ever seen as we looked at the fourth quarter that certainly helped on the occupancy side on the expense side i think it s probably the obvious it s just we know that we had some struggles last year with repairs and maintenance and that cost to maintain we re feeling better about it than we have but we re not 100 there in terms of having everything optimized running and the proof will be in the pudding just like it is on the revenue side for peak leasing season will become the summer time when we hit that the majority of our quarters have to do around the hvac season we ll be better prepared for that this year by leaps and bounds than we were last year but i think that will be the true test for us on the expense side as we get into peak or quarter season how are we doing are the teams optimized or is everything working the way we expect to we re pleased with the path we re on right now and by midway through the year come that august call late july august call we ll have a pretty good sense i think of how the year is playing out on the expense side hardik goel zelman associates analyst thanks and just one quick one if you ll indulge me the move outs to buy where there a big driver of turnover being lower do you see them trend lower year over year or what was the trend there ernest m freedman executive vice president and chief financial officer year over year they trended slightly lower they ve actually been a little bit more lower in the previous quarters and for the year they were definitely lower so i think it s just i think it s more broadly that people are pleased with the service that they re getting and our stand a little bit longer fourth quarter there is not much activity as you know hardik so it s draw a lot of conclusions from fourth quarter but we did see it low quarter over quarter like we did every other quarter this year and so that certainly did help with the turnover number hardik goel zelman associates analyst thanks ernie operator the next question will be from alan wai of goldman sachs please go ahead alan wai goldman sachs analyst good morning i had a question on g a is your 4q number a good run rate how should we think about incremental synergy savings realized mid quarters as well as potential seasonality ernest m freedman executive vice president and chief financial officer sure so we provided a walk in our earnings release that showed how you get from where we ended up for 2018 for core ffo and into the midpoint of our guidance for 2019 within that what we did call out the fact that both property management expense and g a combined we expect to be about a 0 01 better it s not quite 0 01 around it s up to a 0 01 and so we are into a little bit better more so in g a than in property management expense but both numbers should be down a year over year from where they were in 2018 and that s mainly from the earnings of the synergies that s still to go as well as the ones that happened in 2018 and there s not much to go still on the g a and pma numbers so it s not mainly in the earnings from 2018 but then understand there is some cost inflation baked into there too cost don t remain static in terms of what s happening with compensation costs for the organization and other costs and so you have a synergy good guy that more than offset inflationary increase in those costs for 2019 alan wai goldman sachs analyst that s helpful i was wondering in terms of seasonality and g a how should i think of that ernest m freedman executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah there s really not a lot of seasonality in g a that should be unless we are the only thing that potential to that would be our run on bonus accruals we try to do a good job throughout the year anticipating where those will come out so you should see that be pretty steady each quarter throughout the year alan wai goldman sachs analyst thank you very much operator the next question will be from john pawlowski of green street advisors please go ahead john pawlowski green street advisors analyst thanks dallas or ernie could you provide the acquisition and disposition volume targets for this year dallas b tanner president and chief executive officer director yeah hi john we re going to give early guidance around numbers that feel pretty similar to last year we think we ll by somewhere between 300 million and 500 million of assets on a base case scenario we ll probably sell somewhere between 300 million and 500 million in assets john pawlowski green street advisors analyst okay and then ernie i understand you re not giving repair and maintenance expenses i guess i m still having trouble understanding where the easy comps are going middle of the year you guys increased expense guidance pretty meaningfully that implied over over 10 million of what was described as transitory costs i know you re not completely refined but it still seems like a very very easy comp that doesn t seem to be baked in the guidance so i m hoping you can provide a little bit more a walk ernest m freedman executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah john i saw what you had published back in december where you broke things out a little bit more specifically about expectations from sort of different the expense line items and as i mentioned earlier for net cost to maintain overall we do expect to be up about 3 and i know you had a number out there that i think was down 4 and of course with our better fourth quarter performance i think that number adjusted some that s probably closer to down 2 so certainly a disconnect from what you thought we would be with what was happening in the repairs and maintenance world versus where our guidance has come out maybe best for us just to talk offline to give you more information to help you try to bridge the gap between the two at the end of the day we had some good guys we had some some tough items that should help us for comparable perspective we also taken after taking account where we think cost inflation is going on a year over year basis if none of that was happening we don t need a good discussion on what your assumption was there versus what ours was but overall we think we ve set ourselves up for a number that is achievable on all of the expenses where we can get there and of course going into our message just try to do better and with some areas where we had some negative one timers last year and hopefully that sets us up to do a little bit better but also lesson learned from last year want to go out and make sure we re we d put out put out numbers that are achievable and we feel good about and we re confident john pawlowski green street advisors analyst okay a follow up on wes question around expense variability i m less concerned about what happened in 18 and 19 but just trying to figure out this business over the next three to five years but using 4q 18 as a case study to do that so full year 18 expenses come in well below the revised guidance range and 50 of your expenses actually hit your expectation with two months left of the year that implies huge variability for the rest of the line items i know i ve asked this question in the past but it seems that this business model is going to be a lot more variability have a lot more variability on expenses versus multifamily do you believe that to be the case and maybe a little bit of color there would be great ernest m freedman executive vice president and chief financial officer yes no john what i would tell you is i can t speak for us i don t want to speak broadly for the business those two companies are public companies and the other company does a great job of what they do and they can speak to that they certainly speak to their strengths on what they do well let s talk about invitation homes we went through a big merger in 2018 and it was a little bit of how it works so many things went well for us there was a little bit of surprise and caught us off guard about having some issues on the r m side and as we were wrapping up the third quarter and preparing for the third quarter call and felt that it was appropriate to revise our guidance we want to do it in a way that we were confident we wouldn t mess and then in hindsight we overshot i would rather have done that than not and it turns out that the work that s being led by charles inaudible and all our folks in the field they did even better than our wildest expectations of moving some of these things forward and there are still more to go and so i don t want to draw too much conclusion on just from one quarter you said the right thing let s look over the long term over the long term and some these companies have been in public for a long time it certainly invitation homes was before our merger you didn t see that variability so i think the majority of the variability is specific to some of the things that popped up when you bring two very large companies together that were doing things a little bit differently and how to get it on still not completely all in one platform the proof will be in the pudding over the next couple of years will this business be a little bit more variable than multifamily i guess i d ask you look back in the 90s when the multifamily companies were doing mergers when you saw that kind of activity and go back and see what the variability was in there expenses when they were putting much smaller companies together i suspect they had similar variability in i think over time it s a residential business that should be more predictable than other businesses as i don t know the comparable to a multifamily but certainly the other businesses so i know it s tough in the moment john but we are looking at a long term and feel a lot better where we are today than we were a year ago for sure and we are all hoping we want to see less variability as expenses going on and we think we re going to continue to earn into that less variability as we continue to move forward john pawlowski green street advisors analyst alright that s fair thanks ernie operator the next question will be from ryan gilbert of btig please go ahead ryan gilbert btig analyst hi thanks guys i understand that demand for single family rental product looks strong on an overall basis but are there any markets in particular where you re seeing elevated move outs to buy or maybe just lower than expected traffic from potential renters charles d young executive vice president and chief operating officer no this is charles we really haven t seen a demand as we said has really been strong across the board our turnover has been low which has been great affordability is working in our favor you can see our occupancy grow in q4 and continue into january in addition to our rent growth in january was up across almost all of our markets on a blended basis so we re really we re optimistic on how we re going into the year there s always a few markets that we can see improvement and we ve already started to see that in january and clearly we re being led with a lot of the west coast markets and the demand that s out there ryan gilbert btig analyst okay good thanks and then how does the labor market feel for your field repairs and maintenance property technicians i understand it was pretty pretty tight last year has there been any change in your ability to source labor either positively or negatively charles d young executive vice president and chief operating officer yes the markets are tight but we haven t seen any impact to our business on that perspective i think we have a couple of real positive structural advantages as you think around how long our leadership has been here the scale that we have if we do lose somebody we have a deep bench of talent that we can pull from and ultimately our employees enjoy our high dynamic environment and our mission of serving our residents so we know that s been a conversation over the summer and we re watching it closely but we haven t seen any material impact to our techs ryan gilbert btig analyst okay great thanks very much operator the next question will be from haendel st juste of mizuho please go ahead haendel emmanuel st juste mizuho securities usa inc analyst hey i guess good morning out there first dallas congratulations i m curious if there is perhaps anything where your view may differ off from your predecessor like say perhaps doing single family rental development in house maybe more meaningful changes on the geographic footprint target leverage or anything else of that nature dallas b tanner president and chief executive officer director it s good question fair question thank you for the congratulations look i think if fred were here i were here quite frankly any of the other leadership that have been a part of invitation homes our mission has been pretty consistent in terms of making sure that we have scale density and high touch high quality service in good location i think what fred brought me predecessor brought to the table was this high single toward some of the tech enhancements that were available to us and so charles and fred were cutting edge in terms of smart home capabilities some of those things that they re doing really well we ve obviously adopted that i think as you think through what we believe kind of butters of the bread so to speak is just that consistent pragmatic approach to how you run your business and so that won t change and what i talked earlier in my prepared remarks about staying true to our dna our dna and you guys probably get sick of hearing it but i would rather pay for the right locations and make sure that we have infill dynamics happening around our portfolio than look for scale and growth opportunities where i ve got to be outside of call it infill locations and so i think we don t defer all that much and the good news is we ve taken the best from both organizations on the path forward charles and i worked very well together ernie and i have worked together now for three plus years we ve got a nice energy among management team and so we re excited to to really push forward i think to some of the earlier questions around what are the opportunities for growth we certainly see quite a bit of organic growth inside of our portfolio today that we can still go cash so charles was right when he said that we want to focus on making sure we finished the integration but we ve got playbook of things that we re thinking about that we want to try to roll out over the next couple of years that we think will not only enhance the value of the real estate in the rents but make the customer stickier and i think if we get really good at that piece of our business we re not going to be talking about the history of invitation homes it s about where we are going haendel emmanuel st juste mizuho securities usa inc analyst helpful thank you another question i guess on the same store expense outlook i m curious how much asset sales might be helping that line item and then if you could confirm if the assets that you re contemplating selling are included in the same store pool and in that same store expense charles d young executive vice president and chief operating officer sure so i would say the assets that we have sold over the last period of time has been kind of neutral to our results as things came out from the bulk dispositions we saw the numbers looked like before and after it really didn t have a material impact with regards to what our numbers would have been for 2018 then for 2019 and out there s homes that we ve identified for sale and we vacate them that s when we take them out of same store because those specifically the homes we are trying to sell to end users not through a bulk disposition if there s homes that were identified for sale that we think might go through bulk disposition and they remain occupied those we will keep in same store until we get to the point where we have minor contract we have a hard deposit and it s highly certain the transaction is going to happen so what will happen is throughout the year you will see some homes move out of same store and as they kind of go through the process or identified for sale so the answer is a little bit of both some of them are out of same store today but there will be some that we sell today that are currently in same store haendel emmanuel st juste mizuho securities usa inc analyst okay thanks and last one for me you ve mentioned seattle and california being some of your better markets and curious what are the more challenging markets and then what type of delta are you projecting between in terms of revenue between the upper and lower end of your portfolio in terms of revenue charles d young executive vice president and chief operating officer so this is charles i ll jump in on the markets where we see opportunity if you look in the results we put out dallas denver houston occupancy was below where we wanted we ve seen a really nice trajectory in all three markets dallas has moved up into the 95s and we ve seen really good blended rent growth increase in january as well we sustain that occupancy denver is on a really nice move we finished january above 95 95 2 and february continues to rise where blended rent growth also going houston we ve maintained our occupancy up to 95 rent growth kind of flat so we see those as markets that will continue to get better throughout the year if you look back over 18 we ve made really good progress on our florida markets and with such a large presence there orlando has been strong for us all year but tampa and south florida have really come along so we re excited about getting the whole portfolio balanced and operating similar to what we ve seen out in the west coast in orlando markets haendel emmanuel st juste mizuho securities usa inc analyst and quickly on tampa i recall there being the issue last year with some of the personnel can you quickly update us on that where that stands personnel back in place regional or local property management teams fully operating and everything i guess back to where you want it there or can you maybe give us some color on that dallas b tanner president and chief executive officer director yes we re in really good shape in tampa a lot of the noise you just discussed was early in the year we were able to address it quickly as we talked about and part of that is showing up in our results in q4 on both the top line and the bottom line so we feel really good around where tampa stands for us haendel emmanuel st juste mizuho securities usa inc analyst thank you charles d young executive vice president and chief operating officer thanks haendel operator the final question today will be from anthony paolone of jpmorgan please go ahead anthony paolone jpmorgan analyst thanks so thanks for the disposition and acquisition guidance nets to zero how do you think about that versus maybe just reducing leverage a little bit faster charles d young executive vice president and chief operating officer well it s a great question we have to have a base case scenario and we feel very comfortable to ernie s earlier points on guidance with the guidance we re putting out we think we can acquire accretively somewhere between 300 million and 500 million we think we can also recycle easily between 300 million and 500 million on the sales side certainly if there s something opportunistic where we look at a situation that it might make sense we could look at selling or buying more but i would say that will help us the base case scenario that we laid out will help us achieve our goals we want to make sure that we have kind of a nice focused single to getting to investment grade and we know that by calling and selling the parts of the portfolio where we were seeing underperformance either recycling that capital or prepaying debt will put us on that path to that investment grade balance sheet that we ultimately want ernie i don t know if you want to add anything to that but i think that is generally how we feel about anthony anthony paolone jpmorgan analyst okay thanks and then you talked a lot about rate and occupancy and those drivers to the same store revenue picture is there anything appreciable to think about through either revenue management or other income that might contribute or not in 19 ernest m freedman executive vice president and chief financial officer yes we think other income will probably grow a little bit less of a pace than it did in 2018 not significantly so but i think and that s our base case get to our midpoint guidance from a revenue management space i think overall there the team is doing a great job with both the dallas and charles leadership continue to trying to optimize and we ve seen especially we talked about it going into the fourth quarter we felt really good going into the offseason being highly occupied and then charles talked about what the january numbers are it s really putting us in a position to be more offensive than we ve been in the last couple of years as we get into peak leasing season that s not the wrong way to say we were just really pleased with where we are at to be able to and we can optimize and so the team is doing a nice job there and again it s another year of knowledge of both portfolios the team is working together so that sets us up we are set up well but we need to start accomplishing as we get to march april and may anthony paolone jpmorgan analyst so you think that the revenue management actually been part of the driver to kind of the strong occupancy and some of this rate growth charles d young executive vice president and chief operating officer this is charles absolutely that was one of the first parts of the combined company that we put together and once we got under the hood we were able to take best practices of both and it showed up early in the year but by the second half of the year we really hit our stride and it s showing up well in q4 and continues into 2019 anthony paolone jpmorgan analyst okay thanks and then last question just on g a you kind of talked about that but just on non cash comp any appreciable difference in 19 versus 18 on that front ernest m freedman executive vice president and chief financial officer yes there will be because a lot of that non cash comp that came from the ipo finished it s vesting in the early part of 2019 the majority of that expense was recognized in 17 and 18 so the non cash comp around share based comp does come down materially let me we had a question about that earlier two time listening but how we can get something out there so folks get more comfortable about modeling out it doesn t come into our core ffo number because it s been so volatile going forward it will be much less volatile but now that we re past the two year point there was a vesting period on the equity grants associated with the ipo for those of us who had invitation homes are here for that we ll get to much more of what i call normalized run rate of share based comp but we are going to put our heads together and we ll try to figure out a way that we can provide some more help there for folks anthony paolone jpmorgan analyst okay great operator and ladies and gentlemen this will conclude our question and answer session i would like to hand the conference back over to dallas tanner for his closing remarks dallas b tanner president and chief executive officer director thank you again for joining us today we appreciate your interest and the

to 2018 and favorable momentum into 2019 our location scale and platform continued to create a best in class experience for our residents evidenced by our industry leading resident turnover rates blended rent growth has accelerated for each of the past three months to level significantly higher than last year and solid occupancy positions us well to continue capturing acceleration in the 2019 peak leasing season we are also driving better efficiency on the r m side of our business which resulted in fourth quarter performance that exceeded our guidance our strong finish to the year brought core ffo per share growth for the full year 2018 to 14 before discussing what this momentum may translate to in 2019 i want to take a moment to review our performance on the 2018 operational priorities that we communicated to you at the beginning of the year our first objective was to deliver strong consistent operational results across our core portfolio we met our expectations for the top line with 4 5 same store core revenue growth which outpaced residential peers however we can execute better on the expense side of the business after identifying opportunities to be more efficient with repairs and maintenance last summer our teams have done a great job of starting to capture some of these opportunities we have more work to do but are pleased with how our performance improved in the second half of 2018 our next objective was to further enhance the quality of service we provide to our residents the ultimate scorecard on service comes when it is time for residents to make a renewal decision and we are thrilled that our turnover rate on a trailing 12 month basis improved each quarter in 2018 to new all time lows our third operational priority was to execute on our integration plan in addition to finding an incremental 5 million of projected and state synergies we also beat expectations for 2018 achievement by capturing 46 million of annualized run rate synergies in the year with respect to investments our priority was to continue increasing the quality of our portfolio by recycling capital in total in 2018 we sold roughly 500 million of primarily lower rent band homes that no longer fit our long term strategy we recycled capital from dispositions in both the purchase of almost 300 million of homes in more attractive sub markets with higher expected total returns and prepayments of debt finally we made progress on our path to an investment grade balance sheet we reduced net debt to adjusted ebitda to below 9 times compared to approximately 11 times at our ipo in early 2017 we also improved our weighted average maturity and cost of debt looking ahead to 2019 we are excited about our opportunity for growth let me address these three opportunities in particular revenue growth expense controls and capital allocation with respect to revenue growth fundamentals are strong as they ve ever been for single family rental in our markets household formation in 2019 are forecasted to grow at almost 2 or 90 greater than the us average construction of new single family homes is not keeping pace with this demand and has recently slowed further in addition affordability has become a bigger challenge for potential home buyers due to a combination of home price appreciation and higher mortgage rates compared to last year we are seeing this play out in our portfolio today with same store move outs to home ownership down 17 year over year in 2018 leading housing economist john burns estimates that the cost to run a single family home is lower than the cost to own a comparable home in 15 of our 17 markets today by an average discount of 16 we believe our product provides an attractive solution for customers who want to live in a high quality single family home without making the financial commitment of homeownership furthermore we believe the location of our homes in attractive neighborhoods close to jobs and great schools and the high touch service we provide differentiate invitation homes and make the choice to lease with us even more compelling regardless of what the broader economy may bring in the coming years we feel that our business is well positioned even if we were to experience a cooling of the economy our portfolio could continue to benefit from demographics that are shifting more and more in our favor and from a sticky single family resident base that would likely find homeownership incrementally less attractive under more challenging economic conditions we are also excited about our opportunity on the expense side of the business and are focused in 2019 on adding to the progress we made in the second half of 2018 newly implemented changes to our repairs and maintenance workflow and route optimization systems are paying dividends already but we still have plenty of opportunity to be more efficient we also believe the integration of our field teams and property management platform in 2019 will be a positive catalyst for expense improvement if one team operating on one platform we will be better positioned to find new ways to refine our business and take resident service to higher levels with respect to capital allocation our plan in 2019 remains focused on the dual objective of refining our portfolio and reducing leverage on our balance sheet the markets we re in remain healthy providing compelling opportunities on both the acquisition and disposition sides for us to achieve our capital recycling goals abundant capital from potential buyers and limited inventory in our markets create an attractive opportunity for us to prune our portfolio we also have multiple uses for these proceeds including buying homes in more attractive submarkets reinvesting in our portfolio through value enhancing capex and prepaying down debt before we move on i want to say a few quick words about our team it is a thrill to have the opportunity to lead the company i founded with my partners a company that is full of talented people from top to bottom i m fortunate to be stepping into the ceo role with the company in an outstanding place thanks in part to the leadership of fred tuomi fred helped guide invitation homes through what has been a very successful merger and integration has positioned us to move forward better than we ve ever been before we thank fred for his leadership and wish him the absolute best moving forward we will continue to stay true to our dna and the strategic path we ve been on since day one we will put residents first we will drive organic growth and an outstanding living experience by leveraging our competitive advantage of location scale and high touch service we will be opportunistic with respect to external growth we ll progress towards an investment grade balance sheet and we will do all of this with the best team in the business i am fortunate to be surrounded by true experts and industry pioneers on our field and corporate teams as well as in our boardroom to all of our associates thank you for a great finish to 2018 and let s continue to build on our momentum in 2019 with that i ll turn it over to charles young our chief operating officer to provide more detail on our fourth quarter operating results charles d young executive vice president and chief operating officer thank you as dallas said the fourth quarter of 2018 was a great one for us operationally our teams did a fantastic job capturing rent growth and occupancy to put us in a strong position going into 2019 drove better r m efficiency resulting in outperformance of our guidance in the fourth quarter and most importantly we continue to provide outstanding resident service i ll now walk you through our fourth quarter operating results in more detail same store core revenues in the fourth quarter grew 4 6 year over year this increase was driven by average monthly rental rate growth of 3 8 and a 70 basis point increase in average occupancy to 96 for the quarter same store core expense growth in the fourth quarter was better than expected core controllable costs were down slightly year over year even with the tough r m comparison versus the fourth quarter of 2017 due to that year s hurricanes property taxes increased 15 1 year over year in line with our expectation expectations due to the timing items discussed on last quarter s call as a result overall same store expense growth was 7 4 year over year this brought our fourth quarter 2018 same store noi growth to 3 2 for the full year 2018 same store noi growth was 4 4 65 basis points ahead of the midpoint of guidance provided on our last earnings call importantly we have made steady progress on improving our r m efficiency by implementing numerous changes to systems and processes after opportunities for improvement were identified with these changes we have improved how work orders are allocated between in house technicians and third parties our corresponding service trips are scheduled and the routes the technicians follow to optimize their time in the fourth quarter we also rolled out an important update to our technology platform that enabled all of our internal technicians to perform work on any home in our portfolio not just the homes associated with our legacy organization this made a material difference in the productivity of our maintenance technicians in the fourth quarter we still have work to do though and we ll continue implementing process improvements and procare enhancements in the months leading up to 2019 peak service season next i ll provide an update on integration of our field teams after successful results in the testing phase we began market implementation of our unified operating platform in november as of today we have teams in five markets representing almost 40 of our homes functioning under our go forward structure and platform transitions have been smooth and feedback from the field teams have been extremely positive we plan to roll out the platform to our remaining markets in waves over the next several months this rollout is expected to unlock the remainder of the 50 million to 55 million of total run rate synergies we have guided to by mid 2019 as of year end 2018 our run rate synergy achievement was 46 million next i ll cover leasing trends in the fourth quarter of 2018 and january 2019 fundamentals in our markets remain as strong as ever and we are executing well both renewal rent growth and new lease rent growth have increased sequentially in each of the last three months renewals averaged 4 7 in the fourth quarter of 2018 and new leases averaged 2 1 notably new lease rent growth is now exceeding prior year levels and was a full 70 basis points ahead of last year in the fourth quarter of 2018 this resulted in blended rent growth of 3 7 in the fourth quarter of 2018 up 20 basis points year over year same time resident turnover continued to decrease driving occupancy to 96 in the fourth quarter of 2018 up 70 basis points year over year each of these leasing metrics improved further in january lender rent growth averaged 4 3 in january 2019 up 90 basis points year over year and occupancy averaged 96 2 in january 2019 also up 90 basis points year over year the fundamental tailwinds at our back and occupancy in a strong position we are confident as we start the new year our field teams are focused on execution and are excited to leverage our integrated platform to deliver even more efficient resident service with that i ll turn the call over to our chief financial officer ernie freedman ernest m freedman executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you charles today i will cover the following topics balance sheet and capital markets activity financial results for the fourth quarter and 2019 guidance first i ll cover the balance sheet and capital markets activity where we had a very active and successful year let me start with a few highlights about where we started 2018 versus where we ended it net debt 9 1 billion to start the year 8 8 billion to end the year net debt to ebitda 9 5 times to start the year 8 8 times to end the year pro forma the conversion of our 2019 convertible notes weighted average years to maturity 4 1 to start the year 5 5 to end the year unencumbered homes 42 of homes to start the year 48 to end the year in weighted average interest rate 3 4 to start the year 3 3 to end the year in a rising rate environment we accomplished all of this by prioritizing free cash flow in bulk disposition proceeds for debt prepayment and by refinancing debt in 2018 with 4 2 billion of proceeds from our four new securitizations while we remain opportunistic we anticipate less refinancing activity in 2019 with no secured debt maturing in 2019 or 2020 and only 373 million maturing in 2021 however we will continue to prioritize debt prepayments as part of our efforts to pursue an investment grade rating and have made incremental progress already with the pre payment of 70 million of secured debt in january we will continue our deleveraging strategy by electing to settle conversions of our 230 million of 2019 convertible notes in common shares we view this decision as a way to reduce net debt to ebitda by approximately 0 25 turns while incurring minimal incremental dilution to core ffo per share our liquidity at quarter end was over 1 1 billion through a combination of unrestricted cash and undrawn capacity on our credit facility i ll now cover our fourth quarter 2018 financial results core ffo and affo per share for the fourth quarter increased year over year to 0 30 and 0 25 respectively primary drivers of the increases were growth in noi and lower cash interest expense per share for the full year 2018 core ffo and affo per share increased 13 7 and 8 1 respectively as a result of our anticipated growth in affo per share in 2019 we have increased our quarterly dividend to 0 13 from 0 11 per share we continue to target a low dividend payout ratio as we believe a beneficial use of cash is to further pay down debt the last thing i will cover is 2019 guidance as dallas and charles discussed we believe that we continue to have strong fundamental tailwinds at our back and entered the year from a strong occupancy position with accelerating rate growth as such we expect to grow same store revenue by 3 8 to 4 4 in 2019 home price appreciation in our markets over the last year or two suggest that growth in real estate taxes in 2019 is likely to remain elevated albeit lower than the growth we saw in 2018 as a result we expect overall same store core expense growth to moderate from 2018 levels to 3 5 to 4 5 in 2019 core controllable expenses are likely to grow less than that as we believe we have positioned ourselves to better control r m cost in 2019 but we still have work to do this brings our expectation for same store noi growth to 3 5 to 4 5 full year 2019 core ffo per share is expected to be 1 20 to 1 28 and affo per share is expected to be 0 98 to 1 06 representing year over year increases of greater than 5 and 7 at the mid points respectively primary driver of these expected increases is growth in same store noi lower property management and g a expenses and lower interest expense are also expected to contribute to growth a detailed bridge of our 2018 core ffo per share to the midpoint of 2019 core ffo per share guidance can be found in our earnings release there are a handful of items likely to impact the progression of same store growth in core ffo and affo growth from a timing perspective over the course of the year with respect to revenue growth occupancy comps are easier at the start of the year versus later regarding expenses core expense growth is likely to be highest in the first quarter first while we have made great progress addressing items related to our integrated r m system that drove inefficiency in 2018 we still have work to complete as part of our plan we do not expect to be fully optimized in the first quarter of 2019 second as we discussed last year other income and resident recoveries in the first quarter of 2018 were higher than normal as a result of post merger alignment of the resident utility bill back timing across the two legacy companies this will create a more difficult comparison for core expense growth in the first quarter of 2019 these two items are expected to more than offset the favorable impact of comping against a period in the first quarter of 2018 with higher than normal work order volume as a result of 2017 s hurricanes also regarding expenses the year over year increase in real estate taxes is likely to be materially lower in the fourth quarter of 2019 than in the first three quarters of the year as discussed previously we booked an unfavorable real estate tax catch up in the fourth quarter of 2018 for tax assessments that came in higher than expected this creates an easier comp for the fourth quarter of 2019 finally the 2019 convertible notes are expected to convert to common shares on july 1 2019 this will impact the interest expense and share count used to calculate core ffo and affo per share by treating the notes as debt for the first half of 2019 and as equity for the second half of 2019 assuming that the notes convert as expected i ll wrap up by reiterating how much we are looking forward to 2019 fundamentals are in our favor and we have multiple levers we believe we can pull to create value we are excited to move on to one platform across the entire organization and to execute on that platform to deliver outstanding results to both our residents and our shareholders with that operator would you please open up the line for questions questions and answers operator thank you mr freedman we will now begin the question and answer session operator instructions the first question will come from nick joseph of citi please go ahead nick joseph citi analyst thanks as you roll out the unified operating platform across the portfolio what lessons have you learned from the process are you making any adjustments for the other markets based off of them charles d young executive vice president and chief operating officer yeah this is charles we ve made really good progress in implementing the combined portfolio rollout as i said in my remarks we ve implemented in about five markets which equals about 40 of our total homes we ve been really thoughtful based on what we learned in 2018 that we ve taken a really measured pace on how we roll it out we expect to be done around mid 2019 we ve made a decision to implement in the slower time of the year which is working in our favor and we are careful also around the timing in which we roll it out during the month to make sure that we re not impacting the field teams we went through multiple rounds of testing to make sure that things were working as expected before we went in we have great training we ve learned from each of the rollouts to get better in our training and implementation has been great the feedback from our field teams have been very positive and as i said we expect that we ll be there by mid year bottom line is the teams are really excited to get on one combined platform because they were working in multiple systems before so that we see this as a really positive thing nick joseph citi analyst thanks then dallas congratulations on the promotion when you took over as interim president in august the board formed a special committee to work with you and the team during fred s absence is that committee still in place and what s the board s role today dallas b tanner president and chief executive officer director yeah hi thanks for the question and excuse me the compliment yeah the board is still functioning in a similar fashion as we were and that executive committee will stay in place through 2019 as you guys know we have a very supportive board with a ton of excellent experience behind it so we ll continue to use that it s been strategic for us as we ve vetted out some of these things that charles just discussed in terms of how we would integrate going forward and we thought through some of the processes so they ve been very supportive in that capacity and we would anticipate them to continue doing so nick joseph citi analyst thanks operator the next question will be from drew babin of baird please go ahead drew babin robert w baird analyst hey good morning dallas b tanner president and chief executive officer director good morning drew drew babin robert w baird analyst as it pertains to affo guidance i was hoping you can talk about the direction of recurring capex per home in 19 understanding that in 18 with the starwood waypoint merger there might have been a little bit of noise there can you just give us a little more color on the trends in that number as well as how you think about our revenue enhancing capex this year ernest m freedman executive vice president and chief financial officer sure drew i ll take this this is ernie with regards specifically to our recurring capex we expect overall net cost to maintain which is both our operating expenses associated with repairs and maintenance as well as turnover as well as the capital associated with that that would be our recurring capex and that s going to be up approximately about 3 year over year we definitely have some easier comps to go up against in and we certainly had some improvements but as we talked about in the prepared remarks we re not fully optimized today and of course we want to be cautious before we get into peak leasing season before getting too far ahead of ourselves and where things may end up where we sit today and where we re at with the progress we made we feel like we re back to a more normal type growth rate with the opportunity maybe do better as we go forward so i would expect plus or minus in the 3 range for net cost to maintain to grow drew remind me what the second part of your question was drew babin robert w baird analyst it s revenue enhancing capex whether we can expect any kind of directional change from last year there dallas b tanner president and chief executive officer director hey drew this is dallas i ll answer this we continue to expect our focus to continue to find ways to optimize these assets on a like for like basis as they turn now some of that allows us these opportunities with revenue enhancing capex i would expect that program to continue to develop if not maybe be a little bit more active as we spread into some of our west coast markets we certainly see a number of different opportunities outside of just the smart home functionality with which we re continually adding into the portfolio today we re finding that our customers they are sticky by nature but what s been really interesting over the past year as we ve piloted revenue enhancing capex and gotten better at how we implement that process is how many times our customers on a renewal or on a new lease want to actually pay up to optimize parts or sections of their house this is a win for both us and the customer because we re able to harden the asset in theory and also get a better risk adjusted return on the revenue increase and that s outside of the way we would normally underwriter a property so expect us to do more of it we re looking in getting smarter charles and his team have done a terrific job on the procurement side to find ways that we can continually enhance that experience for the customer drew babin robert w baird analyst thank you that s helpful and then lastly just on the guidance expectations non cash interest and share based comp i was hoping you could kind of give us those numbers just given the accounting kind of how those play into the core ffo calculation charles d young executive vice president and chief operating officer yeah drew we have not provided guidance for those in the past and so let me think about what we can do and get something out there for folks to help with modeling but i don t have anything i can share with that with you today drew babin robert w baird analyst okay we can follow up on that that is all from me thank you operator then the next question will be from douglas harter of credit suisse please go ahead douglas harter credit suisse analyst i was hoping you could talk about where you are in the process of optimizing the portfolio and kind of how you think about the home count as we move through 2019 dallas b tanner president and chief executive officer director yeah hi doug this is dallas we ve been pretty vocal about our desire to continually refine and optimize the portfolio and the nice thing about the merger is we ve had enough time and distance we knew there were some homes initially both with which we wanted to sell and also some areas where we wanted to scale up and could find and drive greater efficiencies in the portfolio by acquiring expect us to do more of the same we had a pretty busy year in terms of what we were selling and it comes in a variety of shapes and sizes to why we sold we certainly were active in parts of florida where we now on a combined basis had over 25 000 homes post merger expect us to continually look for areas like that where we can continue to refine the portfolio create efficiencies for the operating teams and build on the scale and density that we have in those markets in addition we also have outlier locations or geographies where we ll at times or seasons look for ways to refine and improve the way that those parts of the portfolio is behaving and lastly i d just add there are occasions and we re starting to see this a little bit in some of our west coast properties where if a home just becomes too valuable and ultimately we think it s better suited for an end user we ll sell that home and take those gains and recycle capital in the parts of markets where we see still significant opportunities for good risk adjusted return douglas harter credit suisse analyst dallas just following up on that which are the markets where you see the best opportunities to kind of recycle capital into dallas b tanner president and chief executive officer director well funny enough we were pretty active in 2018 in still lot of west coast markets we ve been pretty vocal about the fact that we love seattle we love the growth that s going on there it s evidenced in some of the new lease and renewal rates that we re seeing in the business today we also still are finding really good opportunities in the southeast and if we could we would buy more in california and markets if those opportunities were available to us we just see limited supply in today s environment as we ve stated household formation in our markets today is almost two times than the national average and we re feeling that in the parts of our business specifically around new lease growth and renewals but generally speaking you ve seen that we ve been getting out of parts of the midwest over time and we ve continued to recycle coastal where the majority of our footprints are today douglas harter credit suisse analyst great thank you dallas operator the next question will be from shirley wu of bank of america merrill lynch please go ahead shirley wu bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi guys thanks for taking the question so in your expense guidance of 4 do you think you could break out like different markets in terms of growth or personnel or r m for 19 dallas b tanner president and chief executive officer director yes shirley what we are comfortable providing today is because taxes are almost half of our expense number i can provide some guidance around what we think would happen with taxes and what s going to happen for everything else which is really roughly the other half and i think as everyone knows home price appreciation continues to be pretty strong in our markets and it is run over 6 across the board on a weighted average basis across our markets and with that and we do expect that property taxes in 2019 will be up somewhere in the fives for us and of course prop 13 in california helps mute that a little bit for us with having 20 of our portfolio in california and so the real estate taxes being up we think somewhere in the fives we think everything else will be less than 3 to get to our at the midpoint to get to our guidance range of 3 5 to 4 5 and then as the year plays out as different things earns in we ll see some things flow through on those other expense items that from a guidance perspective we re comfortable providing guidance in that way shirley shirley wu bank of america merrill lynch analyst that s helpful so also recently mortgage rates have really pulled back especially in the last couple of months but your move outs to home buying has still has continued to trend down is that something that you re concerned about or moving forward how do you think about that dallas b tanner president and chief executive officer director well we are certainly not concerned about it because it s been fairly consistent over the past couple of years less than 10 of our overall portfolio on an annual basis moves out of our business to go buy a home at least that s what we ve seen over the first few years as a public company we look at it a couple of ways i mentioned it in my earlier comments we are seeing a real shift in terms of affordability to your point and we re picking up some of the net benefit of that quite frankly in our business today as we mentioned before 15 markets of our 17 markets based on the research that we look at and follow are now more affordable to lease call it an entry level product than it is to buy in today s environment so we think interest rates there actually maybe push people into a longer term lease with us or maybe offer an opportunity for consideration to choose the leasing lifestyle and there are some markets to your point that are a bit more dislocated i mean in seattle washington for example that differential can be as high as 30 and so we look at that as also an opportunity to make sure that we re providing a best in class service and an experience that people are willing to pay for we look at that as an opportunity shirley wu bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it thanks for the color guys operator the next question will be from derek johnston of deutsche bank please go ahead derek johnston deutsche bank ag analyst hi everybody can you discuss how turn times trended in 4q and where you d like to see them in 2019 and really if the new r m platform drives any benefit there charles d young executive vice president and chief operating officer yes so this charles turn times have been kind of mid teens for us and we d like to bring that down again we ve been consolidating the teams the offices and the platforms as we get all into one platform as we talked about and finalize that integration at the first half of the year here i think we ll be in a much better shape to bring those times down as we think around turn it really is the kind of quality and location of our homes and we make sure that we are delivering a high quality product that delivery of product will relate to the r m in terms of any work orders that may come afterwards part of what we want to implement in 2018 that s important is our procare service and that s a follow on after the turn when the resident moves in to make sure that they understand their responsibility but also we bundle some of those work orders to a 45 day visit that will allow us to kind of manage that process with the resident on the r m side so that s where the overlap and the transition happens but ultimately they are two separate portions of the business and as i said we d like to bring those turn times down and we expect that we ll start getting into the low teens as we get consolidated derek johnston deutsche bank ag analyst great and last one for me how many customers are now subscribed to the smart technology and what other ancillary income drivers have you guys identified charles d young executive vice president and chief operating officer yes so right now we have about a third of our homes have the smart home installed so a little over 30 000 about half of those are paying customers and that builds every time that we move a resident in 70 to 80 of those residents are opting into the service which is great adoption rate in terms of other ancillary with the integration we ve really been focusing on finalizing that but once we get through the integration we see there s opportunities whether it s in moving services or pet services pest control items that we can think around filters there are a number of items that we want to attack but right now we re focused in on making sure that we finalize the integration derek johnston deutsche bank ag analyst good stuff thanks operator the next question will be from richard hill of morgan stanley please go ahead richard hill morgan stanley analyst hey guys wanted to just ask a maybe a couple of questions about how you think about 2019 where you didn t give guidance you had some success with bulk sales so dallas i m wondering if you can give us any sort of color around those bulk sales cap rates breadth of buyers and then do you think that s going to continue in 2019 how are we supposed to think about that going forward dallas b tanner president and chief executive officer director sure thanks rich a number of things as i mentioned earlier in my comments we still see a quite a bit of demand in the marketplace for stabilized product being sold from an institutional operator like ourselves so i would expect that we ll still explore some bulk opportunities this year and really quite frankly any year where our scale and density allow us to facilitate those types of transactions in terms of what we did in 2018 we sold homes on average that were much cheaper than the homes that we are acquiring i think if you look at the fourth quarter as an example the 1600 plus homes we sold in q4 we had an call it an average price per home around 175 000 we re recycling that money into homes that were well north of 300 000 on a per property basis so as you think about what those cap rates are you would certainly when you re selling cheaper product generally on a pro forma basis you re going to see cap rates that are a little bit higher just because your denominator being so low in terms of your asset price pricing and so what we sold over the majority of 18 were homes that were closer to 6 cap and recycling the homes that were well within the mid fives now that doesn t tell you the whole story as you think about the way we ve recycled in terms of what we bought and what we sold on average we re buying homes that were renting for about 500 more or less more than the homes that we were selling so that additional 6 000 in revenue is a really smart way to operate on the long term when you think about all the incremental costs that can go into this business richard hill morgan stanley analyst that s great detail hey guys you guys put up a really impressive margin number this quarter so how are we thinking about that sort of near term and long term so i guess the question is that 65 plus margin is that sustainable near term and do you think you can still get that into the high 60s i m going to push it to 70 area what are you thinking about there ernest m freedman executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah rich i think the answer is it really all depends on how things move forward with some capital allocation and other things and you ll recall as you know fourth quarter first quarter typically are our highest margin quarters but for the entire year of 2018 in the year we certainly had some challenges we put up 64 5 margin which we re pleased to do even with the challenges that we had and as we continue to refine the portfolio from a capital allocation perspective and importantly as charles continues to refine what he s doing on an operating standpoint and our guidance implies that the margins will be pretty similar from 2018 to 2019 based on what we put out there for midpoint of revenue expense and noi guidance we think there s opportunity for that to continue to increase to somewhere certainly in the higher 60s we do have i think half a dozen markets today that are in the 70s and certainly as dallas looks to do some things on the capital allocation and especially that the homes we are selling out of in some of the markets where we ve been disproportionately selling those markets do have lower margins so you could certainly see you could force your way to a 70 type margin but i think for where we are at where we want to have our homes in the portfolio i think increasing it by a few 100 basis points from where it is now into the higher 60s is certainly a very achievable goal over the next period of time richard hill morgan stanley analyst great thank you and just one final question dallas going back to your prepared remarks on affordability when you think about affordability are you sort of doing apples to apples rent to mortgage payment or do you guys think about affordability relative to the cost of owning a home differently dallas b tanner president and chief executive officer director yeah i think we like to look at it a couple of different ways i think the way to really look at it and so that you keep everything constant is you got to think about housing costs as not only your mortgage but also some ongoing maintenance expense that a normal homeowner would incur over ordinary course and that s the way burns and a number of other economists tend to look at it we ve looked at a couple of different pieces we ve done some of our own research obviously with the data that we have and you re certainly seeing that dislocation we talked about earlier now there is time and seasons where that s your friend and there s a time and season where maybe it isn t but right now it certainly feels like we re positioned to capture some of that affordability demand that people are looking for some relief specifically in the west coast where we re seeing rising home prices as well as the rising rate environment not helping the homeownership story richard hill morgan stanley analyst perfect thanks guys that s it dallas b tanner president and chief executive officer director thanks richard operator the next question will be from jason green of evercore please go ahead jason green evercore analyst good morning on the deceleration in same store revenue growth that your guidance implies is that kind of due to conservatism on occupancy slowing rent growth or a combination of the two ernest m freedman executive vice president and chief financial officer yes if you look on page 23 of our earnings release jason i think it s a helpful guide to what happened in 2018 and give you a sense for what we think is going to happen with regards to 2019 you see in 2018 our revenue growth of 4 5 was made up of 3 9 rental rate growth 50 bps increase in occupancy and then other income was a little bit better than those and so that s how you get to a 4 5 to get to the midpoint of our 4 1 revenue growth we think we would have similar rental type growth maybe a tick lower than that at the midpoint but very similar as you recall we have accelerating rent growth here starting in the fourth quarter of 18 and we saw that in january as charles talked about but for the first three quarters of 2018 it was a deceleration year over year so we need to earn that in and then on occupancy growth we do expect occupancy to be better than it was in 2019 versus 2018 but not necessarily 50 bps better now that said charles is off to really good start in january up 90 basis points and we are off to a good start on rental rate as well and so when you factor that in that s why we don t think we quite get to 4 5 with regards to our the midpoint of our guidance but there s certainly a path for us to do better than that certainly seen how well we started off the year with january jason green evercore analyst got it and then the synergies that you guys had mentioned from the merger are those factored in the same store guidance or do those represent additional upside ernest m freedman executive vice president and chief financial officer no those are factored into our guidance and so about 90 of the synergies that hit the field hit same store the rest hit the total portfolio because we ve got 90 of our homes in same store so those are factored in so with regards to getting to numbers we expect to from an expense perspective it s taking into account synergies that we earned in 2018 as well as what we anticipate the timing on those synergies and to be clear that those synergies aren t all going to earn in on january 1st as charles talked it s going to be until mid year and we got the whole portfolio rolled out and as we do that it s about 60 days after that where we get to that final numbers and want to have some overlap period to make sure things are working right in the field and so those take a little while to earn here in 2019 but that s all factored into our guidance jason green evercore analyst got it and then last one from me total cost to maintain came in for the year at about 3 200 per home you re talking about that increasing potentially around 3 in 19 previously you d said the long term rate is probably somewhere between 2 600 and 2 800 so i guess first is that still the long term rate that you guys feel will be necessary for a total cost to maintain the homes and then how long does it take for you guys to get there ernest m freedman executive vice president and chief financial officer and so we came in i think close to 3 100 and 3 200 i think it s 3 109 for the year but notwithstanding we first came out with our ipo way back a couple of years ago we did say adjusting for inflation we expect to be at 2 600 to 2 800 so those numbers are going to move on us those guideposts if there is inflation in the rm world and we ve actually seen probably more inflation in that than in other areas just on what s been going on with broader products and services that you always need to reset that that said we re not quite where we think we re going to be in getting back on that track and as we further optimize and get things rolled out on the r m side and we ve talked about in the prepared remarks we had a good fourth quarter it came in stronger than we thought and we re excited about that with regards to what happened with r m to bring us down to that 3 100 number that we came in for the year we are going to be cautious as we come out this year to make sure things are going as we expect and move forward i think once we re fully optimized everyone is working on the same platform that s when we have the real opportunity to get back to numbers that were more like where we thought we would end up with regards to the longer term growing for inflation where we thought cost to maintain would be jason green evercore analyst got it thank you ernest m freedman executive vice president and chief financial officer all right thanks operator the next question will be from jade rahmani of kbw please go ahead jade rahmani keefe bruyette woods inc analyst thanks very much are you seeing a pickup in interest from home builders in partnering with you dallas b tanner president and chief executive officer director hi jade it s dallas it s interesting we ve certainly had a number of discussions around opportunities and we re looking at a couple of different things as i ve mentioned before we really are channel agnostic and we just want to make sure that we re focused on the right locations so we re interested we like the fact that i think home builders are getting more and more comfortable with the idea of single family owners being in their neighborhoods and buying product i certainly could see it becoming more and more of an opportunity for us going forward i don t think we have to take on any of that development risk ourselves i mean we ve been pretty clear about that but we certainly want to look for strategic partners that we can then be potential buyer for we think that there is definitely opportunity for us there to grow jade rahmani keefe bruyette woods inc analyst and what s your view toward master plan communities that feature apartments and stand alone single family rental communities with high amenities targeted toward millennials dallas b tanner president and chief executive officer director well it s an interesting concept that continues to evolve we certainly know some of the operators and the owners that are building that product today i think it s kind of a shift quite frankly i think it plays into some of the same demographics that we ve been talking about there is this 65 million person cohort between the ages of 20 and 35 that are coming our way that want quality of choice it s no different than the business we run today i think where you got to be careful though jade in some of those opportunities is you got to still stay location specific in terms of where you want to invest capital that s a it s a small boutique opportunity in an infill location with really good rents and that the square footages are similar to what we would normally own it would be something we look at what i ve seen across a broad spectrum of some of that product is it s typically been much smaller footprints between 800 and 1300 square feet and that s not really our sweet spot more or less but if we saw an opportunity that was infill that made sense we d certainly want to look at it and we re encouraged by the fact that people are recognizing that leasing is a real choice right now for people jade rahmani keefe bruyette woods inc analyst and just on the influence of ibuyers on the market are you competing directly with them with respect to acquisitions are they distorting pricing or impacting the market in any way and is there a potential opportunity to enter into joint ventures to provide centralized property management services since they are active in many of your markets dallas b tanner president and chief executive officer director let me answer kind of those in part and i think you re thinking about the world the right way jade in terms of being an entrepreneur this is an interesting moment in time with these ibuyers it certainly feels like there s a new company popping up every day who knows what will actually stick or last or who will be the king pins in the long term this is public record we ve been supportive of companies like opendoor and offerpad and zillow that are out there making the home buying and selling experience much easier for the customer now 5 5 million transactions in the us occur every year so you should think about that i mean there s plenty of space for both brokers ibuyers and individual investors to be buying and selling homes in the us we certainly want to look for strategic partners that we can partner with to help grow our footprint in our portfolio we get the question a lot about would you want to do third party management you could certainly see a day where that could be interesting but now for us it s just not really our focus our focus is on growing our own footprint we see plenty of opportunity within our own book of business where we can continue to grow the invitation homes product along with the invitation homes fit and finish standards as well as the service levels that our customers are wanting to expect so it s not in our near term horizon by any stretch jade rahmani keefe bruyette woods inc analyst thanks so much douglas harter credit suisse analyst thanks jade operator your next question will be from wes golladay of rbc capital markets please go ahead wes golladay rbc capital markets analyst hey good morning guys i can appreciate that there s a lot of moving parts last year on the expense side volatility to the upside and the downside but this year you have a 1 range on your same store expenses should we take that as a sense that all the moving parts are behind us that would be more of a normal environment this year charles d young executive vice president and chief operating officer yeah wes we certainly think so we want to be cautious and want to set a range that we thought was appropriate at the end of the day we feel lot better sitting today with the lessons learned over the last 12 months you recall last year at this time when we were providing guidance the merger had just closed about 60 days ahead of that and actually closed ahead of schedule we all thought they would actually close in early january but fortunately we re able to get it done quicker we re bringing two companies together we run on the same platform we re learning how each of the companies were doing things and in hindsight we got a lot of things right but a couple of things we didn t unfortunately and that caused some noise we definitely feel much more confident but again we re not 100 of the way there as we talked about in a couple of other things but we re certainly so much further along so we are feeling better for sure than we were last year and certainly as the year progressed wes golladay rbc capital markets analyst okay and then you made the comment about the r m being a little bit lower from the leasing from early last year but looking at this year what are your expectations for blended rent growth for each of the quarters and not by quarter but just in general do you expect to continue to modestly accelerate throughout the year based on the supply and demand you re seeing charles d young executive vice president and chief operating officer yeah we want to be careful with that i did mention in the prepared remarks we obviously comps does get harder throughout the year so just want to make sure people realize that that means you re likely to see higher revenue growth earlier in the year because we won t have as an easy inaudible comp later in the year we ll just have to see how it plays out it s january it s early in the year we make our hay starting in mid march that s kind of when peak season starts for us and goes through end of july or early august so certainly when we re talking to you guys in about 90 days about first quarter results we ll have a much better feel for whether we re seeing that acceleration continue at the pace it did in january or not wes golladay rbc capital markets analyst okay that s all from me thanks for taking the questions ernest m freedman executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks operator the next question will be from hardik goel of zelman associates please go ahead hardik goel zelman associates analyst hey guys thanks for taking my question as i look across the guidance range my first question is would you consider the low end of guidance to be as likely as the high end of guidance and as a follow up to that what are the components of guidance that you look to as being drivers of potential downside to guidance the midpoint and drivers of potential upside as well ernest m freedman executive vice president and chief financial officer sure hardik i think by definition we think it s equally likely as we put out our guidance at the low side could be hit as well as the high side we ll certainly be optimistic that we think we can do better but that s the point of the range is we think that they re kind of equal weighted but we certainly are excited about how january came out and we ll do our best to get more toward the high end of those ranges in terms of looking to influence our ability to have upside to that or not again peak leasing season on the revenue side will be the key and we re real pleased with how january came out for sure and so i think that s going to be what will swing us in terms of rental rate achievement and then we are always rate focused first but we ve been successful especially with lower turnover and we saw the lowest we ve ever seen as we looked at the fourth quarter that certainly helped on the occupancy side on the expense side i think it s probably the obvious it s just we know that we had some struggles last year with repairs and maintenance and that cost to maintain we re feeling better about it than we have but we re not 100 there in terms of having everything optimized running and the proof will be in the pudding just like it is on the revenue side for peak leasing season will become the summer time when we hit the majority of our work orders that have to do around the hvac season we ll be better prepared for that this year by leaps and bounds than we were last year but i think that will be the true test for us on the expense side as we get into peak work order season how are we doing are the teams optimized or is everything working the way we expect it to we re pleased with the path we re on right now and by midway through the year and come that august call the late july august call we ll have a pretty good sense i think of how the year is playing out on the expense side hardik goel zelman associates analyst thanks and just one quick one if you ll indulge me the move outs to buy were they a big driver of turnover being lower do you see them trend lower year over year or what was the trend there ernest m freedman executive vice president and chief financial officer year over year they trended slightly lower they ve actually been a little bit more lower in the previous quarters and for the year they were definitely lower so i think it s just i think it s more broadly that people are pleased with the services that they re getting and are staying a little bit longer and fourth quarter there is not much activity as you know hardik so it s i don t know if you draw a lot of conclusions from fourth quarter but we did see it low quarter over quarter like we did every other quarter this year and so that certainly did help with the turnover number hardik goel zelman associates analyst thanks ernie operator the next question will be from alan wai of goldman sachs please go ahead alan wai goldman sachs analyst good morning i had a question on g a is your 4q number a good run rate how should we think about incremental synergy savings realized mid quarters as well as potential seasonality ernest m freedman executive vice president and chief financial officer sure so we provided a walk in our earnings release that showed how you get from where we ended up for 2018 for core ffo and then to the midpoint of our guidance for 2019 within that walk we did call out the fact that both property management expense and g a combined we expect to be about a 0 01 better it s not quite 0 01 it rounds up to 0 01 and so we are going to do a little bit better more so in g a than in property management expense but both numbers should be down a year over year from where they were in 2018 and that s mainly from the earn in of the synergies that s still to go as well as the ones that happened in 2018 and there s not much to go still on the g a and p a numbers so it s not mainly in the earnings from 2018 but then understand there is some cost inflation baked into there too cost don t ph remain static in terms of what s happening with compensation costs for the organization and other costs and so you have a synergy good guy that more than offset an inflationary increase in those costs for 2019 alan wai goldman sachs analyst that s helpful and i was wondering in terms of seasonality and g a how should i think of that ernest m freedman executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah there s really not a lot of seasonality in g a that should be unless we are the only thing that potentially would do that would be around our bonus accruals we try to do a good job throughout the year anticipating where those will come out so you should see that to be pretty steady each quarter throughout the year alan wai goldman sachs analyst thank you very much operator the next question will be from john pawlowski of green street advisors please go ahead john pawlowski green street advisors analyst thanks dallas or ernie could you provide the acquisition and disposition volume targets for this year dallas b tanner president and chief executive officer director yeah hi john we re going to give early guidance around numbers that feel pretty similar to last year we think we ll by somewhere between 300 million and 500 million of assets on our base case scenario and we ll probably sell somewhere between 300 million and 500 million in assets john pawlowski green street advisors analyst okay and then ernie i understand you re not giving repair and maintenance expenses i guess i m still having trouble understanding where the easy comps are going middle of the year you guys increased expense guidance pretty meaningfully that implied over over 10 million of what was described as transitory costs i know you re not completely refined but it still seems like a very very easy comp that doesn t seem to be baked in the guidance so i m hoping you can provide a little bit more of a walk ernest m freedman executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah john i saw what you had published back in december where you ve broken things out a little bit more specifically about expectations from sort of different the expense line items and as i mentioned earlier for net cost to maintain overall we do expect to be up about 3 and i know you had a number out there that i think was down 4 and of course with our better fourth quarter performance i think that number adjusted some that s probably closer to down 2 so there s certainly a disconnect from what you thought we would be with what was happening in the repairs and maintenance world versus where our guidance has come out maybe best for us just to talk offline to give you more information to help you try to bridge the gap between the two at the end of the day we had some good guys we had some some tough items that should help us from a comparable perspective we ve also taken have to take into account where we think cost inflation is going on a year over year basis if none of that was happening we don t need a good discussion inaudible what your assumption was there versus what ours was but overall we think we ve set ourselves up for a number that is achievable on all of the expenses where we can get there and of course we re going to do our best to try to do better and with some areas where we had some negative one timers last year and hopefully that sets us up to do a little bit better but also lesson learned from last year want to go out and make sure we re we put out numbers that are achievable and we feel good about and we re confident john pawlowski green street advisors analyst okay a follow up on wes question around expense variability i m less concerned about what happened in 18 and 19 but just trying to figure out this business over the next three to five years but using 4q 18 as a case study to do that so full year 18 expenses come in well below the revised guidance range and 50 of your expenses actually hit your expectation with two months left to the year that implies huge variability for the rest of the line items i know i ve asked this question in the past but it seems that this business model is going to be a lot more variability have a lot more variability on expenses versus multifamily do you believe that to be the case and maybe a little bit of color there would be great ernest m freedman executive vice president and chief financial officer yes no john what i would tell you is i can speak for us i don t want to speak broadly for the business those two companies are public companies and the other company does a great job of what they do and they can speak to that they certainly speak to their strengths on what they do well so let s just talk about invitation homes we went through a big merger in 2018 and it was a little bit of inaudible work so many things went well for us there was a little bit of surprise and caught us off guard about having some issues on the r m side and as we were wrapping up the third quarter and preparing for the third quarter call and felt that it was appropriate to revise our guidance we want to do it in a way that we were confident we wouldn t mess and in hindsight we overshot i would rather have done that than not and it turns out that the work that s being led by charles and tim lobner and all our folks in the field they did even better than our wildest expectations in moving some of these things forward and now still more to go and so i don t want to draw too much conclusion on just from one quarter you said the right thing let s look over the long term over the long term and some these companies have been in public for a long time and certainly invitation homes was before our merger you didn t see that variability so i think the majority of the variability is specific to some of the things that popped up when you bring two very large companies together that were doing things a little bit differently and how to get it on still not completely on one platform the proof will be in the pudding over the next couple of years will this business be a little bit more variable than multifamily i guess i d ask you to look back in the 90s when the multifamily companies were doing mergers when you saw that kind of activity and go back and see what the variability was in their expenses when they were putting much smaller companies together i suspect that they had similar variability in i think over time it s a residential business that should be more predictable than other businesses not only comparable to a multifamily but certainly to other businesses so i know it s tough when we re in the moment john but we are looking at the long term and feel a lot better where we are today than we were a year ago for sure and we are all hoping we want to see less variability in these expenses going on and we think we re going to continue to earn into that less variability as we continue to move forward john pawlowski green street advisors analyst alright that s fair thanks ernie operator the next question will be from ryan gilbert of btig please go ahead ryan gilbert btig analyst hi thanks guys i understand that demand for single family rental product looks strong on an overall basis but are there any markets in particular where you re seeing elevated move outs to buy or maybe just lower than expected traffic from potential renters charles d young executive vice president and chief operating officer no this is charles we really haven t seen a demand as we said has really been strong across the board our turnover has been low which has been great affordability is working in our favor you can see our occupancy grow in q4 and continue into january in addition to our rent growth in january was up across almost all of our markets on a blended basis so we re really we re optimistic on how we re going into the year there s always a few markets that we can see improvement and we ve already started to see that in january and clearly we re being led with a lot of the west coast markets and the demand that s out there ryan gilbert btig analyst okay good thanks and then how does the labor market feel for your field repairs and maintenance property technicians i understand it was pretty pretty tight last year has there been any change in your ability to source labor either positively or negatively charles d young executive vice president and chief operating officer yes the markets are tight but we haven t seen any impact to our business on that perspective i think we have a couple of real positive structural advantages as you think around how long our leadership has been here our scale that we have if we do lose somebody we have a deep bench of talent that we can pull from and ultimately our employees enjoy our high dynamic environment and our mission of serving our residents so we know that s been a conversation over the summer and we re watching it closely but we haven t seen any material impact to our techs ryan gilbert btig analyst okay great thanks very much operator the next question will be from haendel st juste of mizuho please go ahead haendel emmanuel st juste mizuho securities usa inc analyst hey i guess good morning out there first dallas again ph congratulations i m curious if there is perhaps anything where your view may differ at all from your predecessor like say perhaps doing single family rental development in house maybe more meaningful changes on the geographic footprint target leverage or anything else of that nature dallas b tanner president and chief executive officer director it s good question fair question thank you for the congratulations look i think if fred were here i were here quite frankly any of the other leadership that have been a part of invitation homes our mission has been pretty consistent in terms of making sure that we have scale density and high touch high quality service in good location i think what fred brought my predecessor brought to the table was this high single toward some of the tech enhancements that were available to us and so charles and fred were cutting edge in terms of smart home capabilities some of those things that they re doing really well we ve obviously adopted that i think as you think through what we believe kind of butters the bread so to speak is just that consistent pragmatic approach to how you run your business and so that won t change and what i talked earlier in my prepared remarks about staying true to our dna our dna and you guys probably get sick of hearing it but i would rather pay for the right locations and make sure that we have infill dynamics happening around our portfolio than look for scale and growth opportunities where i ve got to be outside of call it infill locations and so i think we don t differ all that much and the good news is we ve taken the best from both organizations on the path forward charles and i worked very well together ernie and i have worked together now for three plus years we ve got a nice energy among management team and so we re excited to to really push forward i think to some of the earlier questions around what are the opportunities for growth we certainly see quite a bit of organic growth inside of our portfolio today that we can still go cash so charles was right when he said that we want to focus on making sure we finished the integration but we ve got playbook of things that we re thinking about that we want to try to roll out over the next couple of years that we think will not only enhance the value of the real estate and the rents but make the customer stickier and i think if we get really good at that piece of our business we re not going to be talking about the history of invitation homes it s about where are we going haendel emmanuel st juste mizuho securities usa inc analyst helpful thank you another question i guess on the same store expense outlook i m curious how much asset sales might be helping that line item and then if you could confirm if the assets that you re contemplating selling are included in the same store pool and in that same store expense dallas b tanner president and chief executive officer director sure so i would say the assets that we have sold over the last period of time has been kind of neutral to our results as things came out from the bulk dispositions we saw the numbers looked like before and after it really didn t have a material impact with regards to what our numbers would have been for 2018 then for 2019 and out there s homes that we ve identified for sale and we vacate them that s when we take them out of same store because and those specifically will be homes we are trying to sell to end users not through a bulk disposition if there s homes that were identified for sale that we think might go through a bulk disposition and they remain occupied those we will keep in same store until we get to the point where we have them under contract we have a hard deposit and it s highly certain the transaction is going to happen so what will happen is throughout the year you will see some homes move out of same store and as they kind of go through the process or identified for sale so the answer is a little bit of both some of them are out of same store today but there will be some that we sell today that are currently in same store haendel emmanuel st juste mizuho securities usa inc analyst okay thanks and last one for me you ve mentioned seattle and california being some of your better markets and curious what are the more challenging markets and then what type of delta are you projecting between in terms of revenue between the upper and lower end of your portfolio in terms of revenue charles d young executive vice president and chief operating officer so this is charles i ll jump in on the markets where we see opportunity if you look in the results we put out dallas denver houston our occupancy was below where we wanted we ve seen a really nice trajectory in all three markets dallas has moved up into the 95s and we ve seen really good blended rent growth increase in january as well we have sustained that occupancy denver is on a really nice move we finished january above 95 95 2 and february continues to rise with blended rent growth also going houston we ve maintained our occupancy up to 95 rent growth kind of flat so we see those as markets that will continue to get better throughout the year if you look back over 18 we ve made really good progress on our florida markets and with such a large presence there orlando has been strong for us all year but tampa and south florida have really come along so we re excited about getting the whole portfolio balanced and operating similar to what we ve seen out in the west coast and our atlanta markets haendel emmanuel st juste mizuho securities usa inc analyst and quickly on tampa i recall there being the issue last year with some of the personnel just can you quickly update us on that where that stands personnel back in place regional or local property management teams fully operating and everything is i guess back to where you want it there or can you maybe give us some color on that charles d young executive vice president and chief operating officer yes we re in really good shape in tampa a lot of the noise you just discussed was early in the year we were able to address it quickly as we talked about and part of that is showing up in our results in q4 on both the top line and the bottom line so we feel really good around where tampa stands for us haendel emmanuel st juste mizuho securities usa inc analyst thank you charles d young executive vice president and chief operating officer thanks haendel operator the final question today will be from anthony paolone of jpmorgan please go ahead anthony paolone jpmorgan analyst thanks headliner so thanks for the disposition and acquisition guidance nets to zero how do you think about that versus maybe just reducing leverage a little bit faster charles d young executive vice president and chief operating officer well it s a great question we have to have a base case scenario and we feel very comfortable to ernie s earlier points on guidance with the guidance we re putting out we think we can acquire accretively somewhere between 300 million and 500 million we think we can also recycle easily between 300 million and 500 million on the sales side certainly if there s something opportunistic where we look at a situation that it might make sense we could look at selling or buying more but i would say that will help us the base case scenario that we laid out will help us achieve our goals we want to make sure that we have kind of an eye focused single to getting to investment grade and we know that by calling and selling the parts of the portfolio where we re seeing underperformance either recycling that capital or prepaying debt will put us on that path to that investment grade balance sheet that we ultimately want ernie i don t know if you want to add anything to that but i think that is generally how we feel about anthony anthony paolone jpmorgan analyst okay thanks and then you talked a lot about rate and occupancy and those drivers to the same store revenue picture is there anything appreciable to think about through either revenue management or other income that might contribute or not in 19 ernest m freedman executive vice president and chief financial officer yes we think other income will probably grow at a little bit less of a pace than it did in 2018 not significantly so but i think and that s our base case to get to our midpoint of guidance from a revenue management space i think overall there the team is doing a great job with both dallas and charles leadership to continue to trying to optimize and what we ve seen especially and we talked about it going into the fourth quarter we felt really good going into the offseason being highly occupied and then charles talked about what the january numbers are it s really putting us in a position to be more offensive than we ve been in the last couple of years as we get into peak leasing season that s not the wrong way to say more offensive we re just really pleased with where we are at the table and we can optimize and so the team is doing a nice job there and again it s another year of knowledge of both portfolios and teams working together so that sets us up we are set up well but we need to start accomplishing as we get to march april and may anthony paolone jpmorgan analyst so you think that the revenue management has actually been part of the driver to kind of the strong occupancy and some of this rate growth charles d young executive vice president and chief operating officer yes this is charles absolutely that was one of the first parts of the combined company that we put together and once we got onto the hood we were able to take best practices of both and it showed up early in the year but by the second half of the year we really hit our stride and it s showing up well in q4 and continues into 2019 anthony paolone jpmorgan analyst okay thanks and then last question just on g a you kind of talked about that but just on non cash comp any appreciable difference in 19 versus 18 on that front ernest m freedman executive vice president and chief financial officer yes there will be because a lot of that non cash comp that came from the ipo finished it s vesting in the early part of 2019 so majority of that expense was recognized in 17 and 18 so the non cash comp around share based comp does come down materially let me we had a question about that earlier too tony let me just think about how we can get something out there so folks can get more comfortable about modeling that it doesn t come into our core ffo number because it s been so volatile going forward it will be much less volatile but now that we re past the two year point there was a vesting period on the equity grants associated with the ipo for those of us those folks at invitation homes are here for that we ll get to much more of what i call normalized run rate of share based comp but let greg and i put our heads together and we ll try to figure out a way that we can provide some more help there for folks anthony paolone jpmorgan analyst okay great thank you operator and ladies and gentlemen this will conclude our question and answer session i would like to hand the conference back over to dallas tanner for his closing remarks dallas b tanner president and chief executive officer director

chairman and chief executive officer thanks roger and good morning everyone i d like to begin on slide five with a high level overview of 2018 following these initial comments jon will review the financial data of the fourth quarter and full year in more detail and then i ll come back and share our progress on the company s strategic priorities in 2018 based on the geopolitical and vehicle volume and mix dynamics around the world our results fell short of expectations the global team worked to offset these factors as much as possible with increases in operating efficiency and lean initiatives that yielded 80 million in operating cost reductions as well as significantly lower sga e expense in addition our continued focus on workplace safety resulted in 28 of our facilities achieving perfect safety performance with zero reported incidents for the year these metrics are even more meaningful given that we launched a record 196 new programs in the year and that was an increase of 16 over 2017 our superior products innovative technologies and high level of customer satisfaction continue to drive new orders for the full year 2018 we booked over 440 million in net new business awards which is a strong indicator of our future growth notably sales awards related to our new innovative product offerings totaled 287 million for the year and that s up 30 compared to 2017 so this shows that our customers are valuing the technology we re bringing to the market which is creating substantial competitive advantage and margin expansion opportunities going forward overall even though our results in the second half of the year were weighed down by challenging economic and market conditions we continued to perform well in 2018 in the areas of our business that we can directly control and we made considerable progress in the execution of our long term strategy for profitable growth now let me turn the call over to jon jonathan p banas executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks jeff and good morning everyone in the next few slides i ll provide some additional detail on our quarterly and full year financial results and put some context around some of the key items that impacted our earnings on slide seven we show a summary of our results for the fourth quarter and full year 2018 with comparisons to the prior year the year over year comparisons were challenging given the record quarter we had for both sales and ebitda achievement in the fourth quarter of 2017 fourth quarter 2018 sales were 872 million down 7 versus the fourth quarter of last year the year over year change was driven by unfavorable volume and mix foreign exchange and customer price adjustments partially offset by acquisitions adjusted ebitda for the fourth quarter was 76 4 million or 8 8 of sales compared to 131 million or 14 of sales in the fourth quarter of 2017 the change was a result of unfavorable volume mix in all regions customer price adjustments higher raw material costs and general inflation partially offset by improved operating efficiency and restructuring and other cost saving initiatives implemented during the year on a us gaap basis we incurred a net loss of 23 million in the quarter this included the net impact of 39 8 million in non cash goodwill impairment charges in our europe and asia segments 43 7 million in non cash impairment charges related to certain intangible and fixed assets in asia and europe as well as the net tax benefit related to deferred tax assets in france and in the us among other special items on an adjusted basis net income for the quarter was 27 5 million or 1 53 per diluted share for the full year sales of 3 63 billion were up 0 3 over last year we had positive contributions to sales from acquisitions improved volume and mix in north america and the net impact of foreign exchange these positive drivers were partially offset by customer price adjustments of approximately 2 of sales and unfavorable volume and mix in europe and asia adjusted ebitda at 376 5 million was down 16 7 year over year the key drivers of the decline were customer price adjustments unfavorable volume and mix and higher raw material costs partially offset by lower sga e and our cost saving and lean initiatives full year net income was 107 8 million or 5 89 per diluted share adjusted for the net impact of impairments tax adjustments and other special items net income for the year was 160 7 million or 8 79 per diluted share this compares to 208 million or 11 08 per diluted share in 2017 from a capex perspective we ended the year at 218 million or 6 of sale this was in line with our guidance and plans for the year as increased launch activity continued investment in innovation expansion of our spartanburg plant in advance of new fortrex launches and investment in our non automotive businesses drove higher capital demand capex for our core business was approximately 5 of sales while investments related to innovation and diversification added the other 1 moving to slide eight these charts quantify the significant drivers of the year over year change in our adjusted ebitda for the fourth quarter and full year in the quarter we achieved 23 million in cost savings through improved operating efficiency and we also reduced sga e expense by 5 million compared to the fourth quarter of last year these savings were more than offset by the negative impacts of 52 million from weaker volume and mix net of price 16 million in higher material costs and 15 million in higher expense related to wages and general inflation for the full year we achieved 80 million in cost savings through improved operating efficiency and 38 million of cost reductions in sga e these savings were again more than offset by the negative impacts of 126 million in unfavorable volume and mix net of price higher material costs of 44 million and wage increases general inflation and other items totaling 23 million in terms of adjusted ebitda margin company driven cost savings and improvements in our underlying performance resulted in positive contribution to margins of 70 basis points for the year however market factors negatively impacted margins by 280 basis points moving to slide nine our balance sheet and credit profile remain strong despite lower earnings and cash flow during the year we ended 2018 with 265 million of cash on hand this was after investing nearly 172 million in strategic acquisitions and returning more than 60 million to shareholders in the way of share repurchases during the year our total debt at year end was 831 million and net debt was 566 million this compares to total debt of 758 million and net debt of 242 million last year our gross debt was 2 2 times adjusted ebitda at year end on a net basis our leverage ratio was just 1 5 times with cash on hand and availability under revolver we had total liquidity of 409 million at year end and as a reminder we expect the sale of our avs business to provide approximately 200 million in cash at closing early in the second quarter of this year when combined with our current cash position and credit profile we expect to have more than adequate liquidity support our near term operating requirements as well as our longer term strategic plans and priority moving to slide 10 we issued our initial full year guidance for 2019 a few weeks ago and those same numbers and assumptions are provided again this morning we expect sales in the range of 3 4 billion to 3 6 billion in 2019 the net impact of divestitures and acquisitions is expected to reduce sales by approximately 160 million or around 4 versus 2018 other assumptions affecting the top line are continued weakness in asia and europe for the year and ongoing customer price adjustments albeit at a rate substantially lower than we experienced in 2018 capex is expected to be between 180 million and 190 million down from 218 million in 2018 we expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 16 to 18 for the year given the lower statutory rate in the us and plan geographic mix of earnings we expect our operations will again be successful in improving operating efficiency and lean savings we also anticipate incremental savings from recent restructuring activities combined these represent 360 basis points of margin improvement over 2018 however we also anticipate continuing headwinds from market driven factors given our outlook on commodity prices and assuming currently announced tariffs remain in effect for the year we would expect to see an adverse 180 basis points in raw material cost pressure this assumes no further tariff actions are implemented general inflation on wages energy rent and utilities is expected to drive 150 basis points of margin headwind and all other items are expected to add another 160 basis points of pressure our margin guidance assumes volume and mix essentially in line with 2018 levels moving to slide 11 free cash flow for the quarter and full year 2018 was weaker than in 2017 and short of our expectations this was primarily due to lower cash earnings the non recurring positive benefit at the start of our pan european factoring program in q4 of 2017 and higher capex losses we also made a discretionary pension contribution to our us plan in 2018 to benefit from the then current tax rate while we don t provide specific guidance our global team is committed and aligned to improving free cash flow in 2019 we have already taken proactive steps beginning in 2018 through reduced sga e and fixed overheads last year targeted actions reduced sga e expense and headcount saving 27 million with expected carryover benefit in 2019 we also expect to see the benefit of a recent voluntary separation program that is expected to drive further savings with less than a one year payback on the capital side our global team will centrally manage equipment specs and sourcing decisions better enabling us to evaluate and facilitate equipment redeployment opportunities similarly we now have centralized global leaders who are driving working capital optimization and are focused on reducing days inventory on hand in summary while we expect continued margin pressure in the near term we are committed to making 2019 one of our better years for free cash flow improvement and the good news is that this process of driving improved free cash flow has already begun now let me turn the call back over to jeff jeffrey s edwards chairman and chief executive officer okay thanks john so before wrapping up our discussion this morning i just want to take a few minutes to review our longer term strategic outlet and some of the reasons why we believe the next five years will provide greater opportunity for our company than the last five did so let s move to slide 13 we have many reasons to be positive about the future of our company and product innovation is just one this is an important year for fortrex in the automotive industry it s the year we launch our first major fortrex production program which will be on the 2020 ford explorer it is also the first year we expect to see a significant revenue impact from this important material science innovation our customers will soon be able to experience the difference fortrex makes and the overall advantages it provides on their vehicles as well as in the assembly process we ll be launching the new explorer sealing program in our plant in spartanburg south carolina where we recently completed a major expansion project focused specifically on fortrex production so following two years of planning execution significant capital investment the construction is now complete the equipment is in place and the training of production personnel is under way turning to slide 14 this chart shows our projected growth in innovation related revenue as you can see we have significant growth planned in each of our product categories so our innovations include much more than just the fortrex technology applied to our sealing products as our innovations go into production and ramp up we anticipate margin expansion opportunities as we set prices in accordance with the incremental value they provide our customers moving on to slide 15 another key reason to be positive about our outlook is the progress we ve made in our strategy to diversify the business building on the formalized structure we put in place in 2018 our advanced technology group is poised to deliver strong growth and margin enhancement going forward the industrial and specialty group will aggressively pursue share in a fragmented non automotive market estimated at approximately 3 2 billion globally this business will leverage our traditional technologies as well as our core product innovations to drive value in near adjacent industrial markets such as recreational vehicles power sport vehicles commercial trucks agriculture and off road equipment and appliances among others the applied materials science business will employ a license based business model to expand penetration of our fortrex chemistry platform into a broad range of high volume industrial and consumer applications with limited additional capital requirements for our company existence existing licensees inoac and polyone are progressing toward initial production and commercialization and we ve advanced our discussions and negotiations with several additional potential licensees in various market segments moving on to slide 16 the chart on slide 16 shows our plans for the growth of the advanced technology group the cumulative average growth rate of 21 takes into account book business as well as planned replacement and targeted new business within the industrial and specialty group it also assumes a number of new licensees within the applied materials science business it does not assume any further m a activity although this will continue to be part of our strategic growth plan for this business while we re not providing definitive guidance on the potential margins for this combined non automotive group we are confident that this business can eventually deliver ebitda margins similar to our north american core automotive business and significantly higher roic so it certainly makes for a very exciting part of our growth strategy going forward turning to slide 17 this chart provides a look at our overall growth expectations for the next five years with a significant portion of our future sales already booked over this period and the competitive advantages provided by our innovation we believe that our sales growth will significantly outpace the forecasted growth in light vehicle production we also expect china will continue to be a growth driver for us in our core automotive business and that s despite the current projections for slower growth in the near term it s the largest automotive market in the world china remains a tremendous opportunity for us to grow our top line and improve margins as we launch record numbers of new programs in the country and ultimately fill up our existing manufacturing plants the plan to strong revenue growth within our advanced technology group as i just discussed will also be key to our ability to outpace the growth of the global light vehicle market turning to slide 18 so to conclude our prepared comments this morning i really want to return our focus to the action plans and the opportunities to deliver improved value here in the short term on slide 18 we highlight a number of these opportunities including the further leveraging of our innovations to help offset price pressure and material cost increases optimizing cash flow as jon described and successfully concluding the sale of our avs business underlying all of this we re committed to continued improvements in operating efficiency and further cost savings estimated at a combined 130 million in 2019 to offset as much of the market headwinds as possible so in spite of our lower sales and earnings projections we expect to deliver significantly higher free cash flow in 2019 and as we do we will continue to be prudent yet opportunistic as it relates to the deployment of capital for strategic acquisitions as well as further share repurchases importantly we want to thank our global team of employees for their commitment to continuous improvement and dedication to delivering value to our customers and stakeholders in challenging market conditions we also want to thank our customers around the world for their continued trust and confidence in the cooper standard team this concludes our prepared comments so we can move on to the q a questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from john murphy with bank of america merrill lynch please go ahead john murphy bank of america merrill lynch analyst good morning guys and thanks for taking the time so a first question on the outlook on slide 10 and i appreciate the walk on the margins but if you were to look back at page eight which is sort of an absolute walk year over year in 2018 and obviously inaudible margin one is absolute dollars so i understand it s a little bit mixed up here but if we look back at slide eight the volume and mix was a negative 126 million i don t see any bar like that in slide 10 for that margin walk and once again no one s absolute ph no one s margins were not perfect but when you think about volume and mix in 2019 how are you kind of thinking about that headwind or maybe not such a big headwind is what we saw in 2018 and if we think about that bar in 2018 i mean how much of that was just pure volume as opposed to mix because mix doesn t seem like it should have been too negative in 2018 jonathan p banas executive vice president and chief financial officer hey john thanks for the question this is jon as far as the 2019 walk in my prepared remarks i kind of alluded to the fact that we expect the same mix profile throughout 2019 that we do in 2018 so that s why you don t see an incremental bar on that margin walk for the guidance levels so the same kind of profile for volume and mix that we saw in q3 and q4 that continues all the way throughout 2019 in our planning process so with respect to the 2018 impact it really was the story of the european footprint for us with some platforms that drove a true mix profile and then the china volumes being down there were where concentrated 90 of our sales go to global oems and detroit three oems so as they were significantly challenged in 2018 that impacted our volumes and mix profile during the year so again those two stories continue on into the 2019 that we foresee in the near future jeffrey s edwards chairman and chief executive officer john this is jeff let me continue that so back in mid january when we issued our guidance we talked about the uncertainty in the market in asia primarily china and also in europe obviously some of that is a result of the conversations going on right now around trade and we happen to believe that ll probably resolve itself hereby early summer at least that s our optimistic view we didn t put that into our guidance we felt that there was too much uncertainty to do that so we took the back half of 18 which was obviously significantly down from what anybody thought and that s what we put into the entire 2019 year so obviously that s a conservative approach but it s the one that we decided to go in john murphy bank of america merrill lynch analyst got you and so for section 301 you guys are assuming the 10 stays in place we don t go up to 25 and then here is an assumption that 232 in the us doesn t get put into place is that a or gets enacted as sort of a net zero is that a fair statement jeffrey s edwards chairman and chief executive officer yes john that s exactly right we re not assuming any additional tariffs come on board john murphy bank of america merrill lynch analyst got you okay and then just real quickly on europe the rde i mean it sounds like wltp like for everybody creates some disruption particularly at audi and vw have you heard anything about the rde testing sort of in the second half of this year and how far ahead of that your customers may or may not be jonathan p banas executive vice president and chief financial officer this is john jeff no we don t have an opinion there i can tell you that our concern in europe is a little different in terms of some of the uncertainty the geopolitical uncertainty obviously the trade discussion with china is having impact on europe i think the paris activity that existed back last year when we pulled out of that it s just driving some very unique behaviors across some segments in europe for us that were being impacted by so frankly that s more of the issue for cooper standard than the issues that you raised john murphy bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay and then just another question on the 440 million of net new business that you booked this year just curious sort of the cadence of the flow of that flowing on to the books and then also as we look at slide 14 kind of thinking about that business flowing on plus the innovative revenue flowing on i mean how should we think about sort of the net new business backlog over the next three or five years and what kind of growth above market so first really how fast does the 440 million flow on just so we can gauge how quickly you can win and grow the top line and then also sort of just a thought process around the next three to five years on net backlog jeffrey s edwards chairman and chief executive officer yeah john this is jeff so regarding how long it takes typically from the time we book an order do we go into production is somewhere between two and three years at this rate of change that s going on in the industry so it s not sort of four to five like it was in the old days so a lot faster and as we go forward i think we expect that we will continue to see similar opportunities that we have this year in terms of net new business john murphy bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it and then just lastly on the licensing side should we think about sort of 5 licensing fees on whatever dollar revenue that your partners sell or is that way too simplistic i mean how should we think about that licensing flow jeffrey s edwards chairman and chief executive officer yeah i think it s fair to say that as we do more of these john going forward we ll have more transparency around it so it would be premature for us to talk about specific numbers but in general terms the licensee approach that you ve described is pretty typical john murphy bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay great thank you very much guys jeffrey s edwards chairman and chief executive officer thanks john operator our next question comes from david tamberrino with goldman sachs please go ahead mariel kennedy goldman sachs analyst hi this is mariel on for david so our first question is just kind of on the industry production assumptions in your 2019 guidance you guys said that you were expecting weakness in asia and europe but it looks like in industry kind of assumptions you re pointing to a little bit of growth year over year is this in line with what you re seeing from customers or is the weakness just something more particular with your customer base jonathan p banas executive vice president and chief financial officer mariel this is jon thanks for the question yeah it s more particular to the customer base as we discussed on our last call the impact in the european story is really a mix discussion around a few significant platforms for our business there is some luxury suvs being produced in the european markets that we have some nice business with that was it was down in q3 and q4 of last year as well as some other premium vehicles and some b segment vehicles that really drove the mix decline for us so it s not so much the overall volume market in 2019 that we re concerned about it s that mix story continuing for that year mariel kennedy goldman sachs analyst okay and then more particularly with china is that sort of the same thing where you could still see it up year over year for the region or jonathan p banas executive vice president and chief financial officer are you talking about the overall production environment or cooper standard specific mariel kennedy goldman sachs analyst overall production and then cooper standard specific jonathan p banas executive vice president and chief financial officer okay well i guess i ll leave it to more experts in the china market to predict where that s going but the way the ihs looks china specific looks to be down year over year as far as in terms of production so we kind of model and follow through that but again with our heavy concentration on global oems and the detroit three oems our story is going to be a little bit more significant than the market decline mariel kennedy goldman sachs analyst okay jeffrey s edwards chairman and chief executive officer this is jeff i ll just add this for you this is additional information that we provided few weeks ago if you look at the mix related to western oems in china as jon just talked about that obviously in the short term that mix is hitting us pretty significantly but when you go out over the course of the next several years you ll see that our china business becomes much more diversified than it is today so by 2023 in fact 30 of the revenue in china will be with the chinese domestic automakers so as we go forward each year we ll have less and less dependence on the western companies and will shift a lot more balance over to the local chinese and our innovation is driving a lot of that they re very interested in the new products new innovation that we have to create a competitive advantage for them mariel kennedy goldman sachs analyst okay thanks for that detail and then just on the 70 million in innovation awards in the quarter how much of this was replacement versus new business can you break that out jonathan p banas executive vice president and chief financial officer we don t really have a specific breakout at hand it s little bit of a complicated mix but we can address that over the past period of time if you were to look at the last year or so on the innovation sales it s roughly 50 50 i just don t have the specific detail on the quarter at hand mariel kennedy goldman sachs analyst okay and then just the last question from us it seem like pricing again was negative in the quarter and it looked like it stepped up a little bit from 3q how is this kind of comparing to your expectations for pricing going forward and like i think the 2 range jeffrey s edwards chairman and chief executive officer yeah it s good question so just historically we ve been in the 1 5 to 1 7 just to frame that 2018 was definitely a year that we anticipated more pricing pressure and we got it we were in the 2 range as you just mentioned for 2019 that number is going to be a lot closer to 1 mariel kennedy goldman sachs analyst okay thanks so much for taking our questions jeffrey s edwards chairman and chief executive officer okay operator our next question comes from matt koranda with roth capital partners please go ahead matt koranda roth capital partners analyst hey guys good morning jeffrey s edwards chairman and chief executive officer good morning matt jonathan p banas executive vice president and chief financial officer hey matt matt koranda roth capital partners analyst in terms of the eu mix issue that you guys were referencing earlier i guess without getting too far over your skis and spring ph for customers why are those programs seeing headwinds in particular is that demand related in your view or is that sort of trade and production issues around brexit just a little more color would be helpful jeffrey s edwards chairman and chief executive officer sure matt this is jeff i was trying to allude to that with john s question earlier and it is difficult as you know to not talk specifically about our customers challenges there i tried to avoid that but clearly there are five vehicles matt that are affecting us one of them is a larger suv that s really a high end vehicle produced in the uk another is a large luxury passenger car produced in germany and then we have issues around what i would call small to mid cycle or mid segment vehicle that s produced in europe by a north american manufacturer that s high content per vehicle for us there s another one in italy that s an issue for us and this comes back to what we think is really driving the issue more of a geopolitical more of an environment focus obviously the diesel scandal had a lot to do with creating an awareness on top of the already existing environmental awareness in europe certainly the rhetoric around the paris discussions and ultimately the us pulling out of that i think all has led to some type of the challenge within the market on these larger upscale vehicles it just happened to be ones that we re producing large content per vehicle large profit per vehicle our customers make a lot of money on those vehicles therefore the supply base tends to follow so that s what s going on for us in europe and we ve assumed that that will continue through 2019 and that was the back half of 18 issue when this really started for us matt koranda roth capital partners analyst okay understandable and then just maybe a little help with the quarterly cadence for the year for 2019 i mean you guys did a good job with the bridge and explaining some of the headwinds but are there any launches that are going to drive some choppiness quarter to quarter i know you guys mentioned the explorer fortrex program in your slides for an example of a launch but how should we be sort of thinking about the sales and ebitda progress through the years as the quarters progress jeffrey s edwards chairman and chief executive officer yeah i think the good news there is that we ve got almost 200 new programs that we will be launching we are very confident in our ability to continue to do that and to do it well we historically last couple of years each year has been a record launch year for us 19 will also be a record launch year our teams are executing very well we don t have concerns matt that we ll have costs above what we ve already baked into our plans i mean statistically we re pretty good at predicting how much it s going to cost us to reach launch and if the last two years being any indication we re confident that 19 is covered with what we showed you jonathan p banas executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah matt and i won t break out the actual revenues for you specifically but i can give you a flavor of the launch cadence as jeff indicated there it s a record launch year and we re going to have over 250 launches in 2019 around 50 of those hit in q1 but then q2 and q3 are over 80 new launches and then it tails off at the end of the year so you can kind of get a feel for that launch cadence compared to how the business results are coming matt koranda roth capital partners analyst okay that s helpful and then just in terms of licensing and how that impacts the 2019 outlook i don t think you guys necessarily covered that i mean i m guessing it s de minimis or whatever you may get is mostly upside to the ebitda outlook but if you could clarify that that would be helpful and then maybe just also level set us on maybe the number of additional licensing agreements that you d expect to sign in the year jonathan p banas executive vice president and chief financial officer hey matt this is jon on the actual financial impact during the year we call that immaterial at this point and i don t want to give you any specific information just because we only have two deal signed right now because that would kind of give away an indication of commercial sensitivity there so we are nearing or i should say we re in discussions and nearing and hope to have about three to four new license agreements signed here in the coming months matt koranda roth capital partners analyst okay that s helpful guys i ll jump back in queue operator our next question comes from glenn chin with buckingham research please go ahead glenn chin buckingham research analyst good morning gentlemen jeffrey s edwards chairman and chief executive officer hey glenn jonathan p banas executive vice president and chief financial officer hey glenn glenn chin buckingham research analyst just a quick follow up on the customer pricing dynamics so you mentioned it ramped up in 2018 but then is expected to moderate in 2019 is that a function of i guess your negotiations for raw material recovery jeffrey s edwards chairman and chief executive officer hi glenn this is jeff yes glenn chin buckingham research analyst okay and then in the presentation jeff you mentioned opportunity to optimize your china manufacturing footprint what needs to be done to optimize that other than just filling up the plants jeffrey s edwards chairman and chief executive officer yeah the biggest thing glenn is the vertical integration for our fuel and brake business so we re in the early stage of launching a brand new tube plant there with our magalloy technology so that s for 2019 that s the biggest factor other than just launching product and putting it into the existing factories so this is a significant investment that we made during the 2018 year and it will come up to production here as we head into 2019 glenn chin buckingham research analyst okay and then in china and europe even excluding the non cash impairment charge so the way you guys disclosed the results by region it looks like even excluding those non cash impairment charges that profitability took a bit of a step down sequentially did anything accelerate or deteriorate in the quarter from third quarter to fourth quarter jonathan p banas executive vice president and chief financial officer hey glenn it s jon there it is just the further exacerbation of the mix story that we talked about earlier this is the big the big impact there in q4 glenn chin buckingham research analyst okay very good that s it for me thanks operator our next question comes from michael ward with seaport global please go ahead michael ward seaport global securities analyst thank you good morning just a follow up on that when you re referring to volume and mix customer mix is part of that correct jeffrey s edwards chairman and chief executive officer yes michael ward seaport global securities analyst okay and can you break down you just got 50 million of volume and mix hit in the fourth quarter can you break down how much of that was china and how much of that was europe is it about 50 50 or is it more tilted toward china jonathan p banas executive vice president and chief financial officer actually for q4 we had negative volume and mix in all regions even the north american footprint based on our customer mix profile took a bit of a hit but europe and asia kind of were equally weighted as far as that 40 million or 50 million you mentioned michael ward seaport global securities analyst okay when you talked about jeff you were just mentioning the commercial negotiations and if the math was right it s roughly 30 million of a help and jon when you alluded to the 60 million raw material pressures in 2019 is that net of the 30 million savings from commercial negotiations or is the 30 million negotiations a payback from 2018 in the negative impact jonathan p banas executive vice president and chief financial officer hey mike this is jon again the material economic numbers i gave you were the gross impact before going back for the price michael ward seaport global securities analyst okay so then and help out on the price sales for 2019 is that more of a payback for the pain you took in 2018 or is that exactly jonathan p banas executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah exactly that s exactly right mike michael ward seaport global securities analyst okay so when you re looking at that 60 million number for 2019 there is a chance we could get some positive commercial negotiations at some point jonathan p banas executive vice president and chief financial officer it s possible but typically those happen on a lag as is commodity inflation occurs during the year and the year closes out and then we kind of rack things up and go back to our customers with the overall scorecard and present at that time a minor amount there is actually indexed so you would get it on that two to three months lag but for the most part it s all based on negotiations michael ward seaport global securities analyst okay and as a ballpark figure for what you re spending on raw materials from out of these about 1 billion jonathan p banas executive vice president and chief financial officer good question i don t have that in hand but i think direct materials are about 50 of our overall cost of goods sold michael ward seaport global securities analyst goods sold jonathan p banas executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah michael ward seaport global securities analyst right so that s ballpark okay jonathan p banas executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah michael ward seaport global securities analyst thanks very much jeffrey s edwards chairman and chief executive officer okay mike jonathan p banas executive vice president and chief financial officer

answers call participants prepared remarks operator ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by welcome to the waste connections fourth quarter 2018 earnings conference call during the presentation all participants will be in a listen only mode afterwards we will conduct a question and answer session operator instructions as a reminder this conference is being recorded thursday february 14 2019 i would now like to turn the conference over to worthing jackman president of waste connections please go ahead sir worthing f jackman president okay thank you operator and good morning i d like to welcome everyone to this conference call to discuss our fourth quarter 2018 results and provide a detailed outlook for both the first quarter and full year 2019 i m joined this morning by mary anne whitney our cfo and several other members of our senior management team unfortunately ron mittelstaedt our ceo and chairman of the board is unable to participate on this morning s call due to an immediate family member s medical matter ron appreciates everyone s concerns and sends his best as noted in our earnings release 2018 finished on a high note as financial results for the fourth quarter exceeded expectations on better than expected solid waste organic growth e p waste activity and acquisition contribution we are also extremely pleased with our results for the full year as adjusted ebitda as a percentage of revenue expanded 30 basis points and adjusted free cash flow increased 15 2 increases in both solid waste pricing growth which was up 130 basis points year over year to 4 5 and e p waste activity enabled us to overcome the precipitous decline in recycled commodity values and certain cost pressures during the year the strength of these results continues to reflect the benefits of our purposeful culture differentiated strategy and disciplined execution 2018 was also noteworthy for the continuing elevated pace of acquisition activity our acquisition of american disposal in the fourth quarter brought total annualized acquired revenue to more than 360 million for the year with rollover revenue contribution of approximately 200 million in 2019 along with continued strong pricing growth this already positions us for high single digit revenue growth and another 30 basis points adjusted ebitda margin expansion in 2019 with any growth in solid waste volumes e p waste activity or additional acquisitions providing further upside we have increased adjusted free cash flow per share at a compounded rate of more than 15 per year over the past several years and expect continuing double digit adjusted free cash flow per share growth in the upcoming year our strong financial profile continues to afford the flexibility to fund outsized acquisition activity an increasing cash dividend and opportunistic share repurchases before we get into much more detail let me turn the call over to mary anne for our forward looking disclaimer and other housekeeping items mary anne whitney senior vice president and chief financial officer thank you worthing and good morning the discussion during today s call includes forward looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the u s private securities litigation reform act of 1995 including forward looking information within the meaning of applicable canadian securities laws actual results could differ materially from those made in such forward looking statements due to various risks and uncertainties factors that could cause actual results to differ are discussed both in the cautionary statement on page 3 of our february 13 earnings release and in greater detail on waste connections filings with the u s securities and exchange commission and the securities commissions or similar regulatory authorities in canada you should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements and information as there may be additional risks of which we are not presently aware or that we currently believe are immaterial which could have an adverse impact on our business we make no commitment to revise or update any forward looking statements and information in order to reflect the events or circumstances that may change after today s date on the call we will discuss non gaap measures such as adjusted ebitda adjusted net income attributable to waste connections on both a dollar basis and per diluted share and adjusted free cash flow please refer to our earnings releases for a reconciliation of such non gaap measures to the most comparable gaap measure management uses certain non gaap measures to evaluate and monitor the ongoing financial performance of our operations other companies may calculate these non gaap measures differently i ll now turn the call back over to worthing worthing f jackman president thank you mary anne in the fourth quarter solid waste price plus volume growth was 4 9 exceeding the high end of our outlook for the period by almost 100 basis points and volumes turned positive for the first time in 2018 in the fourth quarter solid waste pricing growth was our highest reported price in a decade at 4 8 up 30 basis points sequentially and up 120 basis points year over year as noted in prior quarters our pricing strength reflects the differentiation of our market model and intense focus on execution as we implemented and more importantly retained additional price increases during 2018 to address recycling headwinds and certain cost pressures including third party logistics and fuel once again in q4 our pricing range from approximately 3 in our more exclusive markets in the western region to an average of about 5 5 in our more competitive regions reported volume growth in q4 turned positive for the first time since we began intentional shedding of lower quality revenue and unsafe to service accounts acquired in the progressive waste transaction volumes were up 10 basis points and well above the high end of our expected range for the period we continue to believe yet prudent to be cautious on volume growth in this environment with anything positive being upside looking across our regions volumes were driven most notably by our western region which was up over 3 in the quarter while canada and our southern region though showing some improvement sequentially were both down year over year between 0 5 and 1 5 as we continue to anniversary the mostly completed intentional shedding in those regions looking at 2019 we expect pricing growth to continue to average about 4 5 likely starting higher than that on a reported basis early in the year and we expect reported volumes to be down about 50 basis points due to the remaining purposeful shedding of poor quality revenue with underlying volumes about flat year over year we believe that our 2018 results are indicative of the effectiveness of a price led organic growth strategy and as noted earlier we will continue to view any increases in underlying volumes as upside looking at year over year results in the fourth quarter by line of business on a same store basis commercial collection revenue increased approximately 6 5 mostly due to price increases roll off revenue increased approximately 3 5 on higher revenue per pull in the u s pulls per day decreased about 1 and revenue per pull was up 3 in canada pulls per day decreased about 1 5 and revenue per pull increased about 7 5 solid waste landfill tonnage increased about 1 on increases in msw tons up about 3 led by increases in the northeast and california and c d tons up about 4 on increases across several markets led by the northeast and texas special waste tons were down about 4 in q4 a smaller year over year decrease than in prior quarters as tough comps began to ease a bit recycling revenue excluding acquisitions was about 20 million in the fourth quarter down 8 million or almost 30 the smallest year over year decrease in 2018 due to easier comparisons on prices for occ or old corrugated containers and a slight increase sequentially occ prices in q4 averaged about 93 per ton which was down 23 from the year ago period and up 6 sequentially from q3 mixed paper revenue ex acquisitions declined approximately 45 year over year as values remain between zero and 5 per ton we believe that the flow through from changes in recycling revenue was similar to prior quarters with detrimental margins of approximately 95 due to the combination of lower fiber values and higher recycling processing costs resulting in an impact of about 7 5 million in ebitda and about 0 02 per share of eps in q4 occ prices currently average about 85 per ton reflecting some recent weakness which is down about 10 from q4 and down about 15 from last year s average of 102 in the first quarter we expect recycled commodity values to remain around these levels for the full year looking at e p waste activity we reported 64 million of e p waste revenue in the fourth quarter up 20 year over year and down slightly sequentially from q3 reflecting a lower seasonal decline than typically seen we have not experienced a notable impact in activity levels resulting from weakening crude prices in late 2018 that said we remain cautious in our outlook for e p waste activity and will let any increases in activity or ramping of newly constructed locations be upside in the year looking at acquisition activity as noted earlier we closed the previously announced acquisition of american disposal in december which along with other acquisitions completed earlier in 2018 provides rollover acquisition contribution of about 200 million in 2019 coming off of two years of outsized activity during which we essentially completed four years worth of acquisitions we continue to believe that the factors that were viewed favorably by sellers are still relevant that is sellers continue to note the strength of their underlying businesses the clarity around taxes as a result of tax reform and higher reinvestment rates as drivers for transactions dialog remains active and the pipeline continues to be robust in short we believe 2019 could be another year for outsized acquisition activity in 2018 we deployed over 1 billion in acquisitions and returned over 210 million to shareholders including opportunistically buying back stock during december sell off and we remain well positioned for potential continued outsized capital deployment in the upcoming year now i d like to pass the call to mary anne to review more in depth the financial highlights of the fourth quarter and provide a detailed outlook for q1 and full year 2019 i will then wrap up before heading into q a mary anne whitney senior vice president and chief financial officer thank you worthing in the fourth quarter revenue was 1 26 billion up 104 6 million over the prior year period and about 37 million above our outlook due to higher organic growth and solid waste and e p waste as well as contribution from closing the american disposal acquisition in december in total acquisitions completed since the year ago period contributed about 66 5 million of revenue in the quarter or about 61 4 million net of divestitures adjusted ebitda for q4 as reconciled in our earnings release was 397 2 million about 11 2 million above our outlook for the period on higher than expected revenue and up over 36 million year over year despite an estimated hit to ebitda from recycled commodities of approximately 7 5 million adjusted ebitda as a percentage of revenue was 31 5 in q4 in line with our outlook and up 30 basis points year over year excluding the margin dilutive impact of acquisitions contributing in the period adjusted ebitda margins were up about 80 basis points in q4 despite the impact of lower recycled commodity values looking at the full year ebitda margins were up 30 basis points on the strength of price led organic growth and e p waste activity in spite of the 70 basis point impact from recycling fuel expense in q4 was about 3 7 of revenue up 10 basis points year over year we averaged approximately 2 65 per gallon for diesel in the quarter which was up about 0 04 from the year ago period and down about 0 07 sequentially from q3 depreciation and amortization expense for the fourth quarter was 14 of revenue up 10 basis points year over year due to increased depreciation and amortization expense from acquisitions closed since the year ago period interest expense in the quarter increased by 2 7 million over the prior year period to 35 2 million due primarily to higher total borrowings as compared to the prior year period however this increase was partially offset by 1 5 million in higher interest earnings from invested cash balances net of interest earnings interest expense in the period was 31 7 million up 1 2 million year over year debt outstanding at quarter end was about 4 2 billion approximately 23 of which was floating rate and our leverage ratio as defined in our credit agreement ended the year at 2 45 times debt to ebitda with cash balances of almost 320 million our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 20 3 slightly lower than expected gaap and adjusted net income per diluted share in q4 were 0 50 and 0 63 respectively adjusted net income in q4 primarily excludes the impact of intangibles amortization and other acquisition related items and impairments as noted earlier the impact to our adjusted net income per diluted share from recycling was a drag of about 0 02 in q4 adjusted free cash flow in 2018 was 879 9 million or 17 9 of revenue and approximately 20 million higher than expected than anticipated due to better than expected collection activity on the final day of the year essentially pulling some 2019 cash flow into 2018 i will now review our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2019 before i do we d like to remind everyone once again that actual results may vary significantly based on risks and uncertainties outlined in our safe harbor statement and filings we ve made with the sec and the securities commissions or similar regulatory authorities in canada we encourage investors to review these factors carefully our outlook assumes no change in the current economic and operating environment it also excludes any impact from additional acquisitions or divestitures that may close during the remainder of the year and expensing of transaction related items during the period looking first at the full year 2019 revenue in 2019 is estimated to be approximately 5 310 billion for solid waste we expect organic growth of approximately 4 this includes price of about 4 5 with volumes down about 50 basis points due to the remaining shedding of poor quality revenue primarily the impact of the new york city department of sanitations marine terminal operations contract with a third party underlying volumes are expected to be essentially flat adjusted ebitda in 2019 as reconciled in our earnings release is expected to be approximately 1 705 billion or about 32 1 of revenue up about 30 basis points year over year in spite of over 30 basis points of dilutive margin impact from approximately 200 million in rollover acquisition contribution already in place for the year regarding tax rates we noted in our earnings release that laid in december 2018 the irs released proposed regulations associated with the tax act that we believe if finalized could impact our current effective tax rate of 21 5 depending on the final form of any proposed regulations we estimate that our resulting effective tax rate for 2019 could range between 21 5 and 26 5 the proposed regs are not anticipated to be finalized until june or thereabout if they do indeed get approved as final and that timing will impact our effective tax rate from quarter to quarter during the year for example our first quarter tax rate in 2019 is not expected to be impacted from these proposed regs and should be about 20 in the period excluding these proposed regs our effective rate for q2 to q4 would average about 22 for a full year effective rate of 21 5 however for the full year our outlook assumes that some form of the proposed regs is enacted and reflects the midpoint of our expected range or a 24 effective tax rate adjusted free cash flow in 2019 as reconciled in our earnings release is expected to be approximately 950 million or about 17 9 of revenue to be clear the potential tax rate impact from proposed regulations as noted earlier has already been considered in our guidance for adjusted free cash flow turning now to our outlook for q1 2019 revenue in q1 is estimated to be approximately 1 24 billion we expect price growth for solid waste to be in the range of 4 5 to 5 in q1 with volume of approximately negative 1 about half of which is due to the purposeful shedding including the impact of the new york city department of sanitations marine terminal operations contract and additional impact from severe winter weather conditions adjusted ebitda in q1 is estimated to be approximately 30 9 of revenue or about 383 million down 40 basis points year over year but up 25 basis points when adjusted for the 65 basis point margin dilutive impact of acquisitions this impact is most pronounced in q1 due to the timing of deals in 2018 depreciation and amortization expense for the first quarter is estimated to be about 14 1 of revenue of that amount amortization of intangibles in the quarter is estimated to be about 30 6 million or 0 08 per diluted share net of taxes interest expense net of interest income in q1 is estimated to be approximately 35 million our effective tax rate in q1 as noted earlier is estimated to be about 20 subject to some variability the effective rate for the period includes about a 4 million benefit to the provision related to excess tax benefits associated with equity based compensation and finally non controlling interest is expected to reduce net income by about 200 000 in the first quarter and now let me turn the call back over to worthing for some final remarks before q a worthing f jackman president okay thank you mary anne 2018 was truly a remarkable year considering the challenges that we overcame and the results we delivered to drive our 15th consecutive year of positive shareholder returns completing another outsized year of acquisitions overcoming the headwinds of recycling certain cost pressures and lower margin acquisitions to drive reported margin expansion and further reducing the frequency of safety related incidents would be noteworthy in any environment but even more so when facing the constraints of low unemployment in many markets these accomplishments would not have been possible without the tireless efforts of our over 16 000 dedicated employees at waste connections we believe that accountability is integral to everything we accomplish and is ultimately what sets us apart given the headwinds that we were able to overcome in 2018 we appreciate the greater visibility we have coming into 2019 with high single digit revenue growth already in place continuing adjusted ebitda margin expansion and another year of targeted double digit adjusted free cash flow per share growth and again any increases in solid waste volumes e p waste activity or additional acquisitions would provide further upside appreciate your time today i will now turn this call over to the operator to open up the lines for your questions stacey questions and answers operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of brian maguire with goldman sachs please proceed with your question brian maguire goldman sachs analyst hey good morning worthing and mary anne and ron if you re listening hope all is well hope to hear some good news guys just a trying to put aside the quarter and the outlook just kind of a bigger picture question for you to start off it seems like consumer sentiment and mood around single use plastic single use consumable items has been shifting a lot in the last year or so and europe is certainly has moved a lot of our packaging companies and are seeing the impact of that and you guys seem to be sort of part of the solution potentially with your recycling operations has been sort of a push to increase recyclability of single use items but obviously the economics of that aren t really great especially these days but potentially this could morph into more than just a war on plastics could become more of a war on waste and just thinking about how do you guys really think about that impacting your business over the longer term obviously not something that probably is going to impact 2019 or maybe even 2020 but just do you expect that we ll see tighter regulation on landfill expansions or could states and municipalities sort of do expansion of landfills as encouraging more waste any efforts you guys can do to increase the recyclability of items or is it are we really is dependent on getting some government help or things like that worthing f jackman president brian you stopped year count at 2020 and i d suggest you probably have to go well beyond 2020 before you d see any impact notable within our business i mean clearly bifurcation and separation of the waste stream at the source is a growing trend obviously we applaud that because it helps the purity of what s going through our facilities i mean obviously what folks are also realizing when you try to do increased source separation to improve recycling recovery that cost more money and so you do have this intersection of desires to recycle maybe reuse intersecting with the likely increase in the cost to do so but i d say in the near term which easy looking at over the next decade or more i don t think you d see a notable impact in anything within our business now are we always looking at new technologies to improve our processing capabilities in our facilities absolutely but that s evolutionary it s not revolutionary brian maguire goldman sachs analyst okay appreciate the color just switching gears worthing your comments on the m a environment certainly encouraging i guess you obviously mentioned you ve done a lot of deals in the last two years just wondering how you would balance the need to integrate those deals effectively and the risk involved with that versus the opportunities that you got in front of them do you think 2019 is going to be more of a year just integrating what you ve already done and digesting it or could this be another front forward year where we see something similar to what we saw in 2018 worthing f jackman president well obviously it s hard to predict the ultimate amount we do in 2019 but i back up to your first question around integration we these are some gold plated companies that were acquired in 2018 with fantastic management teams in fact if you start with the biggest transactions work your way down from the bigger transactions the existing teams are running the businesses have stayed with the businesses and so its required very few heads on our side to relocate into these operations and so it s not stressed our bench at all what i d say on how are they doing i look no further than the initial company we purchased in 2018 bay disposal and you look at the integration of bay disposal and the adoption of our culture bay disposal led our company last year in incident reduction down almost 70 and exiting the year with the single irate moving forward again so i think we don t wait sit around and hope integration happens i think the team pops on at early on i think the support that we give acquired companies is second to none it s not like we buy a business and all of a sudden start believing that we can jam them with emails and jam them with requests what we do is we flood them with people to support and to grow and develop the business and integrate the business immediately not the other way around so i d say success in 18 and the amount of activity done in the past two years is no way precluding us from what we could do in 19 and again we remain well positioned should 19 become another outsized year brian maguire goldman sachs analyst okay great to hear i ll turn it over now thanks operator our next question comes from the line of hamzah mazari with macquarie capital sir please proceed with your question hamzah mazari macquarie securities group analyst good morning thank you my question is on m a as well could you maybe talk about how you re managing to keep returns on capital on these deals similar to what you ve done historically just given valuations have stepped up in the private market so any thoughts on returns on deals worthing f jackman president sure and as we ve said before in prior calls clearly multiples have gone up half a turn to a turn or so over the past couple of years but that s a combination of things i mean initially it was combination of very high quality companies we re buying with high quality assets meaning companies that had over invested in the years up to sale and obviously that means if you re looking at returns on a cash on cash basis those returns benefit from lower capex required early on after acquiring the business by the way the inverse happens too when we take that out in valuations if someone s under invested and we think we have to over invest post closing so that s what initially drove it a couple years ago obviously the change in tax law with regards to lower tax rates in the u s and immediate expensing of required capital based on how the deals are structured that also accelerates obviously cash flow and lower tax rate puts more cash flow on our pocket too and so we haven t seen a major change in targeted irrs it s just the fact that the other changes that affect how we deduct our purchase price how we can accelerate cash flow delivery as well as the quality of assets also drives those returns hamzah mazari macquarie securities group analyst great and just a follow up question on the volume side is your commentary just incrementally more cautious or is it just conservatism i guess underlying volumes are flat but it feels like the u s consumer is still pretty strong the job market is strong gdp is up so just any disconnect in sort of your volume commentary is it a comp issue or just any thoughts there mary anne whitney senior vice president and chief financial officer no i wouldn t say any disconnect or change in what we re seeing i would start by reminding that we always come into every year pretty cautious after coming off we had five years in a row of very strong volumes last year not on a reported basis because of the shedding but continued strong underlying volumes as we ve discussed in places like the west coast which we highlighted in q4 the other thing i would note hamzah is in the last two quarters we ve guided to volumes being down 50 basis points to 100 basis points and we ve beaten by on that by almost 100 basis points in both cases so as we 100 basis points in both cases so as we come into this year and we saw the weather in january and of course we have already described the purposeful shedding that we already know about that s hitting 19 we think it s prudent to guide to volumes being flat and letting volumes be upside but to be clear no change in what we re seeing out there worthing f jackman president yeah hamzah as we ve been saying all along we think the u s economy generally is in that 1 to 2 range and the canadian economy somewhere in that 0 to 1 change growth from on an underlying basis and i d also point out i mean you can slice and dice stuff as much as you want you can say tongue in cheek if you exclude all the negatives volume is nicely positive so i mean you got to be careful about what you want to exclude and trying to lead a message but we think it s always better to be cautious and let volumes be upside hamzah mazari macquarie securities group analyst yeah got you just last question i will turn it over the proposed regs that are impacting taxes for you is that specific to you because of a tax inversion that you guys did or is this sort of common for most companies thank you mary anne whitney senior vice president and chief financial officer so hamzah to answer to your question about proposed regs they do include some potential limits on the deductibility of interest in the united states which could impact us if they get promulgated as proposed and so that s why we mentioned them and think it s prudent in our guidance to include that midpoint of the range of where they could end up but again to be clear nothing s happened yet and they won t impact q1 worthing f jackman president it affects all companies with cross border the inter company financing i d say capital is flowing across countries this could get caught in so it s any company with multinational operations hamzah mazari macquarie securities group analyst got you thank you operator our next question comes from the line of tyler brown with raymond james please proceed with your question tyler brown raymond james associates analyst hey good morning guys worthing f jackman president hey good morning tyler mary anne whitney senior vice president and chief financial officer good morning tyler brown raymond james associates analyst hey our thoughts go out to ron but hey mary anne i appreciate the q1 guide but could you guys put a finer point on the progression of the change in ebitda margins as the year progresses it sounds like you re going to be most burdened with the rollover of m a early in the year and then that abates as the year progresses is that the right way to think about it mary anne whitney senior vice president and chief financial officer that is tyler yes as i said it s over 30 basis points for the full year and the cadence would be as follows it s about a 65 basis point margin dilutive impact in q1 and that increase decreases to about 40 basis points in q2 steps down to about 20 basis points in q3 and mostly gone by q4 but about 10 basis points in q4 so overall that works out to be between 30 basis points and 35 basis points for the year tyler brown raymond james associates analyst okay very helpful and then mary anne i know this is very fluid but what is your expectation for cash taxes as a percent of that 24 book accrual mary anne whitney senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah so the expectation for cash taxes as a percentage of book is about between 60 and 65 tyler brown raymond james associates analyst okay and does that change as time goes on will that go higher mary anne whitney senior vice president and chief financial officer as we said to be clear our 950 million in free cash flow guidance already incorporates a consideration for our expectations around taxes worthing f jackman president but obviously it does if you go all the way out to 2023 when bonus depreciation expires obviously you start at 60 65 and starts migrating above 85 90 especially when you intersect into 2023 when most of your capex outlays over the prior five years have been fully expensed tyler brown raymond james associates analyst okay and then worthing this is a conceptual question but you guys are guiding to say 60 basis points of core solid waste margins on a very healthy 4 5 price your larger competitors are guiding to give or take say 30 basis points of margin expansion with 2 to high 2 ph pricing so where do you think the disconnect is is it that you are being conservative or do you have some sort of differing unit cost inflation setup am i reading too much into this or just any thoughts broadly there worthing f jackman president well look i don t know what s driving the outlook of other companies in the space all we can address is how we look at things look just look at our experience quarter in and quarter out or year in and year out we try to put numbers out there in february that provide enough push and as we look at the entire year for the proverbial unknowns that can hit you and obviously if we re able to dodge more of those unknowns you ll see nice upside to our outlook putting numbers out there and then recrafting the truth as you move through the year to try to reinterpret people s perceptions is not what we try to do during the year we just lay it all out there and let our numbers speak for themselves tyler brown raymond james associates analyst okay that s helpful and then just one last one mary i think you mentioned two spot four or five ph debt to ebitda today curious can you talk about what you view as your optimal capital structure where do you kind of want that leverage ratio long term thanks mary anne whitney senior vice president and chief financial officer sure we re certainly very comfortable being higher than that and sort of in the 2 75 times range we think is a good place to be because what we know is that we could then with the ability to take leverage up to 3 5 times or even higher for an outsized deal to the extent that opportunity were to present itself but what we know is we will de lever dynamically about half a turn within year and we like staying in that 2 75 times to 3 times range tyler brown raymond james associates analyst all right guys thank you very much operator our next question comes from the line of derek spronck with rbc please proceed with your question derek spronck rbc capital analyst good morning worthing and mary anne thank you for taking my questions just on the proposed changes tax changes should we assume that the cash flow impact would be the differential of the effective tax rate of 24 from 21 5 mary anne whitney senior vice president and chief financial officer well as i said derek we think of it more that this impact gaap and really is less a matter of cash and that s why we tried to give you free cash flow guidance that says look don t worry about that we ve already factored that in it s really a gaap issue derek spronck rbc capital analyst so technically there wouldn t be much of a if the regulation didn t come through there wouldn t be much of a free cash flow tailwind is that correct mary anne whitney senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah as you know we try to come into the year with some visibility on what we think we can deliver and that s how we factored in the 950 million so at this point we d leave it at that i think what s helpful is we ll know more in april when we re on this call and so we ll be able to give clear guidance derek spronck rbc capital analyst okay great worthing f jackman president remember we apologized for overdelivering in 2018 so let s don t start raising the 950 million on us right now derek spronck rbc capital analyst okay it s the opposite of what i usually do is over promise under deliver but just moving on to some of the items in the 10 k you have 14 landfills that you re seeking expansion and it also indicated around 10 of your workforce is going through or will be going through a collective bargaining agreement in 2019 is this just standard business for waste connections or is there any risk that could be tied with those two developments worthing f jackman president now i d say pull out all the prior case and you ll see similar ratios this is just standard fare of solid waste business when you have a large portfolio of landfills every company is going through episodic expansions that s common obviously when you have a large workforce and multiple underlying contracts with unions we re negotiating those all the time we just got a couple of finished earlier this year already and such as part of the day to day blocking and tackling mary anne whitney senior vice president and chief financial officer and i would just add derek that a number of the landfills with the shorter lives are very small and probably one of the largest is one that s been on there literally for years where we have other landfill right in the same market which so we ve been anticipating the closure derek spronck rbc capital analyst okay got it that s great and then just one more for myself free cash flow as a percent of revenue originally it was around 15 that was a sustainable run rate 2017 was 16 5 2018 18 and looks like 2019 is shaping up to be in and around 18 is that largely from the changes in the cash tax regime or is it partly due to the you leveraging economies of scale or how should we think about that ratio on a sustainable basis here worthing f jackman president well we have always said don t own us for 55 ebitda to free cash flow conversion that will be coming down over time it will probably go into the low 50s not the mid 50s and so we fully expect that to come down over time obviously as we talked before as cash taxes go up as bonus depreciation expires in 2022 and so that will always move down over the course of time but as we sit here today we don t see anything lowering that bringing that below 50 anywhere anytime soon but again as you know as we ve always said as you look at ebitda to free cash flow conversion we always say that not only ebitda creates same amount of free cash flow that s a combination of obviously the financial profile and the performance we have on our collection side of the business which again is 60 plus of revenue it s a combination of and that s lower asset intensive business it s a combination of how we structure acquisitions and looking for our basis and transactions and that impacts cash taxes so there are host of things that drive comparisons against other companies but again for us 55 don t model that long term we ve been consistently saying that for some time now we will enjoy 55 we can do it but that s not a long term number derek spronck rbc capital analyst you have pretty good visibility though to 2020 though that should be in and around that level is that correct worthing f jackman president yeah we try to have visibility beyond that derek spronck rbc capital analyst yeah ok thank you very much i ll leave it there operator our next question comes from the line of noah kaye with oppenheimer please proceed with your question noah kaye oppenheimer co inc analyst hi good morning first just a quick math question on the recycling so assuming the basket s down 15 year over year and that sort of decrementals continue this is about a 10 million to 15 million ebitda headwind for 19 is that right worthing f jackman president no i mean that s mostly a q1 thing we re talking about here because q1 was the toughest comp year over year once you get past q1 it s nominal noah kaye oppenheimer co inc analyst okay so the full year headwind we re talking mid single digits worthing f jackman president couple of million bucks noah kaye oppenheimer co inc analyst okay and then just to piggyback off of a earlier cash tax question so essentially you had very low accrual in 18 you go into 19 and basically you re looking at cash taxes at about a 70 million or so headwind year over year so essentially what i read into this that underlying free cash flow growth is in the double digits is that a fair statement mary anne whitney senior vice president and chief financial officer again we did point out that we essentially over delivered in 18 so i do think if you back that out you do see nice underlying growth beyond what we re showing here so yes you re right we had the big over accrual coming into 18 it s on a reported basis our cash taxes will be up about 75 million year over year and we ll continue to deliver free cash flow so that is fair noah kaye oppenheimer co inc analyst okay great and then maybe one last one i walked past a waste connections hauling truck this morning in new york city and after reading a lot of press around plans for new york city to move toward commercial its own franchising and the experience that la has had so far i guess generally do you see this as a medium term trend in more of your urban markets and if so how positive or negative do you think it is for waste connections worthing f jackman president no we don t see this as a trend i mean l a was late to the party relative to those markets in the west coast new york city it s just something that makes sense in that tight operating environment dozens of trucks shouldn t be crisscrossing each other on crowded streets at all times of the day and the risk profile is just too high for many operators the quality of the equipment that they can pick on the street is very low because of the financial positions they re in and so it makes sense for new york to follow the heels of l a now how new york structures it in the end is still remain to be seen but we don t see this as a trend in other markets noah kaye oppenheimer co inc analyst okay thanks very much operator our next question comes from the line of michael hoffman with stifel please proceed with your question michael hoffman stifel analyst hi worthing and mary anne thanks for taking my questions if you do no deals in 19 can we continue to think about the structural organic growth in solid waste is in between 4 and 5 worthing f jackman president yeah we ve been consistently saying it s a tune of 4 and 6 number especially with this cpi and this pricing environment being 4 5 plus michael hoffman stifel analyst okay and then again no deals in 19 how long does it take to recover that 30 basis points 35 basis points of 19 s dilution from deals worthing f jackman president recover again what you have is the acquisitions within the embedded in the base calculation and so then you re looking at a jumping off point again up 30 basis points year over year coming out of 19 then obviously if you don t have the rollover of any dilutive transactions in the year again you re looking at that typical 30 basis point to 40 basis point type margin expansion in 2020 albeit let s wait and see how the economy is but no again when you ve got the such a large denominator right now it s rare that acquisitions move the needle on a notable basis but when you have a deal as large as american at 3 5 of revenue coming in a comparative margins down 600 basis points because it s collection oriented that s about a 20 basis point impact to consolidated margins but again if it s depends on the size of the year for acquisitions obviously if you do no deals which we ve never done then you don t have that influence on the reported margins going forward as mary anne said as you begin to anniversary deals did last year you see less and less of a drag in the reported numbers and therefore the printed margin expansion will be a lot higher as you move through the year relative to how we start the year michael hoffman stifel analyst right i was just trying to draw that out and then to be clear you see no line of business weakness no regional weakness prospects are probably flat housing consumer remains engaged mary anne whitney senior vice president and chief financial officer as i said earlier there s nothing that s changed that would influence our volume outlook we think it s pretty consistent with the way we ve been communicating volumes for the last two quarters and again guiding down and then delivering better than that and we d prefer to start the year the same way worthing f jackman president but i guess you know michael this is such a fixed bill system business that if you have a high market share model generally it s a tone of the underlying economy that s going to drive volume growth and reported numbers our business is not about market share grabbing it s about servicing the underlying markets that we operate in michael hoffman stifel analyst yeah and my question wasn t specific about volume it was about a macro view you re not seeing line of business weakness you re not seeing regional weakness housing i m assuming you re saying you think it s going to be flattish and you still see the consumer engaged that s what i was asking worthing f jackman president that s all a fair statement we saw all that in january to confirm at least one month of 2019 michael hoffman stifel analyst okay and then just two more questions just to clarify something if you re doing double digit per share growth in free cash flow obviously you re going to be pretty active in the buyback because you ve got to average at least 2 that s the right way to think about that right worthing f jackman president yeah i mean as we ve always said if you look back for past several years the numerator has been what that had been the key driver to high teens cagr on free cash flow per share growth but as the large numbers proceed you ve got a combination of higher numerator and lower denominator that eventually comes into play because we re just spitting out more cash flow than we need to deploy in acquisitions because again we re cash funding all acquisitions delevering the balance sheet we ve got more than enough capacity and flexibility to affect the numerator and the denominator going forward michael hoffman stifel analyst great and then last for me just to be clear about an earlier question waste connections is completely indifferent about what they would do with the trash once they collect it as long as you generate a reasonable return on the capital you deploy it so whatever changes may come slowly you ll be ought to react to because you ll control it at the curve in a loading dock worthing f jackman president no one around here is changing that drive michael that s right michael hoffman stifel analyst okay all right great thanks operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from the line of chris murray with altacorp capital please proceed with your question chris murray altacorp capital analyst thanks good morning folks just follow on maybe on michael s question a little bit around the free cash flow guidance so the number year over year looks to start at around 8 and so i guess a couple of pieces to this first of all expecting kind of high single digit revenue growth you would have expected it would ve been higher what s the drag embedded in that number from the tax change i guess is the first piece of that and then second i think about you think about your target leverage or sitting call it 300 million in cash you re going to have the free cash flow generation should we start thinking about maybe a change in how you approach it as a buyback or something like that i mean historically 2 to 4 of shares bought back but is there any opportunity to maybe step up that number as that free cash flow number expands worthing f jackman president as you know everything s possible again that s the flexibility we have again if you look at the free cash flow we look at it as actually a double digit growth because again last year we were talking about 860 million and looking at in 2019 of 950 million that s little over 10 growth in free cash flow on a dollar basis we ve already apologized for giving 20 million more in 2018 and delivered 880 million instead of 860 million but again it s too early to change the target of 950 million inaudible what that means is probably could have be 970 million or more of that 20 million cleared the bank on january 2nd instead of december 31st and so one of the difference of a day makes that s a difference of a day makes so we re less focused on that that s just a timing issue of when some checks cleared mary anne whitney senior vice president and chief financial officer and i guess the other piece of it regarding leverage and the ability to do more in terms of buybacks as worthing said there are a number of things that are possible and we have so much flexibility we continue to believe we re in a period of outsized m a activity as worthing had said and so that will continue to be our highest and best use of cash but again we exited the year at sub 25 with over 300 million in cash on the balance sheet and guided to 950 million in free cash flow so that s 800 million after the dividend so we have ample firepower to do what we did last year worthing f jackman president yeah as you know also chris look we are the ultimate owner of our stock so we can be very patient when we pick the time to go to the market and buy we bought in february 5th last year we bought in december 5th last year and so i think our average repurchase price was around 71 and so that in addition to deploying overbuilding and acquisitions again we spent over 1 2 ph billion on m a and returned capital to shareholders and our leverage declined so again we just feel fortunate to be in this position to first and foremost deploy our capital on strategically consistent and appropriately priced m a opportunities and then that gives a runway so long for us on that opportunity and then dabble in the stock market opportunistically now for whatever reason the seller expectations over inflate and deal activity slows down a little bit and cash is building up obviously we don t sit on cash we ll pick our spots in the market and step it in a larger way chris murray altacorp capital analyst okay fair enough i m sorry just the what was your expectation to tax change on the 950 million guide mary anne whitney senior vice president and chief financial officer again what we tried to say is that we think this is a gaap matter and that on the free cash flow guide we ve already factored in the changes to taxes so it s not a free cash flow impact chris murray altacorp capital analyst all right great thanks just going back to some of the timing as we think about the purposeful shedding particularly in canada i mean a 6 2 price number you got to be thinking that that s got to step down a little bit as you anniversary the shedding and maybe flatten out the volume number even if you re going to go to a zero number how should we think about the cadence as we move through 19 in terms of call the normalization of that price growth mary anne whitney senior vice president and chief financial officer yes you re right chris and certainly what you saw in q4 on that continued high price in canada a lot of that is because of price increases that were put in late 2017 and into 2018 and when as you note that was very purposeful and as we said really all of last year that price stuck better than we expected and volumes took longer to go away than we would have expected when we really started that in earnest in 17 what you should expect to see during 2019 is that price will start stepping down as worthing said even on a reported basis when we guide to 4 5 for the full year it will start higher than that we exited q4 2018 already higher than that you should expect it to be higher than that in q1 and step down over the course of the year and i would expect canada in particular to follow that same pattern over the course of 19 chris murray altacorp capital analyst okay fair enough all right and just one last one for me just to kind of following up you had mentioned you re spending some capex on some e p landfills and i think they are supposed to be operational toward the middle of this year i guess first of all i just want to confirm or update where we are with those projects and then anything we should think about and i know you had previously talked about some ebitda margins but anything that s going to be odd in the start up of those or should we just assume that as they start taking volumes that we should see call it normalized margin profiles on the way in or will there be some sort of dilution that we should expect in the back half of the year worthing f jackman president obviously depends the initial costs ramp you won t notice in our overall consolidated business because it s nominal compared to the size of our business but obviously the first revenue that comes in dollar for dollar will cover costs right and once we start exceeding that cost because the fixed cost nature of that business then you start seeing the incremental flow through become a lot higher it all depends on the speed of the ramp as regards to timing one of our landfills will likely start doing its trial start during q2 and so we re ahead of schedule on that one another project that we it s still under construction right now but will probably start ramping early in the third quarter and so that is on schedule with our original schedule because we re somewhat cautious on that so no again and what we ve tried to say is that look the ramping of that of either of the new projects and the other ones we re working on we ll look at that as being just potential upside to the way we guided for the full year chris murray altacorp capital analyst all right thanks very much folks operator our next question comes from the line of sean eastman with keybanc capital markets please proceed with your question sean eastman keybanc capital markets analyst hi guys thanks for taking my questions i was hoping to get an update on the labor capacity and wage inflation challenges perhaps relative to when you guys reported in the fall i was just hoping to get some context on things like turnover safety incidents and whether those things have stayed in check or worsened or maybe improved a little bit and perhaps just what the main sort of goal and focus area is in terms of addressing these challenges in 19 mary anne whitney senior vice president and chief financial officer sure so i can start certainly first of all with respect to safety as worthing noted safety did continue to come down in 2018 you saw high single digit decrease on our incident rate in 2018 we re in the dead of winter and had january with severe weather that certainly impact safety and was certainly mindful and paying close attention to it in q1 in terms of turnover really remained in that and we ve been in that kind of 25 to 26 or 27 range on turnover haven t seen a market change there what we really said all of last year is that we are pleased that it wasn t getting much worse given that constraints on labor and what we saw with real wage increase in q4 it was about where it was maybe a little higher than in q3 high 4s between 4 5 and 5 would be the same employee wage increases of course that s that s mitigated or muted in the p l by the turnover but that s what the wage increases are and as we think about 2019 as i think we ve communicated we ve taken a look at things like our benefits and increased our 401 k match and done some things to make sure that we remain the employer of choice and have the benefits that that we think are appropriate for our employees and those costs are factored into our guidance for 2019 worthing f jackman president yes sean to mary anne s point about higher 401 k contributions and the matching that we re doing we anticipate that and included in our outlook that s about 30 basis points headwind year over year so while we guided a 30 basis point improvement in margins obviously if i adjust just for the anticipated increase in 401 k contributions that would have been a 60 basis point margin expansion for the full year but we re anticipating again increased participation and folks to be deferring more of their eligible compensation for that sean eastman keybanc capital markets analyst really helpful and my next question is just going back to the m a i was hoping to you guys are indicating an elevated environment continuing this year i assume there s a pipeline of targets that are sort of in negotiations getting close and out of those targets that are in advance stages i was hoping to get a sense for the mix of kind of collections only versus integrated or maybe non solid waste to get a sense for what could be added this year worthing f jackman president again like most few years we ve got a couple of integrated meaning collection and landfill but then there s a large number that are collection only that either tuck into our existing operations that could be internalized in our facilities or new market entries as well so it s a standard mix as we sit here right now and it is all solid waste oriented right now sean eastman keybanc capital markets analyst okay got it and just lastly for me i m just trying to get an idea for what the risk to this acquisition environment is is there potential from where private equity to swoop in what could choke off some of this elevated deal activity worthing f jackman president well obviously as we ve talked about on last call i mean episodically you ve got whether it would be pe or pe backed companies that come in and take a different look value things on ebitda and not cash flow sometimes that that s an interruption sometimes and we don t get all the deals we think we might get that s fine our view has always been you can never recover from overpaying so that s obviously a potential interruption we re fine with that i mean again we ve got we re taking the long view here as we know companies that pursue growth for growth sake don t end well the debt could get paid off and the banks are safe but the equity is always at risk and so we ve got to play the long game here and not be tempted in doing foolish things and again i think the track record you ve seen over 21 plus years validates that chris murray altacorp capital analyst excellent thanks so much for your time operator thank you operator instructions mr jackman there are no further phone questions at this time worthing f jackman president well great thank you if there are no further questions on behalf of our entire management team we appreciate your listening to and

yesterday s closing price we also declared our quarterly preferred dividend of 0 4375 per series a preferred share which is payable on march 31 2019 to holders of record on march 15 now i ll turn the call over to michael arougheti who will start with some quarterly and full year financial and business highlights michael arougheti co founder chief executive officer president great thank you carl good afternoon everyone and happy valentine s day our fourth quarter s results concluded a record year for ares we grew our fee related earnings and realized income in excess of 17 and increased our aum over 20 driven by a record year of fundraising as carl mentioned we ve increased our regular quarterly dividend by 14 to 0 32 per share which annualized represents 1 28 per share based on our positive outlook for continued growth in our core fee related earnings mike mcferran will provide more color on that when he walk us through the financial results a little bit later before i get into the specifics and review the 2018 key highlights i would like to start with just a few comments on the recent market volatility and the implications for our business as you all know the fourth quarter saw significant equity market volatility which bled into parts of the credit markets in our view the technical selling pressure was disconnected from otherwise healthy corporate fundamentals while we are seeing some modest deceleration of earnings growth credit performance in general remains stable default rates remained low and below historical average levels and i remind everybody that oftentimes a slow growth choppy environment can be very good for our investing it extends the duration of credit portfolios without compromising already strong debt service levels and could provide more lender friendly pricing in terms on the pe side it may reduce competition for assets and if we were to see a more significant dislocation this could also create separation between stronger and weaker credit managers and meaningful consolidation opportunities also on the pe side it also enhances rescue financing and distressed for control opportunities so while the markets have recovered most of their december losses the q4 environment was a great reminder to everyone that markets can be fragile and that many geopolitical and global macro risks still remain our strong inflows and performance against the volatile q4 backdrop is evidence of the stability and strength of our business model we invest with a flexible relative value approach and since we have locked up capital we have a long time frame for value creation and are never forced sellers our clients trust us to invest aggressively during periods of dislocation and to exit investments as appropriate during more constructive times so unlike many traditional asset managers that experienced severe outflows in q4 we saw a near record inflows to our firm illustrating this dynamic and that leaves us well positioned for opportunities that future volatility may bring in q4 we had gross inflows of 10 4 billion in new capital bringing the full year to a record of over 36 billion all this fundraising was organic and does not include assets acquired or any material amounts raised through partnerships or joint ventures our growing client base continues to reward our consistent performance even in volatile markets by giving us more capital and over the past several years we ve been fortunate to experience strong fundraising in each of our business lines from ever larger subsequent vintages and well established commingled fund families like ace and acof and our real estate private equity funds through launching new commingled funds as we demonstrated with pcs sdl energy ops and real estate debt by growing our managed account business across our credit strategies by securing certain strategic partnerships such as the insurance company jv we talked about on last quarter s call and strategic mandates with large institutional investors and importantly the ongoing efforts outside of our institutional fundraising channel in places like arcc and our growing clo franchise this fundraising momentum also demonstrates the valuable partnerships that we continue to build with our lps the expanding reach of our marketing infrastructure and our ability to offer a growing array of innovative and attractive investment strategies across the platform over the past several years we ve added significant resources across our marketing strategy product development and ir teams and extended our coverage across the globe today we have approximately 95 professionals across these groups compared to 64 just three years ago and we re really starting to see the benefits of these investments over the past 12 months we added 139 new direct fund investors to the platform and 57 of all money raised came from investors outside of north america illustrating our increasingly global footprint we believe that we re just scratching the surface growing in all major investor categories particularly with global pension funds insurance companies sovereign wealth funds and private banks our total number of direct investors has now increased to over 900 up more than 15 over the past year and five fold since 2011 and our existing investors continue to reup with us in new funds or across the platform at an impressive rate during 2018 the 131 existing lps who invested directly with us invested 2 7 times more capital than our new investors this reinforces the industry trend of lps placing more of their capital with fewer managers and we believe that it demonstrates the growing desire to invest more with ares so maybe now turning to more specifics on the fourth quarter and full year results we had first closings in two first time commingled funds over 750 million in our energy opportunities private equity strategy and 600 million in our real estate debt core plus strategy we also held multiple final fund closings including our first time senior direct lending fund or sdl at 3 billion of equity which we expect will grow to over 5 billion of aum with leverage and in our 9th us real estate value add fund with over 1 billion of capital commitments in our market leading european direct lending business we added over 2 billion in new capital across new and existing strategic accounts and we added over 1 4 billion to ace iv s total capital bringing total equity and debt in that strategy and fund to over 9 billion as we ve discussed on prior calls another exciting growth area for us is in our asset backed and structured credit strategies we renamed the strategy alternative credit to better reflect the breadth of the strategies that we offer across a wide spectrum of non traditional corporate consumer and real estate credit assets we believe that our alternative credit strategy has an addressable market of over 3 trillion in assets across the globe as discussed over the past year we ve added and we ll continue to add significant talent to our team and have enhanced our capabilities across a wide range of assets and during q4 alone we added 1 4 billion in new alternative credit funds bringing full year fundraising to 2 6 billion of gross commitments these record levels of fundraising drove aum growth of 23 for full year 2018 positioning us to meaningfully grow fee related earnings and realized income in the years ahead and our fundraising momentum is continuing as we expect another above average year in 2019 with several larger flagship funds either launching this year and into 2020 i think most importantly we continue to perform well for our fund investors our direct lending strategies generated exceptional relative returns in both the us and europe as evidenced by arcc s strong earnings results and stable credit reported earlier this week including a 12 net return for 2018 in europe our third european direct lending fund ace iii had gross returns in excess of 16 for 2018 our real estate funds had yet another strong year with our major us and european private equity funds generating gross returns between 16 and 20 for 2018 and from a private equity standpoint while still down for q4 our corporate private equity fund composite outperformed the public equity markets for the quarter down 5 7 versus the s p 500 which was down 13 5 i remind everybody that our three year gross appreciation for our corporate pe composite remains in the high teens and our longer term aggregate gross irr since inception remained well over 20 from an investing and deployment standpoint we had an active year as we scaled our teams and broadened our investing reach across various market segments and strategies total drawdown deployment was over 17 billion in 2018 up from nearly 13 billion in 2017 with growth across all three investment groups given the market environment the key theme for us in 2018 was quality we continue to focus on franchise businesses with top management teams where we could add value over time and protect our downside risk in direct lending we largely stayed senior secured and defensively positioned industries with a strong emphasis on backing incumbent borrowers and larger more durable companies about 90 of our 2018 transactions and direct lending included financial covenants and more than half of those new commitments were to incumbent borrowers in that business we closed only 4 of the transactions we reviewed with significant overweighting to non cyclical and recession resistant industries in pe given the challenging environment for regular way private equity we invested our flexible capital selectively in high quality platform companies with compelling growth dynamics and an attractive energy investments where we were seeing interesting relative value and lastly in real estate we took advantage of favorable demand demographics and local supply demand trends to invest across multi family and industrial logistics properties in strong growth markets and finally before i turn it over to mike i think as everyone knows in 2018 we made an important change to our corporate structure as we converted to a c corp for tax purposes in march and for legal governance purposes in november these changes were designed to increase the liquidity in and broaden the universe of potential buyers of our stock and while still early we ve already seen the benefits of these actions between march and year end our public float increased from approximately 10 to about 30 our average daily trading volumes increased more than fourfold and our institutional ownership has tripled in addition we are also included in several well known stock industries for the first time which facilitated nearly 6 million shares purchased by index funds late last year we would also expect to be added to at least another large index later this year and while our stock price was not immune to the year end market pressures we do believe that as a c corp we re now better positioned to capture value for our stockholders over the long term and with that i ll turn the call over to mike mcferran who will walk through the q4 results in detail and describe our expected growth michael mcferran executive vice president chief financial officer chief operating officer thanks mike i ll start with the review of our fourth quarter and full year results and conclude with a discussion on our dividends and capital management activities as mike stated ares is benefiting from the strongest fundraising year in its history as existing investors provide us additional capital to manage and as new investors are attracted to our leading strategies and expanding platform we had gross inflows of more than 36 billion for the year which drove acceleration in our aum growth to 23 year over year this growth sets us up very nicely for aum conversion of fee related earnings as we invest our capital not yet earning fees our aum reached 130 7 billion on the heels of another strong quarter of fundraising our fee paying aum increased 13 year over year driven by deployment as a meaningful amount of our aum converts to fee paying aum once it is invested management fees and fee related earnings both increased 16 from the fourth quarter of 2017 were up 12 and 18 respectively for the full year compared to the same period in 2017 looking forward our corporate objective is to continue to grow our aum and fee related earnings annually in the low to high teens consistent with our historical rates our fourth quarter realized income of 123 9 million up 66 was a record which helped drive full year of realized income to 395 4 million up 21 compared to 2017 levels in addition to the growth in our underlying fee related earnings the strength in the fourth quarter realized income included 15 1 million from succeeding and earning the capital gains fee this year at arcc also known as part ii fees along with several real estate private equity fund monetizations our fourth quarter after tax realized income per common share of 0 41 increased 78 year over year and on a full year basis was 1 42 per share a 31 increase over 2017 levels our steady stable growth in our fee related earnings continues to account for about two thirds of our realized income and provides a solid and growing foundation for realized income growth our realized net performance income and realized net investment income collectively have averaged about 117 million annually over the past five years and we believe the aggregate amount will continue to track higher over time as our underlying incentive generating aum increases our business provides visibility on future management fee growth through the embedded management fees we expect to generate from capital already raised but not yet deployed also known as our shadow aum we ended the fourth quarter with record amounts of dry powder and shadow aum and our shadow aum is more diverse and more global at any point in our history our available capital totaled 38 1 billion up 52 from prior year and our shadow aum increased 94 from prior year to 28 2 billion of this 28 2 billion approximately 24 8 billion is available for future deployment with corresponding annual management fees totaling 245 5 million or approximately 29 of our last 12 months management fees based on the underlying strategies we would expect deployment horizons ranging from 18 months to 36 months please note that the 245 5 million in incremental management fees does not include the impact of any potential arcc part i fees we expect to earn in the future any additional management fees we would expect to earn if arcc is above its 0 75 times debt to equity ratio or the expiration of the 10 million per quarter arcc part 1 fee waiver at the end of the third quarter of 2019 assuming arcc s leverage reaches the midpoint of its previously announced new target debt to equity range beginning in the second quarter of 2019 we estimate that our future management and part i fees from arcc could provide an additional 50 million of incremental fees on an annualized basis above the amount included in the 245 5 million i already referenced therefore while there can be no assurance the 245 5 million the 50 million of incremental fees and the 40 million in annual part 1 fee waivers totals approximately 336 million of potential future annual management fees or 40 of our last 12 months management fees incentive eligible aum also reached a record high in the fourth quarter of 78 4 billion up 26 1 year over year of that amount 31 6 billion is not yet invested and available for future deployment which is more than 83 of our fourth quarter incentive generating total which implies material potential upsize to our realized performance income in future years our incentive generating aum of 38 billion which is comprised of 73 in credit strategies and 18 in private equity strategies increased 67 year over year of the amount of incentive eligible aum that is currently invested over 81 is generating performance fees as mike stated based on the market volatility we witnessed in the fourth quarter it s good to remind everyone about the nature of our revenues and aum our management fees continue to represent more than 80 of our total fees and are derived from locked up long dated capital including permanent vehicles approximately 90 of our fourth quarter management fees were generated from permanent capital or funds with closed end structures we derive only about 5 of our management fees from liquid credit funds based on market values since many of you asked about our clo exposure in december we thought we will provide you some updated statistics as a reminder a clo is simply a type of highly diversified institutional loan fund that holds primarily senior secured syndicated bank loans managed by asset managers like ares or many of our peers we derive about 7 of our management fee from clos and we only have approximately 75 million of recourse exposure in clo tranches on our balance sheet clos have been tested throughout the past two decades the multiple credit cycles and the result has been cumulative loss rates near zero our experience to clo investing in down credit cycles has also been strong for example our 2004 to 2007 clo vintages which we managed through the great financial crisis generated a weighted average annual distribution to the equity of 19 7 finally turning to our dividend we declared a new quarterly dividend of 0 32 per common share for our first quarter which represents an increase of 14 over our dividend levels in 2018 as a reminder in early 2018 we moved to a level qualifying quarterly dividend as we said that we would reassess the dividend annually at the beginning of each year our new dividend is pegged to the expected trajectory of our after tax fee related earnings we expect to retain the excess realized income above our dividends to either reinvest our management fee business for potential stock repurchases or for any cash required in acquisitions or other strategic ventures on the topic of share repurchases this morning we announced a new 150 million stock repurchase program the primary objective of this program is to have the flexibility to use our free cash flow to manage our share count from the vesting of employee equity awards mike will now close with his thoughts and our future outlook michael arougheti co founder chief executive officer president great thanks mike reflecting on 2018 and looking ahead to 2019 i couldn t be more excited and i don t think that we ve ever been better positioned we operate a balance sheet light business model with modest net debt relative to our core earnings and our business is growing at a double digit pace we expect this growth to continue as we invest in new products people and operating infrastructure to support our expansion as mike talked about we believe our future is bright as the levers of future growth already exist in our shadow and incentive eligible aum and current fundraising pipeline our clients continue to give us a greater share of their capital and with our expanding product suite we just had our best fundraising year in our history with new growth initiatives and adjacent strategies launched in every business group we re poised to continue our growth and expansion in the years ahead we have world class investment capital raising and business ops teams and a cycle tested investment approach and the shines through and our excellent investment performance we re starting the year with over 38 billion of dry powder to invest which puts us in a great position as evidenced by our strong growth in management fees and aum during the financial crisis volatile markets have always been good to ares and provide us the chance to really showcase the power of our platform in past cycles we ve been able to differentiate our investment performance make accretive strategic acquisitions and grow faster than our peers and i m confident that the next dislocation whenever it comes we ll also provide strong opportunities for ares our fund investors and our shareholders so in closing i want to thank the entire ares team for all of the hard work and effort in delivering incredible results in 2018 and to our shareholders as always we appreciate your time and support for our company and operator we d like to now open up the line for questions questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions and our first questioner today will be ken worthington with jp morgan please go ahead ken worthington jpmorgan analyst hi good afternoon and thank you for taking my questions and so first one 2018 was obviously a tremendous year for capital raising you gave some high level comments in the prepared remarks i was hoping you could share more the outlook for capital raising in 19 maybe by the asset class so kind of thoughts on credit thoughts on private equity and real estate and you mentioned in the prepared remarks the flagships and flagship funds in pipeline for 2019 maybe just help us understand how big the prior vintages were in terms of aum michael arougheti co founder chief executive officer president sure ken it s mike i ll try to answer that somewhat succinctly i think look 2018 was an incredible year but i d highlight if you go back our historical average over the last couple of years it s been about 17 billion and so while the 36 billion stands out these numbers have been increasing sequentially and to your point as we talked about in the prepared remarks we ve gotten into a rhythm now where the growth is coming not only from sequentially larger flagship funds but it s coming from our ability to launch new strategies alongside those flagship fund families open up new geographies open up new distribution channels like private banks and non traded retail developing strategic partnerships so our whole approach to fundraising as we talked about has gotten more global more systematic and we re now able given the track record of investment performance here able to launch new strategies more quickly and get them scaled we won t give you a projection into 2019 but as i mentioned i think our 2019 gross fundraising should be at or above the historical averages and again that s going to come from a combination of flagship funds and new strategies on the private equity side we are in the market with a special opportunities fund that is a first time fund in a strategy that we ve been executing on since the inception of the firm our expectation is that can be a multi billion dollar product in 2019 and a significant growth area going forward as i mentioned we have launched an energy opportunity strategy again as a quote unquote first time fund but sitting alongside our core energy capabilities within private equity and as we sit here today our acof v fund is in and around 40 deployed and so within the next maybe even more within the next 12 to 18 months i think those teams will begin to think about what acof vi could look like with regard to credit the fundraising tends to be much more broad based we re obviously coming off of a significant fundraising year in credit i think the story in credit for 2019 will be much more about continued deployment than large flagship fundraises but you should expect to see us growing in each of our credit categories with an emphasis on the alternative credit strategies i referenced in the prepared remarks and then in real estate as i mentioned we are in the market with our fifth european flagship fund the prior fund size there was about eur1 billion we would expect this fund to exceed that and we will likely be back in the market based on the exceptional performance we ve had in our us opportunistic equity strategies and that prior fund was about 800 million operator and our next questioner today will be robert lee with kbw please go ahead pell bermingham kbw analyst yes this is actually pell bermingham on for robert lee i just kind of volunteered as to unset the fre margin which has remained relatively flat over the past few quarters i was wondering if you guys had any guidance on when we can expect an acceleration in that fre margin michael mcferran executive vice president chief financial officer chief operating officer as we said we ve targeted 30 this year it s what we ve delivered we find 30 staff ph is sustainable on the call we highlighted the amount of management fees tied to capital has been raised but will be recognized as we invest that capital so i think over the coming years as management fees grow the deployment of capital is raised and where a lot of the expense is tied to raise and manage that capital already embedded in our numbers you will see progressive expansion i think the important thing is i wouldn t necessarily view this as a quarter to quarter exercise but view it over a longer time horizon i think we ve mentioned on past calls that we think in the years ahead we would expect our margin to expand past 30 into the low and then eventually in the mid 30s michael arougheti co founder chief executive officer president i think one other comment which echoes some things we ve talked about on prior calls ares is a growth company we ve been delivering growth between 15 and 20 for 15 years and while we are focused on driving economies of scale as we grow folks should appreciate that there are a number of meaningful investments in the p l that allow us to continue to sustain that type of growth into the future and i think we committed on past calls and i think over the course of this year we ll try to give folks better transparency into what those investments look like and the impact on the margin but we really want people to understand if you want to grow at 15 to 20 for 15 years you have to reinvest in growth and people and infrastructure which is what we continue to do so so when you see our margins going up 500 basis points over the last 3 5 years that s inclusive of all of the growth investments that we ve made pell bermingham kbw analyst great thank you for taking my question operator and our next questioner today will be gerry o hara with jefferies please go ahead gerald o hara jefferies analyst thanks and good morning maybe a question on the backlog and pipeline metrics that were provided in the supplemental slide appreciate the additional disclosure but perhaps you can maybe help us think a little bit about how we should model this kind of going forward in terms of realizations or flow through into realized income and perhaps kind of mark to market swings that these metrics might be might be susceptible to thank you michael mcferran executive vice president chief financial officer chief operating officer why don t we inaudible if the make sure we understand the question gerry if the question is how should you be thinking about monetizations in realized and unrealized maybe we ll let mike walk through the unrealized component a good place to look historically is we ve averaged about 120 million annually since our ipo below the fre line if you will and incentive income and investment income as mike mentioned in the prepared remarks the pool of incentive eligible aum continues to scale quite aggressively as we raise more capital so those historical averages while big numbers should scale with the aum base but it s probably worthwhile dissecting the unrealized just to get a sense for how that plays with the realized income piece michael arougheti co founder chief executive officer president yeah and i think mike hit on it probably speaking about the realized as the incentive eligible aum grows or that notional amount expands you expect over the longer term realized income would have the opportunity to expand with that the unrealized piece just stepping back for a second if you recall we led the industry away from viewing eni as a key metric during the course of this year i think all of our peers have now dropped eni and the reason we did that was we felt unrealized gains and losses was an appropriate reflection of value creation and portfolios and that s most apparent when you remember we ve said this in our prepared remarks that we managed these assets in either permanent or a long dated closed end fund vehicles where we control the timing of exits so when prices go up or prices go down doesn t mean we would manage we would actually monetize at those prices so i think looking at the unrealized to us was a distraction for the public and i think our industry has agreed and followed suit when you look then going specific to unrealized you have to remember that when you think about unrealized gains or losses that number reflects the actual change that happened during the period so if your assets went up 1 one quarter and the next quarter you monetize those that gain and book a realized gain of 1 in that same quarter you ll show an unrealized loss of 1 all else being equal so i think that s when you think about the unrealized function you have to remember it s not necessarily asset declines or gains it s also netted against the activity of realizations that answer your question gerald o hara jefferies analyst it does that s helpful color appreciate it michael arougheti co founder chief executive officer president and the other thing we talked about too is if you look at where we are in fund life we have talked on prior calls in our private equity franchise acof iii and acof iv are seasoned and you ve been seeing us monetize as appropriate there you saw a meaningful pickup in monetization activity within some of our older vintage real estate funds which drove some of the exceptional performance in q4 so we are in a healthy harvesting cycle across the platform and i think you ll continue to see us focused on that throughout 2019 operator and our next questioner today will be michael carrier with bank of america merrill lynch please go ahead mike needham bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi thank you this is mike needham in for mike carrier just two quick items first on the fee rate it was higher again in the fourth quarter is there anything particular driving that higher and the second item on acof v can you just touch on how that funds doing pretty significant fund hoping we could get an update thank you michael arougheti co founder chief executive officer president so i ll start with the fee rate and david kaplan can give you an update on acof v on the fee rate it has ticked up in most that s really a function of you think about the capital raising it s mostly around real estate private equity and illiquid credit strategies that have fee rates higher than some of what we call the lower fee rates assigned to our liquid credit business which was more probably in the historical 50 bp range and most of the capital we raised today is north of a point so as we re deploying that capital and raising it you re actually seeing our average fee rate tick up a little bit david you want to give some color on acof v david kaplan co head of private equity group sure so just to remind folks it s a 7 85 billion fund it is a february 2017 vintage which is when the fee clock started working or was turned on mike mentioned that we re 40 plus invested committed we re actually very very happy with that pace of deployment in what is a tightly priced private equity environment the composition of the portfolio is a very good mix reflective of our flexible capital approach inclusive of more distressed rescue opportunities as well as straight plain vanilla buyouts of more growth oriented company so we feel very good about where the funds are today mike needham bank of america merrill lynch analyst thank you operator and our next questioner today will be alex blostein with goldman sachs please go ahead alex blostein goldman sachs analyst hey thanks guys for taking the question i was hoping to dig into a couple of fundraising trends that you highlighted particularly in the us direct lending and european direct lending side of things if you kind of look at the year to date numbers are very strong and those are the areas obviously that it sounds like you might continue to see some growth so i was wondering if you could spend a minute on where the momentum is coming from still and maybe talk a little bit about kind of the nature of that capital so duration any sort of lock ups does that have a similar kind of longer duration characteristics as we know the rest of your credit business has michael arougheti co founder chief executive officer president so as we ve talked about before the demand for private credit strategies broadly defined whether it s corporate direct lending privately originated asset backed privately originated commercial real estate the investor appetite is coming for a couple of reasons it was initially spread because of the low interest rate environment and frustration with the yields and coupled with volatile global equity markets which forced folks to rethink how they would generate excess return what we ve seen over the last 10 years is while that may have catalyzed the growth the growth is now being sustained because of the nominal relative value and relative performance within the private credit asset classes so when people find their way to private credit and they re allocating away from private equity or traditional fixed income they re basically looking to de risk try to move up the capital structure position into floating rate loans as a hedge against rising interest rate environment and candidly shortened duration because weighted average most private credit asset classes are going to have an average life somewhere between two years and four years once folks have now tried the product and seen how the asset class performs when you look at how it s been performing against liquid alternatives we would expect the demand to continue so just to put that in perspective as i mentioned in fiscal 2018 our european direct lending business delivered 16 2 gross rates of return across that composite if you look at our us direct lending business as we talked about arcc but it s true across the platform 12 plus type rates of return and when you compare that against the liquid leverage finance benchmarks whether it s the credit suisse leveraged loan index which was scrapped by with a 1 annual return or that baml high yield index which was down 2 for the year people are beginning to see the durability of the return opportunity in private credit it s a large large addressable market that demand for credit continues to grow and so we would expect to continue to see growth there in terms of how investors are accessing the growth we offer arcc as a daily liquidity public vehicle for folks to get access to private credit strategies we offer commingled funds to your specific question that are locked up gp lp structures that typically have a life of eight to 10 years with extension and on average have an investment period between four and six years so when people are allocating into the space it s with an expectation that you will be investing that fund over a four year to six year period the nice thing is not only they locked up but most of these private credit funds have recycled so to the extent that that velocity in the portfolio of two to four years that i mentioned comes through that capital stays on the platform to reinvest maybe stating the obvious because these are private illiquid securities it s very hard to own and manage them in anything other than a long dated locked up commingled fund or permanent capital structure alex blostein goldman sachs analyst got it great thanks for that and then mike just a follow up question for you just around the capital obviously nice to see dividend increase and the buyback here can you talk a little bit about the pace of buyback and whether or not you plan to be more opportunistic and more kind of systematically to be in the market and also i guess the follow up to that looks like your debt balances picked up a little bit on the balance sheet anything we need to be mindful of in terms of potential m a michael mcferran executive vice president chief financial officer chief operating officer sure on the why don t we start the last part of that first on the debt balance in the balance sheet revolver ph had more on it at year end and prior quarter that was really a function of timing for the most part year end compensations done at december a lot of management fees and year end fees are collected in january so there s been no fundamental changes in our use of debt or debt profile we still remain frankly pretty low levered as a firm on the first part of buyback we had a program in place so the point we will be more active we definitely can t be any less active so i think with that we announced what we said in the call was our intention of the buyback program primarily is to try and pursue our share count neutrality strategy where we would intend to opportunistically repurchase shares as they have asked from employee awards and again while we haven t committed to any specific range the 150 million program size gives us flexibility to do so and look if market conditions warranted it we would consider opportunistic buybacks in excess of those michael arougheti co founder chief executive officer president yes so the way we probably structured the program is we would have both 10b 5 and 10b 18 in place to allow us to accomplish both objectives that s something that we re thinking through in terms of the execution of the plan but as you saw in the fourth quarter the market sometimes overreacts and that overreaction shows up in our stock and i think with the plan we would absolutely be in the market acquiring shares to the extent that we saw that kind of dislocation again mike needham bank of america merrill lynch analyst yes no doubt thanks so much michael arougheti co founder chief executive officer president thank you operator and our next questioner today will be craig siegenthaler with credit suisse please go ahead craig siegenthaler credit suisse analyst thanks good morning michael and mike michael arougheti co founder chief executive officer president good morning michael mcferran executive vice president chief financial officer chief operating officer good morning craig craig siegenthaler credit suisse analyst so correct me if i m wrong but it doesn t look like any of your products are near capacity constraints and also because your investment performance is broadly strong what is your view of long term aum growth here and also just kind of a follow up to that what is the economic what is the economic sensitivity to that aum growth because in 2008 in the financial crisis your aum growth actually accelerated during that period michael arougheti co founder chief executive officer president yes i think you actually answered the question for us craig the nice thing about the addressable markets that we operate in are they re massive and they re global and while we have leading market shares in certain of those markets even where we have a market leading position it s probably in the sub 5 range so we re going to continue to experience growth across the platform as we penetrate these large addressable markets but it should not in any way feel capacity constrained we do not put forward long term asset objectives we re investment managers and we focus on delivering great investment performance and have always had a view that when we deliver great investment performance our assets grow but what we can tell you is based on the breadth of product that we have here and the forward view on fundraising i think you should continue to expect the same type of growth from us that you ve seen historically and that s been 15 plus type rate of growth in most of the metrics that you guys are following for the foreseeable future craig siegenthaler credit suisse analyst got it and then just if i can have one follow up here given that arcc now is planning to releverage up in the 0 9 to 1 25 zone could you remind us what level of management fees and incentive fee level ones this will translate into and also how quickly will it take you to get up in that zone because i don t think you can actually start until june of this year michael arougheti co founder chief executive officer president yes so one thing to clarify arcc i would encourage both to go look at what that company accomplished in q4 and through 2018 speaking maybe for my partners who are a little modest the other day was nothing short of remarkable in terms of monetizing the acas acquisition and rotating that portfolio they recently announced another dividend increase a meaningful special dividend and i think are demonstrating to the market that there s still a lot of embedded earnings growth as the company relevers the origination platform that exists here should allow arcc to get higher and to leverage pretty quickly we were roughly 0 6 to 1 net of cash at the end of q4 that number is moving up as we approach the june that is 0 7 moving up as we approach the june transition date and i think as kipp and penny and mitch talked about on that call we ll be slowly moving the leverage up as we approach june and then through the june date we would expect to keep investing into leverage in terms of the dollar value of investing those funds as mike mentioned i think if we were to go to the midpoint of that range it would represent about 50 million of incremental fee coming out of arcc and that is in addition to the roll off of the acas fee waiver which is another 40 million of gross fee so pretty meaningful when you think of it in terms of the percentage of existing revenues coming off the arcc platform craig siegenthaler credit suisse analyst thank you michael michael arougheti co founder chief executive officer president thanks operator and our next questioner today will be kenneth lee with rbc please go ahead kenneth lee rbc analyst hi thanks for taking my question just within the credit business wondering if you could give us a little bit more detail into what drove the elevated realized performance income in the quarter thanks michael arougheti co founder chief executive officer president sure the biggest driver of that was actually this arcc outperformance i just referenced there is a significant amount of realized gains that were monetized throughout the course of 2018 largely out of the legacy american capital book and if you look at the contribution that was about 15 million of the 48 million of realized performance fee came from that single fund we had some credit realizations within some of our alternative credit strategies which also drove it and then the bulk of the remainder came out of our real estate portfolio as i mentioned earlier our opportunistic strategies in the us have been very actively monetizing what has been a fantastic portfolio kenneth lee rbc analyst got you very helpful and just one follow up within the direct lending franchise maybe some updated commentary on what you re seeing in terms of competitive activity whether you re seeing rational behavior among the new entrants into the marketplace and also i think you briefly touch upon this in the prepared remarks maybe a little bit more details on terms of how you saw the lending terms change in the fourth quarter thanks michael arougheti co founder chief executive officer president sure so i never like to say that people are acting rationally or irrationally because i don t know of any investment manager who makes an investment believing thing that they re taking inappropriate risk on behalf of their investors so i would maybe phrase it differently which is given the attractiveness of the asset class that i highlighted we are seeing more capital in the market and we re seeing more capital in the hands of people who frankly have not been investing in the asset class as long as we have and that probably leads them to take certain risks that may be other more seasoned investors won t but we ll only know that when we come through the next dislocation and we can see the dispersion in return the other thing that we talk a lot about in direct lending and i mentioned in the script it s worth highlighting again is when you look at our deployment throughout 2018 in us and europe and that gross deployment was probably close to 17 billion in direct lending across those two geographies in our drawdown funds and arcc 50 of that deployment was to incumbent borrowers which means that if those are high quality companies that we re investing behind it s likely that new market entrants are not seeing that and i d venture to say that the other large market participants see a similar type of incumbency benefit so that available market for that new entrant who doesn t have the competitive advantages of scale and origination and balance sheet et cetera is probably already fishing in a much smaller available market than we are and that does run the risk of adverse selection i think the good news is while q4 as i said was primarily technical it did bring some sobriety back into the market in terms of pricing and structure generally speaking we ve seen spreads increase in the new year somewhere between 50 basis points and 75 basis points in our direct lending strategies generally speaking we re seeing better documentation in things around covenant levels and definitions of ebitda and ebitda adjustments so there has been a dose of conservatism put back into the market as a result of the volatility we saw in q4 i would expect that to persist i think the market has kind of absorbed that and settled out at a new level which we re happy about obviously because we re generating higher returns we were a couple of months ago kenneth lee rbc analyst great thank you very much michael arougheti co founder chief executive officer president thanks ken operator and the next questioner today will be chris harris with wells fargo please go ahead chris harris wells fargo analyst hey can you guys talk to us a little bit about what you re seeing in europe the economic conditions over there seems to be a lot worse than they are here and then related to that your performance in europe continues to look really good so again can you square that with what appears to be much more difficult macro environment there michael mcferran executive vice president chief financial officer chief operating officer sure so just to remind folks where we where we are in europe in terms of geographies the bulk of our business in europe today is in our direct lending business in our real estate private equity business and in our liquid credit strategies buying euro bank loans and bonds we tend to focus predominantly on western europe and we predominantly focus on what i would call more healthy geographies as opposed to iberia and the periphery so with that framework we tend to be much more active investing in the german market french market the uk market which i ll come back to in a second and less so in some of the developing eastern european economies although we re seeing great relative gdp growth there and then it depends on the business in the real estate market the bulk of that gdp is concentrated in the gateway cities and so the strategies there tend to have us focusing in and around gateway cities in real estate and in the private credit business it s much more broadly distributed across europe and geography what i will say is following unlike the us central bank continues to be accommodating in europe which has been constructive for liquidity in the market and asset prices despite commentary to the contrary we think that that will continue bank liquidity and bank competition has changed dramatically so we re seeing much less competition from the bank market across the board that s been constructive for our business and generally i said this in our prepared remarks in the credit business which is where the bulk of the deployment comes from low and slow gdp growth tends to be very constructive for private credit extends duration allows you to maintain high asset spreads et cetera et cetera so the kind of low and slow growth gdp is good for the private credit business the uk is probably been the one area where we ve seen meaningful market changes as you would expect given the uncertainty around brexit and that s played out in a couple of ways we ve seen deal flow shifting out of the uk market and more broadly into the continent in places like france and germany we have seen some reduction in asset and property values in the core uk markets but generally that market has slowed appropriately just given all of the uncertainty and i don t think that we will see deal flow return to prior levels until we get clarity as to what the path for brexit will be and what the ultimate economic impact will be in the uk market so if you look at our deployment we ve seen a meaningful shift out of that core uk market to more of a pan european slant chris harris wells fargo analyst thank you operator and the next questioner today will be michael cyprys with morgan stanley please go ahead michael cyprys morgan stanley analyst okay good morning thanks for taking the question so you guys continue to raise record amounts of capital and investing back into business just hoping you could help flesh out where specifically you re investing back in the business today and as you look out over the next three years what would you say is on your to do list in terms of incremental investments in the business if you could speak about investment capabilities you re thinking about distribution technology just hoping you could help flesh all of that out thank you michael arougheti co founder chief executive officer president sure we ve talked about some of these in the past that i ll reiterate it just to give some context so one strategy that i reference was our opportunity fund special opportunities fund we began talking about adding people there i guess now two years ago we ve since hired about 18 new professionals into that part of our business out ahead of the launch of this very exciting product that we just talked about and our p l had been burdened with all of those additions and people let alone the infrastructure to support those people a good 12 months to 18 months before we formally launch to fund there we re making similar investments in and around our real estate credit business continue to add people and capabilities to support what we think is a very high growth area for us and so while our aum continues to ramp we re not seeing a dollar for dollar impact on the profitability of that business just yet and then lastly which we mentioned this in the prepared remarks we continue and will continue to add meaningful resources and infrastructure around our alternative credit businesses which is really everything we re doing in non corporate lending across a whole host of interesting asset classes we have as you ve seen continued to invest in geographic expansion europe was non existent for us 10 or 11 years ago that now represents probably 25 of the firm s aum and growing we have a full pan european office footprint we continue to grow that we just actually opened up an office in amsterdam so i think you ll continue to see us increasing our geographic footprint as we push into some local markets that we think are interesting and then in distribution we actually quantified some of that in the prepared remarks three years ago across our distribution and ir groups we had about 64 people that number is 95 and continuing to grow and it s growing globally and i think some of the results you re seeing in fundraising are just a direct reflection of those investments that we ve been making over the last three years to five years and then on retail distribution we did talk about it in prior calls but it s worth mentioning we have put meaningful investment into the development of our non traded retail distribution and integral fund business as well as our private bank distribution capability and we re starting to see significant momentum in both of those channels as well michael cyprys morgan stanley analyst great thanks for that and just a follow up question maybe shifting gears to the broader exit environment just curious if you could talk a little about how you see that shaping up and then if you look at your accrued carry balance nearly 250 million in accrued carry receivable today i guess just what period would you expect that to be realized over i think if you look back historically it looks like you ve kind of monetized the receivable balance over about 2 5 years on average how does that sound to you with respect to where you see the funds today and you could touch upon the backdrop of should that be a little bit slower or faster thanks michael arougheti co founder chief executive officer president i ll give you a broad response then maybe david wants to just chime in terms of what we re seeing from realization and monetization backdrop within the pe portfolios but look we have such a diverse pool of funds and investments that we re consistently in deployment and harvest mode and so obviously certain market environments are more conducive and constructive for exit than others but every quarter just given where funds are in their lives and given where various strategies are you re going to see fairly consistent level of deployment and monetization i think your assumption around our historical pace is probably accurate as mike mentioned we would expect our shadow aum to be deployed somewhere between 18 months and 36 months depending on the shape of the market i think the same would hold through therefore for realizations and if you go back to the 120 million number that i referenced earlier and you look at the accrued balance which by the way has gone up as the markets have rebounded that would correlate also to that kind of 18 month to 36 month timeframe david you want to give any specifics just on what we re seeing generally in the market and liquidity for quality assets david kaplan co head of private equity group for quality assets there is no shortage of a bid if you will maybe a couple of quick statistics which is there is somewhere around 900 billion of private equity dry powder in the market today and as of the third quarter i believe in 2018 we hit as we monitor purchase multiples over last 20 years we hit an all time high on average of about 11 times so if you have a quality asset there is capital absolutely available with multiple folks chasing it so we continue to see a reasonably constructive exit environment today michael cyprys morgan stanley analyst any notable or large exits in the pipeline at this point to speak of in terms of where the pipeline stands at exits today versus a quarter ago michael arougheti co founder chief executive officer president yes mike we can talk specifically about individual companies other than to say as we mentioned some of our legacy pe funds are at that stage of their life cycle where we re continually looking for opportunities to monetize michael cyprys morgan stanley analyst great thank you very much michael arougheti co founder chief executive officer president thank you operator and this will conclude our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks michael arougheti co founder chief executive officer president i don t think we have any we appreciate all the time you spent with us and again happy valentine s day i hope you enjoy a wonderful day with your loved ones

stage set up for higher gold prices trouble for equities the economy in each of the last three years gold has gotten off to a strong start only to fizzle as the year moved along will 2019 be the year gold finally breaks the pattern a good many investors fund managers and analysts think that 2019 might very well be the year when gold breaks the restraints and pushes to higher ground one of those is carter worth of cornerstone macro in new york who cnbc s melissa lee refers to as the chart master in a recent interview with lee worth referred to the long term chart below saying that there is a well defined set up and a lot of tension which he says is going to resolve to the upside a breakout to all time highs with respect to gold s relationship to the dollar worth says gold s got its own momentum now it is all setting up for higher gold prices and trouble for equities trouble for the economy the far left s next great monetary experiment mmt this mmt sounds like a recipe for immense inflation even hyperinflation says daily reckoning s bill maher you are spending all this money directly into the economy it will drive consumer prices through the attic roof you say this is crackpot a witch s sabbath of inflation would surely result yes but here the mmt crowd meets you head on they agree with you they agree mmt could cause a general inflation possibly even a hyperinflation modern monetary theory mmt is neither modern nor a theory john law the scottish financier tried a version of it exactly 300 years ago 1717 18 in france he did so with the blessing of the french monarchy and with a rationale very similar to mmt s proponents today in the end law s theories to his surprise if we are to believe the historical account bankrupted the french people and the government reduced the economy to ashes and created such a distaste for paper scrip among the citizenry that it took 80 years for france to reintroduce paper money as a circulating medium the shrewder speculators became alarmed they began to sell their shares of stock and hoard in gold the enormous wealth they had acquired this resulted in a demand on the government for metal in exchange for its paper and soon the government had no metal to give then the crash came those who had the government paper could buy nothing with it those who held the mississippi stock could scarce give it away it was worthless the government itself refused to accept its own paper for taxes a few lucky speculators had made vast fortunes but thousands of families especially among the wealthier classes were ruined edward s ellis and charles f home the story of the greatest nations 1900 funds institutions push gold etf stockpiles to the highest level in five years when this year s davos conference attendees boarded their private jets for the long ride home they left the swiss mountain resort with a sense that all is not well in the global economy and that financial markets might be in for some unpleasant times that sense of foreboding has big money led by some of the top names in the money management business paring its exposure to stock and bond markets and deploying that capital in the gold market gold etfs the favorite haunt for funds and institutions taking a stake in the gold market have started the year by adding 72 tonnes of gold to their stockpiles the influx has pushed the combined etf total to 2 513 tonnes the highest level since 2013 china builds up gold reserves in shift away from dollar as reported in the south china morning post yi gang the current central bank governor said in 2013 when he headed the state administration of foreign exchange safe that beijing was unable to diversify significantly into gold because the gold market is too small for china s us 3 trillion foreign reserves but things may start to change though it remained to be seen whether the modest gold purchases in the last two months represented a fundamental shift in china s attitude towards the precious metal analysts said i mentioned this south china morning post article in a recent daily market report but i did not pass along or comment on the portion highlighted above which may be the most interesting aspect of xin and yeung s report to give you an idea of china s dilemma with respect to gold and perhaps an inkling of just how undervalued gold is at current prices consider that all the gold ever mined according to world gold council data is worth about 7 5 trillion at a 1250 gold price china in other words could buy 40 of all the world s gold with its 3 trillion in reserves the market value of the 8 133 5 tonne u s gold reserve at 1250 per ounce is 335 billion thus china could buy america s gold reserve almost ten times over or put another way could swap its entire dollar reserves for the stockpile at 12 500 per ounce if by this time you have come to the conclusion that something is critically out of joint in this mathematical construct you are correct it is the price of gold silver forecast shortage to send silver prices soaring above 20 in 2019 surprisingly since gold and silver started their uptrend late last summer both are up the same number roughly 13 in other words silver has not outperformed gold as many thought it would at least so far that doesn t mean it won t in the future the gold silver ratio is still nearly 83 to one and still bumping along near its highs since 1970 that could all be changing now writes jason hamlin in a silver phoenix article as silver has become increasingly attractive to investors looking for undervalued asset classes or safe haven investments silver is benefiting from the persistent trade war government shutdown weakening dollar and a more dovish federal reserve venezuela s hyperinflation by the charts and numbers when a combination of currency debasement and inflation strikes an economy the effects can be sudden and severe as indicated in the two charts shown below i had to smile when i read this matter of fact summation of the situation from trading economics not that i fail to empathize with how these numbers translate to everyday life for venezuela s average citizen consumer prices in venezuela jumped 1 300 000 percent year on year in november of 2018 up from a 833 997 climb in october according to estimates from venezuela s opposition led congress inflation rate in venezuela averaged 3 268 55 percent from 1973 until 2018 reaching an all time high of 833 997 percent in october of 2018 and a record low of 3 22 percent in february of 1973 the usdveb traded at 248 520 9000 on wednesday january 23 historically the venezuelan bolivar reached an all time high of 248 520 90 in august of 2018 and a record low of 0 05 in january of 1989 it does not take a great deal of imagination to contemplate what the effects might have been on the price of gold in bolivars the charts below tell the tale of hyperinflation in venezuela gold sentiment reading on the mend climbing pretty steadily recently we touched base with sentiment trader s jason goepfert to ask about his latest reading on gold market sentiment we thought it might be a good time to check to see if there were any changes now that the price is approaching the 1300 level he graciously sent over the chart posted below along with the following comment our measure reached a point of maximum pessimism in august and has been climbing pretty steadily ever since it reached the upper end of neutral recently before falling off a bit bull markets tend to see optimism stay above 40 during the pullbacks so the next one will be interesting to watch we got the surge off of the extreme pessimism and now if it can hold above 40ish and starting bouncing again it would argue strongly that the longer term trend has changed for the better u s mint posts strongest american eagle bullion gold coin sales in two years gold and silver bullion coin sales rebounded in january with the strongest monthly sales in two years the u s mint sold 65 500 troy ounces of the gold american eagle and 4 017 500 troy ounces of the silver american eagle in january 2019 12 and 24 increases respectively over the same month last year in january 2018 investors purchased 58 500 troy ounces in gold bullion coins and 3 235 000 in silver bullion coins last month the mint sold a low 3000 troy ounces in gold eagles and 490 000 in silver eagles sales typically slow down in december as the mint and market wholesalers gear up for the new year the solid gains over january of last year indicate growing interest among investors as we head into the new year january is typically a strong month for sales in both the gold and silver categories as collectors and investors step up purchases of coins bearing the new year s date central bank gold demand highest in 50 years many analysts credit the washington gold agreement of 1999 as the seminal document at the heart of gold s secular bull market in it the top central banks agreed to gradually curtail the sale and lease of gold reserves two activities that kept the price rangebound for much of the 1990s at the time gold was stuck in the 270 to 300 price range from there it never looked back fast forward to 2011 and we begin to see central banks moving from the net seller side of the gold fundamentals ledger to become net buyers some analysts applauded the simple retreat from sales and leases as a major victory for gold bulls the move to becoming net buyers was icing on the cake in 2018 central bank gold purchases reached their highest level in fifty years according to world gold council data a profound development the machinations of which have yet to be fully digested in the marketplace notablequotable this is a rally inside a bear market we could have something between a 10 percent and a 30 percent decline the market on a risk reward basis is dangerous we do feel as if individuals ought to cut back their equity exposure i m a believer that gold represents true money we are in a fiat money world and it s dangerous not to have some gold in your portfolio david tice formerly prudent bear fund interview cnbc s trading nation markets tend to veer between two extremes fear and greed but right now the dominant emotion appears to be confusion as one top hedge fund manager says no one has a view and everyone is positioned accordingly robin wigglesworth financial times not only is europe s expansionary cycle fading but the region is about to face challenges that it has to tackle amid growing political fragmentation italy slipped into recession in the fourth quarter of 2018 according to new data france continues to be haunted by yellow vests protests germany has entered an era of uncertainty and brexit overshadows the uk future in the absence of trump s tariffs europe could have benefited from a nascent recovery of world trade investment and finance but now even these hopes are diminishing dan steinbrock counting pips editor s note it seems with all the problems steinbrock mentions coming to a head simultaneously that europe is one trigger event from a major unraveling gold demand is running at high levels on both sides of the english channel i grew up in a purely urban family we had no relatives in the country i m born in 1944 when i was a baby my mother could only buy food because she still had some gold coins without gold i would have starved she always told me that therefore this generation already has a certain gold affinity in extreme times of crisis this is one of the few things left to be accepted gold was the only thing left to the people of the city at that time before the silver cutlery was also traded at the farmer ewald nowotny european central bank governor we can t assume it will be a smooth sail for the rest of 2019 so what does that mean for you as an investor if you need insurance for your portfolio the best way to protect yourself from economic chaos is by owning some gold now i have been saying this for years jim cramer cnbc the market reaction has been positive for risk assets but not as drastic as might have been expected yes the fed was expected to move in a dovish direction so some of this was in the price before wednesday but nobody expected fed chairman jerome powell to embrace the dovish narrative so fully john authers bloomberg gold and silver like other commodities have an intrinsic value which is not arbitrary but is dependent on their scarcity the quantity of labour bestowed in procuring them and the value of the capital employed in the mines which produce them david ricardo british political economist 1772 1823 central banks cannot stop the money printing without the whole system blowing up maybe that is why gold is going up martenson says i believe it is i buy gold because gold is the only form of money that is not simultaneously someone else s liability we are talking about a world so saddled with debt i am not sure where all the liabilities lie i don t trust the accounting of major corporations i don t trust what derivatives will do in a crisis this is the everything bubble what happens when it bursts we don t know so gold to me is the thing i want to own and hold when you have a systemic crisis chris martenson sam zell the founder of equity group investments says he bought gold for the first time in his life because it s a good hedge bloomberg video interview editor s note billionaire sam zell is not the first property mogul to become a gold owner nor will he be the last he adds his name to a long list of renowned money men who have made their interest in

resulting in an after tax npv 8 of us 256 million in 2018 we focused on building a strong foundation from which to grow our business said copper mountain s president and ceo gil clausen the copper mountain mine finished the year achieving guidance across all metrics we are also completing an integrated mine plan which will combine the new ingerbelle deposit into the copper mountain mine plan and may double the mine life the new ingerbelle deposit provides the potential to add significant value through the addition of low risk low cost production particularly as we evaluate a mill expansion plan which could allow for increased production levels in our existing mill within our current operating and environmental permits we expect to complete this integrated life of mine plan and

20 0 million for q4 2017 and a net loss of 19 0 million in q4 2018 compared to a net income of 23 5 million in q4 2017 the increase in the net loss from net income was primarily a result of a non cash unrealized foreign exchange loss of 14 7 million compared to a non cash unrealized foreign exchange loss of 1 8 million for q4 2017 a change of approximately 12 9 million which was primarily related to the company s debt that is denominated in u s dollars the increase in net loss was also due to lower revenue and higher cost of sales year over year the company recognized revenue of 73 1 million net of pricing adjustments and treatment charges on the sale of 19 4 million pounds of copper 7 475 ounces of gold and 69 761 ounces of silver and based on an average realized copper price of us 2 81

silver and based on an average realized copper price of us 3 12 per pound for q4 2017 despite higher sales lower revenue year over year was a result of a 10 lower realized copper price in q4 2018 compared to q4 2017 and a q4 2018 mark to market adjustment of negative 2 4 million compared to a positive mark to market adjustment of 10 3 million in q4 2017 cost of sales for q4 2018 decreased marginally to 65 2 million compared to 65 7 million in q4 2017 even though more concentrate was sold in q4 2018 than q4 2017 this was because q4 2017 included a 10 8 million write down to the low grade stockpile which was included in cost of sales exploration expenditures in q4 2018 were 1 2 million which includes exploration in both australia and british columbia full year 2018 financial review the company reported gross profit in 2018 of 25 3 million compared to 59 1 million in 2017 and a net loss in 2018 of 26 9 million compared to a net income of 67 3 million in 2017 the increase in net loss in 2018 from net income in 2017 was primarily a result of a non cash unrealized foreign exchange loss 23 8 million in 2018 compared to a non cash unrealized foreign exchange gain of 20 9 million in 2017 a change of approximately 45 million which was mainly related to the company s debt that is denominated in u s dollars the increase in net loss was also due to lower revenue and higher cost of sales year over year the company recognized revenue of 296 0 million in 2018 net of pricing adjustments and treatment charges on the sale of 79 2 million pounds of copper 26 799 ounces of gold and 284 086 ounces of silver based on an average realized copper price of us 2 98 per pound this compares to revenue of 304 1 million in 2017 net of pricing adjustments and treatment charges on the sale of 73 9 million pounds of copper 23 969 ounces of gold and 260 493 ounces of silver based on an average realized price of realized copper price of us 2 82 per pound as required under ifrs revenue in 2017 included a positive mark to market adjustment of 10 7 million for unsettled shipments outstanding at year end as compared to a negative mark to market adjustment of 0 9 million for 2018 unsettled shipments at year end cost of sales for 2018 increased by 26 million to 270 7 million compared to 245 0 million in 2017 this increase was due in small part to higher costs for diesel fuel maintenance and power but primarily due to the change in ore stockpile inventory with a 13 1 million decrease in 2018 charged to cost of sales as compared to a 14 0 million increase in 2017 charged to ore stockpile inventory the drawdown of ore stockpiles in the year is a result of increased development stripping as the copper mountain mine starts to expose higher grade areas of the pit for future years as required under ifrs some of these additional costs of stripping are capitalized when the period stripping ratio exceeds the life of mine stripping ratio of 2 1 exploration expenditures for the full year of 2018 were 6 5 million which includes exploration in both australia and british columbia summary operating results copper mountain mine 100 basis q4 2018 q4 2017 annual 2018 annual

production associated with the copper mountain mine and take steps in further supporting peer group comparability see the non gaap performance measures section of this md a for details of these calculations fourth quarter 2018 operating results review in q4 2018 the copper mountain mine produced 20 6 million pounds of copper 8 124 ounces of gold and 62 711 ounces of silver compared to 19 6 million pounds of copper 5 206 ounces of gold and 70 384 ounces of silver in q4 2017 increased recoveries for all metals and a 5 increase in tonnes milled resulted in strong production results for q4 2018 and the strongest quarter for copper and gold production in 2018 increased gold production can be attributed to the new flash floatation circuit installed in the second half of 2018 total operating costs c1 for q4 2018 were us 1 60 per pound of copper produced 13 lower than the c1 costs for q4 2017 of us 1 85 per pound of copper produced the improvement in costs when compared to the prior year is related to several factors including 5 higher copper production in the quarter a 5 decrease in total mine operating costs in q4 2018 and a weakening of the canadian dollar to the united states dollar used when translating c1 costs to united states dollars it should be noted that substantially all of the company s operating costs are priced in canadian dollars the decrease in c1 costs is also affected by the levels of deferred stripping in the period as these excess stripping costs are treated as capital expenditures deferred stripping costs are captured in all in sustaining costs aisc and not included in c1 costs the total cash value of deferred stripping in q4 2018 was 4 6 million compared to nil in q4 2017 full year 2018 operating results review in 2018 the copper mountain mine achieved annual copper production guidance producing 78 8 million pounds of copper 28 250 ounces of gold and 273 913 ounces of silver compared to 75 8 million pounds of copper 23 633 ounces of gold and 277 094 ounces of silver in 2017 this represents an increase of 4 for copper 19 for gold and a slight 1 decrease in silver production increases for copper and gold production as compared to the prior year is a result of improved recoveries and mill throughput in 2018 offset slightly by lower grades being milled in 2018 improved recoveries in the mill can be attributed to the installation of the new flash flotation circuit in the third quarter of 2018 recoveries contributed to strong annual production results which included an increase of total tonnes milled by 3 total c1 costs for 2018 were us 1 77 per pound of copper produced 4 lower than the c1 costs for 2017 of us 1 84 the improvement in costs per pound is a result of higher copper production in 2018 and slightly lower total mine operating costs when compared to 2017 after taking into account cost associated with increased low grade stockpile inventories in 2017 as required under ifrs the decrease in c1 costs was also affected by the levels of deferred stripping in the year as these mining costs are treated as capital expenditures and deferred as required under ifrs deferred stripping costs are captured in aisc and not included in c1 costs the total cash value of deferred stripping in 2018 was 20 2 million compared to 1 5 million in 2017 q4 2018 financial and operating results conference call and webcast the

year we reported adjusted ebitda of 182 million for the quarter bringing our full year result to 777 million adjusting for the year over year impact of real estate transactions our fourth quarter adjusted ebitda increased approximately 19 and our full year adjusted ebitda increased 13 both on a constant currency basis these very strong rates of growth were primarily driven by performance in our own hotels strong increases in management and franchise fees across all regions and effective sg a management systemwide revpar increased 1 5 during the fourth quarter weighed down by lower than expected growth in our asia pacific region and revpar contraction in our us select service hotels as joan will discuss shortly this weaker than expected fourth quarter revpar growth resulted in full year systemwide revpar growth of 3 1 which is slightly lower than our expectations that we shared with at the end of october during the fourth quarter excluding the addition of hotels resulting from the two roads acquisition we opened 25 hotels driving full year net rooms growth of 7 2 on a year over year basis this brings us to a total of 63 new hotel openings in 2018 in addition to this industry leading organic net rooms growth we added 75 properties through the acquisition of two roads including 65 hotels with approximately 12 000 rooms and 10 condominium ownership properties comprising approximately 1500 units we ve continued to focus on driving relevant growth of our brands in new markets where our guests are traveling during 2018 we entered 38 new markets through organic hotel openings and an additional 20 new markets through the acquisition of two roads for example fourth quarter openings include the addition of hotel sofia in barcelona within our unbound collection the sofia is a 465 room luxury hotel with outstanding food and beverage outlets and serves as hyatt s first representation in barcelona i m also excited to highlight the opening of the hyatt regency seattle this hotel was not in our previous estimates for net rooms growth in 2018 but we re thrilled to have been able to open this important hotel just prior to year end the hyatt regency seattle is a 1260 room hotel located in the heart of downtown and adjacent to the expansion of the washington state convention center the hotel has 52 meeting and dining venues spanning a total of over 100 000 square feet as to examples of new markets from two roads additions we expanded our resort offerings in asia with four new markets in bali all represented by stunning alila properties and now serve three new markets on the west coast of the us in washington oregon and northern california these collective additions represent a meaningful expansion of our global distribution in a short period of time we are excited about the significant growth of our presence around the world including the acquisition of two roads which added many great hotels and outstanding brands that we believe will enhance the performance of our existing network of hotels and position us for even stronger growth in the future i m very pleased to highlight that the fourth quarter marks our fifth consecutive quarter of net rooms growth of 7 or higher and notwithstanding our record level of net rooms growth we closed the year with a pipeline of signed deals amounting to 89 000 rooms up from 70 000 rooms a year ago this includes the pipeline of executed contracts acquired through the two roads acquisition amounting to approximately 5000 rooms our pipeline has increased almost 27 inclusive of the two roads hotels or 20 excluding them fueled by a record year of signings in 2018 we believe that the pace of our pipeline growth is indicative of our ability to sustain high levels of net rooms growth over time before turning the call over to joan i wanted to comment on some recent developments during our third quarter call i reviewed the progress we are making to drive guest engagement and we recently announced that the world of hyatt is welcoming an additional 56 hotels with small luxury hotels of the world or slh into the program under the strategic alliance we entered with slh last year this latest group brings us to a total of 110 slh hotels in the program and provides world of hyatt members access to six additional countries including hotels in destinations such as portugal and finland since the first group of hotels entered the world of hyatt program late last year member engagement has exceeded our expectations especially among elite members who make up the majority of the bookings feedback has been overwhelmingly positive given the prestige and quality of the slh properties and the elevated on property experience consistent with what our members have come to expect from us we are extremely pleased with how this partnership has come to life and expect to launch yet another group of slh hotels within the coming month to illustrate the guest space we are serving the bookings of world of hyatt members at slh hotels have been at an average adr of approximately 385 this both demonstrates the power of our focus on the high end traveler as well as the quality of the slh portfolio of hotels the backdrop to this discussion is extremely strong growth in our membership base and their share of our total revenues our membership base increased by 47 over 2017 and our member s share of hotel revenues has increased by over 300 basis points in the year we see continued momentum in both membership and spending by our members as we continue to enhance the value of membership in world of hyatt the last item i d like to comment on is a recent development relating to the grand hyatt new york a hotel owned by hyatt the hotel was originally opened in 1919 and it became the grand hyatt new york in 1980 prior to 2010 it was the only hotel that hyatt had in new york and today we have 14 hotels and two under development the hotel is under a long term lease and sits on top of one of the most important transportation hubs in the world we ve been engaged in discussions with tf cornerstone and msd partners the owners of the air rights of grand central station which is adjacent to the hotel the new development that they envision involves the construction of a new tower that would include a new grand hyatt hotel we believe participating in the redevelopment represents the highest and best use of the property for the long term and we are committed to working with the developers to move this project forward there are a significant number of approvals and other steps that need to be accomplished before a redevelopment could be possible which we believe will take more than a year to work through we expect site work for the redevelopment would not begin until 2021 at the earliest therefore we expect to continue to own and operate the hotel through at least the end of 2020 our current expectation is that we would ultimately sell the hotel and ground lease interest that we have to the development entity that would do the redevelopment and enter into a long term management agreement for a new grand hyatt hotel upon completion we welcome being part of such an important project with such experienced and accomplished developers and we are also very excited by the prospects of a new world class grand hyatt hotel ours is an iconic location in the center of manhattan and we are committed to a long term presence in that area as you can imagine this is a complicated deal given the nature and location of the property and we are still working through details of various agreements with tf cornerstone and msd partners we will share additional details on the potential redevelopment as it evolves over time in conclusion 2018 was a great year in which we drove earnings growth well in excess of our earnings model and beyond our expectations we managed to finish the year with strong fourth quarter earnings notwithstanding some revpar pressure we saw in a couple of areas during the fourth quarter while we are attentive to economic and other indicators going forward we remain confident in our ability to maintain sold growth and expect to deliver another year of industry leading net rooms growth in 2018 we also successfully executed against our capital strategy having now sold over 1 1 billion of our 1 5 billion sell down target we deployed proceeds from those sales to both invest in the growth of our business through our acquisition of two roads and returned a record level of capital to shareholders we intend to continue to drive the evolution of our earnings to be increasingly fee based through the growth of our managed and franchise business along with the continued execution of our capital strategy as we will discuss further in new york during our investor day on march 5th i ll now turn the call over to joan to provide additional detail on our 2018 results and our expectations for 2019 joan over to you joan bottarini chief financial officer thanks mark and good morning everyone late yesterday we reported fourth quarter adjusted net income attributable to hyatt of 69 million and diluted earning per share of 0 62 adjusted for special items adjusted ebitda for the quarter was 182 million with systemwide revpar growth of 1 5 in constant dollars our adjusted ebitda for the quarter includes a negative 2 million impact from two roads which is in line with our expectations to be flat for 2018 excluding a 17 million impact from real estate transactions our fourth quarter adjusted ebitda grew at an impressive level of approximately 19 on a constant currency basis while revpar results were slightly lower than we anticipated we are very pleased with our strong finish to the year i ll now highlight our segment results starting with our managed and franchise business we ended 2018 with our managed and franchise business representing 53 of adjusted ebitda before corporate and other for the year up from 47 in 2017 we expect this trend to continue in the year ahead as we evolve to a more fee based earnings profile during the fourth quarter we delivered 11 growth in base incentive and franchise fees on a constant currency basis compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 total fees increased approximately 12 on a constant currency basis we ve now delivered 10 consecutive quarters of high single to low double digit growth in our total fees an excellent track record driven in part by industry leading net rooms growth next i will provide additional perspective on each of our three lodging segments beginning with the americas the americas segment delivered full service revpar growth of 3 4 while select service revpar declined 3 7 total us revpar grew 0 9 with us full service up 2 6 and us select service down 3 for the quarter we experienced headwinds in our select service results compared with the fourth quarter of 2017 due to a weather related benefit from post hurricane demand in 2017 excluding the acquired two roads hotels net rooms growth for the americas during q4 was approximately 5 base incentive and franchise fee growth of approximately 11 led to adjusted ebitda growth of 12 for the quarter both on a constant currency basis full year group rooms revenue in the us increased approximately 3 in the quarter with increases in both group room night and rates the growth of our group business in the fourth quarter came primarily from associations with strong growth banqueting revenue in the quarter for the quarter bookings were down slightly but we ended 2018 with total in the year for the year bookings up 4 over last year fourth quarter production for all years was up approximately 3 primarily driven by longer term bookings looking ahead group booking pace for all years is positive and 2019 is up in the low single digits nearly 80 of our group business of 2019 is already on the books us full service transient revenue was a little over 1 for the quarter with decreases from room nights more than offset by solid rate increases i ll now move on to our asia pacific segment where full service revpar increased 2 1 in the quarter driven by a combination of occupancy and rate revpar in greater china increased by just slightly more than overall segment revpar excluding acquired two roads hotels net rooms growth for asia pacific was approximately 13 together revpar and strong rooms growth drove an increase in base incentive and franchise fees of approximately 11 in constant dollars adjusted ebitda grew approximately 5 on a constant currency basis reflecting strong fee growth partially offset by the impact of additional investments supporting our growth in greater china now moving to our europe africa middle east and southwest asia segment full service revpar increased 2 7 driven by occupancy gain all regions in the segment showed solid revpar growth other than the middle east where significant supply growth continues to have a negative impact on results net rooms growth of 10 for the segment helped to drive a 9 increase in base incentive and franchise fee revenue for the quarter and an increase in adjusted ebitda of 15 both on a constant currency basis i ll not review owned a leased business which accounted for approximately 46 of our adjusted ebitda before corporate and other in q4 and 47 for the full year owned and leased revpar increased 3 in the fourth quarter adjusted ebitda for this segment was down approximately 1 in constant currency entirely due to asset sales excluding the net impact of these transactions segment adjusted ebitda in constant currency would have increased approximately 18 an impressive performance by our owned and leased hotels our comparable owned and leased margins increased 240 basis points during the quarter about half of the margin improvement resulted from remarkable operating performance from our hotel teams yielding improvements rate realization food and beverage operations and continued productivity gain the remainder of the margin increase came from non recurring credits and a decline in costs in 2018 as we lapped certain one time costs in 2017 lastly i want to touch on another factor helping our consolidated results for the full year and fourth quarter of 2018 we reported adjusted selling general and administrative costs 11 million lower than last year while a portion of this decline relates to our focus on realizing efficiencies in our operating model more than half of this reduction relates to costs incurred in 2017 including non recurring severance and costs related to certain marketing initiative in summary we are exceedingly proud of our remarkable end to the year with strong double digit fee growth excellent owned and leased hotel operating margin performance and outstanding net rooms growth and a significant increase in our pipeline of executed management and franchise agreements now that i ve reviewed our operating performance i d like to update you on our shareholder capital returns we close out 2018 with full year share repurchases of approximately 966 million the largest volume of annual share repurchases in our history when combined with a total of 68 million in dividends we delivered on our commitment to return a total of approximately 1 billion to shareholders in 2018 additionally during the fourth quarter we announced a new 750 million share repurchase authorization or which approximately 614 million remains as of february 8th turning to 2019 we expect to return approximately 300 million in capital to shareholders this year which includes 54 million in repurchases completed through february 8th our return of capital to shareholders will come through a combination of share repurchases and our quarterly dividend which we are increases from 0 15 per share in 2018 to 0 19 per share without first quarterly dividend of 2019 to be paid on march 11th our expected total shareholder return of approximately 300 million does not contemplate the potential application of proceeds from asset sales that may occur during 2019 turning to additional guidance related to 2019 all guidance that i will be providing this morning excluded the impact of any potential 2019 transaction including potential asset sales we will update our full year guidance when we complete any potential transaction including asset sales or investments in new hotels or businesses the guidance i provide will include the impact of our acquisition of two roads but i will break two roads items out where appropriate and as a reminder you can find details of our 2019 guidance in our earnings release filed late yesterday we expect full year 2019 systemwide revpar growth to range from 1 to 3 consistent with the guidance we provided during our third quarter call we continue to expect revpar in the us to be a bit lower than revpar internationally and specifically expect some continued pressure on select service revpar in the us we expect our 2019 adjusted ebitda to range from 780 million to 800 million it s important to point out that the net impact of real estate transactions completed during 2018 is creating a 28 million headwind on our year over year earnings progression we also expect a 5 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency when excluding the impact of these items we expect our adjusted ebitda to grow by about 6 versus 2018 at the mid point this guidance includes the expected results from the addition of two roads at an adjusted ebitda contribution of flat to 5 million consistent with our prior guidance the strength of our 2018 management and franchise fee growth and hotel operating results nearly offset approximately 100 million in real estate transaction and foreign currency headwinds for the year as we look forward to 2019 we expect to more than offset the headwinds i mentioned earlier and when you combine our 2018 results with the mid point of our 2019 guidance after adjusting for the impact of real estate transactions and foreign currency for both periods we expect to deliver a two year compounded growth rate of approximately 10 in our adjusted ebitda this growth rate is on the higher end of our growth model reflecting a combination of strong growth in our fee business excellent operating performance and our owned and leased hotels and solid sg a leverage over the two year period before leaving our 2019 adjusted ebitda outlook i would like to note that the majority of the transaction related headwinds i mentioned earlier will weigh on our reported first quarter adjusted ebitda we expect adjusted sg a totaling 345 million in 2019 excluding the impact of two roads 2019 adjusted sg a is expected to be 305 million which compares to 294 million in 2018 the additional 40 million of two roads related sg a included approximately 25 million in one time integration costs capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 375 million for the year by way of reminder one of the drivers of these higher capital expenditure amounts is the completion of significant redevelopment efforts at our miraval property in lenox massachusetts with an expected opening later this year additionally significant renovation activity is planned for the hyatt regency phoenix and hyatt regency indian wells properties we purchased last year as well as a handful of other properties we also have new hotel construction costs of approximately 60 to 70 million during 2019 with a continued evolution of our capital strategy we expect levels of capex to decrease significantly over time and we will discuss further at our investor conference on march 5th i ll briefly comment on our tax guidance for 2019 our 19 effective tax rate was driven lower by tax reform and one time benefits including a favorable outcome on a large hotel sale our expected effective tax rate for 2019 is in the rage of 28 to 30 next i d like to highlight our expected 2019 net unit growth which we expect to include opening over 80 hotels with net rooms growth in the range of 7 to 7 5 net rooms growth in 2018 exceeded our expectations driven by december openings including the hyatt regency seattle that mark mentioned earlier while this significant level of 2018 hotel openings elevated our inventory and represents a pull forward from our expected 2019 openings we remain confident in our ability to deliver another exceptionally strong year of net rooms growth in 2019 the significant increase in our pipeline of signed deals is the foundation of our future growth and we believe our ability to maintain a high level of growth over time positions us well to meet the needs of our expanding base of world of hyatt members with expanded presence in key markets i will conclude my prepared remarks by saying that we are very pleased with our 2018 operating results where we delivered solid revpar growth net rooms growth in excess of 7 driving high levels of fee growth while at the same time expanding our robust development pipeline we are proud of our execution of our capital strategy including the successful acquisition of two roads and the delivery of a record level of capital return to shareholders we expect to continue to execute against our operating and capital strategies which include investing in the business and growing our brands to create more value for our shareholders as a reminder we invite you to attend our investor day in new york on march 5th where we plan to expand on many of these important topics meanwhile we ll be happy to take any questions you have on the material we cover this morning thank you and with that i ll turn it back to christine for q a questions and answers operator thank you in order to ask a question i d like to remind everyone to please press and the number 1 on your telephone keypad we ll pause for just a moment to compile the q a roster and your first question comes from the line of jared shojaian from wolfe research your line is open jared shojaian wolfe research analyst hey everybody thanks for taking my question so i wanna go back to the 2019 guidance here for a second you called out 6 growth sort of core growth excluding all the one timers so that s at the low end of your longer term target and i appreciate the comments that the multi year cagr might be higher but if i look at the components of your longer term 6 to 11 target there doesn t appear to be anything unusual in your guidance in terms of revpar or units so can you talk about that a little bit and maybe help me understand that gap joan bottarini chief financial officer sure jared after removing the net impact of transactions and foreign exchange headwinds our anticipated ebitda growth is 6 at the midpoint of the range so i wanna remind you that there were other non recurring items that helped us in 2018 as i mentioned earlier in the owned and leased portfolio and also a one time settlement we received in the first quarter of 2018 when you combine those two items those two alone had a lift on our earnings growth rate of 2 points in 2018 which is a headwind we ll face in 2019 so this is why it s important and instructive to look at the growth over the two years given the non recurring items that two year growth rate just as a reminder from 17 to 19 mid point is 10 and it s on the high end of our growth model reflecting strong growth in our fee business our owned and leased hotels and solid sg a leverage over the two year period jared shojaian wolfe research analyst okay thank you and you mentioned the grand hyatt i appreciate the details there but how are you thinking about that in terms of your longer term disposition plan and allocation of capital would that be incremental to your 1 5 billion target would you consider recycling the proceeds into other hotels and as you look at your entire portfolio of assets are there any properties that you would consider not being available for sale whether that s for strategic reasons tax reasons or anything else that you might be considering mark hoplamazian president and chief executive officer thanks jared with respect to the grand hyatt new york and how we think about it the steps that we re taking right now are consistent with the overall direction that we ve taken which is to continue to move to an asset lighter balance sheet so we looked at that opportunity in the context of several different factors one being that the last the capex profile for the property is driven in part by the fact that the last major renovation that we did was in 2011 at a cost of a bit over 120 million and so as we look forward a capex profile that suggested that this is an appropriate time for us to think about doing something different with the property as to how we ultimately will treat the proceeds from the sale we will make that determination as we get closer to the time of actually selling the hotel so we ve got a framing for our permit sell down commitment which is at the 1 5 billion level that we described and talked extensively about last year and we ve also engaged in a number of recycling transactions so i think exactly how we end up treating those proceeds will be determined when we get closer to disposition jared shojaian wolfe research analyst great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of david katz from jeffries your line is open david katz jefferies analyst hi good morning everyone i wanted to just ask about the capital allocation framework and how your thoughts sit today and obviously the world his maybe changed and then changed back again i don t know around the prospect of adding more brands to the portfolio through m a and reallocating some sale proceeds that way as opposed to returning it and what your appetite might be for that mark hoplamazian president and chief executive officer thanks so we ve been consistent to say that our number one focus for proceeds from dispositions would be to look for growth opportunities for hyatt our further color to that has been that we re not focused on transactions that would bring with it any significant amount of real estate and if we did look at opportunities that did include hotel real estate we would look to have a path to divest the real estate over time so really the idea was and has been and remains finding appropriate opportunities for us to actually enhance our growth rate over time in the case of two roads it s focused on a customer base that is very similar to our customer base from a adr level perspective and also from a demographic perspective they have certain key attributes in the lifestyle space that our strengths of theirs that we will bring on and use to help enhance our own performance but most importantly it s really a growth platform and it s entirely management fee driven so the idea behind being able to redeploy capital has to do with ensuring that we are continuing to expand in key areas for our customer base and doing it in a way that s gonna continue to help our earnings mixed migration one example of that is we ve got a very strong base of world of hyatt members in asia and with the alila acquisition we have significantly expanded our resort offerings with a significant pipeline in that brand so we re particularly excited about the opportunity to really use that new platform to enhance the value of the world of hyatt for all of our asian customers david katz jefferies analyst and if i can just follow that up i appreciate the answer do you sort of feel more appetite among the higher end which seems like where more of the growth has been or are there any sort of attractive elements that may be in the limited service or even lower than that mark hoplamazian president and chief executive officer yeah we have looked at potential acquisitions across all of the chain scales that we currently compete in so everything from the upscale area through the luxury area and would be our focus we ve also looked at some platforms that have brand representation adjacent to upscale but below upscale if you just look at it on a rate basis particularly in europe and also looking at how we might be able to significantly expand our reach so one of the key goals of our acquisition focus and the lens through which we re looking to look at potential acquisitions is really geography as well as segment representation so the ability to have additional representation in key markets and within that i would say key types of representation within those markets and i ll go back to my alila example really resort focused that actually helps to sharpen our focus on the things that we think will make the biggest difference to our network david katz jefferies analyst got it thank you mark hoplamazian president and chief executive officer i would just add to all of that sorry to continue just one last thing and that is we ve been very disciplined and very driven to be deliberate about ensuring that we are maintaining a healthy return of capital to shareholders and you can see from our behavior over the course of 2018 where we started off the year with a expectation or a guidance of returning about 300 million to shareholders and it ended up over a billion that is the result of a mindset which is we will if we don t have clear paths to utilization of capital be returning capital to shareholders so it is important to us it is an area of focus for us so i don t want my answer to lead you to believe that we are exclusively focused on m a and not committed to continuing our path of returning capital to shareholders david katz jefferies analyst noted thank you very much operator your next question comes from the line of thomas allen from morgan stanley your line is open thomas allen morgan stanley analyst hey good morning you guys are obviously putting up really impressive unit growth just one that stood out to me that i was very confused about was you went from 330 hotels in the pipeline and 73 000 rooms as of september to 4 even if you take out two roads its 410 hotels and 84 000 so were there lumpy additions or were there one offs it s impressive so how are you growing so quickly thanks mark hoplamazian president and chief executive officer yeah i m thrilled to be able to address this one we had just a remarkable year we had been i would say over the past year maybe 15 months been really focused on looking at how we can enhance our development capabilities and we ve added developers and resources to help support development activity over the course of that period of time by the way we ve extended that further because when we acquired two roads we brought into hyatt some really accomplished and experienced developers so part of the quote unquote run rate overhead that we are bringing in with two roads is a fantastic development team that know the brands very very well so we really have been working against those with the new teams in place or enhanced teams in place over the course of the year and we had a very significant measure of deals in process our discipline around disclosure is to alone disclose deals that are fully executed and in our opinion fully financed so if you look at the total activity base of our development activity and you took into account things that were either in very advanced stages post loi for sure or even signed but in our opinion still not included in the pipeline because we haven t yet pushed the button yet on our confidence in their being financed the actual pipeline is significantly larger than what report as our pipeline but we ve consistently reported fully signed and executed deals and that s partly why you see some lumpiness because as you can imagine getting deals across the finish line and getting ink on paper can sometimes lag when the activity is done and then the deals are essentially finished and we just had an incredibly robust fourth quarter the things i would say that are notable first significant across all of our brands second select service in general had mid 20 increase in rooms all the percentages i ll use are for rooms whereas full service was just under 30 growth year over year and that s partly why you see that the composition of our pipeline is 70 managed and 27 actually it s more than that it s 70 managed 27 franchised and 3 is in the o l category owned and leased so really 73 managed because virtually all the o l properties are managed that s higher than our current composition which is about 68 managed and that is the result of very very significant increase in our full service pipeline so that s the first thing that i would point out the second is that the balance between select service and full service is essentially identical to our current sorry it s a little bit higher in select service 36 of the pipeline roughly is select service 64 full service our current base is about 28 select service so faster growth in some of the select services properties mostly a us phenomena so i would say that we re seeing significant growth pretty much across the globe china remains the single biggest country with about 30 of the total pipeline but the us and the americas had a very strong year in terms of new development thomas allen morgan stanley analyst congratulations just on a different topic so on revpar you called out the select service weakness in the fourth quarter because of the hurricane comps but then you also highlighted the 2019 us select service to be a little softer too what s driving that joan bottarini chief financial officer sure let me address first how we re thinking about things in 20 what happened at the end of the year in 2018 in the fourth quarter firstly 2018 saw supply growth in the us upscale segment begin to outpace demand so that was the first issue that impacted us the second is when you compare the industry performance to our performance there s a notable in our mix in our geographic concentration the hyatt place brand is much more heavily represented in texas and the southeastern united states which benefited from post hurricane demand as i mentioned in my prepared remarks and lastly i ll just make a comment that we communicated previously we ve had a number of initiates under way to upgrade the programming in the hyatt place brand to increase the value offering for our world of hyatt members and we re in the process of evaluating what disruptions this could have caused and what i would say is that we re encouraged by what we re hearing from member feedback on our offering and are pleased with the growth in the world of hyatt penetration numbers and the brand in recent months so in summary on 2018 the rate of growth is primarily supply driven and impacted by those rather related items due to our market concentration and we don t have any evidence of a core demand problem or a macro brand issue as you think about 2019 that supply and demand equation we expect to continue throughout the year and because we had such strong performance in the first half of 2018 we ll have some tough comps in the first half of 2019 as well on the select service side thomas allen morgan stanley analyst makes sense thank you operator your next question comes the line of stephen grambling from goldman sachs your line is open stephen grambling goldman sachs analyst hey good morning it s stephen i guess as a follow up to a little bit on jared and thomas s question on 19 guidance and kind of the ebitda trajectory what are the building blocks on the core owned and leased side kind of acquisitions and are there any key integration milestones to consider with two roads as you look to pivot to accelerating growth mark hoplamazian president and chief executive officer i ll start stephen with the second question i think the evolution of the integration plan is under way and we re on track relative to where we expected to be with respect to two roads and over the course of the years we re going to be doing a number of things to migrate in a very thoughtful and deliberate way with a lot of coordination with the owners of the hotels i know that there s a lot of focus around how other integrations might have occurred previously i think we re aware of how we need to be doing this in a very deliberate way in order to be successful and i m thrilled to tell you that the extra effort and planning and resources that we ve put behind this are definitely yielding a great path to having not just a really solid base of owners but also really accelerating the growth of the brands around the globe so we ve already seen some great opportunities we had one notable pickup in the first part of this year already which is the conversation of the parker hotel in new york which was neither in the property count nor in the pipeline we were able to work in a very coordinated way with our new colleagues from two roads with an ownership group that had a good experience with two roads in the past and bring that across the finish line in a very rapid way so some really great early signs that the combination is gonna yield some really good results there s no question that we have a lot of work left to do the amount of money that we re putting behind the transition is significant and we are really focused on making sure that we have a really fantastic foundation for the future which is why we re taking extra time effort and costs to make sure that that goes well in terms of the o l progression i think we re in good shape in terms of the market representation that we ve got as we look into this year and see how markets are performing at the top line maybe joan you can cover the picture on the margin side because we re lapping a massive year or margin expansion joan bottarini chief financial officer right so for the fourth quarter we had an extraordinary headline on our margin expansion of 240 basis points and i covered the fact that half of that was operational and half of that was non recurring items for the full year we expanded margins at 140 basis points as well so we had a very strong year and driven by the strong focus from our operations teams and a lot of good results coming out both on the top line and in productivity to drive those margins our teams going into next year will be working hard to identify opportunities to continue to drive margins but i would say that the continued expansion of margins at these expected revenue levels will be challenging in the past we stated that we were targeting about 3 revpar growth to yield flat margins and cover inflationary costs so it will continue to be challenging at these low single digit revpar rates that we re expecting stephen grambling goldman sachs analyst thanks and maybe one unrelated follow up as you see the momentum in spend and sign ups associated with the loyalty program how much of the growth has been domestic versus overseas are you seeing any difference in the frequency or spend by region thanks mark hoplamazian president and chief executive officer we ve seen growth across the globe and we think that the addition of alila in asia will also enhance the value proposition there one growth driver for new membership and also increased penetration over the course of the year with some changes that we made in the model for hyatt place we transitioned both the physical plant the physical model on the area programming for our new hotels that was really done in close coordination with our current owners and developers to make it a more efficient build so we were able to take costs out and take space out of the new hyatt place model and in order to also enhance excuse margin performance we converted and transitioned to a new food and beverage program in which the breakfast offering is free to members but paid for otherwise which is a change from what we used to do which was it was a free breakfast included in room rate and that has spurred a lot of sign ups and penetration and we re tracking durability and share of wallet over time but we significantly enhanced and changed the breakfast offering at the same time so we ve increased and elevated the experience and also really used the opportunity to drive membership no question that in that transition which occurred in the fourth quarter we had some disruption in terms of how hotels were represented from a rate and offering perspective something that we re continuing to evaluate as we most into january and february of this year but overall the member feedback and the owner feedback has been very very positive so we re really excited about that the only other thing i would say is we also say an inflection point on the full service signup as well and i think part of that has to do with focus and attention by our hotel teams but also we ve really taken some significant steps over the course of the year to enhance the value proposition for world of hyatt and as we add more and more slh hotels to the offering we re gonna be tracking our membership base in europe closely because it really is a material change in what s available through the program to our guests stephen grambling goldman sachs analyst thanks for the call i look forward to the investor day mark hoplamazian president and chief executive officer thanks operator your next question comes from the line of smedes rose from citi your line is open smedes rose citi analyst hi thanks i was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about for the capital return that you have targeted this year the decision to increase the dividend versus more share repurchases joan bottarini chief financial officer so our capital return guidance for the year is 300 million and i just want to point out that we had also came out at the same time last year with the same guidance of 300 million and we ended up the year at a billion in shareholder returns to investors and that was driven largely be asset sales as we look at going into the year the 300 million that we just guided is before taking into consideration any asset sales and includes as you pointed out the increase in our quarterly dividend so we ll update you over the course of the year if any of our estimates change and with respect to our dividend we don t have a first policy but we have stated that we ll revisit it annually this is a 27 increase which makes sense given our earnings growth and we took that decision to increase it for this year and increase the shareholder return mark hoplamazian president and chief executive officer yeah i would say one factor is when you think about it is payout ratio which we pay attention to but also it s reflective of our cash flow strength we ve got significant operating cash flow increasing levels of free cash flow over time so part of this is in anticipation that you will see as we go into a much more asset lighter earnings mix over time that free cash flow attributes will also increase not just because we re growing fees at such a significant pace but also because our capex will decline over time so it s in part a change that is in anticipation of what our profile evolution looks like smedes rose citi analyst i understand that i guess it seems like for companies that are moving to more asset light strategies as you are the investor s value will share repurchase more than dividend increases so i m just wondering what the sort of thought is going forward would you expect to increase your dividend at this kind of rate or is there kind of a thought about the ratio between dividends versus share repurchase it was just a little surprising to me given you trade below your peers and you chose to push up the dividend mark hoplamazian president and chief executive officer yeah when you really go through the numbers though the total dollar change year over year is not material relative to the level of share repurchases that we re talking about so we don t see this as a significant trade off and when we set the initial dividend of a year ago we indicated that we were setting it at what we considered to a sort of a conservative level and then we anticipated that we would find opportunities that we would increase it over time but i think most importantly just in terms of a consumption of total dollars it s not gonna have a material impact on our share repurchases when you just go through the numbers it s not a material amount of incremental cash that s being dedicated to dividends relative to the 100 millions we are spending on share repurchase smedes rose citi analyst okay fair enough the other thing i just wanted to ask you about you called out the expected losses for the guarantees in france this year which narrow i was just wondering are those losses greater than you would have expected given the unrest in france is that impacting those hotels at all and can you just remind us when those contracts burn off or the guarantees burn off joan bottarini chief financial officer so the guarantee burns off in may of 2020 and we expect our expense to decelerate from last year that obligation and we don t see any impact from a very minimal impact from the unrest in france recently smedes rose citi analyst okay thank you operator your next question comes from the line of shaun kelley from bank of america your line is open shaun kelley bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi good morning everyone just a couple clarifications most of my questions have been asked and answered but to go back to the whole capital recycling plan kind of before we get the full update on the analyst day mark can you just remind us of exactly how much you have remaining on sort of this dated kinda 1 5 billion goal to sell for this program as you ve outlined it so far mark hoplamazian president and chief executive officer yes i don t know what the precise number is but it s in the range of 350 million shaun kelley bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay and the only thing sold in the fourth quarter was the i think one hyatt house asset right mark hoplamazian president and chief executive officer no we actually ended up there was another disposition which was a jv interest that we had in the hyatt regency in minneapolis which is a sizable hotel and we also have at this time we have an asset being marketed for sale at which we in our practices that we will update when there s more to report like a signed deal but that s where we stand right now shaun kelley bank of america merrill lynch analyst excellent great and then just one other clarification was around the new york asset and again appreciate the color that you did give us on that because i think we saw that in some of the new york real estate circles so the question i have on that is i think you mentioned it is a ground lease asset but then i think you also said that you may have some interest in the ground lease so could you just give us a little more color because we re undoubtedly gonna be trying to think about value there and it ll depend a lot on whether or not it s ground leased or how much of the ground lease you own mark hoplamazian president and chief executive officer okay excuse me given the transportation on which that property sits all the land is owned by government entities and we are the lessee of the land and owner of the improvements so that s the status that we have in that property and our intention would be to sell the property therefore inclusive of the ground lease interests to the development group that s been formed to pursue this new redevelopment on the site the adjacency of our site with it s contiguous with the grand central station parcel has allowed the development group to take advantage of certain opportunities to make that total redevelopment and opportunity more efficient and effective than it might otherwise be so it s a bit of a special opportunity with this group that owns the air rights at grand central shaun kelley bank of america merrill lynch analyst right because you can only use them if it s contiguous i think is one of the key rules around air rights mark hoplamazian president and chief executive officer well there are some transfer abilities it s not as powerful though as might exist if you re contiguous shaun kelley bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay great appreciate the color there and look forward to hearing more about that mark hoplamazian president and chief executive officer okay bradley o bryan treasurer and senior vice president investor relations and corporate finance christine this is brad we ll take our last question now operator your last question comes from the line of patrick scholes from suntrust your line is open patrick scholes suntrust robinson analyst hi good morning just a question on the two roads ebitda for 2020 and how should we think about that as we work on our models thank you mark hoplamazian president and chief executive officer in terms of earnings profile going forward patrick scholes suntrust robinson analyst yes yes you gave color on 19 but looking out to 20 how should we think about that mark hoplamazian president and chief executive officer yeah i ll just remind you what we said when we closed the deal and then i ll ask joan to just go through the numbers how they work in 2019 what we indicated is that we thought that it would take until 2021 effectively to get stabilized and also realize some of the embedded growth that was in the near term opening profile for the pipeline that we acquired and that our 2021 earnings base would yield effectively something in the range of about a 12 multiple on our purchase price and that underwriting remains correct in our view and as we think about the opportunity between now and then it comes in the form of some conversions and also excuse me accelerating new development opportunities on which we are fully working at the moment so that s the near term profile but joan you might wanna just recover how the numbers actually work in 2019 joan bottarini chief financial officer sure as a reminder on what we expect for 2019 we ve stated 0 to 5 million net impact of adjusted ebitda and a 40 million cost base inclusive of the 25 million of one time transition costs we expect to be fully transitioned by the end of this year so that 25 million the substance of that is technology conversions to bring the properties to our platform so that they could fully derive the benefits associated with our systems and other transition services that we are engaging with from the seller side to ensure a smooth transition and to have this all completed before the end of the year of 19 patrick scholes suntrust robinson analyst okay thank you very much operator at this time i return the call over to mr bradley o bryan i now turn the call back over to you bradley o bryan treasurer and senior vice president investor relations and corporate finance thank you christine and think everyone for joining us today and we look forward to seeing you in new york on march 5th

sitting with me in the sleek conference room of the afl cio s executive suite overlooking the white house john sweeney presents a striking contrast to his surroundings portly in his suspenders and rumpled shirt with his jacket nowhere in sight he appears totally unassuming it would be easy to underestimate the man at first glance the only way to gauge his emotions is by his passionate discourse on the present government and right now he s on a roll what we re seeing today is an administration that is probably the worst on working family issues and certainly the most anti union that we ve seen since herbert hoover we ve had republican administrations where we re on different sides during the election but after the election we at least attempted to work together on issues sweeney asserts if you look at the present policies whether it s tax or trade or even the current situation where they re looking for an economic recovery that s really jobless they re not focused on dealing with employment dealing with the loss of jobs but the job loss especially in the manufacturing industries has been in the millions in the past two years he continues sweeney was elected president of the afl cio in 1995 it marked a high point in a career and lifetime devoted to social justice and organized labor formed in 1955 with the merger of the american federation of labor and the congress of industrial organizations the afl cio is the umbrella organization for 64 member unions working in almost every part of the economy and has a membership of more than 13 million american workers for many years organized labor suffered from the perception that unions were corrupt and didn t serve the actual interests of workers the nov dec 2002 issue of the national right to work newsletter an anti union organization called the afl cio a multibillion dollar forced dues empire and referred to sweeney as a a tin eared dictator out of step with the real concerns of american workers still in spite of its detractors the afl cio added almost a million new members in the past two years and to the foes of organized labor sweeney hats proved a shrewd opponent using surprise spontaneity and no shortage of creativity to drive his points home to celebrate his election as president of the afl cio in 1995 he led an impromptu march up fashion avenue in new york city to protest wages and working conditions in the garment industry he s been known to even buy stock in a company in order to attend the shareholders conference and confront the company president on labor issues and he averages about one arrest per year for acts of civil disobedience i have enormous respect for john sweeney states senator edward kennedy the afl cio s voice as a powerful advocate for progressive public policy and the interests of working families is due largely to the strong leadership and determination of john sweeney and all americans are in his debt in a 1997 interview with the new republic political consultant don sweitzer compared sweeney to guerilla leader che guevara he is an old fashioned confrontational union organizer who is not afraid to use unpopular methods to get to the bottom line we had to do things differently sweeney acknowledges everything around us wats changing in the 1994 election we saw what newt gingrich was able to do and if anything it scared the hell out of us so i set out to build a stronger labor movement we had to grow if we didn t we weren t going to be effective politically and we weren t going to be effective in terms of collective bargaining in different industries we could never match the opposition in terms of money he continues but we had people power and we started a campaign to raise the focus among grassroots activists and rank and file workers in clinton s 1992 election union households were about 16 or 17 percent of the total electorate we realized that that had to increase so in 2000 with gore s election we increased the percentage from 16 to 26 percent of union households who voted the afl cio also encouraged its members to run for political office we re now up to about 5 000 people they re in state legislatures they re in city councils boards of education and three are members of congress sweeney proudly reports adding although we haven t endorsed a political candidate we re out there training workers to be involved in the campaign and they can go and work for any candidate they want now serving his third term as president john sweeney was raised on the teething ring of organized labor born in the bronx the oldest of four children of immigrants from county leitrim sweeney credits his passion for social justice to family faith and his irish heritage growing up in this happy very modest home family faith and heritage were important to us were both irish immigrants so we grew up in that culture and social justice was a big thing it was something that i felt very strongly about and in my youngest days i could draw the contrast between my father being a member of the union and my mother a domestic worker with no union and no benefits sweeney s father james a city bus driver wats a dedicated member of the transport workers union and a huge fan of its founder another irish immigrant kerry born mike quill we grew up in an atmosphere of him relating his improvements on the job to his union membership sweeney recalls i remember we d go to rockaway beach in the summertime and rent a cottage there my father couldn t join us all the time because he could only get a week s vacation or ten days at a time but i remember he said i can stay two weeks our last contract gave me so many more days of vacation time as a teenager sweeney attended union meetings and activities with his dad and campaigned for labor candidates at election time he went on to study economics at iona college in new rochelle new york the first in his family to attend college and worked his way through school in a union job as a grave digger unable to find work with any of the unions after graduation he did a brief stint at ibm before landing a position as a research assistant with the ladies garment workers union i was making ninety dollars a week at ibm he recalls the garment workers offered sixty dollars and i jumped at it in 1961 he joined the service employees international union in new york city as a union representative working his way up through the ranks sweeney was elected president in 1980 under his leadership the seiu s membership rose from 625 000 to 1 1 million at a time when union membership was declining overall in 1995 he drew national attention when he led striking janitors in a sit in on the 14th street bridge in washington d c during morning rash hour it was sweeney s success with the seiu that prompted other labor leaders to nominate him for the presidency of the afl cio throughout the 1980s the afl cio s membership steadily declined along with the political weight it carded on capitol hill sweeney s history of activism and agitation seemed to be just the thing needed to rejuvenate the federation and he was elected to the office in 1995 once in power sweeney embarked on a massive campaign to enlist new members earmarking one third of the afl cio s annual budget for this effort and to politicize the masses long believed to be the bastion of white men the union underwent a facelift under sweeney with new leadership opportunities for women and minorities we had to change the perception of our members they had to be more knowledgeable and educated about the labor movement about the issues and we also had to change the perception of the public sweeney recalls the struggle for an ideal is invariably uphill requiring equal doses of inspiration and pragmatism for sweeney the ideal is social justice throughout his life he has been a tireless advocate for workers rights fair wages good jobs health care retirement security and corporate accountability it s all part of the american dream the dream of sweeney s own immigrant parents our country s been built by immigrant workers we re all immigrants or the product of immigrants sweeney points out and we re all very proud of our roots but the way we re treating the present millions of immigrant workers in our country is a disgrace immigrant workers are being exploited even more than they have ever been in our country the only solution to the immigration problem right now is to have true immigration reform sweeney asserts which guarantees every worker the protection of the law to prevent them from being exploited if these workers are in a low wage job they should be getting whatever the legal minimum wage is and not something below that if they re working overtime they should be entitled to overtime pay to draw attention to the plight of immigrant and undocumented workers the afl cio sponsored the immigrant workers freedom rides last october modeled after the freedom rides during the civil rights movement of the 1960s these demonstrations drew scores of buses from across the country to rallies in washington d c and new york the issue gets raised about whether immigrants are going to replace workers in current jobs sweeney acknowledges i know workers in some industries are nervous about that but it s safe to say that millions of immigrant workers are working in some of the lowest paid service jobs farm jobs domestic workers office building cleaners hotel and restaurant workers and so on they re not depriving anyone of a job those are jobs that are available and i think that the paranoia has to be relieved policy makers who know that this is the situation have to stop using that as an argument against the legalization of immigration solve the legalization question the amnesty question and deal with these workers as human beings don t pit them against someone who was born in this country the traditional view of labor as a bastion for the preservation of american jobs might seem increasingly irrelevant in a world moving toward globalization but not john sweeney s labor he feel that the afl cio s demands for social justice are more necessary than ever in a post nafta world ten years after the signing of the north american free trade agreement the country is debating its costs and benefits the afl cio opposed the agreement along with the central american free trade agreement and the free trade areas of the americas agreement and sweeney explains why our message is that trade agreements have to include core labor standards and environmental initiatives ten years ago we opposed nafta because it really didn t provide for core labor standards or environmental protections we re talking about workers in those countries having the ability to assemble to organize to fight child labor and forced labor these are basic human rights that the ilo and the united nations have adopted and we think that these basic rights should be in every country and we should do everything in our trading negotiations to try and strengthen that we re as concerned about the developing world as anybody else is sweeney asserts and we have to deal with the issues of the developing world one of the ways we can deal with it is in terms of trade and also paying more attention to debt relief for developing countries we recognize the fact that trade is very important to our country to the economy and to our trading partners if we can protect capital and we can protect property rights in our trade agreements there s no reason that we can t make it work for working families we re not talking about imposing our economy our minimum wage or our standards on our trading partners globalization is here to stay and it s going to continue to grow we re more involved globally than we ve ever been because that s the direction that business and public policy are going and here in the u s sweeney says the need for a stronger voice for labor is as dire now as it ever was half the people in this country who are in jobs that fall into the category of worker not management would join a union if they had the opportunity it s not about whether a union has approached them although that s part of it it s about their employers really put pressure on them not to join a union there are thousands of cases each year where workers are fired because they are stimulating union organizing activities he emphasizes just look at homeland security sweeney continues they have increased the number of airport screeners which is necessary but they won t allow them to join unions they have disallowed them any opportunity to organize they have excluded 700 000 defense workers who will not be allowed to join unions or to participate in collective bargaining and while sweeney recognizes that there have been some modest improvements in some areas in terms of the economy the job situation is bad he says we have displaced steelworkers whose plants have closed and they re flipping hamburgers at mcdonald s part time that s really a disaster for our country he declares firmly with the primary season heating up and the afl cio preparing to endorse a presidential nominee sweeney says his ideal president would be one who would focus on the broad diversity and demographics of our country and address the issue of workers and their families he adds we have to have a country that s productive that is going to be successful in business and the economy and give everybody the hope the dream of having a good decent life with education health retirement security and a decent standard of living we ve done that before and we certainly as the strongest industrial country in the world and the strongest democracy have the ability and potential to do it again in a 1997 interview with irish america sweeney described the america of his childhood there was the feeling that if you worked hard you could get your decent share you were able to afford certain things you could get your kids educated you may have been poor or a member of the working class but there was still this feeling of hope now more than seven years later sweeney states i would add to that quote that you could expect a decent retirement retirement security is no longer a sure thing for anyone and sweeney blames corporate greed the enron situation was an example here were people who were decently paid enjoyed their work played by the rules paid their taxes raised their families moved up in the company got promoted and overnight were thrown out on the street they lost their retirement hundreds of thousands of dollars in many cases lost their homes and college funds that s a national disgrace in the wake of the enron debacle sweeney and the afl cio succeeded in negotiating a settlement for workers for a total of approximately 35 million dollars it s victories like this that sustain him improving the lives of all americans one worker at a time one family at a time the best part of this job is the satisfaction in helping workers he points out in my earliest days if i could get somebody his job back after he was terminated or organize a new worker who was making minimum wage and double his salary and his benefits as a result i was happy this is very satisfying kind of work he asserts whatever the problems are there s not a day when i am not eager and really anxious to get to work note some weeks after this interview the afl cio endorsed presidential candidate john kerry

jerry barag to cover full year 2018 results fourth quarter results and company guidance for the year ahead jerry barag president chief executive officer and director thanks brian good morning everybody and thank you for joining us as we all know the past six months have been somewhat volatile for the timber and wood products industry and especially difficult for lumber manufacturers with prices down 50 to 60 in certain lumber categories this led to a challenging fourth quarter particularly impacting owners of timberland in the pacific northwest at catchmark by design we have been able to navigate through this rough patch effectively unscathed our pure play model circumventing lumber price volatility the u s south micro markets where we are concentrated are steady and improving driven by recent under way and announced mill expansions which should result in future strengthening of unit prices furthermore southern yellow pine lumber prices have been less affected compared to other species and today stand at close to long term trend prices quite frankly our operations have remained unchanged during this period and so does our outlook for catchmark owned properties since catchmark s inception as a public company we have steadily expanded assembling the industry s consistently highest quality timberland portfolio and consistently meeting our operating targets we ve reduced exposure to volatility through our pure play nature we re a timberland investor not a lumber company our acquisitions have proved out by picking the right locations with proximity to the best mill markets our delivered wood sales strategy and fiber supply agreements continue to help baseload and optimize our timber sales revenue through relationships with creditworthy counterparties our diversified cash flow streams have enabled to defer harvest to optimize future upside we ve managed our capital effectively to maximize growth including entering into strategic joint ventures with institutional investors and our new investment management business delivers asset management fees helps protect against downside volatility and provides opportunities to capture very attractive incentive fees as a result of our business strategy catchmark is extremely well positioned to generate and grow durable cash flows always seeking to deliver a reliable dividend over time in 2018 specifically we took bold and significant steps to execute our long standing strategic initiatives to increase cash flow expand our prime timberland portfolio in top mill markets maximize results from harvest operations and reinforce our capital position in addition we significantly advanced our investment management business diversifying and solidifying our revenue streams and again we met our company guidance for the year in 2018 we increased timberlands managed by 200 to more than 1 5 million acres that included investing 200 million in the triple t joint venture which has secured significant stable ongoing asset management fees offers potential superior investment returns and attractive long term sustainable growth from extremely high quality texas timberlands and provides the opportunity for capturing performance based incentive management fees we further diversified assets and expanded sawtimber holdings by entering into the leading pacific northwest mill markets through the purchase of 18 000 acres of prime oregon timberlands in the 89 7 million bandon transaction after the triple t investment upgraded our regional portfolio we rebalanced our holdings in texas and louisiana and recycled capital to facilitate the bandon purchase that was accomplished with the sale of 56 000 acres of timberlands for 79 3 million in the southwest disposition we completed other hbu land sales of approximately 8 500 acres for 17 5 million meeting our target for the year within the range of 1 to 2 of the acreage disposed we raised 72 5 million of capital in an equity offering to pursue opportunities in a robust acquisition pipeline we improved liquidity by increasing total borrowing capacity by 75 million to 644 million at year end and secured a new seven year 140 million term loan to replace existing debt and we executed 200 million of interest rate swaps to mitigate exposure to rising interest rates looking specifically at full year 2018 result highlights we increased total revenues by 7 year over year we increased adjusted ebitda by 19 we increased asset management fees to 5 6 million which were primarily generated by triple t during the second half of 2018 we also produced 2 6 million in income and received 8 5 million in distributions from the dawsonville bluffs joint venture and during the year we paid fully covered dividends totaling 26 million or 0 54 per share catchmark also incurred a net loss of 122 million for full year 2018 these results were overwhelmingly due to losses allocated from the triple t joint venture in accordance with gaap rules in meeting our guidance for 2018 we again effectively demonstrated how our disciplined strategy for assembling the consistently highest quality timberlands portfolio and the ongoing operations excellence together to maximize cash flow and support our dividend to all phases of the business cycle and yesterday we declared a first quarter 2019 cash dividend of 0 135 per share for stockholders payable on march 15 our dividend yield is the highest among timber reits and continues to offer superior risk adjusted coverage in 2018 we completed an industry leading investment the triple t joint venture and took the first step in entering the pacific northwest through the bandon acquisition triple t especially represents a significant expansion of our holdings and both investments are designed to register durable cash flow growth and support our dividend well into the future they further enhance the quality of our prime timberlands in leading markets reinforced by delivered wood sales strategy and fiber supply agreements which meet our investment profile their premium stocking and productivity characteristics are in keeping with our stringent investment criteria which are proved out in helping deliver superior results and enabling operation advantages throughout our portfolio and these operating advantages continue to pay off in consistent and predictable cash flow we operate in superior micro markets with proximity to leading mills and customers we continue to benefit from executing on our delivered wood sale strategies in those mill markets and we gain from our extensive long term fiber supply agreements with creditworthy counterparties by strategic design the mill markets where we operate in the u s south continue to outperform southwide averages catchmark s average pine sawtimber stumpage price has maintained a premium over southwide averages ranging up to 9 since the first quarter 2017 the premium has been even higher in the chip n saw category ranging from 20 to 40 delivered wood sales had been at the foundation of our management philosophy and we increased delivered wood sales as a percentage of total harvest from 74 in 2017 to 80 in 2018 through our delivered wood sales strategy we can keep better control of our supply chain and produce more stable and predictable cash flows we also made a tactical decision early in the year to defer some harvest in anticipation of stronger future pricing our gross timber sales declined 3 year over year as harvest volume declined 8 year over year as a result of these discretionary deferrals but our per term pulpwood pricing increased about 6 to help offset the decline in harvest volume and our fourth quarter pine sawtimber stumpage price registered a 25 per ton compared to southwide averages which have tracked below 24 for the past eight quarters according to timbermart south in addition the significant new asset management fees from triple t and execution of planned hbu timberland sales to dispose of less productive holdings buttressed overall company performance during the year the new asset management fees are notable in diversifying our revenue streams and provide a predictable and significant source of ongoing cash flow in addition we have the opportunity to earn attractive performance based incentive fees going forward both our joint ventures in triple t and dawsonville bluffs are operating to plan and integration of triple t operations has been efficient and well managed meeting our performance objectives to date with regard to dawsonville bluffs we recognized 2 6 million of income during the year generated primarily from the planned sale of hbu timberland and mitigation bank credits in addition we received 8 5 million in distributions as we move to fully monetize this finite life 10 million investment ahead of schedule in terms of adjusted ebitda dawsonville contributed 6 8 million now turning specifically to catchmark s operating results for the 3 month period ending december 31 2018 we increased revenues 1 year over year we generated adjusted ebitda of 9 4 million compared to 9 9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 we produced 2 8 million in asset management fees primarily from triple t we completed timberland sales of approximately 1300 acres for 2 6 million we incurred a net loss of 32 million primarily due to gaap accounting losses allocated from triple t and we paid a dividend of 0 135 per share to stockholders of record on december 13 2018 as a result of our plan to strategically defer harvest for an anticipated future stronger pricing environment gross timber sales revenue in the fourth quarter decreased 20 from fourth quarter 2017 due to a 22 decrease in harvest volume timberland sales for the quarter were higher year over year due to selling more acres at a price per acre 26 above fourth quarter 2017 in the fourth quarter catchmark completed a series of coordinated transactions by closing on the sale of 56 000 acres of timberlands in texas and louisiana the southwest region disposition as a part of the sale we retained approximately 200 000 tons of merchantable inventory to be harvested over the next two years proceeds from the southwest disposition were recycled to pay down debt used for last summer s bandon acquisition as a result of these two transactions in triple t we improved the overall quality of our timberlands ownership in the southwest and reduced our regional exposure to post the triple t investment we also redeployed capital to prime sawtimber holdings in the pacific northwest and we strengthened our overall capital position also in the fourth quarter under our 30 million share repurchase program announced in august 2015 catchmark repurchased close to 99 000 shares of common stock for approximately 1 million in open market transactions as of december 31 2018 catchmark may repurchase up to an additional 18 7 million worth of shares under the program given the relative stability of our cash flow and recent steps taken to reduce debt including the southwest disposition we re very comfortable with our balance sheet during the year we raised 72 5 million in equity to support our investment pipeline we refinanced existing debt which was outstanding under our multi draw facility securing 140 million term loan this refinancing improved our weighted average maturities and our first step maturities are now marked until 2024 after increasing our borrowing capacity to a total of 644 million we had 165 million of dry powder at year end and we entered into 200 million of interest rate swaps to reduce exposure to potential rising interest rates approximately three quarters of our rate exposure was swaps fixed rate as of year end 2018 as a result going into the new year we have sufficient capacity and flexibility to continue our track record of growth through select acquisitions and joint venture investments at the appropriate time taken together all the initiatives we completed last year will help set the stage for growth in adjusted ebitda for 2019 as well as in the future and we believe that we are well positioned to navigate through current economic volatility stemming from general concern about the housing market and tariff and trade issues as well as global uncertainty lumber mills in our micro markets are operating at or near full capacity demand is good for finished lumber supported by expected level of housing activity including robust repair and remodel business we also see no pullback in previously announced mill expansion projects in the u s south and recent capital investments in mills are beginning to pay off with improved production levels that is beginning to drive increased log demands in our micro markets across the region another positive sign overall finished lumber inventories are light which bodes well for mills to run at or near capacity levels with multiple shifts furthermore southern yellow pine lumber manufacturers are still able to produce lumber with comfortable margins based on current levels of finished lumber prices and timber input prices our pulp markets also remained strong across all products as a result our fiber supply agreement partners and other pulp customers appear well positioned for steady production throughout the year ahead lastly historically weather conditions are supporting and even increasing timber prices in our market taking all factors into consideration for full year 2019 guidance we anticipate adjusted ebitda in a range of 52 million to 60 million or a 4 to 21 increase compared to full year 2018 this increase will result primarily from earning a full year of triple t asset management fees of 11 5 million as well as an increase in net timber revenue attributable to higher harvest volumes harvest volumes are anticipated in the range of 2 2 million to 2 4 million tons and increases our forecast to drive from southwest disposition timber reservations deferred harvest from last year and expect the new harvest from the bandon acquisition beginning in the second quarter bandon should also help increase the share of sawtimber and our mix into a range of 40 to 50 in the u s south we also anticipate a slight increase of approximately 1 in harvest volume as a result of our delivered wood sales and fiber supply agreements in select micro markets the timberland sales target of 16 million to 18 million remains consistent with past years within the range of 1 to 2 of the acreage we ve also been delighted with dawsonville bluffs which by year end 2018 had generated adjusted ebitda of 8 8 million we anticipate dawsonville generating an additional 3 million to 5 million surpassing our original investment of 10 million our outlook does not include potential contributions from future acquisitions and joint ventures which we pursue as part of our ongoing growth strategy and does not include any potential capital recycling from dispositions so in summary catchmark s favorable guidance for the year ahead derives directly from the well formulated and consistently executed programs that deliver durable cash flow for our shareholders and support our dividend they are investing capital prudently in prime timberlands in selected markets near leading mill customers to provide growth opportunities which has resulted in price and demand stability also benefiting from the disciplined management of delivered sales strategy and fiber supply agreements in those markets with creditworthy counterparties to cushion against volatility capturing new highly predictable revenue streams from entry into the investment management business and finally focusing to derive upside from our investment in triple t and further upside from dawsonville bluffs so in conclusion catchmark had an extremely successful year in 2018 in meeting our strategic objectives registering higher year over year revenues and higher ebitda and significantly expanding our investments and investment management platform and we believe we re well positioned to move ahead successfully in 2019 all of us at catchmark our executive group our board our astounding and dedicated employees have worked extremely hard to position the company to deliver on our promise to our shareholders grow cash flow and support our dividend from execution of a clear and focused strategy and operations excellence that will continue to be our focus in the year ahead i appreciate everybody being on the call today and now todd brian john rasor and i are available to take any of your questions questions and answers operator we ll now begin the question and answer session operator instructions and look today s first question will be from collin mings with raymond james please go ahead collin mings raymond james analyst thanks good morning guys jerry barag president chief executive officer and director good morning brian davis chief financial officer good morning collin collin mings raymond james analyst to start jerry do you have any other acquisitions or dispositions in the active pipeline right now and just along those lines how do you think about the potential to reduce leverage further here in 2019 with some additional capital recycling jerry barag president chief executive officer and director okay so it s an easy answer to the first part of your question no we purposefully made a decision post the frenetic end of 2018 and closing triple t the southwest disposition and bandon to make sure that we had appropriately integrated all those changes into our portfolio and so we have effectively stopped looking at acquisitions for the time being and then with the dislocation that happened in our share price we didn t think that it was a particularly opportune time to aggressively go and seek new investments so having said that from a capital standpoint we are very very focused right now on liquidity in particular and the use of that liquidity which we think would be best spent on a combination of paying down debt and some tactical share repurchases assuming our share price remains at a level that i think is unrealistically low and opportune for us to repurchase shares so i think that will be certainly the focus of what we re doing for the first six months of 2019 and we ll continue to reevaluate that brian do you have anything you want to add brian davis chief financial officer no i guess another point of emphasis here collin is when we take a look at our guidance for 2019 which reflects a full year impact associated with bandon as well as triple t our leverage profile does naturally reduce from the levels where on a stated basis today by another turn to turn in a quarter so you put that on top of what jerry is talking about an opportunity for us to review some capital recycling opportunities that would be on a cad per share neutral basis and that would also maximize our asset realizations you see some opportunities inside of our portfolio for additional leverage reduction collin mings raymond james analyst okay so on balancing nothing under contract or really active right now neither of the acquisition or disposition front or just given where things stand it sounds like the buyers would be fear to go one way or the other it would may be to be to sell something to on the margin bring down leverage a little bit more is that a fair recap brian davis chief financial officer i think that is very accurate as the way we re thinking about things collin mings raymond james analyst okay that s helpful and then switching to triple t can you just provide us an update both operationally as well as any progress toward restructuring the sawtimber supply agreement or really any other value creation event recognizing you guys are highly incentivized to unlock value in the first few years of that deal so an update there again both operationally as well as any sort of value creation activity would be very helpful jerry barag president chief executive officer and director so john rasor is here joining us today and i m going to turn over the specifics of that question to him but he as well as everybody on the team involved with triple t have done just a remarkable job of integrating 1 1 million acres into full operations and i m pleased to report that we are running at a full operational run rate at this point and have been for some time we ve met all of the minimum deliveries or the expected deliveries to the supply agreement counterparties in the southwest and it continues to go well there continues to improve and john will talk a little bit about that with respect to the future opportunities that we identified when we purchased the triple t property we re working toward that diligently that was not meant to be an overnight process it s going to take a little bit of time but we have begun the process of trying to get to agree that we think we ll have the opportunity to add significant value to that property john won t you give a little bit more detail about that john rasor president triple t timberlands okay i think the headline what the property of this size and the amount of volume that has to move is best described as more than 400 truckloads a day to support the supply agreements then and the additional sales we make into the market and with the weather that has been absolutely historically epic over there meaning it just has rained and rained and rained with the rainfall for the quarter being well over anything that anybody has seen previously i m feeling like we met the challenge as jerry said we satisfied both the big georgia pacific supply agreement requirements and the ip supply agreement requirements that was quite an accomplishment but the challenges we faced with the weather alone i would add to that that while we hit all the numbers on the volumes we did come up short on the hardwood volumes simply because we could not access the tracks we will be prepared to get after that again in 2019 and you really only have about three month window over there in the flatwoods of texas to get into these bottom lands and we intend to be fully prepared to take advantage of that opportunity as we look at 2019 surely the rain will be less by then on the harvest revenue side i can tell you pricing has been a bit less than we had expected but we re seeing some uplift now so that we re looking at a really good start in january and we see prices moving upward specifically around the prime pulpwood and the prime sawtimber products also our surface use income has been significant and better than we expected with the oil and gas activity that has become quite a component of our business that s been value added and we will we ve started to implement a modest land sale program and are very encouraged by the kind of pricing and interest we re getting so it was a tough six months but we got there and we re looking forward to 2019 jerry barag president chief executive officer and director yes so i will remind everybody that all of these things and all of the accomplishments that have happened over there are important but from a cash flow standpoint from an ebitda standpoint to catchmark it s really a barometer for what we expect to be able to move property value and nav over time the earnings that catchmark receives on that property are essentially from the investment management fees so realistically changes in prices changes in income for 2019 really won t have any bearing on the ebitda that catchmark is going to get from its investment collin mings raymond james analyst okay that s very helpful update guys two other quick ones for me i ll turn it over just on capex brian it looks like you guys came in a little bit below budget for 2018 how should we think about 2019 on the capex front i apologize if i missed this in the guidance brian davis chief financial officer it s about 5 million to 6 million next year we got a carryover from the fourth quarter and first quarter this year so 5 million to 6 million in 2019 collin mings raymond james analyst okay and then on just the cost side overall it does look like g a forestry management fees and other operating expenses were all up notably sequentially in the fourth quarter again not necessarily huge dollar amounts but just collectively that was a notable variance for us at least just anything in particular we should be mindful of brian davis chief financial officer so in the q4 in g a it included pursue costs about 150 000 i think that s noted inside the adjusted ebitda reconciliation line as it stands with other operating expenses we expense basis of timber related to lease terminations and timber deed expirations and casualty losses within the operating expense line item in the fourth quarter we had just under 600 000 of non cash charges related to this activity the corresponding entry reflecting these non cash expenses can be found on our cash flow statement in the operating section so those are the two notable areas which you can we can provide detail on collin mings raymond james analyst okay i ll turn it over and go back in the queue thanks guys brian davis chief financial officer thank you operator next question will be from anthony pettinari with citi please go ahead randy toth citi analyst good morning guys this is actually randy toth sitting in for anthony i guess my first question is brian davis chief financial officer good morning randy toth citi analyst good morning can you talk a little bit about your 2019 guidance and what baked in i know you have 3 million to 5 million coming from dawsonville and i imagine around 11 million coming from triple t just any assumptions around pricing in the u s south jerry barag president chief executive officer and director i m going to let todd answer that todd reitz senior vice president forest resources sure so we ll think about overall market conditions and where we re coming out of 2018 we finished fourth quarter very strong had a nice run rate coming up to that point as jerry mentioned in his comments some of that being weather related but the bigger takeaway and the stable steady part of this is that we re beginning to see build consumption improve some of the capital improvements that have been initiated in late 2017 and 2018 are beginning to come online so we re seeing some of that demand pull that being said we re anticipating some more stable view of pricing if you will going forward so if we saw a 2 to 3 very modest uptick over the year that would be what we re looking at going forward additionally we have a little stronger mix of sawtimber in there as jerry mentioned with bandon coming on and we re positioned to harvest this year going to be more in that 40 to 50 range so some added value associated with that as well jerry barag president chief executive officer and director yeah and i probably like to remind everybody that a year ago when we did this call i think my exact words were that we would be disappointed if we didn t see some modest improvement in prices over the operating areas where catchmark owns its properties and in fact we delivered that in spite of some headwinds that came from southern yellow pine exports that were effectively derailed as a result of tariffs that were put on particularly punitive tariffs from the u s south and so we re very proud at being able to do that we certainly saw the conditions strengthening and being able to do that we think we delivered it and i think we feel relatively confident that we will see some more strengthening going into 2019 randy toth citi analyst okay that s helpful and then just saying in the u s south it s quite a bit of saw mill capacity coming online over the next 12 to 24 months especially in alabama and georgia my question is how will all of this capacity impact pricing for pulpwood because of the saw mill residuals just kind of curious how that relationship how you think about that jerry barag president chief executive officer and director sure so you look at a lot of the customers where we re operating and in general they have a baseload that is associated with raw logs that have to come in pulpwood that has to come in that component will be consistent pricing for that has been very very stable we see that being strong going forward and customers being well positioned for that as far as the residuals are concerned they ll work that into their overall mix and we think that we re going to see some positive movement on the market going forward additionally with our supply agreements we have a strong position with our customers that are stable and set forth into the future 10 12 years depending on who we re working with that allows us to be a little bit insulated to any of the ups and downs if you will in the marketplace randy toth citi analyst okay that s helpful thank you i ll turn it over jerry barag president chief executive officer and director thank you operator operator instructions next question will be from paul quinn with rbc capital markets please go ahead paul quinn rbc capital markets analyst yeah thanks very much good morning guys jerry barag president chief executive officer and director hi paul brian davis chief financial officer hi paul paul quinn rbc capital markets analyst hey just a question on 2018 just what was the quantify of harvest that you deferred and it sounds like that you re going to harvest a part of the deferral or all it so maybe you could just help me out in 2019 jerry barag president chief executive officer and director sure so when you look at it as a year over year call it 150 000 100 000 or so tons that we pulled back going into 2018 going into 2019 we re going to end up adding about that amount back in so it s kind of a rebalancing of where we were compared to previous again it will be a regional difference with the northwest coming in and then having the timber reservation coming out of the southwest as well so all of that will pretty much be brought back online throughout 2019 paul quinn rbc capital markets analyst so the original reason for the deferral was to take advantage of higher timber prices down the round is the stuff that you re coming in but i guess the increased harvest in 2019 as a result of the deferral in 2018 on the regional mix is that going to result in a higher price in the sort of 2 to 3 that you re kind of expecting jerry barag president chief executive officer and director we would anticipate that going the modest increase throughout the year or potential for throughout the year that s correct paul quinn rbc capital markets analyst okay and just shifting now we haven t seen a lot of timberland transactions it seems like i don t know a year and a half two years now and we had a pretty steady increase in interest rates throughout 2018 have you seen or you experienced yourself changing underwriting criteria around that jerry barag president chief executive officer and director i think underwriting criteria has generally been somewhat stable paul now where the volatility has been has been really out in the pacific northwest where you ve had a lot of volatility for the most part to the upside but more recently to the downside in timber prices and so interestingly there since we closed on the bandon transaction there were two properties that were offered out in the pacific northwest one of them actually transacted the other one didn t transact in that that was the first time in quite some time that a property in pacific northwest failed to meet a clearing price what we re seeing going forward into 2019 are a couple of things a couple of trends one is quality has become much more important even it was important previously it s become much more important and so higher quality property is the best properties are trading and they are supporting floor pricing number one number two it s going to be an interesting transaction because there still is seemingly a lot of pressure on the timos who have a decade or so old investments that there is pressure for them to liquidate but they have been cycling through their portfolio selling the better properties as opposed to the weaker properties and in the u s that s getting harder to do because you had seen a lot of transactions in the pacific northwest and that seems to be coming off given i think people s anticipation that pacific northwest properties are going to at least flatten or potentially some of the valuations out there might fall interestingly what we ve heard at this early point in the year is there maybe a significant number of international transactions that happen or offerings that are coming from the timos this year and so naturally we won t be a very active participant in things like that paul quinn rbc capital markets analyst all right thanks very much best of luck guys jerry barag president chief executive officer and director thanks paul brian davis chief financial officer thanks paul operator next question is a follow up from collin mings please go ahead collin mings raymond james analyst thanks just a couple of housekeeping things from me here just as far as the timing of future losses associated with triple t can you just maybe give us some guidepost there and remind us what that should be just given how that just from a net perspective kind of a big driver brian davis chief financial officer certainly collin so how we re thinking about is about 25 million per quarter for q1 through q3 and then the remaining 15 million in q4 2019 collin mings raymond james analyst okay and then i apologize if i missed this brian but as far as have you quantified a g a number for 2019 again i guess you kind of gave us some other puzzled pieces but can you be a little bit more explicit there brian davis chief financial officer we ll give you the corners to your puzzle collin so we anticipate g a to increase about 1 to 2 year over year which close about 2 6 million of equity compensation one thing i should note as we kind of fill these things in our other operating expense is expected to remain flat on a gross basis even after backing out the other operating expense that we occurred in fourth quarter this year the real net increase is resulting from property taxes and for where we added for forestry management will increase year over year to about 7 3 million to 7 7 million as we allocate expenses of our management of our joint ventures from g a into this line item and this is inclusive of approximately about 500 000 of equity compensation expense collin mings raymond james analyst okay that s helpful detail and then just going back to paul s question as far as timberland transaction markets jerry just for our benefit can you maybe just maybe clarify a little bit as far as some of the evolution in the market if you will how much of that is being driven by some of the potential bidders not maybe emerging as much they would have a couple of years ago is it concerns around pricing and the trajectory of pricing specifically in the northwest near term or longer term outlook for the u s south just curious maybe more simply that the pool of potential buyers has changed or maybe has some of their underwriting and the environment changed where it just has been as active jerry barag president chief executive officer and director i think the answer is yes to all of the above so the backdrop to the markets really starts with liquidity and liquidity is i would tell you it was a transaction year last year so there is liquidity it is coming from different places and it is it s spotty certainly compare to what it used to be a decade ago and that trend has been around for the last couple of years and i don t think that it is going to change if you look at the buyer s property over the last year or over the last couple of years it s a rotation in names i mean its different names than you would have likely seen a decade ago and the philosophies around those transactions tend to be a little bit different so by and large the as i previously mentioned higher quality properties and really high quality markets are the ones that are ultimately transacting there have been some other transactions of lesser quality properties and after being marketed for multiple times some of those had begun to actually trade now there was actually a trade of some alabama property at the end of last year that transacted at just under 1 200 an acre and interestingly it was a pretty similar price to the triple t transaction although it was much worse mill markets much less productive property than triple t and a much different story and so you may see some of that actually come to market and finally transact now in 2019 but i believe the real focus is going to be from the sellers they re going to looking around their portfolio for properties in pockets of strength and i think right now they believe that those pockets of strength really are international properties international investments that they ve made and that there s probably more liquidity especially in the timo market for international properties right now than domestic properties collin mings raymond james analyst along those lines are you concerned though as maybe some of these lower quality properties clear the market just the impact that might have on timberland appraisals and just from that environment recognizing again you have triple t up there which at some point you like the optionality around that but just curious how you think this might actually filter through from an appraisal standpoint in the marketplace jerry barag president chief executive officer and director yes as you pointed out it really becomes an appraisal issue the appraisal issue at least for us the biggest outcome of that would be around the loan to value ratios the coverage ratios that go with our debt we think we re comfortably insulated from it and but at the end of the day we do believe that the appraisers and the market in general has made the distinction between lower quality properties and higher quality properties and we are not feeling much downward pressure if any on the types of properties that we own i think it s going to be a different state of properties which ultimately may have an impact on the ncreif timberland index so it should cause some interesting headlines but operationally for us i don t expect there s problems collin mings raymond james analyst i appreciate all the extra color jerry barag president chief executive officer and director great thanks collin operator at this time this will conclude today s question and answer session i d like to turn the conference back over to jerry barag for any closing remarks jerry barag president chief executive officer and director thanks

bowe president and chief executive officer thanks john and good morning everyone thank you for joining our call this morning to review our fourth quarter 2018 results i ll start by providing some viewpoints on each of our four business groups after brian valentine our cfo provides a business review i will conclude our prepared remarks with some comments about our early views on 2019 and then we ll take your questions adjusted fourth quarter and full year 2018 results were better than those of the comparable 2017 periods grain and plant nutrient results in particular were much improved we also successfully closed our acquisition of lansing trade group just after year end and we re excited about our early integration momentum we had our best fourth quarter in the grain business since 2011 weaker margins drove the ethanol group s results lower year over year but they operated well given the market backdrop plant nutrient group improved results in each of its product lines except specialty nutrients and the rail group s results were on par with those of the fourth quarter of 2017 the grain group rebounded from a tough third quarter as corn and soybean basis values improved largely as we expected however weak spreads contracted sharply during the quarter leading to a full year decrease in base income per bushel large u s carryouts in corn and soybeans limited trading opportunities while increasing storage income lansing had a strong quarter on an operating basis as i mentioned earlier we successfully closed on the lansing acquisition at the beginning of 2019 this transaction aligns very well with our overall growth strategy as it supports growth in grain originations merchandising and specialty food and feed ingredients it broadens our portfolio of products and services and it expands our geographic reach despite industry margin headwinds the ethanol group was profitable during the fourth quarter the group s achievements were driven by timely hedging and continuing production efficiency despite higher industry stocks and seasonally low demand the plant nutrient group posted better results compared to those of late 2017 wholesale nutrient results improved year over year on stronger primary nutrient margins but specialty nutrient margins suffered further even though volumes were up the lawn business put a strong finish on a record year the group did a nice job managing expenses reducing them by about 10 the railcar market continues to steadily improve while these rates are rising for most car types in many cases renewal rates are still lower than the rates they re replacing our utilization rate rose again sequentially to its highest level in recent history at 94 and we continue to buy cars in the secondary market we continue to gain efficiencies across the company by improving productivity we achieved our 10 million run rate cost savings in each of 2016 and 2017 and also reached our goal of 7 5 million in 2018 that brings our three year cost takeout total to nearly 30 million this year while we ll still have our eyes on similar opportunities across the company our primary focus will be on achieving 10 million in run rate cost synergies from the lansing acquisition i ll be back after brian s remarks to discuss our early thoughts about 2019 brian will now walk you through a more detailed review of our fourth quarter financial results brian valentine senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks pat and good morning everyone we re now on slide no 5 in the fourth quarter of 2018 the company reported net income attributable to the andersons of 23 8 million or 0 84 per diluted share and adjusted net income of 26 million or 0 92 per diluted share the adjusted results exclude 3 1 million of pre tax transaction costs related to the lansing acquisition on an adjusted basis earnings per share for the quarter improved by more than 35 year over year earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization or ebitda and adjusted ebitda for the fourth quarter of 2018 were 60 2 million and 63 3 million respectively an increase in adjusted ebitda of almost 20 year over year for the full year 2018 revenue was just over 3 billion compared to 3 7 billion in revenue last year a 2018 change in revenue recognition rules reduced full year sales by approximately 700 million but had an immaterial impact on gross profit net income attributable to the andersons was 41 5 million in 2018 or 1 46 per diluted share adjusted net income attributable to the andersons was 46 4 million or 1 63 per diluted share these numbers compare to reported net income of 42 5 million earned in the same period of 2017 or 1 50 per diluted share and adjusted net income attributable to the company of 33 7 million or 1 19 per diluted share full year adjusted ebitda was 178 1 million which compares favorably to full year 2017 adjusted ebitda of 157 4 million our full year effective tax rate was 22 5 the onetime impact of 2017 u s federal income tax reform on 2018 income tax expense was negligible we currently believe that our 2019 effective income tax rate will be in the range of 24 to 26 we re still evaluating the impact of the lansing acquisition on that number we increased our long term debt during 2018 which raised our long term debt to equity ratio to 0 57 to 1 the closing of the lansing acquisition included the assumption of approximately 160 million of lansing and thompsons limited long term debt we refinanced the lansing debt as well as the cash portion of the purchase price using part of our new 1 65 billion unsecured credit facility in mid january the new facility includes five and seven year tranches and provides us with future financing flexibility after the refinancing our long term debt stands at approximately 1 billion and our long term debt to equity ratio is approximately one to one while the interest rates on the facility are variable we have fixed the rate on much of a long term debt turning now to slide no 6 we present bridge graphs that compare 2017 adjusted pre tax income to 2018 adjusted pre tax income year over year for the fourth quarter and for the full year in the fourth quarter the grain group s income improved through the higher merchandising income from recovery and corn and soybean basis levels offset somewhat by unexpected tightening of wheat spreads the plant nutrient group s improvement was driven by better margins on primary nutrients and lower expenses unallocated net cost adjusted for lansing acquisition expenses were higher primarily due to a fourth quarter 2017 gain on the sale of a former retail store property on slide 7 you can see that the only significant variances for the year ending december 31 2018 were in the rail group and in other net unallocated expenses the rail group anticipated lower income as the result of a change in accounting rules but it also decided to scrap a significant number of cars at a book loss to generate cash reduce carrying costs and take advantage of relatively high scrap steel prices unallocated costs were 13 8 million lower a 2017 net loss in the former retail segment accounts for more than half of that change and third quarter 2018 income from investments owned by maumee ventures accounts for most of the remainder before we leave this slide i also wanted to point out that the ethanol group s results were up more than 15 in 2018 despite a difficult margin environment now we ll move on to a review of each of our four business units beginning with the grain group on slide no 8 our fourth quarter grain group results improved year over year the group reported pre tax income of 25 4 million an increase of more than 30 versus the adjusted pre tax income of 19 2 million in the same period of 2017 improved income from merchandising activities drove base grain pre tax income to 22 4 million in the fourth quarter compared to adjusted pre tax income of 15 7 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 income from affiliates was moderately lower year over year lansing incurred expenses related to closing its sale to the andersons and also recorded an impairment charge on an investment in a small canadian based grain company these two charges had a nearly 2 million impact on the grain group s pre tax results grain group ebitda for the quarter of 32 1 million was more than 25 higher than fourth quarter of 2017 adjusted ebitda of 25 2 million now we ll move to ethanol s results on slide no 9 as we anticipated during our last earnings call the ethanol group s fourth quarter performance fell somewhat short of its comparable 2017 results however given the market conditions in which it operated during the quarter we feel good about their accomplishments the group earned fourth quarter pre tax income attributable to the company of 5 1 million or 1 3 million less than the 6 4 million in pre tax income attributable to the company for the same period last year the primary drivers of the group s results were timely hedging and continued highly efficient production margins continued to be stressed by higher inventories causing some producers to slow or halt production during the quarter falling gasoline prices also reduced demand for e 85 for the quarter although full year e 85 sales rose more than 25 for the second consecutive year on slide 10 we can see that the plant nutrient group generated pre tax income of 3 8 million a marked improvement over the reported pre tax loss of 18 million and an adjusted pre tax loss of 900 000 in 2017 gross profit rose by 2 4 million or more than 10 primarily due to a significant improvement in gross margin per ton on the flip side gross profit on specialty nutrient margins continued to suffer even as volume increased somewhat the farm center and lawn businesses were modestly more profitable than in the fourth quarter of 2017 plant nutrient group ebitda for the quarter was 12 5 million compared to 2017 adjusted ebitda of 6 9 million on slide no 11 you can see that the rail group generated 6 7 million of pre tax income which was equal to fourth quarter 2017 results our utilization rate averaged 94 3 for the quarter which was up compared to 92 last quarter and 8 1 above the fourth quarter 2017 utilization average lease rates were unchanged year over year overall maintenance expense also was flat despite higher tank car recertification costs base leasing pre tax income of 1 4 million was down by 0 5 million from last year s results due to higher interest expenses the group recorded income from car sales of 1 2 million down from 3 3 million of pre tax income in the fourth quarter of 2017 much of the year over year variance was from gains recorded from nonrecourse financing transactions in the fourth quarter of 2017 which were permitted under previous revenue recognition rules the group s repair business produced fourth quarter results almost 30 better than those of the comparable period we also recorded a 2 4 million gain on the sale of some barges the group s ebitda for the quarter was 17 9 million more than 25 better than the fourth quarter 2017 ebitda of 14 3 million from a fleet management perspective 2018 was another active and productive year the group spent 105 million to buy almost 2 400 cars which are the second highest annual amount since 2004 and 2005 respectively the group also scrapped almost 2 300 cars or almost 500 more than its previous high set in 2017 more importantly the rail group maintained the size of the fleet and improved utilization while once again increasing its average remaining life in accordance with its fleet portfolio management objectives and with that i ll now turn the call back over to pat for a few comments on our outlook for 2019 pat bowe president and chief executive officer thanks brian as we look farther into 2019 we expect our overall company results to continue to improve we re especially focused on getting lansing fully integrated with our grain business and operating as a trade group the grain group was merged with lansing to form the trade group when we closed the acquisition in early january we expect the combined group to accelerate the steady improvements we ve made in our grain business performance since 2015 we continue to believe that this acquisition will be accretive on an operating basis for the end of this year our new expanded scale has us well on our way to achieving our run rate expense synergy target of 10 million by the end of the year and we re beginning to uncover some nice top line opportunities as well the result will be a larger andersons that produces significantly more gross profit and ebitda the ethanol group s near term outlook will continue to be defined by the margin pressure it experienced throughout 2018 as there were fewer opportunities to hedge forward margins into early 2019 we anticipate lower year over year results in the first half of the year the group continues to focus on maximizing the margin it can earn on every bushel of corn it grinds we re making good progress on the construction of our new bio refinery in kansas that will allow us to introduce some new products late this year we still expect to begin producing conventional lower carbon ethanol in mid 2019 our plant nutrient group continues to be impacted by low margins especially in specialty nutrients while primary nutrient prices have strengthened we don t anticipate significant appreciation into 2019 lawn and contract manufacturing should continue to perform well but will likely be off its record 2018 performance the rail group continues to actively pursue its primary objectives to profitably grow the number of railcars on lease and to continue to expand its railcar repair network they continue to work through the last of the 2018 tank car requalification work we expect our average lease rates will remain under pressure as we continue to work through renewals of leases that were booked at peak rates overall we anticipate steady improvement in the group s results in closing our 2018 company results were considerably better than those of 2017 i m optimistic that we will see continued improvement in 2019 especially as we integrate lansing while the trade group is showing good early signs and rail continues to steadily improve we ll remain guarded in the near term about the prospects for ethanol and plant nutrient the lansing acquisition and the element project give us more confidence that we ll achieve the 2020 ebitda target of 300 million on an operating basis that we set in late 2017 with that i d like to hand the call back over to mark our operator to entertain your questions questions and answers operator thank you our first question comes from the line of eric larson with buckingham research your line is now open eric larson buckingham research analyst thank you nice quarter everybody pat bowe president and chief executive officer thank you eric eric larson buckingham research analyst congrats on a good year so really i have to start with kind of lansing you ve closed on the transaction here the look of your p l is going to change quite a bit so do you expect lansing to be accretive to earnings this i mean how should we be modeling this thing for 2019 pat bowe president and chief executive officer thanks eric and we re really excited about the progress we re making on integration with lansing we re proud of the fact that we ve made good investment to have some people help us with the integration planning and setting up the imo office we have good work streams that are actively working on putting the two companies together we ve seen a lot of already just in a short period of time the teams are working great together and we re excited about how the traders of both companies are working together on a shared trade book so things are going very well with lansing we re also targeting these synergies we ve said before and the work on that goes well so all that feels very good and your last part of your question is yes we expect the transaction to be accretive in the first year on an operating basis so we re all lights are green so far with very good feelings toward lansing brian valentine senior vice president and chief financial officer and this is brian i would just add we re working through the all the valuation work and so our first quarter results of course will have impacts of purchase accounting and that type of stuff but we ll carve all that out separately and as pat said it s our expectation we ll be accretive on an operating basis eric larson buckingham research analyst ok and then the overall grain environment which obviously with all the kind of a u s china trade deal has remained pretty difficult there s not a lot of volatility in the grain markets trading opportunities are limited your first half kind of grain cadence in earnings how should we be thinking about that for you pat as well pat bowe president and chief executive officer yes i think you hit the nail on the head there i mean i think the market is paying a lot of attention on geopolitical events more so than maybe market fundamentals in grain good news for us is that we put on really good harvest positions and filled most and carrying charges on corn and soybeans have widened the bad news is wheat spreads have narrowed in dramatically so the carry we ve enjoyed the last few years on wheat has come in quite a bit so that s something that s different than we had the last couple of years we i think one thing will happen we ll have to see what the china trade talks happen here in the next couple of weeks that could be encouraging overall to the marketplace and it would be nice to just have that behind us for our farmers and the ag industry in general so that would also give some potential good strength to ethanol if china opened again for ddgs and ethanol import so that s i think the big geopolitical thing that most people in the markets are watching right now eric larson buckingham research analyst ok yes then one final question obviously the way the market is pricing grain today you blow the cost of production for farmers on beans your kind of maybe at the cost of production maybe a little bit higher if we stay above 4 on the harvest contract you can kind of make a little bit of money in corn which means implies that you should have a fair increase in acreage planted in corn this year is my guess so why would that not start helping your plant nutrient business a lot more i understand having a guarded view is probably very prudent but why wouldn t the prospects for plant nutrient be a little bit better pat bowe president and chief executive officer yes i think you got again you have a good analysis there on how we look to corn acres would be beneficial overall to fertilizer use we also with pretty poor weather here in the fourth quarter didn t get much early application weren t done across the midwest with all the cold and snow and ice so it could get off to a decent start on the other hand price has started to recover on the wholesale side but have kind of stalled a little bit so we re kind of keeping an eye on what absolute fertilizer prices do and because of that low farmer income that s been troubling to our specialty products with farmers not wanting to pay up for our specialty products so that s a concern for us and that s why we said we re probably more guarded a boost in corn acreage would be a nice fundamental thing to support our fertilizer business eric larson buckingham research analyst all right thanks guys i ll pass it on pat bowe president and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of ken zaslow of bmo capital markets your line is now open ken zaslow bmo capital markets analyst good afternoon guys pat bowe president and chief executive officer good afternoon ken how are you ken zaslow bmo capital markets analyst hello doing all right so a couple of questions one is on the ethanol you mentioned some comments that you said you have the timing hedges which we knew about but the efficiency of production really contributed and then you followed that up with others needed to halt production so two questions on this one is what were your real efficiencies and where did you gain that from and did you have to halt production as well or you just left production that was part of your efficiencies can you just tie those two together pat bowe president and chief executive officer yes no good question ken so we ve been working on different technologies at all of our plants our four plants in the past three years it really helped a lot a big portion has been on energy cost reduction one of the bigger ones we did was in albion michigan where we saw quite a bit of reduction in energy costs some other mechanical improvements we ve made in our plants that are helping us with our fermentation yield and some other bottom line yield and recovery opportunities in the plants so that s just about operating better when margins are under pressure like they ve been we tend to try to operate in a more cheaper fashion so we wouldn t put we wouldn t try to maximize yields we try to maybe cut costs back on enzyme and yeast and other things we would use to maximize cost efficiency over production so we never closed during the period other than our normal shutdowns so we re just trying to maximize our cost position and most of that comes from mechanical and technical work in the plants ken zaslow bmo capital markets analyst can you talk about if you x out the hedges what is your outperformance relative to industry margins how do you kind of think about that do you guys outperform by 0 05 0 10 like how do you think about that it sounds like there is a separation here pat bowe president and chief executive officer yes we i really couldn t comment on that i think what we ve just tried to focus on our improvement week over week month over month year over year especially on cost if you remember a year ago we had a trouble with some of our by product quality with the tox and issues we had over in michigan those are behind us so feed quality was really good we did have the opportunity as you mentioned to hedge some early into the period which is tougher to do now given the forward nature of the curve here but i think the key thing for us is again to focus on our grain originations and how we can maximize every bushel we re buying and we have spent a lot of time on our coproduct yield and quality issues to make sure we have the best possible returns on coproducts the ethanol market will be what the ethanol market is going to be we can t control the price of gasoline but we ve done a nice job from a plant side ken zaslow bmo capital markets analyst yes and then my last set of question is just on the grain group can you talk about the opportunities and how you are framing next year overall i just wanted to put the pieces together i think you said the narrowing of the wheat spread the elevation margin i guess is also contracting what s going in your favor and how do you kind of figure this out in terms of a margin structure pat bowe president and chief executive officer good question so i think a big difference this year now from what we had before was this collapsing of wheat spreads which impacts our income on storage of wheat which is different than the last couple of years where we had wide carrying charges in wheat and even vsr ticks that we were able to earn that is changed but the good news is that we have wider carrying charges on corn and soybeans we re able to make i think that there is some interesting export opportunities that are potential to pop up in the second half of the year that can help drive trading opportunities and the other thing with lansing now we re much more diversified with a broader range of customer mix and feed ingredients pet food products and specialty grains so we worked on that whole wide range of portfolio to drive the total bottom line so we re cautiously optimistic about how the next half is going to be the trade war was a big thing that s going to impact everyone so we ll see how that plays out and watch how the farmers gets into planting season this spring ken zaslow bmo capital markets analyst but you would say that even excluding lansing the underlying fundamentals have improved is that fair in 2019 versus 2018 is that the expectation pat bowe president and chief executive officer no i think what you were talking about earlier the traditional margins i think the wheat carries a big impact that would be a negative that would be probably considered not constructive look outlook into 2019 corn and soybeans have improved but maybe don t make up for all of that i m just talking of a normal carry situation of storage and our trading opportunities working together with lansing now we re much more optimistic about the skilled traders we brought into the company from lansing and i think that s going to help us drive better trading opportunities in the balance of 19 ken zaslow bmo capital markets analyst great thank you very much pat bowe president and chief executive officer thank you ken operator and we have a follow up question from the line of eric larson of buckingham research your line is now open eric larson buckingham research analyst yes yes thanks guys just a quick follow up question on your fourth quarter grain results you entered q4 i think with i forget the exact number i think it was either 10 million or 12 million of mark to market losses were mtms a significant part of q4 income grain income pat bowe president and chief executive officer somewhat yes especially on corn and soybean basis so not crazy though i mean we just have nice appreciation is what we expected to see and that s a good sign as i mentioned again the not the outright price of wheat as you mentioned earlier our monthly average closes has been a pretty narrow range on flat price but we continue to do steady business on wheat corn and beans just the spread conditions on wheat changed quite a bit so it wasn t a big mark to market impact for the quarter eric larson buckingham research analyst ok yes we could use a little bit of grain market volatility here so ok thanks guys pat bowe president and chief executive officer thank you operator and we have a follow up question from the line of ken zaslow of bmo capital markets your line is now open ken zaslow bmo capital markets analyst hey guys the railcar utilization rate the 94 versus 92 last quarter and up 8 percentage 800 basis points but yet that contradicts the idea that your leasing rates will keep on coming down can you talk about why that s a balancing act between those two it seems it s kind of contradictory i would assume that your leasing rates would actually start to improve pat bowe president and chief executive officer yes i think what over the longer term you re correct so we scrapped a bunch of older cars which helped us a lot with our utilization rates we have some of the leases that are coming off those peak rates so we kept to work through that to get a steady improvement but we are seeing lease rates improve as you just mentioned so we just have some of those cars that are on lease at those higher levels that we need to get through the system i don t know brian you want to brian valentine senior vice president and chief financial officer yes i think as pat said if you think about stuff that maybe was under a five year lease that s coming off from stuff that was done in call it 2014 2013 14 time frame coming off they re lower rates but our utilization is up and our total number of cars on lease is also up pat bowe president and chief executive officer so ken overall the rail ken zaslow bmo capital markets analyst yes go ahead i m sorry pat bowe president and chief executive officer no go ahead ken zaslow bmo capital markets analyst no no you go you re the ceo you go first pat bowe president and chief executive officer i was just going to add that overall we feel pretty good about steady improvement on our rail business also our shop network we added four additional shops this past year there s quite a bit of repair business going on for our shops so we re getting nice steady improvement rail is not a business that shoots way up or shoots way down but we have a nice steady recovery happening across our rail business ken zaslow bmo capital markets analyst when will the five year peak contract be completely lapping that you will be then lapping then you ll start to actually form a base to which to grow is it a 2020 event a 2021 event how do i think about that brian valentine senior vice president and chief financial officer i would say we re seeing the rates increase steadily and so we don t i don t have that right in front of me but we can follow up and get that to you when we have a call ken zaslow bmo capital markets analyst ok but you understand what i m trying to say it s like brian valentine senior vice president and chief financial officer yes i absolutely understand yes i absolutely understand we should be able to get that yes since we will be able to get that for you ken zaslow bmo capital markets analyst perfect thank you guys operator thank you and i m not showing any further questions at this time i would now like to turn the call back to mr john kraus for any closing remarks john kraus director of investor relations thanks mark we want to thank you all for joining us this morning i also want to mention again that this presentation and slides with

u s political discussion has been dominated by the issue of donald trump s wall an issue on which trump s irrationality keeps surprising even his critics so i don t imagine that many people have heard about trump s nomination of david malpass currently an under secretary at the treasury department to lead the world bank but it s a story worth following for one thing while the u s traditionally gets to choose the world bank s president europe gets the international monetary fund there will be a lot of opposition to malpass who has a history of being hostile to international institutions furthermore the malpass nomination highlights the remarkable character of trump s economic appointments remarkable in what way well remarkably bad every economist yours truly very much included gets it wrong sometimes but trump only seems to choose men who have been wrong about everything beyond that however what s remarkable is the extent to which this president consistently chooses economists whose ideology is at odds with his own professed views on policy

with that i will turn the call over to juan ramon juan ramon alaix chief executive officer thank you steve good morning everyone our 2018 results once again confirm the strength of our business and our leadership in the animal health industry we delivered another year of strong performance and executed on investment plans to continue to strengthen our portfolio across the continuum of care our successful innovations the high quality of our manufacturing our best in class field force and the diversity of our portfolio has been driving our steady revenue growth over the years since we became a public company in 2013 we have consistently grown revenue faster than the market and this revenue performance has been achieved while significantly improving our profitability with our adjusted ebit margin increasing from 24 in 2013 to 35 in 2018 in 2018 we delivered our sixth consecutive year of operational revenue growth 10 overall with organic operational growth of 8 which excludes the revenue related to our abaxis acquisition in terms of organic revenue drivers we achieved our strongest growth in our dermatology portfolio vaccines and parasiticides meanwhile our anti infective and medicated feed additives show modest growth and this was because of regulatory changes around the use of antibiotics in animal products for the second year in a row our broad base of about 300 product lines generated operational revenue growth across all our core species and major markets we expect our 2018 organic growth to once again outperform the market and deliver our value proposition of growing in line with or faster than the animal health market we also increased profitability faster than revenue growth for the full year growing adjusted net income by 31 on operational basis consistent with our value proposition this improvement was driven by higher revenue improved cost structure and tax reform in 2018 we achieved other important milestones that will support our future growth and success apoquel our largest product by revenue achieved 464 million in sales in 2018 an increase of 28 ph from 2017 we added two new blockbusters to our portfolio in 2018 bringing our total number of products with more than 100 million in annual sales to 12 our oral parasiticide simparica and our monoclonal antibody or dermatology cytopoint each exceeded 100 million in sales for the first time with 158 million and 129 million in annual sales respectively we also introduced critical new lifecycle innovations that keep our portfolio updated and competitive and support the durability of our major global franchises for example fostera gold pcv mh our latest swine vaccine was introduced in the us and canada to provide greater options and flexibility in protecting pigs from diseases we also built on the sarolaner compound in simparica to develop revolution plus a topical parasiticide for cats that was recently approved in the us japan and canada combines two ingredients sarolaner and selamectin and is already marketed in the european union as stronghold plus all these new products and lifecycle innovations demonstrate the actual return on our investments in r d we also took important steps to expand our manufacturing capacity in the us we enlarged our production facility for poultry vaccines in charles city iowa and our expansion in kalamazoo michigan is progressing ahead of schedule with the first commercial batches of oral solid dose medicines expected to be delivered to customers by the middle of 2019 outside the us we expect to complete the construction of our vaccine manufacturing facility in suzhou china by the end of 2019 and we acquired a facility in tallaght ireland to help increase the supply of our market leading bovine teat sealants that help protect cows from mastitis infections during the year we made our largest acquisition to date purchasing abaxis for 2 billion in the fast growing point of care diagnostics space we see diagnostics as an important area to growing our portfolio and with a tremendous growth opportunity ahead especially in international markets we also acquired smartbow where it s sensor technology and monitoring systems which will be essential to our expansion in precision livestock farming and other digital and data analytic solutions that are emerging in animal health and we returned excess capital to our shareholders in december we announced a 2 billion multi year share repurchase program and the increase of our quarterly dividend by 30 looking ahead in 2019 we will continue investing to generate short and long term growth we ll support our key dermatology and parasiticide products with direct to consumer advertising and promotional campaigns through advanced penetration and launches in new markets in the us we ll be launching two new products in our companion animal business revolution plus the topical parasiticide for cats that i mentioned before has launched this quarter and pending fda approval this year we would expect to launch a new injectable formulation to protect dogs against heartworms for up to 12 months in terms of r d our pipeline remains very strong and we expect to see more progress in 2019 potential filings for new products and continued market expansions of major products like cytopoint simparica and apoquel which is expected to launch in china this year in 2019 we ll continue our work on new monoclonal antibodies to manage pain in dogs and cats as well as for dermatology in cats we are making good progress with our research products and we feel very positive about the potential these type of treatments offer for greater compliance convenience and efficacy for different species this remain an area to watch as we invest further internally and we build on our partnership with regeneron in this space as i have mentioned in previous communications the application for our new 3 way combination parasiticides composed of simparica and two other active ingredients has been filed in the us and with european medicines agency and if approved we still anticipate coming to market in 2020 additionally we ll be investing more in research for diagnostics devices digital and data analytics technologies that can be integrated with our core portfolio of medicines and vaccines diagnostics for livestock has a promising long term opportunity and areas such as sensor technology monitoring systems and other digital application for animal health will be receiving more investment in terms of our deeper commitment to diagnostics we look forward to a full year of selling a more robust portfolio of point of care diagnostic instruments consumables and test kits we are seeing a great progress with integration of the legacy abaxis that we bought ph in the us and outside the us we are building the infrastructure sales and technical teams needed to support our diagnostic portfolio moving to market creation for 2019 we expect the overall industry to grow approximately 5 excluding the impact of foreign currency the swine market companion animal market and poultry are all expected to be somewhat in line with the market growth the cattle market growth is expected to be more limited based on the challenging market conditions for beef and dairy customers for zoetis we expect to grow faster in the market for companion animal and swine based on our new products and to grow in line with the poultry and cattle market we announced our full year 2019 guidance today and we are expecting organic operational revenue growth of 4 5 to 6 5 excluding a 3 percentage point contribution from abaxis operational growth for adjusted net income is expected to be in the range of 8 to 11 in 2019 we are committed to invest in net profits to generate short and long term growth while returning excess capital to shareholders in conclusion our strong performance in 2018 is based on our diverse portfolio our leadership innovation and customer experience across the entire cycle of care in 2018 we have invested to support the growth of our core business as well as evolve in spaces like diagnostics devices digital and data analytics we expect to build on this strategic approach to our growth in 2019 while delivering on the full year guidance with that let me hand things over to glenn who will provide more details on our 2018 fourth quarter results and full year 2019 guidance glenn david executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you juan ramon and good morning everyone as juan ramon noted we had another exceptional year in 2018 with strong performance in both revenue and adjusted net income revenue exceeded our guidance and adjusted net income was in line with the high end of our range we expect our 2018 organic growth to again outperform the market once industry figures are finalized delivering on our value proposition of organically growing revenue in line with or faster than the market and growing adjusted net income faster than revenue revenue for the full year 2018 was 5 8 billion with both reported and operational revenue growth for the year at 10 excluding the impact of the abaxis acquisition operational growth for 2018 was 8 of this 8 3 comes from price and 5 from volume included in the volume growth are contributions from our key dermatology portfolio of 2 new products including simparica of 2 and in line products of 1 adjusted net income for the full year was 1 5 billion representing reported growth of 29 and operational growth of 31 driven by revenue growth gross margin improvement and a lower effective tax rate in 2018 we grew our business operationally across all core species therapeutic areas and major markets our key dermatology portfolio and simparica continued to grow and gained additional market share both in the us and international for the full year we recognized combined revenue of 593 million for apoquel and cytopoint this portfolio continued to grow rapidly in 2018 and is well positioned for future growth heading into 2019 for livestock our diverse portfolio of products drove growth across both developed and emerging markets capitalizing on industry trends of higher protein consumption and improved productivity turning to the fourth quarter reported revenue growth was 7 which includes a negative 4 impact from foreign exchange currency depreciation in brazil continued to be the largest driver of the unfavorable foreign exchange impact in the quarter operational revenue growth in the quarter was 11 excluding the impact of abaxis acquisition operational revenue growth was 7 of this 7 3 comes from price and 4 from volume included in the volume growth are contributions from our key dermatology portfolio of 2 and new products including simparica of 2 q4 represents the first full quarter of abaxis related revenue being included in zoetis results we recognized 65 million from legacy abaxis products contributing 4 growth to overall zoetis in q4 these results included destocking of wholesaler inventories in us as we normalized wholesaler inventory levels to be consistent with the rest of our business new products including simparica stronghold plus and pcv combo vaccine were also growth drivers in the quarter simparica generated 32 million in global sales this quarter representing operational growth of 90 over last year equine s core eq innovator the first and only vaccine to contain all five core equine disease antigen also launched in 2018 and it helped to drive operational revenue growth of 12 in equine for the quarter our key dermatology portfolio comprised of apoquel and cytopoint also continued strong performance this quarter with sales of 156 million a 25 increase over the prior year adjusted net income for the quarter grew 21 operationally driven by revenue growth discrete other income items and a lower effective tax rate now let s discuss zoetis segment revenues for q4 beginning with the us revenue grew 14 in the fourth quarter including 6 growth due to legacy abaxis products including the impact of the abaxis acquisition companion animal grew 26 while livestock grew 3 companion animal sales in the quarter were driven by sales of legacy abaxis products our key dermatology portfolio and new products including simparica certain in line products decline due to competitive pressure partially offset these increases excluding the impact from the abaxis acquisition companion animal growth was 14 key dermatology sales were 110 million for the quarter with both apoquel and cytopoint exhibiting significant growth over the prior year simparica also had another positive quarter with us sales in the quarter nearly doubling over the last year revenue growth continued due to increased clinic penetration and market share resulting from our field force selling efforts partially offsetting growth in our companion animal business were declines in rimadyl and clavamox due to anticipated competition the us livestock business delivered growth across all species in the fourth quarter as a reminder this growth comes off a strong fourth quarter in 2017 in the cattle business we continued to see challenges in both the beef and dairy segments however growth was primarily due to higher sales of premium products as well as competitive supply constraints in the quarter in poultry the zoetis portfolio of alternatives to antibiotics in medicated feed additives continued to be a solid contributor to growth as we saw additional market expansion of no antibiotics ever production overall the us demonstrated another strong quarter with growth across all species turning now to our international segment revenue grew 5 operationally in the fourth quarter including 1 growth due to abaxis legacy products including the impact of the abaxis acquisition companion animal operational growth was 14 and operational growth in livestock was 2 as a reminder international markets faced a headwind of four fewer calendar days this quarter resulting from the change in our accounting calendar implemented this year full year operational revenue growth of 9 was not impacted by calendar days and provides a more accurate indicator of international performance companion animal product growth was driven by the addition of legacy abaxis products new products such as simparica and stronghold plus our key dermatology products and increased medicalization rates in key international markets livestock growth was driven by poultry swine and fish while cattle was relatively flat in the quarter the complete quarter and annual results of our top 11 international markets are provided in the table included in our earnings release but i would like to highlight a few items for the quarter in brazil sales grew 8 operationally with companion animal growing 22 and livestock growing 4 companion animal revenue in brazil benefited from growth in vaccines due to improved supply and key products primarily simparica and apoquel livestock benefited from damp weather condition which increased the use of cattle parasiticides as well as expanded usage plan on vaccines which helped drive premium pricing moving onto china we had another great quarter growing revenue 16 operationally largely due to continued growth of companion animal products primarily vaccines and parasiticides canada grew 10 operationally with balanced growth between companion animal and livestock companion animal growth was driven by the inclusion of abaxis legacy products as well as growth in apoquel livestock benefited from sales of new products and swine and strong performance of key brands and cattle other emerging markets also performed well in the quarter summarizing international performance the addition of abaxis legacy product continued growth of new products and diversity across our portfolio all contributed to another solid quarter for our international segment despite the impact of fewer calendar days now moving onto the rest of the p l adjusted gross margin of 66 4 decreased approximately 250 basis points in the quarter on a reported basis versus the prior year the decline this quarter is primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange a full quarter of abaxis related revenue included in our results and increased inventory charges the declines are partially offset by strong revenue growth and continued cost improvements and efficiencies in our manufacturing network the q4 margin is not indicative of the gross margin we anticipate going forward total adjusted operating expenses including the impact of the abaxis acquisition grew 15 operationally the increase is primarily related to the acquisition of abaxis and additional spend in r d including investments in monoclonal antibody for chronic pain and other pipeline programs the adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 17 3 this tax rate is significantly lower than the rate from the comparable 2017 period due to the favorable impact of us tax reform and discrete items recognized during the quarter adjusted net income for the quarter grew 21 operationally through a combination of strong revenue growth favorability in other income and a lower effective tax rate adjusted diluted eps grew 25 operationally in the quarter versus the same period of 2017 our income growth and balance sheet discipline have enabled us to continue increasing operating cash flow inventory improvements are one area i m particularly pleased with having decreased months on hand since 2016 by more than two months the current level of less than nine months on hand is consistent with industry standards and we expect we will continue around this level going forward the significant improvement in inventory has released approximately 300 million of cash from our balance sheet since 2016 now moving to guidance for 2019 we are committed to our value proposition of growing revenue in line with or faster than the market and growing adjusted net income faster than revenue before i get into the specific numbers please note that you can find our guidance table included in the press release as well as the investor slides also note that all foreign exchange impact is based upon exchange rates as of late january in 2019 we are projecting revenue between 6 175 billion and 6 3 billion reflecting operational revenue growth of 7 5 to 9 5 over 2018 foreign exchange is expected to reduce revenue growth by approximately 1 5 our organic operational revenue growth which excludes the impact of the abaxis acquisition is projected to be between 4 5 to 6 5 in addition to abaxis legacy products our key dermatology portfolio and new products will be strong contributors to growth in 2019 from a species perspective we expect companion animal to grow to faster rate than livestock driven by the abaxis acquisition continued growth in our key dermatology and parasiticide portfolios increased medicalization rates in emerging markets and market dynamics including growth in per pet ph spending from a geographic perspective us and international markets will contribute balanced growth adjusted cost of sales as a percent of revenue is expected to be in the range of 31 to 32 the expected improvement over 2018 is driven by price increases and manufacturing cost reductions partially offset by the impact of the abaxis acquisition and currency movements we expect adjusted sg a for the year to be between 1 47 billion and 1 52 billion we anticipate foreign exchange to reduce growth by approximately 1 on a reported basis operational growth in sg a reflects a full year impact of the abaxis acquisition as well as investments in our diagnostics international field force and technical service teams we ll also continue to fund strategic investments that has demonstrated a strong return including direct to consumer advertising for apoquel and simparica moving on to r d we expect 2019 expenses to be between 445 million and 465 million consistent with 2018 we have committed to an increase over 2018 in r d spending to ensure we re well positioned to capture future short medium and long term growth opportunities in critical spaces these spaces includes a new combination of parasiticides monoclonal antibody therapies for pain in cats and dogs and new vaccines for poultry we ll also continue to invest in the next wave of diagnostic innovations building on our existing zoetis and newly acquired diagnostic platforms to ensure we re delivering best in class point of care diagnostic solution the increase in adjusted net interest expense and other income deductions is related to our 2018 debt offering primarily used to fund the abaxis acquisition our adjusted effective tax rate for 2019 is expected to be within the range of 20 to 21 the increase over 2018 is related to the impact of favorable discrete non recurring items in 2018 and the impact of the gilti tax which is effective for us in 2019 we project adjusted net income in the range of 1 65 billion to 1 7 billion representing 8 to 11 operational growth while we do not provide specific guidance on cash flow we anticipate that in 2019 operating cash flow will decline compared to 2018 as mentioned previously we have significantly decreased our inventory months on hand to be in line with industry norms which has provided a significant cash flow benefit in the last two years in 2019 we expect to continue in our current levels of months on hand and as a result we will not have the benefit of a working capital release in our cash flow in 2019 we also expect an incremental increase of approximately 100 million in capital expenditures for information technology and manufacturing to support our recent acquisition improved cost efficiencies and increased capacity in terms of our capital allocation priorities we continue to focus first on internal commercial manufacturing and r d investments then business development opportunities and finally returning excess capital to shareholders we recently announced an increase to our dividend for q1 2019 of 30 in line with our 2018 earnings growth and we also announced a new 2 billion multi year share repurchase program resulting our consistent performance financial discipline and the strength of our business model finally we expect adjusted diluted eps will be in the range of 3 42 to 3 52 our range for reported diluted eps of 2 83 to 2 99 includes purchase accounting abaxis acquisition related costs and certain significant items i d also like to remind you that while we take a long term view of our business and prefer to focus on annual rather quarterly results there are some considerations i want to point out for 2019 within the quarter the full year impact of the abaxis acquisition will have a disproportionate impact on growth across the p l in the first half of 2019 and partially in q3 in addition foreign exchange will negatively impact growth in the first half of the year by approximately 400 basis points in q1 and 300 basis points in q2 in revenue now to summarize before we move to q a 2018 was another strong year delivering topline operational growth of 10 and bottom line growth of 31 demonstrating once again that zoetis is committed to delivering on its value proposition we also remain committed to creating shareholder value returning more than 900 million to shareholders in 2018 through dividends and share repurchases we expect to continue delivering on our value proposition in 2019 driven by solid growth in our core business and increased contribution from the legacy abaxis portfolio of diagnostics products finally in 2019 we will continue to invest internally and externally to grow profitably in the short medium and long term now i ll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions operator questions and answers operator operator instruction today s first question from michael ryskin with bank of america merrill lynch please go ahead your line s open michael ryskin bank of america merrill lynch analyst thanks guys appreciate taking the call congrats on the quarter a couple of quick questions first one you talked about 5 market growth for the overall industry in 2019 i just wanted to go into that a little bit deeper because in the past we ve seen something more in the 5 to 6 range so i m wondering what you re seeing there if you could give a little more color on the dairy markets cattle markets in the us some of the swine issues we re hearing about internationally and what i m getting at with this is what should be our expectation for the in line portfolio in 2019 you know if you exclude abaxis if you exclude the dermatology portfolio simparica what s the base portfolio doing in terms of volume and price and then i ve got a quick follow up questions on the margin expansion for 2019 juan ramon alaix chief executive officer okay thank you mike i will try to cover some of the questions and also i will ask glenn to provide some additional details on how we can see the growth the in line growth in 2019 so i agree that in previous communication i mentioned that we expect in the market a growth of 5 to 6 then we have seen that the cattle market especially in the us both beef and dairy has been showing some weakness and we expect that rather than 5 to 6 now we are projecting the total market growth of 5 we still expect that the cattle business worldwide will be showing growth but definitely growth that will be below this 5 the rest of the species as i mentioned in my comments companion animal and also swine and poultry will be growing in line or slightly above the market and the only species that we see some market growth below the market will be cattle then moving into the details of the organic growth we as part of our guidance it s 4 5 to 6 5 and then if glenn can provide a little bit more details of how much will be price growth and also volume growth and new products glenn david executive vice president and chief financial officer sure so in terms of just the overall breakdown it s really consistent with our long term expectations so price we would to expect to generate around 2 price this year we re particularly strong with price at 3 for 2018 going into 2019 probably more in line with our long term proposition of around 2 new products again consistent probably 1 to 2 and then the remainder comes from the in line portfolio we do consider derm part of the in line portfolio as it has been has matured and has been on the market for a number of years at this point also in terms of your question on margin expansion when you look at where we closed 2018 cost of goods sold as a percent of revenue was a little over 32 our guidance for 2019 is 31 to 32 and we made significant progress in cost of goods in 2018 improving our cost of goods as a percent of revenue by over 100 basis points so that leaves about another 100 basis points to deliver our commitment of improving cost of goods sold as a percent of revenue by 200 basis points by 2020 you ll probably see that spread between 2019 and 2020 that attainment juan ramon alaix chief executive officer thank you next question please operator and we ll go next to kevin ellich with craig hallum please go ahead kevin ellich craig hallum capital group analyst good morning thanks for taking the questions so i just wanted to start off on the cost structure i mean it looks like some expenses this quarter came a little bit higher than we expected and then glenn you made comments about where you think where you think things will line up in 2019 with increased investments in r d can you just talk about some of the moving parts and given how good the year was for you in 2018 did you pull forward any expenses or how should we be thinking above that glenn david executive vice president and chief financial officer so kevin in terms of cost of goods i ll start again we had significant improvement this year of 100 basis points improvement in cost of goods for q4 we did see elevated cost of goods and that was really related to the impact of fx also abaxis and higher inventory write offs in the quarter really the q4 should not be viewed as a run rate for 2019 we have good visibility into our cost of goods and we re confident in the guidance of 31 to 32 for 2019 as we look into 2019 from an expense perspective consistent with what we ve said we are making investments in r d and r d is growing more in line or closer to revenue as we do have many projects that we re very excited about in our pipeline that we want to make sure that we fully fund sg a when you look at the operational growth is growing below revenue even with the investments that we re making in abaxis juan ramon alaix chief executive officer thank you next question please operator we ll go next to erin wright with credit suisse please go ahead erin wright credit suisse analyst great thanks can you speak to the underlying performance at abaxis and how the integration is progressing in the longer term cross selling opportunity with diagnostic portfolio and then my second question is on simparica trio do you think there is a possibility that you re first to market there in that category and should we how should we think about your competitive positioning there and do you still feel confident in the 2020 timeline and do you anticipate one or two review cycles from fda thanks juan ramon alaix chief executive officer thank you very much erin i will probably start with the comments on the abaxis integration glenn will also provide some details of abaxis performance and then i will also talk about the simparica trio in terms of abaxis integration things are progressing in line or even in some cases faster than initially planned in the us both teams abaxis legacy team in the field force and also our teams are already working together and as we communicated initially the zoetis team is already identifying the opportunities and also helping the other team also to identify customers to complete the sales they will be also engaging ensuring that we increase the use of consumables and this will be an opportunity for future growth we are working definitely that in the future we will be not only the teams that are working together but also the portfolio will be fully integrated and this also it s depending in some of the work that we are doing in terms of the sap implementation for abaxis operations that we plan to do it in 2019 in international markets we re also progressing pretty well we have almost completed the hiring process of field force and also technical support but still some positions that will be completed in the next coming months but this team is already working together with the field force team of zoetis generating the demand in most of the markets the supply to customers will be still done through third party distributors and in 2020 we ll be deciding if we keep distribution or we go direct in some of the markets but definitely all the integration opportunities or integration plans are progressing pretty well we are also working on continue identifying opportunities in terms of r d and the scenario that also we are integrating the teams of sitting in kalamazoo also in denmark ph and union city altogether are defining the future portfolio of zoetis in both companion animal and livestock glenn do you want to give details of abaxis performance glenn david executive vice president and chief financial officer in terms of performance for the quarter for abaxis as we mentioned we had 65 million in sales for the quarter i want to remind you that abaxis was on a different accounting calendar but however if you do normalize the accounting calendar that would translate to approximately 8 growth again within the quarter we did have some destocking to bring abaxis more in line with our overall levels of inventory with wholesalers if you adjust for that destocking the growth for the quarter is double digit also for the year again if you try to look at it on an apples to apples basis the growth is double digits for the year with and without the destocking juan ramon alaix chief executive officer thank you glenn and then moving to triple combo so let me maybe provide a little bit of a context so when we launched simparica as a single agent we were two or three years behind competitors nexgard and bravecto now with the triple combo it will be first second to market but what we did is significantly reduced this gap of two or three years and then we expect that if fda approval is coming in line with our filings and expectation is to introduce this product in 2020 so given we are second to market we will be only second with few more ph different with competitor we see a significant improvement compared to the situation that we had with simparica and with simparica we have been able to continue growing patient share in 2018 we increased patient share from 13 1 at the beginning of the year to 15 6 at the end of the year so we are confident that with the efficacy and also the safety profile of simparica and the future efficacy and safety profile of triple combo we ll have the opportunity to have significant market share next question please operator and we ll go next to louise chen with cantor fitzgerald please go ahead louise chen cantor fitzgerald analyst hi thanks for taking my question so my question here is can you talk more about your pipeline as it pertains to the mabs ph livestock diagnostic and aquaculture when will some of these new products hit the market do they have the potential to be blockbusters or an aggregate to be blockbusters and then just a quick follow up on the triple combo is that expected to be a blockbuster product for you as well thank you juan ramon alaix chief executive officer i ll start with the easiest question thank you louise it s definitely triple combo is expected to be a blockbuster definitely simparica is already a blockbuster but we expect also that the triple combo will reach this status in terms of the rest of the pipeline definitely there are products for livestock these products there are a lot of product that maybe in aggregate basis will represent a significant growth opportunity but i will not describe these products as probably in livestock as a blockbuster potential but definitely it will help us first to protect the current portfolio and second to bring innovation in livestock into the market in terms of monoclonal antibodies for chronic pain we expect that this will have the opportunity of being a blockbuster and we are convinced that the monoclonal antibodies for dogs and cats will represent significant opportunity for treating dogs and cats in a different way that is today with nsaid especially for cats that there is nothing especially developed for these animals in terms of pain but we also are excited about the opportunity of developing monoclonal antibody for dermatology in cats again it s an opportunity that we expect that will be coming in the next year and this will strengthen our derm portfolio also moving another species with monoclonal antibody next question please operator we ll go next to john kreger with william blair please go ahead john kaufman william blair analyst hi good morning this is john kaufman on or john kreger so a couple of questions on cattle here you mentioned premium product sales in the us is that a trend that you foresee continuing in spite of market weakness and then internationally where are we in the cycle and some of the key markets looking out beyond 2019 can international growth more than offset us weakness and what are your expectations for long term growth in this market thank you juan ramon alaix chief executive officer definitely the us market for cattle has been driven by our premium products but some of our products they face competition during the year especially when the situation of the animal was of lower risk profile but we also have seen that in risk situation our premium products are the best products that we need to protect or to treat animals so we are confident that our premium products also will remain generating growth in the future in the us definitely we see the cattle business growing below market and maybe also growing below what we expected some months ago because we also projected dairy recovery in the second half of 2018 then we think that it will take even longer to see a recovery on the dairy business in the case of beef i think it will be always cycles animals moving into the feedlot ph sooner or later but we don t see a significant change on beef we re still projecting that beef will be slightly increased in the number of animals only by 1 but we think that beef will be probably in line with what we expected some months ago we expect that the overall cattle business of zoetis will be growing in 2019 and maybe growing faster in international markets than in the us and as we said many times the diversity of our portfolio in species and geographies is helping us to manage these cycles these are cycles that we have been facing forever and one of the things that not only our industry but also zoetis has been very consistent even in the phase of change cycles regulatory situations very consistently delivering growth inline with the market or even higher in the last six years of zoetis as a public independent company next question please operator we ll go next to jon block with stifel please go ahead jonathan block stifel nicolaus analyst great thanks guys good morning maybe a couple of questions and i ll try to rope into one long one so glenn 150 fx basis point headwind i thought you messaged maybe 200 basis points to 300 basis points recently at jpmorgan so i just want to see if i m correct and what if anything has changed there and then on that same question does the midpoint of the 19 eps of 3 47 imply any sort of a share repo i think just trying to blow through your numbers i get toward the lower end of the eps if i use the 4q share count and then just to pivot over to abaxis when you guys bought abaxis juan ramon they had a bunch of new products in their pipeline and your own sentiment blood gas rapid assay so just any more color you can give us in your control now for four or five months how is the uptake been on some of these new products within that portfolio thanks for your time guys glenn david executive vice president and chief financial officer so jon so i ll address the fx question so you re correct when we re at jpmorgan we did see a bigger impact of foreign exchange based on the rates that were applicable at that time in terms of the guidance that we have today we based the guidance based on fx rates as of the end of january and as i mentioned based on that there is 150 basis point impact to revenue however if you look the last few weeks the dollar has continued to strengthen and based on the rates that we see actually as of yesterday our revenues would be negatively impacted by about another 50 million and eps by a few penny so this is currently not reflected in our guidance and something that we ll continue to monitor the other question you had was in terms of the midpoint and share repo when we set our guidance range we really only assume that will offset dilution from compensation in terms of setting our guidance but nothing additional juan ramon alaix chief executive officer jon then on the abaxis question so the focus that we have been there in the last inaudible has been to ensure that all the portfolio existing portfolio were really meeting the needs and the quality that is expected from our customers and one of the efforts that we have been doing significantly is to make sure that our equipments are connected to the practice management system and that s really helping veterinarians to have a full integration of information from different equipments in the clinic we have also been working on defining the priorities in terms of r d focus and we are progressing well in terms of you were asking also about new products well definitely flex4 is working very well we also are planning to introduce flex4 in the international market within canada and some other markets and we will provide a little bit more details on the future launches as we are making progress in terms of defining all the priorities and all the products that will be coming in the next coming year so next question operator we ll go next to david risinger with morgan stanley please go ahead david risinger morgan stanley analyst thanks very much well first of all congrats on the performance i have two high level questions the first is with respect to abaxis we spoke with a consultant who suggested that it will be difficult for abaxis to displace idexx at many us customers could you speak to that your ability to knock idexx out of us customers and drive placements of abaxis going forward and then with respect to the fda s assessment of heartworm drug efficacy and potential resistance concerns could you just speak to where the fda is in that process and whether the heartworm coverage that you re able to demonstrate to the fda for trio will be at the 100 level or whatever level the fda will require thank you juan ramon alaix chief executive officer thank you dave well starting with the question on heartworm definitely we have presented to the fda all the support of 100 efficacy in terms of protection against heartworm so what is the process of the fda is something that probably we cannot comment but we are confident that we have submitted all the data to support our efficacy and safety profile we will continue working with the fda it s a process it s the process of submitting the different dossiers information and also responding to questions we are confident that the process will be able to introduce the product in 2020 about the question on can we gain share in the us well the answer is yes and we are convinced now that zoetis is competing with any competitor in the market on equal or even stronger conditions in the past abaxis was limited in terms of access to customers and i mentioned that maybe they were meeting or visiting customers once per quarter compared to the other competitors having even more frequency than once a month now we have the opportunity to really be in front of our customers even more than once a month for few customers and also very important we have the opportunity also to combine all the diagnostics portfolio with our strong portfolio of vaccines parasiticides derm and so on and so forth and also create a value proposition to the customers that it was not available at the time of abaxis so i understand that it maybe people that need to be convinced but i hope and we are working hard to make them wrong in terms of the assessment that we cannot compete against idexx next question please operator we ll go next to chris schott with jpmorgan please go ahead chris schott jpmorgan analyst great thanks very much for the questions i guess first one was on apoquel i m just trying to get a sense of where we are in the growth cycle here so specifically how much more growth potential do you see for the product in the us market and when we think about the ex us opportunity can you just give us little bit more color about how uptick has trended relative to the us in the markets you ve launched and what are the biggest ex us opportunities that you re watching my second question was on margin expansion over time so beyond 2019 i know you ve highlighted 19 to be of an investment year with abaxis coming on board and the r d investments but when we look beyond 19 can we think about opex growth returning back down to low single digit levels or should we think about zoetis in a period of kind of multi year period of opex investment as you have become as growth drivers inaudible just beyond 19 as we think about the longer term model thanks very much juan ramon alaix chief executive officer thank you chris well on apoquel i m going to comment for the us and also comment for international in the us we started the year with a patient share of 59 and we ended 63 we still think that there are opportunities for growing patient share second we still see opportunities for expanding the market and we ll continue expanding the market or hoping to expand the market with dtc campaigns that will be the third year that we are investing to create this market demand and third we still see opportunities for pricing so these three elements are probably supporting the growth in the us for apoquel definitely lower growth than what we have seen in previous year so the growth has been in the market now for four years it would be five years in 2019 so we should expect that there will be some reduction on the growth in the us in international market well the situation is slightly different and i m not talking about only apoquel i m talking the full derm portfolio including cytopoint cytopoint has been introduced in the market recently in some of the international markets we expect growth in the introduction of cytopoint we still expect growth for apoquel definitely in terms of patient share it s below the patient share that we have achieved in the us and we expect that over time reaching similar level of patient share although the number of medicalized drugs outside of the us is lower than in the us and finally we expect in 2019 to introduce the product in china and again china has been a market that has been surprisingly positive in terms of growth in companion animal now if i remember well and glenn you can correct me if i m not now china in terms of companion animal is the second largest after the us and maybe some other market but second or third it s in companion animal growing very fast and we expect also that apoquel will be successfully introduced in this market talking about margin expansion you wanted to cover this question glenn david executive vice president and chief financial officer of course chris there are number of opportunities for us in terms of margin expansion beyond 2019 just starting with cost of goods and beyond 2020 and delivering on the proposition of delivering a 200 basis point improvement in 2017 as we look past that we should be able to continue to get improvements in our cost of goods as a percent of revenue really the cost of goods efficiency coming from a lot of the capital investments that we re making today which we expect to pay off in longer term in terms of improved cost of goods and we ll continue to also get margin expansion from price looking at the opex line from a g a perspective we do expect general administrative expenses to grow more in line with inflation as we already have the infrastructure established in most of our markets selling will probably be more between the overall inflation rate and the growth in revenue and depending on the level of revenue growth that we have and new product introductions that we ll need to support and then from an r d perspective that will really depend on the opportunities that we have but that will probably grow more in line with revenue than others juan ramon alaix chief executive officer thank you glenn and then maybe adding that to the question on apoquel or derm i did mention that one day we should be also facing competition it s an area that zoetis has created it s not the first time that we are creating the market we did it for pain and now with derm but we are convinced that we have developed a significant portfolio in derm portfolio which is showing high level of efficacy excellent safety profile and we ll be also adding in the future monoclonal antibodies for dermatology issues for cat so we are confident that we have the opportunity of continue growing always we need to consider future competition in this respect next question please operator and we ll take today s final question from kathy miner with cowen please go ahead your line is open kathleen miner cowen and company analyst great thank you for taking the question one just a brief follow up on the dermatology area and i apologize if i missed it but did you give an update for your expectations for 2019 for dermatology particularly as you ve met or exceeded the 500 million plus for 2018 and the second question just on m a does your 2019 guidance assume any small bolt on acquisitions and given that abaxis is now on board what would be the key areas we should watch for there might be some interest in adding thank you juan ramon alaix chief executive officer thank you kathy and well in terms of the sales big sales for our derm portfolio so in 2018 we almost reached 600 million it was 593 million we are projecting growth in 2019 but definitely we are not now updating in terms of big sales we know that in the future we ll have competition in this space so it s a little bit complicated now what is the full potential we are convinced that we still have opportunities to continue growing and as i mentioned before we also expect to add new products to our portfolio monoclonal antibodies for cats and maybe also working to ensure that we also apply lifecycle innovation to apoquel to protect this franchise and this can be in terms of formulations in terms of expansion to other species so it s something that will continue working on lifecycle innovation and then you also ask if we are including any acquisitions for in 2019 guidance and the answer is no so it s just our current portfolio including abaxis

daniel di martino opinion contributor the first time i couldn t buy food at the grocery store i was 15 years old it was 2014 in caracas venezuela and i had spent more than an hour in line waiting when i got to the register i noticed i had forgotten my id that day without the id the government rationing system would not let the supermarket sell my family the full quota of food we needed it was four days until the government allowed me to buy more this was fairly normal for me all my life i lived under socialism in venezuela until i left and came to the united states as a student in 2016 because the regime in charge imposed price controls and nationalized the most important private industries production plummeted no wonder i had to wait hours in lines to buy simple products such as toothpaste or flour and the shortages went far beyond the supermarket my family and i suffered from blackouts and lack of water the regime nationalized electricity in 2007 in an effort to make electricity free unsurprisingly this resulted in underinvestment in the electrical grid by 2016 my home lost power roughly once a week read more commentary sen dick durbin with maduro out democracy is finally coming to venezuela from within maduro is consolidating power in venezuela the international community must intervene venezuela s mafia state under nicolas maduro is almost over we can finally push him and his thugs out our water situation was even worse initially my family didn t have running water for only about one day per month but as the years passed we sometimes went several weeks straight without it for all these problems the regime has blamed an iguana right wing sabotage and even the weather a rich country wasted resources the excuses for these shortages were hollow in reality venezuela has the largest proven oil reserves in the world to use for electricity and three times more fresh water resources per person than the united states the real reason my family went without water and electricity was the socialist economy instituted by dictators hugo chavez and nicolas maduro the welfare programs many minimum wage hikes and nationalizations implemented by their regimes resulted in a colossal government deficit that the central bank covered by simply printing more money leading to rampant inflation now prices double every few weeks and the standard of living continues to plummet i watched what was once one of the richest countries in latin america gradually fall apart under the weight of big government i didn t need to look at statistics to see this but rather at my own family when chavez took office in 1999 my parents were earning several thousand dollars a month between the two of them by 2016 due to inflation they earned less than 2 a day if my parents hadn t fled the country for spain in 2017 they d now be earning less than 1 a day the international definition of extreme poverty even now the inflation rate in venezuela is expected to reach 10 million percent this year venezuela has become a country where a woeful number of children suffer from malnutrition and where working two full time jobs will pay for only 6 pounds of chicken a month american liberals embrace same failed policies though so many of us venezuelans fled to the usa to escape from the destructive consequences of socialism liberal politicians like sen bernie sanders i vt and rep jose serrano d n y have praised the same kind of policies that produced famine mass exodus and soaring inflation in venezuela even worse in recent weeks democratic reps ilhan omar ro khanna and tulsi gabbard have mischaracterized the protests against maduro and condemned president donald trump s widely supported moves to help end maduro s dictatorship additionally many congressional democrats support medicare for all and the green new deal proposals that would nationalize the health insurance industry guarantee everyone who wants it a job and massively raise taxes increasing government intervention in the economy like few countries except cuba and venezuela have seen before proponents think that they can give all americans quality health care housing and everything for free and that somehow politicians can do a better job at running a business than the business owners themselves these proposals would skyrocket the budget deficit and national debt which just reached a record 22 trillion if that is not enough rep alexandria ocasio cortez endorsed paying for the proposal by asking the federal reserve to print money this is exactly what produced venezuela s nightmare even so liberal economist paul krugman recently argued in a column that whenever you see someone invoking venezuela as a reason not to consider progressive policy ideas you know right away that the person in question is uninformed dishonest or both i can assure mr krugman that i m neither uninformed nor dishonest of course it s true that neither medicare for all nor a wealth tax alone would turn the united states into venezuela overnight no single radical proposal would do that however if all or most of these measures are implemented they could have the same catastrophic consequences for the american people that they had for venezuela in his recent state of the union address president trump said america will never be a socialist country i sincerely hope that the president is right and that every american can resist the lure of false promises so this great country can always shine above the dark cloud of socialism and avoid venezuela s fate daniel di martino is a venezuelan

the animal health industry we delivered another year of strong performance and executed on investment plans to continue to strengthen our portfolio across the continuum of care our successful innovations the high quality of our manufacturing our best in class field force and the diversity of our portfolio has been driving our steady revenue growth over the years advertisement advertisement since we became a public company in 2013 we have consistently grown revenue faster than the market and this revenue performance has been achieved while significantly improving our profitability with our adjusted ebit margin increasing from 24 in 2013 to 35 in 2018 in 2018 we delivered our sixth consecutive year of operational revenue growth 10 overall with organic operational growth of 8 which excludes the revenue related to our abaxis acquisition in terms of organic revenue drivers we achieved our strongest growth in our dermatology portfolio vaccines and parasiticides meanwhile our anti infective and medicated feed additives show modest growth and this was because of regulatory changes around the use of antibiotics in animal products for the second year in a row our broad base of about 300 product lines generated operational revenue growth across all our core species and major markets we expect our 2018 organic growth to once again outperform the market and deliver our value proposition of growing in line with or faster than the animal health market we also increased profitability faster than revenue growth for the full year growing adjusted net income by 31 on operational basis consistent with our value proposition this improvement was driven by higher revenue improved cost structure and tax reform in 2018 we achieved other important milestones that will support our future growth and success apoquel our largest product by revenue achieved 464 million in sales in 2018 an increase of 28 ph from 2017 we added two new blockbusters to our portfolio in 2018 bringing our total number of products with more than 100 million in annual sales to 12 advertisement advertisement our oral parasiticide simparica and our monoclonal antibody or dermatology cytopoint each exceeded 100 million in sales for the first time with 158 million and 129 million in annual sales respectively we also introduced critical new lifecycle innovations that keep our portfolio updated and competitive and support the durability of our major global franchises for example fostera gold pcv mh our latest swine vaccine was introduced in the us and canada to provide greater options and flexibility in protecting pigs from diseases we also built on the sarolaner compound in simparica to develop revolution plus a topical parasiticide for cats that was recently approved in the us japan and canada combines two ingredients sarolaner and selamectin and is already marketed in the european union as stronghold plus all these new products and lifecycle innovations demonstrate the actual return on our investments in r d we also took important steps to expand our manufacturing capacity in the us we enlarged our production facility for poultry vaccines in charles city iowa and our expansion in kalamazoo michigan is progressing ahead of schedule with the first commercial batches of oral solid dose medicines expected to be delivered to customers by the middle of 2019 outside the us we expect to complete the construction of our vaccine manufacturing facility in suzhou china by the end of 2019 and we acquired a facility in tallaght ireland to help increase the supply of our market leading bovine teat sealants that help protect cows from mastitis infections advertisement advertisement during the year we made our largest acquisition to date purchasing abaxis for 2 billion in the fast growing point of care diagnostics space we see diagnostics as an important area to growing our portfolio and with a tremendous growth opportunity ahead especially in international markets we also acquired smartbow where it s sensor technology and monitoring systems which will be essential to our expansion in precision livestock farming and other digital and data analytic solutions that are emerging in animal health and we returned excess capital to our shareholders in december we announced a 2 billion multi year share repurchase program and the increase of our quarterly dividend by 30 looking ahead in 2019 we will continue investing to generate short and long term growth we ll support our key dermatology and parasiticide products with direct to consumer advertising and promotional campaigns through advanced penetration and launches in new markets advertisement advertisement in the us we ll be launching two new products in our companion animal business revolution plus the topical parasiticide for cats that i mentioned before has launched this quarter and pending fda approval this year we would expect to launch a new injectable formulation to protect dogs against heartworms for up to 12 months in terms of r d our pipeline remains very strong and we expect to see more progress in 2019 potential filings for new products and continued market expansions of major products like cytopoint simparica and apoquel which is expected to launch in china this year in 2019 we ll continue our work on new monoclonal antibodies to manage pain in dogs and cats as well as for dermatology in cats we are making good progress with our research products and we feel very positive about the potential these type of treatments offer for greater compliance convenience and efficacy for different species this remain an area to watch as we invest further internally and we build on our partnership with regeneron in this space as i have mentioned in previous communications the application for our new 3 way combination parasiticides composed of simparica and two other active ingredients has been filed in the us and with european medicines agency and if approved we still anticipate coming to market in 2020 additionally we ll be investing more in research for diagnostics devices digital and data analytics technologies that can be integrated with our core portfolio of medicines and vaccines diagnostics for livestock has a promising long term opportunity and areas such as sensor technology monitoring systems and other digital application for animal health will be receiving more investment advertisement advertisement in terms of our deeper commitment to diagnostics we look forward to a full year of selling a more robust portfolio of point of care diagnostic instruments consumables and test kits we are seeing a great progress with integration of the legacy abaxis that we bought ph in the us and outside the us we are building the infrastructure sales and technical teams needed to support our diagnostic portfolio moving to market creation for 2019 we expect the overall industry to grow approximately 5 excluding the impact of foreign currency the swine market companion animal market and poultry are all expected to be somewhat in line with the market growth the cattle market growth is expected to be more limited based on the challenging market conditions for beef and dairy customers for zoetis we expect to grow faster in the market for companion animal and swine based on our new products and to grow in line with the poultry and cattle market we announced our full year 2019 guidance today and we are expecting organic operational revenue growth of 4 5 to 6 5 excluding a 3 percentage point contribution from abaxis operational growth for adjusted net income is expected to be in the range of 8 to 11 in 2019 we are committed to invest in net profits to generate short and long term growth while returning excess capital to shareholders advertisement advertisement in conclusion our strong performance in 2018 is based on our diverse portfolio our leadership innovation and customer experience across the entire cycle of care in 2018 we have invested to support the growth of our core business as well as evolve in spaces like diagnostics devices digital and data analytics we expect to build on this strategic approach to our growth in 2019 while delivering on the full year guidance with that let me hand things over to glenn who will provide more details on our 2018 fourth quarter results and full year 2019 guidance glenn david executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you juan ramon and good morning everyone as juan ramon noted we had another exceptional year in 2018 with strong performance in both revenue and adjusted net income revenue exceeded our guidance and adjusted net income was in line with the high end of our range we expect our 2018 organic growth to again outperform the market once industry figures are finalized delivering on our value proposition of organically growing revenue in line with or faster than the market and growing adjusted net income faster than revenue advertisement advertisement revenue for the full year 2018 was 5 8 billion with both reported and operational revenue growth for the year at 10 excluding the impact of the abaxis acquisition operational growth for 2018 was 8 of this 8 3 comes from price and 5 from volume included in the volume growth are contributions from our key dermatology portfolio of 2 new products including simparica of 2 and in line products of 1 adjusted net income for the full year was 1 5 billion representing reported growth of 29 and operational growth of 31 driven by revenue growth gross margin improvement and a lower effective tax rate in 2018 we grew our business operationally across all core species therapeutic areas and major markets our key dermatology portfolio and simparica continued to grow and gained additional market share both in the us and international for the full year we recognized combined revenue of 593 million for apoquel and cytopoint this portfolio continued to grow rapidly in 2018 and is well positioned for future growth heading into 2019 for livestock our diverse portfolio of products drove growth across both developed and emerging markets capitalizing on industry trends of higher protein consumption and improved productivity turning to the fourth quarter reported revenue growth was 7 which includes a negative 4 impact from foreign exchange currency depreciation in brazil continued to be the largest driver of the unfavorable foreign exchange impact in the quarter operational revenue growth in the quarter was 11 excluding the impact of abaxis acquisition operational revenue growth was 7 of this 7 3 comes from price and 4 from volume included in the volume growth are contributions from our key dermatology portfolio of 2 and new products including simparica of 2 q4 represents the first full quarter of abaxis related revenue being included in zoetis results we recognized 65 million from legacy abaxis products contributing 4 growth to overall zoetis in q4 these results included destocking of wholesaler inventories in us as we normalized wholesaler inventory levels to be consistent with the rest of our business new products including simparica stronghold plus and pcv combo vaccine were also growth drivers in the quarter simparica generated 32 million in global sales this quarter representing operational growth of 90 over last year equine s core eq innovator the first and only vaccine to contain all five core equine disease antigen also launched in 2018 and it helped to drive operational revenue growth of 12 in equine for the quarter our key dermatology portfolio comprised of apoquel and cytopoint also continued strong performance this quarter with sales of 156 million a 25 increase over the prior year adjusted net income for the quarter grew 21 operationally driven by revenue growth discrete other income items and a lower effective tax rate now let s discuss zoetis segment revenues for q4 beginning with the us revenue grew 14 in the fourth quarter including 6 growth due to legacy abaxis products including the impact of the abaxis acquisition companion animal grew 26 while livestock grew 3 companion animal sales in the quarter were driven by sales of legacy abaxis products our key dermatology portfolio and new products including simparica certain in line products decline due to competitive pressure partially offset these increases excluding the impact from the abaxis acquisition companion animal growth was 14 key dermatology sales were 110 million for the quarter with both apoquel and cytopoint exhibiting significant growth over the prior year simparica also had another positive quarter with us sales in the quarter nearly doubling over the last year revenue growth continued due to increased clinic penetration and market share resulting from our field force selling efforts partially offsetting growth in our companion animal business were declines in rimadyl and clavamox due to anticipated competition the us livestock business delivered growth across all species in the fourth quarter as a reminder this growth comes off a strong fourth quarter in 2017 in the cattle business we continued to see challenges in both the beef and dairy segments however growth was primarily due to higher sales of premium products as well as competitive supply constraints in the quarter in poultry the zoetis portfolio of alternatives to antibiotics in medicated feed additives continued to be a solid contributor to growth as we saw additional market expansion of no antibiotics ever production overall the us demonstrated another strong quarter with growth across all species turning now to our international segment revenue grew 5 operationally in the fourth quarter including 1 growth due to abaxis legacy products including the impact of the abaxis acquisition companion animal operational growth was 14 and operational growth in livestock was 2 as a reminder international markets faced a headwind of four fewer calendar days this quarter resulting from the change in our accounting calendar implemented this year full year operational revenue growth of 9 was not impacted by calendar days and provides a more accurate indicator of international performance companion animal product growth was driven by the addition of legacy abaxis products new products such as simparica and stronghold plus our key dermatology products and increased medicalization rates in key international markets livestock growth was driven by poultry swine and fish while cattle was relatively flat in the quarter the complete quarter and annual results of our top 11 international markets are provided in the table included in our earnings release but i would like to highlight a few items for the quarter in brazil sales grew 8 operationally with companion animal growing 22 and livestock growing 4 companion animal revenue in brazil benefited from growth in vaccines due to improved supply and key products primarily simparica and apoquel livestock benefited from damp weather condition which increased the use of cattle parasiticides as well as expanded usage plan on vaccines which helped drive premium pricing moving onto china we had another great quarter growing revenue 16 operationally largely due to continued growth of companion animal products primarily vaccines and parasiticides canada grew 10 operationally with balanced growth between companion animal and livestock companion animal growth was driven by the inclusion of abaxis legacy products as well as growth in apoquel livestock benefited from sales of new products and swine and strong performance of key brands and cattle other emerging markets also performed well in the quarter summarizing international performance the addition of abaxis legacy product continued growth of new products and diversity across our portfolio all contributed to another solid quarter for our international segment despite the impact of fewer calendar days now moving onto the rest of the p l adjusted gross margin of 66 4 decreased approximately 250 basis points in the quarter on a reported basis versus the prior year the decline this quarter is primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange a full quarter of abaxis related revenue included in our results and increased inventory charges the declines are partially offset by strong revenue growth and continued cost improvements and efficiencies in our manufacturing network the q4 margin is not indicative of the gross margin we anticipate going forward total adjusted operating expenses including the impact of the abaxis acquisition grew 15 operationally the increase is primarily related to the acquisition of abaxis and additional spend in r d including investments in monoclonal antibody for chronic pain and other pipeline programs the adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 17 3 this tax rate is significantly lower than the rate from the comparable 2017 period due to the favorable impact of us tax reform and discrete items recognized during the quarter adjusted net income for the quarter grew 21 operationally through a combination of strong revenue growth favorability in other income and a lower effective tax rate adjusted diluted eps grew 25 operationally in the quarter versus the same period of 2017 our income growth and balance sheet discipline have enabled us to continue increasing operating cash flow inventory improvements are one area i m particularly pleased with having decreased months on hand since 2016 by more than two months the current level of less than nine months on hand is consistent with industry standards and we expect we will continue around this level going forward the significant improvement in inventory has released approximately 300 million of cash from our balance sheet since 2016 now moving to guidance for 2019 we are committed to our value proposition of growing revenue in line with or faster than the market and growing adjusted net income faster than revenue before i get into the specific numbers please note that you can find our guidance table included in the press release as well as the investor slides also note that all foreign exchange impact is based upon exchange rates as of late january in 2019 we are projecting revenue between 6 175 billion and 6 3 billion reflecting operational revenue growth of 7 5 to 9 5 over 2018 foreign exchange is expected to reduce revenue growth by approximately 1 5 our organic operational revenue growth which excludes the impact of the abaxis acquisition is projected to be between 4 5 to 6 5 in addition to abaxis legacy products our key dermatology portfolio and new products will be strong contributors to growth in 2019 from a species perspective we expect companion animal to grow to faster rate than livestock driven by the abaxis acquisition continued growth in our key dermatology and parasiticide portfolios increased medicalization rates in emerging markets and market dynamics including growth in per pet ph spending from a geographic perspective us and international markets will contribute balanced growth adjusted cost of sales as a percent of revenue is expected to be in the range of 31 to 32 the expected improvement over 2018 is driven by price increases and manufacturing cost reductions partially offset by the impact of the abaxis acquisition and currency movements we expect adjusted sg a for the year to be between 1 47 billion and 1 52 billion we anticipate foreign exchange to reduce growth by approximately 1 on a reported basis operational growth in sg a reflects a full year impact of the abaxis acquisition as well as investments in our diagnostics international field force and technical service teams we ll also continue to fund strategic investments that has demonstrated a strong return including direct to consumer advertising for apoquel and simparica moving on to r d we expect 2019 expenses to be between 445 million and 465 million consistent with 2018 we have committed to an increase over 2018 in r d spending to ensure we re well positioned to capture future short medium and long term growth opportunities in critical spaces these spaces includes a new combination of parasiticides monoclonal antibody therapies for pain in cats and dogs and new vaccines for poultry we ll also continue to invest in the next wave of diagnostic innovations building on our existing zoetis and newly acquired diagnostic platforms to ensure we re delivering best in class point of care diagnostic solution the increase in adjusted net interest expense and other income deductions is related to our 2018 debt offering primarily used to fund the abaxis acquisition our adjusted effective tax rate for 2019 is expected to be within the range of 20 to 21 the increase over 2018 is related to the impact of favorable discrete non recurring items in 2018 and the impact of the gilti tax which is effective for us in 2019 we project adjusted net income in the range of 1 65 billion to 1 7 billion representing 8 to 11 operational growth while we do not provide specific guidance on cash flow we anticipate that in 2019 operating cash flow will decline compared to 2018 as mentioned previously we have significantly decreased our inventory months on hand to be in line with industry norms which has provided a significant cash flow benefit in the last two years in 2019 we expect to continue in our current levels of months on hand and as a result we will not have the benefit of a working capital release in our cash flow in 2019 we also expect an incremental increase of approximately 100 million in capital expenditures for information technology and manufacturing to support our recent acquisition improved cost efficiencies and increased capacity in terms of our capital allocation priorities we continue to focus first on internal commercial manufacturing and r d investments then business development opportunities and finally returning excess capital to shareholders we recently announced an increase to our dividend for q1 2019 of 30 in line with our 2018 earnings growth and we also announced a new 2 billion multi year share repurchase program resulting our consistent performance financial discipline and the strength of our business model finally we expect adjusted diluted eps will be in the range of 3 42 to 3 52 our range for reported diluted eps of 2 83 to 2 99 includes purchase accounting abaxis acquisition related costs and certain significant items i d also like to remind you that while we take a long term view of our business and prefer to focus on annual rather quarterly results there are some considerations i want to point out for 2019 within the quarter the full year impact of the abaxis acquisition will have a disproportionate impact on growth across the p l in the first half of 2019 and partially in q3 in addition foreign exchange will negatively impact growth in the first half of the year by approximately 400 basis points in q1 and 300 basis points in q2 in revenue now to summarize before we move to q a 2018 was another strong year delivering topline operational growth of 10 and bottom line growth of 31 demonstrating once again that zoetis is committed to delivering on its value proposition we also remain committed to creating shareholder value returning more than 900 million to shareholders in 2018 through dividends and share repurchases we expect to continue delivering on our value proposition in 2019 driven by solid growth in our core business and increased contribution from the legacy abaxis portfolio of diagnostics products finally in 2019 we will continue to invest internally and externally to grow profitably in the short medium and long term now i ll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions operator questions and answers operator operator instruction today s first question from michael ryskin with bank of america merrill lynch please go ahead your line s open michael ryskin bank of america merrill lynch analyst thanks guys appreciate taking the call congrats on the quarter a couple of quick questions first one you talked about 5 market growth for the overall industry in 2019 i just wanted to go into that a little bit deeper because in the past we ve seen something more in the 5 to 6 range so i m wondering what you re seeing there if you could give a little more color on the dairy markets cattle markets in the us some of the swine issues we re hearing about internationally and what i m getting at with this is what should be our expectation for the in line portfolio in 2019 you know if you exclude abaxis if you exclude the dermatology portfolio simparica what s the base portfolio doing in terms of volume and price and then i ve got a quick follow up questions on the margin expansion for 2019 juan ramon alaix chief executive officer okay thank you mike i will try to cover some of the questions and also i will ask glenn to provide some additional details on how we can see the growth the in line growth in 2019 so i agree that in previous communication i mentioned that we expect in the market a growth of 5 to 6 then we have seen that the cattle market especially in the us both beef and dairy has been showing some weakness and we expect that rather than 5 to 6 now we are projecting the total market growth of 5 we still expect that the cattle business worldwide will be showing growth but definitely growth that will be below this 5 the rest of the species as i mentioned in my comments companion animal and also swine and poultry will be growing in line or slightly above the market and the only species that we see some market growth below the market will be cattle then moving into the details of the organic growth we as part of our guidance it s 4 5 to 6 5 and then if glenn can provide a little bit more details of how much will be price growth and also volume growth and new products glenn david executive vice president and chief financial officer sure so in terms of just the overall breakdown it s really consistent with our long term expectations so price we would to expect to generate around 2 price this year we re particularly strong with price at 3 for 2018 going into 2019 probably more in line with our long term proposition of around 2 new products again consistent probably 1 to 2 and then the remainder comes from the in line portfolio we do consider derm part of the in line portfolio as it has been has matured and has been on the market for a number of years at this point also in terms of your question on margin expansion when you look at where we closed 2018 cost of goods sold as a percent of revenue was a little over 32 our guidance for 2019 is 31 to 32 and we made significant progress in cost of goods in 2018 improving our cost of goods as a percent of revenue by over 100 basis points so that leaves about another 100 basis points to deliver our commitment of improving cost of goods sold as a percent of revenue by 200 basis points by 2020 you ll probably see that spread between 2019 and 2020 that attainment juan ramon alaix chief executive officer thank you next question please operator and we ll go next to kevin ellich with craig hallum please go ahead kevin ellich craig hallum capital group analyst good morning thanks for taking the questions so i just wanted to start off on the cost structure i mean it looks like some expenses this quarter came a little bit higher than we expected and then glenn you made comments about where you think where you think things will line up in 2019 with increased investments in r d can you just talk about some of the moving parts and given how good the year was for you in 2018 did you pull forward any expenses or how should we be thinking above that glenn david executive vice president and chief financial officer so kevin in terms of cost of goods i ll start again we had significant improvement this year of 100 basis points improvement in cost of goods for q4 we did see elevated cost of goods and that was really related to the impact of fx also abaxis and higher inventory write offs in the quarter really the q4 should not be viewed as a run rate for 2019 we have good visibility into our cost of goods and we re confident in the guidance of 31 to 32 for 2019 as we look into 2019 from an expense perspective consistent with what we ve said we are making investments in r d and r d is growing more in line or closer to revenue as we do have many projects that we re very excited about in our pipeline that we want to make sure that we fully fund sg a when you look at the operational growth is growing below revenue even with the investments that we re making in abaxis juan ramon alaix chief executive officer thank you next question please operator we ll go next to erin wright with credit suisse please go ahead erin wright credit suisse analyst great thanks can you speak to the underlying performance at abaxis and how the integration is progressing in the longer term cross selling opportunity with diagnostic portfolio and then my second question is on simparica trio do you think there is a possibility that you re first to market there in that category and should we how should we think about your competitive positioning there and do you still feel confident in the 2020 timeline and do you anticipate one or two review cycles from fda thanks juan ramon alaix chief executive officer thank you very much erin i will probably start with the comments on the abaxis integration glenn will also provide some details of abaxis performance and then i will also talk about the simparica trio in terms of abaxis integration things are progressing in line or even in some cases faster than initially planned in the us both teams abaxis legacy team in the field force and also our teams are already working together and as we communicated initially the zoetis team is already identifying the opportunities and also helping the other team also to identify customers to complete the sales they will be also engaging ensuring that we increase the use of consumables and this will be an opportunity for future growth we are working definitely that in the future we will be not only the teams that are working together but also the portfolio will be fully integrated and this also it s depending in some of the work that we are doing in terms of the sap implementation for abaxis operations that we plan to do it in 2019 in international markets we re also progressing pretty well we have almost completed the hiring process of field force and also technical support but still some positions that will be completed in the next coming months but this team is already working together with the field force team of zoetis generating the demand in most of the markets the supply to customers will be still done through third party distributors and in 2020 we ll be deciding if we keep distribution or we go direct in some of the markets but definitely all the integration opportunities or integration plans are progressing pretty well we are also working on continue identifying opportunities in terms of r d and the scenario that also we are integrating the teams of sitting in kalamazoo also in denmark ph and union city altogether are defining the future portfolio of zoetis in both companion animal and livestock glenn do you want to give details of abaxis performance glenn david executive vice president and chief financial officer in terms of performance for the quarter for abaxis as we mentioned we had 65 million in sales for the quarter i want to remind you that abaxis was on a different accounting calendar but however if you do normalize the accounting calendar that would translate to approximately 8 growth again within the quarter we did have some destocking to bring abaxis more in line with our overall levels of inventory with wholesalers if you adjust for that destocking the growth for the quarter is double digit also for the year again if you try to look at it on an apples to apples basis the growth is double digits for the year with and without the destocking juan ramon alaix chief executive officer thank you glenn and then moving to triple combo so let me maybe provide a little bit of a context so when we launched simparica as a single agent we were two or three years behind competitors nexgard and bravecto now with the triple combo it will be first second to market but what we did is significantly reduced this gap of two or three years and then we expect that if fda approval is coming in line with our filings and expectation is to introduce this product in 2020 so given we are second to market we will be only second with few more ph different with competitor we see a significant improvement compared to the situation that we had with simparica and with simparica we have been able to continue growing patient share in 2018 we increased patient share from 13 1 at the beginning of the year to 15 6 at the end of the year so we are confident that with the efficacy and also the safety profile of simparica and the future efficacy and safety profile of triple combo we ll have the opportunity to have significant market share next question please operator and we ll go next to louise chen with cantor fitzgerald please go ahead louise chen cantor fitzgerald analyst hi thanks for taking my question so my question here is can you talk more about your pipeline as it pertains to the mabs ph livestock diagnostic and aquaculture when will some of these new products hit the market do they have the potential to be blockbusters or an aggregate to be blockbusters and then just a quick follow up on the triple combo is that expected to be a blockbuster product for you as well thank you juan ramon alaix chief executive officer i ll start with the easiest question thank you louise it s definitely triple combo is expected to be a blockbuster definitely simparica is already a blockbuster but we expect also that the triple combo will reach this status in terms of the rest of the pipeline definitely there are products for livestock these products there are a lot of product that maybe in aggregate basis will represent a significant growth opportunity but i will not describe these products as probably in livestock as a blockbuster potential but definitely it will help us first to protect the current portfolio and second to bring innovation in livestock into the market in terms of monoclonal antibodies for chronic pain we expect that this will have the opportunity of being a blockbuster and we are convinced that the monoclonal antibodies for dogs and cats will represent significant opportunity for treating dogs and cats in a different way that is today with nsaid especially for cats that there is nothing especially developed for these animals in terms of pain but we also are excited about the opportunity of developing monoclonal antibody for dermatology in cats again it s an opportunity that we expect that will be coming in the next year and this will strengthen our derm portfolio also moving another species with monoclonal antibody next question please operator we ll go next to john kreger with william blair please go ahead john kaufman william blair analyst hi good morning this is john kaufman on or john kreger so a couple of questions on cattle here you mentioned premium product sales in the us is that a trend that you foresee continuing in spite of market weakness and then internationally where are we in the cycle and some of the key markets looking out beyond 2019 can international growth more than offset us weakness and what are your expectations for long term growth in this market thank you juan ramon alaix chief executive officer definitely the us market for cattle has been driven by our premium products but some of our products they face competition during the year especially when the situation of the animal was of lower risk profile but we also have seen that in risk situation our premium products are the best products that we need to protect or to treat animals so we are confident that our premium products also will remain generating growth in the future in the us definitely we see the cattle business growing below market and maybe also growing below what we expected some months ago because we also projected dairy recovery in the second half of 2018 then we think that it will take even longer to see a recovery on the dairy business in the case of beef i think it will be always cycles animals moving into the feedlot ph sooner or later but we don t see a significant change on beef we re still projecting that beef will be slightly increased in the number of animals only by 1 but we think that beef will be probably in line with what we expected some months ago we expect that the overall cattle business of zoetis will be growing in 2019 and maybe growing faster in international markets than in the us and as we said many times the diversity of our portfolio in species and geographies is helping us to manage these cycles these are cycles that we have been facing forever and one of the things that not only our industry but also zoetis has been very consistent even in the phase of change cycles regulatory situations very consistently delivering growth inline with the market or even higher in the last six years of zoetis as a public independent company next question please operator we ll go next to jon block with stifel please go ahead jonathan block stifel nicolaus analyst great thanks guys good morning maybe a couple of questions and i ll try to rope into one long one so glenn 150 fx basis point headwind i thought you messaged maybe 200 basis points to 300 basis points recently at jpmorgan so i just want to see if i m correct and what if anything has changed there and then on that same question does the midpoint of the 19 eps of 3 47 imply any sort of a share repo i think just trying to blow through your numbers i get toward the lower end of the eps if i use the 4q share count and then just to pivot over to abaxis when you guys bought abaxis juan ramon they had a bunch of new products in their pipeline and your own sentiment blood gas rapid assay so just any more color you can give us in your control now for four or five months how is the uptake been on some of these new products within that portfolio thanks for your time guys glenn david executive vice president and chief financial officer so jon so i ll address the fx question so you re correct when we re at jpmorgan we did see a bigger impact of foreign exchange based on the rates that were applicable at that time in terms of the guidance that we have today we based the guidance based on fx rates as of the end of january and as i mentioned based on that there is 150 basis point impact to revenue however if you look the last few weeks the dollar has continued to strengthen and based on the rates that we see actually as of yesterday our revenues would be negatively impacted by about another 50 million and eps by a few penny so this is currently not reflected in our guidance and something that we ll continue to monitor the other question you had was in terms of the midpoint and share repo when we set our guidance range we really only assume that will offset dilution from compensation in terms of setting our guidance but nothing additional juan ramon alaix chief executive officer jon then on the abaxis question so the focus that we have been there in the last inaudible has been to ensure that all the portfolio existing portfolio were really meeting the needs and the quality that is expected from our customers and one of the efforts that we have been doing significantly is to make sure that our equipments are connected to the practice management system and that s really helping veterinarians to have a full integration of information from different equipments in the clinic we have also been working on defining the priorities in terms of r d focus and we are progressing well in terms of you were asking also about new products well definitely flex4 is working very well we also are planning to introduce flex4 in the international market within canada and some other markets and we will provide a little bit more details on the future launches as we are making progress in terms of defining all the priorities and all the products that will be coming in the next coming year so next question operator we ll go next to david risinger with morgan stanley please go ahead david risinger morgan stanley analyst thanks very much well first of all congrats on the performance i have two high level questions the first is with respect to abaxis we spoke with a consultant who suggested that it will be difficult for abaxis to displace idexx at many us customers could you speak to that your ability to knock idexx out of us customers and drive placements of abaxis going forward and then with respect to the fda s assessment of heartworm drug efficacy and potential resistance concerns could you just speak to where the fda is in that process and whether the heartworm coverage that you re able to demonstrate to the fda for trio will be at the 100 level or whatever level the fda will require thank you juan ramon alaix chief executive officer thank you dave well starting with the question on heartworm definitely we have presented to the fda all the support of 100 efficacy in terms of protection against heartworm so what is the process of the fda is something that probably we cannot comment but we are confident that we have submitted all the data to support our efficacy and safety profile we will continue working with the fda it s a process it s the process of submitting the different dossiers information and also responding to questions we are confident that the process will be able to introduce the product in 2020 about the question on can we gain share in the us well the answer is yes and we are convinced now that zoetis is competing with any competitor in the market on equal or even stronger conditions in the past abaxis was limited in terms of access to customers and i mentioned that maybe they were meeting or visiting customers once per quarter compared to the other competitors having even more frequency than once a month now we have the opportunity to really be in front of our customers even more than once a month for few customers and also very important we have the opportunity also to combine all the diagnostics portfolio with our strong portfolio of vaccines parasiticides derm and so on and so forth and also create a value proposition to the customers that it was not available at the time of abaxis so i understand that it maybe people that need to be convinced but i hope and we are working hard to make them wrong in terms of the assessment that we cannot compete against idexx next question please operator we ll go next to chris schott with jpmorgan please go ahead chris schott jpmorgan analyst great thanks very much for the questions i guess first one was on apoquel i m just trying to get a sense of where we are in the growth cycle here so specifically how much more growth potential do you see for the product in the us market and when we think about the ex us opportunity can you just give us little bit more color about how uptick has trended relative to the us in the markets you ve launched and what are the biggest ex us opportunities that you re watching my second question was on margin expansion over time so beyond 2019 i know you ve highlighted 19 to be of an investment year with abaxis coming on board and the r d investments but when we look beyond 19 can we think about opex growth returning back down to low single digit levels or should we think about zoetis in a period of kind of multi year period of opex investment as you have become as growth drivers inaudible just beyond 19 as we think about the longer term model thanks very much juan ramon alaix chief executive officer thank you chris well on apoquel i m going to comment for the us and also comment for international in the us we started the year with a patient share of 59 and we ended 63 we still think that there are opportunities for growing patient share second we still see opportunities for expanding the market and we ll continue expanding the market or hoping to expand the market with dtc campaigns that will be the third year that we are investing to create this market demand and third we still see opportunities for pricing so these three elements are probably supporting the growth in the us for apoquel definitely lower growth than what we have seen in previous year so the growth has been in the market now for four years it would be five years in 2019 so we should expect that there will be some reduction on the growth in the us in international market well the situation is slightly different and i m not talking about only apoquel i m talking the full derm portfolio including cytopoint cytopoint has been introduced in the market recently in some of the international markets we expect growth in the introduction of cytopoint we still expect growth for apoquel definitely in terms of patient share it s below the patient share that we have achieved in the us and we expect that over time reaching similar level of patient share although the number of medicalized drugs outside of the us is lower than in the us and finally we expect in 2019 to introduce the product in china and again china has been a market that has been surprisingly positive in terms of growth in companion animal now if i remember well and glenn you can correct me if i m not now china in terms of companion animal is the second largest after the us and maybe some other market but second or third it s in companion animal growing very fast and we expect also that apoquel will be successfully introduced in this market talking about margin expansion you wanted to cover this question glenn david executive vice president and chief financial officer of course chris there are number of opportunities for us in terms of margin expansion beyond 2019 just starting with cost of goods and beyond 2020 and delivering on the proposition of delivering a 200 basis point improvement in 2017 as we look past that we should be able to continue to get improvements in our cost of goods as a percent of revenue really the cost of goods efficiency coming from a lot of the capital investments that we re making today which we expect to pay off in longer term in terms of improved cost of goods and we ll continue to also get margin expansion from price looking at the opex line from a g a perspective we do expect general administrative expenses to grow more in line with inflation as we already have the infrastructure established in most of our markets selling will probably be more between the overall inflation rate and the growth in revenue and depending on the level of revenue growth that we have and new product introductions that we ll need to support and then from an r d perspective that will really depend on the opportunities that we have but that will probably grow more in line with revenue than others juan ramon alaix chief executive officer thank you glenn and then maybe adding that to the question on apoquel or derm i did mention that one day we should be also facing competition it s an area that zoetis has created it s not the first time that we are creating the market we did it for pain and now with derm but we are convinced that we have developed a significant portfolio in derm portfolio which is showing high level of efficacy excellent safety profile and we ll be also adding in the future monoclonal antibodies for dermatology issues for cat so we are confident that we have the opportunity of continue growing always we need to consider future competition in this respect next question please operator and we ll take today s final question from kathy miner with cowen please go ahead your line is open kathleen miner cowen and company analyst great thank you for taking the question one just a brief follow up on the dermatology area and i apologize if i missed it but did you give an update for your expectations for 2019 for dermatology particularly as you ve met or exceeded the 500 million plus for 2018 and the second question just on m a does your 2019 guidance assume any small bolt on acquisitions and given that abaxis is now on board what would be the key areas we should watch for there might be some interest in adding thank you juan ramon alaix chief executive officer thank you kathy and well in terms of the sales big sales for our derm portfolio so in 2018 we almost reached 600 million it was 593 million we are projecting growth in 2019 but definitely we are not now updating in terms of big sales we know that in the future we ll have competition in this space so it s a little bit complicated now what is the full potential we are convinced that we still have opportunities to continue growing and as i mentioned before we also expect to add new products to our portfolio monoclonal antibodies for cats and maybe also working to ensure that we also apply lifecycle innovation to apoquel to protect this franchise and this can be in terms of formulations in terms of expansion to other species so it s something that will continue working on lifecycle innovation and then you also ask if we are including any acquisitions for in 2019 guidance and the answer is no so it s just our current portfolio including abaxis portfolio and what we described now as organic growth including abaxis and that we will continue assessing opportunities in the market we are convinced that we have the infrastructure we have the expertise to integrate and also we have the reach to the customers and we will continue assessing opportunities available in the market and if these opportunities are meeting the criteria of strategic value creation and supported by financials we think that we have the cash flexibility to go and acquire other companies and i think with that we conclude this session so thank you very much for attending the earnings call thank you for your questions and with that we close this call thank you operator and this will conclude today s program thanks for your participation you may now disconnect

peter foley bloomberg getty images martin shkreli the former head of turing pharmaceuticals outside the federal courthouse in brooklyn after he was found guilty of fraud august 2017 the prominence of high drug prices among current american grievances derives from three recent episodes in 2014 gilead sciences brought out sovaldi a drug that cures hepatitis c within twelve weeks but costs 1 000 a pill making the price of a full course of treatment 84 000 in 2015 turing pharmaceuticals a new company headed by martin shkreli a hedge fund manager acquired daraprim the sole treatment available in the united states for a life threatening parasitic infection and raised the price per tablet from 13 50 to 750 shkreli is now serving a prison sentence for fraud unrelated to drug prices and in 2016 mylan pharmaceuticals which had a stranglehold on the market for epipens used to counter allergic shock began selling them wholesale for 284 apiece a 600 percent increase over the wholesale price in 2007 and offering them only in packages of two 1 the three companies appeared to be emblematic of the entire pharmaceutical industry between 2008 and 2016 the price of new prescription drugs doubled and the cost of some older drugs rose many times faster than the annual inflation rate 2 a significant number of americans especially seniors reportedly could not afford their medications mounting public anger forced prescription drug prices onto the nation s political agenda during the 2016 presidential campaign hillary clinton proclaimed that the prices for some drugs were outrageous and donald trump attacked drug companies for getting away with murder during his first year in office trump s condemnations of the drug industry subsided no doubt in response to the influence of his secretary of health and human services alex azar the former president of the american division of the eli lilly corporation but in his state of the union address in january 2018 trump pledged that he would bring the costs of prescription drugs down substantially 3 on may 11 2018 trump proposed an overall policy for putting american patients first which he supplemented with a more specific blueprint posted on the white house website though the document proposed a few regulatory measures its overall thrust was that drug prices could be curbed by free market forces at the end of may trump claimed that some of the largest pharmaceutical firms would enact voluntary massive drops in prices within two weeks that was news to the drug companies whose leaders had planned no such action pressured by the trump administration a number of major companies among them pfizer novartis and merck promised to keep their prices steady for the rest of the year 4 in late october however just before the congressional elections azar declared to reporters that high prices constituted the greatest possible barrier to patient access democratic strategists gave prescription drug prices high priority in congressional campaigns 5 yet leaders in both parties understood that curbing prices would be no easy task the pharmaceutical industry which has long deployed one of the most powerful lobbies in washington was increasing its representation in the capital 6 no less important prescription drug pricing like health care in general was bewilderingly complex while the people who run gilead and turing may have been worlds apart in character and competence the companies pricings were enabled by the same intricate system of laws fda regulations and dispensing programs including public and private insurers that mediate between them and their customers the system largely unplanned is a patchwork product of history vulnerable to manipulation by the pharmaceutical industry through much of the nineteenth century as the historian joseph gabriel observes in his immensely informative book medical monopoly drug monopolies were largely blocked by patent law and by an ethical code that both physicians and even a number of drug companies embraced monopolies could in principle be obtained through patents but most medicines then consisted of plants which along with their extracts were considered ineligible for patents because they were made by nature rather than by man medicinal fabricators nevertheless packaged and bottled a variety of concoctions composed of minerals metals and even plants and sold them in shops as patent medicines although most were not legally patented they protected their products from competitors by keeping the ingredients secret 7 orthodox physicians to use gabriel s term disparaged patent medicine men as quacks and charlatans they castigated the secrecy surrounding the patent medicine enterprise arguing that it prevented physicians from knowing if the ingredients were inferior or dangerous and they decried monopolies in medicine as pernicious restrictions on accessibility of treatment that privileged profit over the welfare of patients when what came to be the american medical association was established in 1847 the founders adopted a code of ethics that declared it inconsistent with beneficence and professional liberality to patent a medicine or prescribe a medicine that was patented associating such medicines with disgraceful ignorance or fraudulent avarice some drug producers the ethical branch of the nascent business as gabriel calls it self consciously aligned themselves with these norms they tended not to seek legal patents even on chemically based medicines which were eligible advertisement during the half century after the civil war however the drug business proliferated with new firms including ethical adherents such as parke davis co and eli lilly co the establishment of federal trademark law in 1870 meant that companies could protect their products in the market by trademarking their brand names while keeping the contents secret ethical firms disapproved of trademarked drugs and so did physicians and pharmacists for much the same reasons that they condemned patented medicines including secrecy and high prices double that which any reputable pharmacist would prepare it for a physician complained but the ethical firms began to find themselves disadvantaged by their ethics the multiplication of firms increased competition and placed a premium on the production of new remedies companies began to establish laboratories for drug research and development a trend led by parke davis co the firm came to see that in the absence of patent protection for its products other companies could compete against it using its own innovations this disadvantage was worsened by the entrance into pharmaceutical manufacturing of chemical firms which had no history of engagement with the medical profession and its ethical resistance to patents for them patents were a natural part of business beginning in the late nineteenth century german companies such as bayer exploiting their formidable capacity in organic chemistry produced patented and sold in the american market powerfully effective drugs notably aspirin in these new circumstances the ethical drug companies embraced patents on their products and trademarks on their brands physicians increasingly recognized the incentive to innovation that patents provided the benefits of public disclosure of formulas and ingredients and the growing identification of patented drugs with efficacy they also welcomed trademarked brand names as an indicator of a medication s quality and reliability the 1906 pure food and drug act and its 1912 amendment which were intended to safeguard consumers from dangerous products in part by requiring the disclosure of a drug s ingredients also as gabriel points out protected drug manufacturers from competition by producers who falsely or misleadingly described their products contents or who kept them secret in 1912 the ama revised what it now called its principles of medical ethics making it acceptable for physicians to patent their innovations as long as they did not profit from them between the wars universities patented biomedically effective discoveries made in their laboratories not primarily to make money but through licensing to control their use for public good 8 royalties from the licenses were generally used to support academic programs but in gabriel s judgment physicians also collaborated with manufacturers to advance both the cause of science and their own personal careers the pursuit of individual interest the creation of corporate profit and the battle against disease were increasingly intertwined those pursuits were further joined in 1980 early in the era of genetic engineering when in the bayh dole act congress authorized universities the centers of research into recombinant dna to patent and license useful results that might emerge from federally funded investigations in their laboratories many research universities and a number of their scientists soon entered into an alliance with the drug industry in profit minded pursuit of innovation 9 in the 1950s reformers advocated for addressing high prescription drug prices a public sector issue with a private sector solution competition from generic drugs i e drugs that are copies of originals or that are composed of the same active ingredients and are functionally their equivalents established companies selling brand name products resisted this proposal as the physician and historian jeremy greene shows in his deeply knowledgeable generic the unbranding of modern medicine likening generics to the adulterated foods in upton sinclair s the jungle such companies obtained passage of laws in forty states prohibiting pharmacists from dispensing anything other than brand name drugs the creation of medicare and medicaid in 1965 helped turn the tide both programs called for the use of generics wherever possible and increasingly so did health maintenance organizations and private insurance plans beginning in the late 1970s the consumer movement helped overturn the anti substitution laws by 1984 all fifty states plus washington d c had passed legislation favoring and in some cases requiring the use of generics in place of brand name drugs the growth of the generics industry was also aided by a shift in fda policy in 1962 after a crisis over birth defects caused by the west german drug thalidomide congress required applicants for fda approval of new drugs to demonstrate that the drugs were not only safe but also effective obtaining approval for a drug even a generic now required the filing of a new drug application that included data from clinical trials demonstrating that it met both requirements would be generic manufacturers were generally unwilling to go to the expense of clearing that bar but in 1969 james goddard the head of the fda dealt with the obstacle by establishing an abbreviated new drug application anda which permitted the generic applicant to qualify for approval by using the clinical trial data accumulated by the drug s original creator and showing that its product was the original drug s chemical and biological equivalent advertisement supporters of pharmaceutical innovation drug patents and generic competitiveness achieved the passage in 1984 of the hatch waxman act cosponsored by senator orrin hatch of utah a republican and a vigorous advocate of the pharmaceutical industry and congressman henry waxman a democrat from california and a staunch proponent of consumer interests the drug industry had long complained that the commercial life of its patents was effectively shortened by the several years required to achieve fda approval for a new drug to restore the patent to de facto full life the act granted new drugs a period of data exclusivity five to seven years from the time they were approved depending on the drug s type and or class of patients the fda could not approve an anda for a generic that used the originator s trial data until the end of that period 10 magnum photos chicago 1947 photograph by wayne miller hatch waxman provided broad encouragement to generics by authorizing quick and straightforward approval of anda s that did not run afoul of an originator s patents in a procedural category dubbed paragraph iv it also encouraged generic applicants to challenge an originator s patents that it considered invalid or weak the challenger risked having to fight an infringement suit from the originator but if the originator lost the suit or declined to sue the first challenger stood to gain fda approval and be rewarded with 180 days of market exclusivity against any other generic competitors 11 it would thus share the market only with the originator for six months during which monthly revenues might be tens of millions of dollars hatch waxman accelerated the growth of the generic industry so did private insurers which favored generics in their reimbursement policies state substitution laws and revisions to medicaid and medicare both programs hugely boosted demand for brand name and generic drugs alike although the states were not required to provide drug coverage to medicaid outpatients all did and still do since 1990 the program has included federally mandated rebates from the average price of brand name drugs medicare part b had been paying the drug costs of patients in hospitals and clinics in 2003 congress established medicare part d which extended coverage to outpatients beginning in 2006 generics which in 1984 comprised almost 19 percent of filled prescriptions now account for about 90 percent and sell for 80 to 90 percent below brand name prices 12 the 1980s marked the beginning of a new generation of drugs including monoclonal antibodies and cancer therapies such as humira and herceptin these are called biologicals because they are manufactured using the biological dynamics of living organisms such as bacteria and because they are made up of molecules more than twenty times larger than those resulting from chemical synthesis such as lipitor or prozac biologicals are expensive to manufacture defy precise physical and chemical description and are difficult to reproduce without detailed command of their methods of production companies therefore opted in the main to protect their intellectual property in biologicals by patenting not the products but the methods used to make them while in the vein of the patent medicine men maintaining knowledge of parts of the process as proprietary secrets faced with the difficulty of reproducing biologicals the generics industry aimed to devise substitutes for them called biosimilars drugs that closely resemble them and perform similar therapeutic functions the generics industry pressed the fda to establish an anda option for biosimilars rightly pointing out that biologicals were fast becoming the most expensive part of the prescription drug market the brand name innovators fought the initiative they were eschewing patents on biologicals as products and their patents on the methods of producing them which were imprecise would be difficult to defend in court against biosimilar competitors greene notes that the weakness of the patent protections turned the attention of originators to the protective period of data exclusivity if biosimilars could gain fda approval through the anda process after at most five years of data exclusivity the innovators of biologicals would have little time to reap returns they counted as adequate on the costs of developing them in 2009 congress enacted a compromise within the affordable care act titled the biologics price competition and innovation act the measure granted original biologicals the extended protection of twelve years of data exclusivity and it established two routes to anda approvals of biogenerics a straightforward one for biosimilars as such but a far more expensive and demanding one requiring clinical trials for biosimilars that claimed complete therapeutic interchangeability with the original drug all the while the brand name branch of the pharmaceutical industry continued its war against generics resorting to a variety of strategies a number of companies marketed cheaper versions of their own brand name drugs after the patents on them had expired relying on advertising and reputation to outsell current or prospective competitors some including shkreli restricted the distribution of their drugs to keep them out of the hands of would be generic competitors denying them access to the knowledge that would enable replication still others exploited hatch waxman to delay competition by filing infringement suits against paragraph iv applicants which automatically postpones approval of the generic and extends the monopoly of the original for up to thirty more months 13 in recent years the pharmaceutical industry has sought to thwart competition from biosimilars and has persuaded the legislatures of a number of states to prohibit their substitution for biologicals unless they qualify as interchangeable 14 it has staunchly defended the twelve year period of data exclusivity for biologicals even though the period is shorter in every other pharmaceutical producing country and a number of companies have refused to provide samples of their biologicals or information concerning their manufacture to would be biosimilar producers more than two hundred brand name drugs are currently without generic alternatives the main reason it seems is that the market for the drugs is too small to attract or sustain generic producers this enables single suppliers to gouge their customers 15 some generic companies have also engaged in anticompetitive behavior including price fixing henry waxman retired from congress in 2015 but as the president of waxman strategies his lobbying and communications firm remains engaged in encouraging drug innovation while curbing the rise in prices perhaps no one knows the intricate interplay of public and private prescription drug policy better than waxman who dealt with the subject through much of his fifteen terms in congress his 2017 report getting to the root of high prescription drug prices coauthored with his colleagues bill corr kristi martin and sophia duong is temperate in tone and authoritative in content it scrutinizes the pharmaceutical industry health care programs medicaid medicare the veterans administration private insurers price negotiators pharmacies and both insured and uninsured consumers it merits attention not least because it takes this patchwork system as a whole identifies the connections between its disparate elements and skyrocketing drug costs and offers a variety of solutions for excessive pricing the report holds that the principal price drivers are for post patent drugs the de facto monopolies produced by the failure of markets to enable or attract competitors and for new brand name drugs the monopolies that result from the patents that cover them from hatch waxman s grant of data exclusivity and from the originator s patenting additional clinical uses for the drug which brings data exclusivity for an additional three years all told innovators of new small molecule drugs enjoy on average almost thirteen years of effective market monopoly 16 while brand name drugs account for only 10 percent of prescription drug fulfillments they command 72 percent of drug spending waxman alludes to the measure he coauthored us prescription drug pricing over the past decade reflects a distortion of the policies enacted by congress to balance innovation and price competition and to enable access to affordable medicine gallerie dell accademia venice pietro longhi the apothecary circa 1752 not only do the brand name originators pioneers to use waxman s word launch their drugs at high prices some also raise prices without in any way improving their products the veterans administration and medicaid may lower these prices with federally mandated rebates but the rebates are subtracted from the average of brand name list prices medicare part d which in 2016 covered between 29 and 35 percent of annual prescription drug costs also begins with brand name list prices but when congress established the program the pharmaceutical industry successfully lobbied to prohibit the federal government from negotiating on behalf of part d recipients 17 negotiations for the program are conducted instead by a handful of private companies through their pharma benefit managers pbm s the pbm s deal with both brand name and generic drugs and they perform the same function for many private insurance firms they obtain discounts and rebates from the list prices and in principle pass on most of the savings to purchasers critics contend that part d prices would be much cheaper if the federal government negotiated them directly with the manufacturers 18 spokespeople for the drug industry counter that they are nonetheless negotiated pointing to the pbm s but the pbm s keep some unknown portion of the discounts and rebates for themselves and for private insurers and the entire process is cloaked in secrecy to reveal any of it the parties say would jeopardize the security of proprietary information the public including the government thus has no knowledge or oversight let alone control of the disposition of the billions of dollars paid each year into medicare part d by its enrollees and the government itself the pharmaceutical industry and its advocates justify high initial prices by pointing to the social value of the new drugs that is what patients hospitals employers and the government save because they don t have to cover the long term cost of treating illness 19 they also defend them on the grounds that companies need substantial revenues to pay for the research and development estimated by the drug industry at 2 6 billion or more per successful innovation required to devise new drugs and see them through clinical trials to fda approval 20 the drugs do generate long term value better for example to be cured of hepatitis c by taking pills for twelve weeks than to suffer the extended pain and costs of a liver transplant but it is questionable to say the least that the social savings should accrue to private suppliers that rationale gains a hearing only because the industry s products enjoy at least for a while the monopoly of a patent the waxman report tacitly rejects the value pricing argument by simply ignoring it in principle the need to fund drug development is fair enough but drug prices in general bear little relation to the costs and value pricing bears none and as waxman s report points out some highly profitable drugs for example the cancer drug taxol which has earned billions were originally devised in academic laboratories with considerable federal support and only then patented and licensed to private companies the waxman report also notes that the drug industry spends at least as much on advertising as it does on research and development waxman s solutions address the system that drives the drug price juggernaut so though in a more piecemeal fashion do the remedies president trump has proposed in his blueprint and the months since in many respects however the two plans are a study in contrast waxman s relying far more than trump s on public intervention trump and waxman both call for promoting competition through generics by as trump puts it taking steps to end the gaming of regulatory and patent processes by drug makers to unfairly protect monopolies both urge accelerating the approval of biosimilars both address the exclusivity features of hatch waxman but here waxman goes further than trump he calls for reducing the data exclusivity period for biologicals to seven years and ending all periods of data exclusivity once a pioneer has recouped some adequate multiple he does not say how large of its investment in developing the drug and for abolishing the thirty month postponement of approval for paragraph iv anda applicants and the 180 day period of market exclusivity awarded the first such applicant both urge that drug advertisements include price information in october the trump administration proposed regulations to that effect and waxman calls for them also to include comparisons with alternative drugs so that patients can make more informed decisions about their purchases 21 waxman calls for authorizing medicare to negotiate part d drug prices directly with manufacturers and open the process to public scrutiny and oversight 22 contrary to his campaign promises trump does not rather he resorts to fixing the privately controlled system by requiring pbm s to strengthen their negotiating power with drug makers and to pass their rebates directly on to consumers in october trump signed a bipartisan bill banning gag rules a condition of sale whereby pbm s and insurers prohibit pharmacists from informing patients of suitable drugs that are not covered by their insurance plans but are cheaper than those that are 23 he also wants to limit price increases to the inflation rate and provide low income seniors with free generics trump s proposals largely ignore market failures waxman aims to counter them by establishing federal incentives for the development of additional domestic producers and by allowing the importation of cheaper drugs vetted for safety and efficacy trump contemplates importing drugs that are substitutes for those produced by a single price gouging supplier that are not covered by patents or grants of exclusivity waxman wants to compel drug manufacturers to provide samples and manufacturing information to would be generic and biosimilar producers trump does not 24 neither trump nor waxman addresses more than obliquely the elephant in the room the prices of new drugs at launch and through the monopolistic years after their sale has been approved in keeping with trump s nationalist aim of putting american patients first his blueprint declares that the united states should pressure foreign governments to raise their drug prices the strategy aims to force foreigners to pay a fairer share of drug development costs now borne mainly by the united states the expectation implausible on its face is that american companies by earning more abroad would reduce prices at home in late october in a preelection attempt at plausibility trump announced that his administration was taking aim at the global freeloading by proposing that the us government tie the amount it pays for drugs under medicare b to their cost in other countries phasing in the shift over five years american pharmaceutical companies he declared had too long rigged the system against american consumers 25 waxman calls on the government to require reasonable prices for brand name drugs developed with the results of federally funded research he finds authority for that proposal in the bayh dole act which obligates the government to ensure that innovations arising from such research are made available to the public on reasonable terms 26 following the democratic victory in the house in november trump declared that he looked forward to collaborating with nancy pelosi to ensure affordable drug prices but trump s blueprint despite its expansion since it was first released tended to leave the pharmaceutical industry largely unscathed one might say that it put the industry not patients first at the beginning of this year drug companies announced price hikes averaging close to 7 percent on hundreds of medications 27 democratic legislative initiatives some of them borrowing from waxman s playbook authorize medicare to negotiate prices directly with drug companies and abolish the tax deductibility of drug advertising costs a measure coauthored by senator bernie sanders empowers the secretary of health and human services to strip a company of its drug patents if the secretary determines that its prices are too high amid mounting evidence that a cartel of generic companies had been driving up prices on three hundred drugs senator elizabeth warren introduced a bill enabling the government to manufacture drugs in cases where competition is nonexistent or suppressed and prices are exorbitant congressman elijah cummings a stalwart critic of the drug industry and now chair of the house committee on oversight and reform has opened a sweeping investigation into the pricing practices of major pharmaceutical companies even senator mitch mcconnell declared on election day i can t imagine won t be on the agenda yet a number of house democrats have close ties to the pharmaceutical industry and so do many republicans and any efforts at reform will be challenged fiercely by the pbm s and the pharmaceutical industry 28 it would be foolhardy amid the profit hungry standards and culture of contemporary capitalism to expect the drug industry and its allies in medicine and academia to recommit to anything resembling the ethical code of the nineteenth century nor would it be beneficial practical or legal to deprive the system of financial incentives to produce new efficacious drugs but recall that in the early decades of industrial capitalism americans enlisted the government to ensure that the private engines of economic growth better served the public interest waxman is hardly alone in thinking that given the formidable power of the drug industry mainly private sector solutions to the public welfare problem of ever rising prescription drug prices are inadequate polls have revealed that his major proposals for reform enjoy widespread public support the current system deprives millions of people of the drugs they need and as waxman says it is helping to make health care costs in the united states unsustainable

turn over the call to jerry barag to cover full year 2018 results fourth quarter results and company guidance for the year ahead jerry barag president chief executive officer and director advertisement advertisement thanks brian good morning everybody and thank you for joining us as we all know the past six months have been somewhat volatile for the timber and wood products industry and especially difficult for lumber manufacturers with prices down 50 to 60 in certain lumber categories this led to a challenging fourth quarter particularly impacting owners of timberland in the pacific northwest at catchmark by design we have been able to navigate through this rough patch effectively unscathed our pure play model circumventing lumber price volatility the u s south micro markets where we are concentrated are steady and improving driven by recent under way and announced mill expansions which should result in future strengthening of unit prices furthermore southern yellow pine lumber prices have been less affected compared to other species and today stand at close to long term trend prices quite frankly our operations have remained unchanged during this period and so does our outlook for catchmark owned properties since catchmark s inception as a public company we have steadily expanded assembling the industry s consistently highest quality timberland portfolio and consistently meeting our operating targets we ve reduced exposure to volatility through our pure play nature advertisement advertisement we re a timberland investor not a lumber company our acquisitions have proved out by picking the right locations with proximity to the best mill markets our delivered wood sales strategy and fiber supply agreements continue to help baseload and optimize our timber sales revenue through relationships with creditworthy counterparties our diversified cash flow streams have enabled to defer harvest to optimize future upside we ve managed our capital effectively to maximize growth including entering into strategic joint ventures with institutional investors and our new investment management business delivers asset management fees helps protect against downside volatility and provides opportunities to capture very attractive incentive fees as a result of our business strategy catchmark is extremely well positioned to generate and grow durable cash flows always seeking to deliver a reliable dividend over time in 2018 specifically we took bold and significant steps to execute our long standing strategic initiatives to increase cash flow expand our prime timberland portfolio in top mill markets maximize results from harvest operations and reinforce our capital position advertisement advertisement in addition we significantly advanced our investment management business diversifying and solidifying our revenue streams and again we met our company guidance for the year in 2018 we increased timberlands managed by 200 to more than 1 5 million acres that included investing 200 million in the triple t joint venture which has secured significant stable ongoing asset management fees offers potential superior investment returns and attractive long term sustainable growth from extremely high quality texas timberlands and provides the opportunity for capturing performance based incentive management fees we further diversified assets and expanded sawtimber holdings by entering into the leading pacific northwest mill markets through the purchase of 18 000 acres of prime oregon timberlands in the 89 7 million bandon transaction after the triple t investment upgraded our regional portfolio we rebalanced our holdings in texas and louisiana and recycled capital to facilitate the bandon purchase that was accomplished with the sale of 56 000 acres of timberlands for 79 3 million in the southwest disposition advertisement advertisement we completed other hbu land sales of approximately 8 500 acres for 17 5 million meeting our target for the year within the range of 1 to 2 of the acreage disposed we raised 72 5 million of capital in an equity offering to pursue opportunities in a robust acquisition pipeline we improved liquidity by increasing total borrowing capacity by 75 million to 644 million at year end and secured a new seven year 140 million term loan to replace existing debt and we executed 200 million of interest rate swaps to mitigate exposure to rising interest rates looking specifically at full year 2018 result highlights we increased total revenues by 7 year over year we increased adjusted ebitda by 19 we increased asset management fees to 5 6 million which were primarily generated by triple t during the second half of 2018 we also produced 2 6 million in income and received 8 5 million in distributions from the dawsonville bluffs joint venture and during the year we paid fully covered dividends totaling 26 million or 0 54 per share catchmark also incurred a net loss of 122 million for full year 2018 these results were overwhelmingly due to losses allocated from the triple t joint venture in accordance with gaap rules in meeting our guidance for 2018 we again effectively demonstrated how our disciplined strategy for assembling the consistently highest quality timberlands portfolio and the ongoing operations excellence together to maximize cash flow and support our dividend to all phases of the business cycle and yesterday we declared a first quarter 2019 cash dividend of 0 135 per share for stockholders payable on march 15 our dividend yield is the highest among timber reits and continues to offer superior risk adjusted coverage advertisement advertisement in 2018 we completed an industry leading investment the triple t joint venture and took the first step in entering the pacific northwest through the bandon acquisition triple t especially represents a significant expansion of our holdings and both investments are designed to register durable cash flow growth and support our dividend well into the future they further enhance the quality of our prime timberlands in leading markets reinforced by delivered wood sales strategy and fiber supply agreements which meet our investment profile their premium stocking and productivity characteristics are in keeping with our stringent investment criteria which are proved out in helping deliver superior results and enabling operation advantages throughout our portfolio and these operating advantages continue to pay off in consistent and predictable cash flow we operate in superior micro markets with proximity to leading mills and customers we continue to benefit from executing on our delivered wood sale strategies in those mill markets and we gain from our extensive long term fiber supply agreements with creditworthy counterparties by strategic design the mill markets where we operate in the u s south continue to outperform southwide averages catchmark s average pine sawtimber stumpage price has maintained a premium over southwide averages ranging up to 9 since the first quarter 2017 advertisement advertisement the premium has been even higher in the chip n saw category ranging from 20 to 40 delivered wood sales had been at the foundation of our management philosophy and we increased delivered wood sales as a percentage of total harvest from 74 in 2017 to 80 in 2018 through our delivered wood sales strategy we can keep better control of our supply chain and produce more stable and predictable cash flows we also made a tactical decision early in the year to defer some harvest in anticipation of stronger future pricing our gross timber sales declined 3 year over year as harvest volume declined 8 year over year as a result of these discretionary deferrals but our per term pulpwood pricing increased about 6 to help offset the decline in harvest volume and our fourth quarter pine sawtimber stumpage price registered a 25 per ton compared to southwide averages which have tracked below 24 for the past eight quarters according to timbermart south in addition the significant new asset management fees from triple t and execution of planned hbu timberland sales to dispose of less productive holdings buttressed overall company performance during the year the new asset management fees are notable in diversifying our revenue streams and provide a predictable and significant source of ongoing cash flow advertisement advertisement in addition we have the opportunity to earn attractive performance based incentive fees going forward both our joint ventures in triple t and dawsonville bluffs are operating to plan and integration of triple t operations has been efficient and well managed meeting our performance objectives to date with regard to dawsonville bluffs we recognized 2 6 million of income during the year generated primarily from the planned sale of hbu timberland and mitigation bank credits in addition we received 8 5 million in distributions as we move to fully monetize this finite life 10 million investment ahead of schedule in terms of adjusted ebitda dawsonville contributed 6 8 million now turning specifically to catchmark s operating results for the 3 month period ending december 31 2018 we increased revenues 1 year over year we generated adjusted ebitda of 9 4 million compared to 9 9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 we produced 2 8 million in asset management fees primarily from triple t we completed timberland sales of approximately 1300 acres for 2 6 million we incurred a net loss of 32 million primarily due to gaap accounting losses allocated from triple t and we paid a dividend of 0 135 per share to stockholders of record on december 13 2018 as a result of our plan to strategically defer harvest for an anticipated future stronger pricing environment gross timber sales revenue in the fourth quarter decreased 20 from fourth quarter 2017 due to a 22 decrease in harvest volume timberland sales for the quarter were higher year over year due to selling more acres at a price per acre 26 above fourth quarter 2017 in the fourth quarter catchmark completed a series of coordinated transactions by closing on the sale of 56 000 acres of timberlands in texas and louisiana the southwest region disposition as a part of the sale we retained approximately 200 000 tons of merchantable inventory to be harvested over the next two years proceeds from the southwest disposition were recycled to pay down debt used for last summer s bandon acquisition as a result of these two transactions in triple t we improved the overall quality of our timberlands ownership in the southwest and reduced our regional exposure to post the triple t investment we also redeployed capital to prime sawtimber holdings in the pacific northwest and we strengthened our overall capital position also in the fourth quarter under our 30 million share repurchase program announced in august 2015 catchmark repurchased close to 99 000 shares of common stock for approximately 1 million in open market transactions as of december 31 2018 catchmark may repurchase up to an additional 18 7 million worth of shares under the program given the relative stability of our cash flow and recent steps taken to reduce debt including the southwest disposition we re very comfortable with our balance sheet during the year we raised 72 5 million in equity to support our investment pipeline we refinanced existing debt which was outstanding under our multi draw facility securing 140 million term loan this refinancing improved our weighted average maturities and our first step maturities are now marked until 2024 after increasing our borrowing capacity to a total of 644 million we had 165 million of dry powder at year end and we entered into 200 million of interest rate swaps to reduce exposure to potential rising interest rates approximately three quarters of our rate exposure was swaps fixed rate as of year end 2018 as a result going into the new year we have sufficient capacity and flexibility to continue our track record of growth through select acquisitions and joint venture investments at the appropriate time taken together all the initiatives we completed last year will help set the stage for growth in adjusted ebitda for 2019 as well as in the future and we believe that we are well positioned to navigate through current economic volatility stemming from general concern about the housing market and tariff and trade issues as well as global uncertainty lumber mills in our micro markets are operating at or near full capacity demand is good for finished lumber supported by expected level of housing activity including robust repair and remodel business we also see no pullback in previously announced mill expansion projects in the u s south and recent capital investments in mills are beginning to pay off with improved production levels that is beginning to drive increased log demands in our micro markets across the region another positive sign overall finished lumber inventories are light which bodes well for mills to run at or near capacity levels with multiple shifts furthermore southern yellow pine lumber manufacturers are still able to produce lumber with comfortable margins based on current levels of finished lumber prices and timber input prices our pulp markets also remained strong across all products as a result our fiber supply agreement partners and other pulp customers appear well positioned for steady production throughout the year ahead lastly historically weather conditions are supporting and even increasing timber prices in our market taking all factors into consideration for full year 2019 guidance we anticipate adjusted ebitda in a range of 52 million to 60 million or a 4 to 21 increase compared to full year 2018 this increase will result primarily from earning a full year of triple t asset management fees of 11 5 million as well as an increase in net timber revenue attributable to higher harvest volumes harvest volumes are anticipated in the range of 2 2 million to 2 4 million tons and increases our forecast to drive from southwest disposition timber reservations deferred harvest from last year and expect the new harvest from the bandon acquisition beginning in the second quarter bandon should also help increase the share of sawtimber and our mix into a range of 40 to 50 in the u s south we also anticipate a slight increase of approximately 1 in harvest volume as a result of our delivered wood sales and fiber supply agreements in select micro markets the timberland sales target of 16 million to 18 million remains consistent with past years within the range of 1 to 2 of the acreage we ve also been delighted with dawsonville bluffs which by year end 2018 had generated adjusted ebitda of 8 8 million we anticipate dawsonville generating an additional 3 million to 5 million surpassing our original investment of 10 million our outlook does not include potential contributions from future acquisitions and joint ventures which we pursue as part of our ongoing growth strategy and does not include any potential capital recycling from dispositions so in summary catchmark s favorable guidance for the year ahead derives directly from the well formulated and consistently executed programs that deliver durable cash flow for our shareholders and support our dividend they are investing capital prudently in prime timberlands in selected markets near leading mill customers to provide growth opportunities which has resulted in price and demand stability also benefiting from the disciplined management of delivered sales strategy and fiber supply agreements in those markets with creditworthy counterparties to cushion against volatility capturing new highly predictable revenue streams from entry into the investment management business and finally focusing to derive upside from our investment in triple t and further upside from dawsonville bluffs so in conclusion catchmark had an extremely successful year in 2018 in meeting our strategic objectives registering higher year over year revenues and higher ebitda and significantly expanding our investments and investment management platform and we believe we re well positioned to move ahead successfully in 2019 all of us at catchmark our executive group our board our astounding and dedicated employees have worked extremely hard to position the company to deliver on our promise to our shareholders grow cash flow and support our dividend from execution of a clear and focused strategy and operations excellence that will continue to be our focus in the year ahead i appreciate everybody being on the call today and now todd brian john rasor and i are available to take any of your questions questions and answers operator we ll now begin the question and answer session operator instructions and look today s first question will be from collin mings with raymond james please go ahead collin mings raymond james analyst thanks good morning guys jerry barag president chief executive officer and director good morning brian davis chief financial officer good morning collin collin mings raymond james analyst to start jerry do you have any other acquisitions or dispositions in the active pipeline right now and just along those lines how do you think about the potential to reduce leverage further here in 2019 with some additional capital recycling jerry barag president chief executive officer and director okay so it s an easy answer to the first part of your question no we purposefully made a decision post the frenetic end of 2018 and closing triple t the southwest disposition and bandon to make sure that we had appropriately integrated all those changes into our portfolio and so we have effectively stopped looking at acquisitions for the time being and then with the dislocation that happened in our share price we didn t think that it was a particularly opportune time to aggressively go and seek new investments so having said that from a capital standpoint we are very very focused right now on liquidity in particular and the use of that liquidity which we think would be best spent on a combination of paying down debt and some tactical share repurchases assuming our share price remains at a level that i think is unrealistically low and opportune for us to repurchase shares so i think that will be certainly the focus of what we re doing for the first six months of 2019 and we ll continue to reevaluate that brian do you have anything you want to add brian davis chief financial officer no i guess another point of emphasis here collin is when we take a look at our guidance for 2019 which reflects a full year impact associated with bandon as well as triple t our leverage profile does naturally reduce from the levels where on a stated basis today by another turn to turn in a quarter so you put that on top of what jerry is talking about an opportunity for us to review some capital recycling opportunities that would be on a cad per share neutral basis and that would also maximize our asset realizations you see some opportunities inside of our portfolio for additional leverage reduction collin mings raymond james analyst okay so on balancing nothing under contract or really active right now neither of the acquisition or disposition front or just given where things stand it sounds like the buyers would be fear to go one way or the other it would may be to be to sell something to on the margin bring down leverage a little bit more is that a fair recap brian davis chief financial officer i think that is very accurate as the way we re thinking about things collin mings raymond james analyst okay that s helpful and then switching to triple t can you just provide us an update both operationally as well as any progress toward restructuring the sawtimber supply agreement or really any other value creation event recognizing you guys are highly incentivized to unlock value in the first few years of that deal so an update there again both operationally as well as any sort of value creation activity would be very helpful jerry barag president chief executive officer and director so john rasor is here joining us today and i m going to turn over the specifics of that question to him but he as well as everybody on the team involved with triple t have done just a remarkable job of integrating 1 1 million acres into full operations and i m pleased to report that we are running at a full operational run rate at this point and have been for some time we ve met all of the minimum deliveries or the expected deliveries to the supply agreement counterparties in the southwest and it continues to go well there continues to improve and john will talk a little bit about that with respect to the future opportunities that we identified when we purchased the triple t property we re working toward that diligently that was not meant to be an overnight process it s going to take a little bit of time but we have begun the process of trying to get to agree that we think we ll have the opportunity to add significant value to that property john won t you give a little bit more detail about that john rasor president triple t timberlands okay i think the headline what the property of this size and the amount of volume that has to move is best described as more than 400 truckloads a day to support the supply agreements then and the additional sales we make into the market and with the weather that has been absolutely historically epic over there meaning it just has rained and rained and rained with the rainfall for the quarter being well over anything that anybody has seen previously i m feeling like we met the challenge as jerry said we satisfied both the big georgia pacific supply agreement requirements and the ip supply agreement requirements that was quite an accomplishment but the challenges we faced with the weather alone i would add to that that while we hit all the numbers on the volumes we did come up short on the hardwood volumes simply because we could not access the tracks we will be prepared to get after that again in 2019 and you really only have about three month window over there in the flatwoods of texas to get into these bottom lands and we intend to be fully prepared to take advantage of that opportunity as we look at 2019 surely the rain will be less by then on the harvest revenue side i can tell you pricing has been a bit less than we had expected but we re seeing some uplift now so that we re looking at a really good start in january and we see prices moving upward specifically around the prime pulpwood and the prime sawtimber products also our surface use income has been significant and better than we expected with the oil and gas activity that has become quite a component of our business that s been value added and we will we ve started to implement a modest land sale program and are very encouraged by the kind of pricing and interest we re getting so it was a tough six months but we got there and we re looking forward to 2019 jerry barag president chief executive officer and director yes so i will remind everybody that all of these things and all of the accomplishments that have happened over there are important but from a cash flow standpoint from an ebitda standpoint to catchmark it s really a barometer for what we expect to be able to move property value and nav over time the earnings that catchmark receives on that property are essentially from the investment management fees so realistically changes in prices changes in income for 2019 really won t have any bearing on the ebitda that catchmark is going to get from its investment collin mings raymond james analyst okay that s very helpful update guys two other quick ones for me i ll turn it over just on capex brian it looks like you guys came in a little bit below budget for 2018 how should we think about 2019 on the capex front i apologize if i missed this in the guidance brian davis chief financial officer it s about 5 million to 6 million next year we got a carryover from the fourth quarter and first quarter this year so 5 million to 6 million in 2019 collin mings raymond james analyst okay and then on just the cost side overall it does look like g a forestry management fees and other operating expenses were all up notably sequentially in the fourth quarter again not necessarily huge dollar amounts but just collectively that was a notable variance for us at least just anything in particular we should be mindful of brian davis chief financial officer so in the q4 in g a it included pursue costs about 150 000 i think that s noted inside the adjusted ebitda reconciliation line as it stands with other operating expenses we expense basis of timber related to lease terminations and timber deed expirations and casualty losses within the operating expense line item in the fourth quarter we had just under 600 000 of non cash charges related to this activity the corresponding entry reflecting these non cash expenses can be found on our cash flow statement in the operating section so those are the two notable areas which you can we can provide detail on collin mings raymond james analyst okay i ll turn it over and go back in the queue thanks guys brian davis chief financial officer thank you operator next question will be from anthony pettinari with citi please go ahead randy toth citi analyst good morning guys this is actually randy toth sitting in for anthony i guess my first question is brian davis chief financial officer good morning randy toth citi analyst good morning can you talk a little bit about your 2019 guidance and what baked in i know you have 3 million to 5 million coming from dawsonville and i imagine around 11 million coming from triple t just any assumptions around pricing in the u s south jerry barag president chief executive officer and director i m going to let todd answer that todd reitz senior vice president forest resources sure so we ll think about overall market conditions and where we re coming out of 2018 we finished fourth quarter very strong had a nice run rate coming up to that point as jerry mentioned in his comments some of that being weather related but the bigger takeaway and the stable steady part of this is that we re beginning to see build consumption improve some of the capital improvements that have been initiated in late 2017 and 2018 are beginning to come online so we re seeing some of that demand pull that being said we re anticipating some more stable view of pricing if you will going forward so if we saw a 2 to 3 very modest uptick over the year that would be what we re looking at going forward additionally we have a little stronger mix of sawtimber in there as jerry mentioned with bandon coming on and we re positioned to harvest this year going to be more in that 40 to 50 range so some added value associated with that as well jerry barag president chief executive officer and director yeah and i probably like to remind everybody that a year ago when we did this call i think my exact words were that we would be disappointed if we didn t see some modest improvement in prices over the operating areas where catchmark owns its properties and in fact we delivered that in spite of some headwinds that came from southern yellow pine exports that were effectively derailed as a result of tariffs that were put on particularly punitive tariffs from the u s south and so we re very proud at being able to do that we certainly saw the conditions strengthening and being able to do that we think we delivered it and i think we feel relatively confident that we will see some more strengthening going into 2019 randy toth citi analyst okay that s helpful and then just saying in the u s south it s quite a bit of saw mill capacity coming online over the next 12 to 24 months especially in alabama and georgia my question is how will all of this capacity impact pricing for pulpwood because of the saw mill residuals just kind of curious how that relationship how you think about that jerry barag president chief executive officer and director sure so you look at a lot of the customers where we re operating and in general they have a baseload that is associated with raw logs that have to come in pulpwood that has to come in that component will be consistent pricing for that has been very very stable we see that being strong going forward and customers being well positioned for that as far as the residuals are concerned they ll work that into their overall mix and we think that we re going to see some positive movement on the market going forward additionally with our supply agreements we have a strong position with our customers that are stable and set forth into the future 10 12 years depending on who we re working with that allows us to be a little bit insulated to any of the ups and downs if you will in the marketplace randy toth citi analyst okay that s helpful thank you i ll turn it over jerry barag president chief executive officer and director thank you operator operator instructions next question will be from paul quinn with rbc capital markets please go ahead paul quinn rbc capital markets analyst yeah thanks very much good morning guys jerry barag president chief executive officer and director hi paul brian davis chief financial officer hi paul paul quinn rbc capital markets analyst hey just a question on 2018 just what was the quantify of harvest that you deferred and it sounds like that you re going to harvest a part of the deferral or all it so maybe you could just help me out in 2019 jerry barag president chief executive officer and director sure so when you look at it as a year over year call it 150 000 100 000 or so tons that we pulled back going into 2018 going into 2019 we re going to end up adding about that amount back in so it s kind of a rebalancing of where we were compared to previous again it will be a regional difference with the northwest coming in and then having the timber reservation coming out of the southwest as well so all of that will pretty much be brought back online throughout 2019 paul quinn rbc capital markets analyst so the original reason for the deferral was to take advantage of higher timber prices down the round is the stuff that you re coming in but i guess the increased harvest in 2019 as a result of the deferral in 2018 on the regional mix is that going to result in a higher price in the sort of 2 to 3 that you re kind of expecting jerry barag president chief executive officer and director we would anticipate that going the modest increase throughout the year or potential for throughout the year that s correct paul quinn rbc capital markets analyst okay and just shifting now we haven t seen a lot of timberland transactions it seems like i don t know a year and a half two years now and we had a pretty steady increase in interest rates throughout 2018 have you seen or you experienced yourself changing underwriting criteria around that jerry barag president chief executive officer and director i think underwriting criteria has generally been somewhat stable paul now where the volatility has been has been really out in the pacific northwest where you ve had a lot of volatility for the most part to the upside but more recently to the downside in timber prices and so interestingly there since we closed on the bandon transaction there were two properties that were offered out in the pacific northwest one of them actually transacted the other one didn t transact in that that was the first time in quite some time that a property in pacific northwest failed to meet a clearing price what we re seeing going forward into 2019 are a couple of things a couple of trends one is quality has become much more important even it was important previously it s become much more important and so higher quality property is the best properties are trading and they are supporting floor pricing number one number two it s going to be an interesting transaction because there still is seemingly a lot of pressure on the timos who have a decade or so old investments that there is pressure for them to liquidate but they have been cycling through their portfolio selling the better properties as opposed to the weaker properties and in the u s that s getting harder to do because you had seen a lot of transactions in the pacific northwest and that seems to be coming off given i think people s anticipation that pacific northwest properties are going to at least flatten or potentially some of the valuations out there might fall interestingly what we ve heard at this early point in the year is there maybe a significant number of international transactions that happen or offerings that are coming from the timos this year and so naturally we won t be a very active participant in things like that paul quinn rbc capital markets analyst all right thanks very much best of luck guys jerry barag president chief executive officer and director thanks paul brian davis chief financial officer thanks paul operator next question is a follow up from collin mings please go ahead collin mings raymond james analyst thanks just a couple of housekeeping things from me here just as far as the timing of future losses associated with triple t can you just maybe give us some guidepost there and remind us what that should be just given how that just from a net perspective kind of a big driver brian davis chief financial officer certainly collin so how we re thinking about is about 25 million per quarter for q1 through q3 and then the remaining 15 million in q4 2019 collin mings raymond james analyst okay and then i apologize if i missed this brian but as far as have you quantified a g a number for 2019 again i guess you kind of gave us some other puzzled pieces but can you be a little bit more explicit there brian davis chief financial officer we ll give you the corners to your puzzle collin so we anticipate g a to increase about 1 to 2 year over year which close about 2 6 million of equity compensation one thing i should note as we kind of fill these things in our other operating expense is expected to remain flat on a gross basis even after backing out the other operating expense that we occurred in fourth quarter this year the real net increase is resulting from property taxes and for where we added for forestry management will increase year over year to about 7 3 million to 7 7 million as we allocate expenses of our management of our joint ventures from g a into this line item and this is inclusive of approximately about 500 000 of equity compensation expense collin mings raymond james analyst okay that s helpful detail and then just going back to paul s question as far as timberland transaction markets jerry just for our benefit can you maybe just maybe clarify a little bit as far as some of the evolution in the market if you will how much of that is being driven by some of the potential bidders not maybe emerging as much they would have a couple of years ago is it concerns around pricing and the trajectory of pricing specifically in the northwest near term or longer term outlook for the u s south just curious maybe more simply that the pool of potential buyers has changed or maybe has some of their underwriting and the environment changed where it just has been as active jerry barag president chief executive officer and director i think the answer is yes to all of the above so the backdrop to the markets really starts with liquidity and liquidity is i would tell you it was a transaction year last year so there is liquidity it is coming from different places and it is it s spotty certainly compare to what it used to be a decade ago and that trend has been around for the last couple of years and i don t think that it is going to change if you look at the buyer s property over the last year or over the last couple of years it s a rotation in names i mean its different names than you would have likely seen a decade ago and the philosophies around those transactions tend to be a little bit different so by and large the as i previously mentioned higher quality properties and really high quality markets are the ones that are ultimately transacting there have been some other transactions of lesser quality properties and after being marketed for multiple times some of those had begun to actually trade now there was actually a trade of some alabama property at the end of last year that transacted at just under 1 200 an acre and interestingly it was a pretty similar price to the triple t transaction although it was much worse mill markets much less productive property than triple t and a much different story and so you may see some of that actually come to market and finally transact now in 2019 but i believe the real focus is going to be from the sellers they re going to looking around their portfolio for properties in pockets of strength and i think right now they believe that those pockets of strength really are international properties international investments that they ve made and that there s probably more liquidity especially in the timo market for international properties right now than domestic properties collin mings raymond james analyst along those lines are you concerned though as maybe some of these lower quality properties clear the market just the impact that might have on timberland appraisals and just from that environment recognizing again you have triple t up there which at some point you like the optionality around that but just curious how you think this might actually filter through from an appraisal standpoint in the marketplace jerry barag president chief executive officer and director yes as you pointed out it really becomes an appraisal issue the appraisal issue at least for us the biggest outcome of that would be around the loan to value ratios the coverage ratios that go with our debt we think we re comfortably insulated from it and but at the end of the day we do believe that the appraisers and the market in general has made the distinction between lower quality properties and higher quality properties and we are not feeling much downward pressure if any on the types of properties that we own i think it s going to be a different state of properties which ultimately may have an impact on the ncreif timberland index so it should cause some interesting headlines but operationally for us i don t expect there s problems collin mings raymond james analyst i appreciate all the extra color jerry barag president chief executive officer and director great thanks collin operator at this time this will conclude today s question and answer session i d like to turn the conference back over to jerry barag for any closing remarks jerry barag president chief executive officer and director thanks

by now that alexandria ocasio cortez aoc and senator markey have introduced their nonbinding green new deal resolution the right wing snowflakes are melting down while respectable centrists are calling the idea crazy on one side global political and economic elites are doing almost nothing to stop climate change from running out of control and on the other side aoc and company are proposing a solution whose size and scale are up to the task which side is the crazy one ross douhat complains that the green new deal is a plan to implement much of the left s boldest ideas exactly the economy is not working for most people the result being the rise of a troubling right wing form of populism heavily tinged with racism in order to avert these unhealthy trends while engendering enough public support to do something about climate change there needs to be something in it for just about everybody climate change will only be adequately addressed when it is wrapped in a wider set of policies designed to help most americans and ensuring that the transition doesn t disproportionately penalize workers in targeted industries and their communities aoc and markey s nonbinding resolution lays out a wide list of aspirational goals that need to be implemented if we are going to prevent the worst of global warming while at the same time endeavoring to improve the lives of the vast majority of our citizens the details will apparently be filled in during the coming months i have been researching and writing about just such an agenda for over 10 years so i d like to kick off the search for concrete green new deal programs that could fulfill the requirements laid out in the resolution the idea of a green new deal will encounter many setbacks frustrations pushback and ridicule so it needs as much intellectual support as possible the projects i will describe share a number of elements in common first the projects should be planned managed and owned by the federal government with as much input as possible from state and local governments in other words the market should not play the primary role in organizing the transition and allocation aside from the private firms that would do the actual building market based systems are largely insensitive to equity considerations the programs therefore should neither be constructed as positive incentives like tax credits or not too onerous regulations as paul krugman has proposed nor should they depend on the tender mercies of thomas friedman s father greed at the same time having the federal government take the lead does not mean full blown socialism communism fascism or whatever other scare words the right will attempt to use to invalidate a major role by the public sector totaling close to 2 trillion per year these expenditures would add less than 10 to a 20 trillion economy during world war ii a much less technologically complex country spent one third of its wealth on a destructive war and even now the u s spends over 1 trillion per year in spending for all military activities as i have previously argued periods of widely shared prosperity and economic growth as occurred for thirty years after wwii are created by bursts of government infrastructure building societies never move forward without governments creating new infrastructure the most recent example being the government created internet and we need to move quickly or we will fall back into environmental catastrophe and or a fascistic resurgence governments must take the lead in establishing the regulatory framework infrastructure and market incentives for the creation of well paid secure healthy satisfying environmentally friendly jobs with particular attention to appropriately meeting the needs of affected workers and their communities the second aspect that these projects have in common is that they are all funded with federal grants not loans so they can not only pay for own operation when they are finished they should be able to return revenues to the federal government thus potentially decreasing middle class taxes stealing the thunder of conservative tax cutters since these projects increase the wealth of the united states it would not be inflationary to simply create the money to build the green new deal just as private banks createat least 500 billion per year to reflect the wealth their investments create in addition aoc elizabeth warren and bernie sanders among others have offered ways to increase tax revenues from the rich and big corporations the right has continuously used the specter of too much spending to scare off the left and the public from advocating policies that would help the economy it s time to go on offense third these projects will all provide affordable and high quality goods and services including electricity housing transportation internet and education which in addition to medicare for all will create the kind of good society that can be used as a rallying cry for the democratic party for decades to come according to the latest science we need to eliminate virtually all greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 at the latest and the projects explained below will take 20 years so a green new deal needs to engender the kind of overwhelming support from the public that can withstand years of propaganda from the fossil fuel industries right wing billionaires and conservatives in general i m slightly revising aoc s call for decarbonizing electricity in 10 years my plan essentially reduces greenhouse gases at the same rate most of all the simultaneous operation of all of these programs will provide so many good jobs well paying high skill amenable to advancement and secure that anyone who wants a good job can get one every politician says they want more jobs but only a green new deal presents a credible way to create them the programs listed below would create over 20 million jobs and a federal job guarantee could be implemented that would be used to hire anyone who wanted to work on the green new deal this means that it will be very easy to implement a just transition for workers from one industry such as fossil fuels to another such as manufacturing wind turbines in addition we can guarantee that all communities of whatever color economic status or geographic location will see their standards of living improve to such an extent that we should be able to totally eliminate poverty in the united states the key to enabling the green new deal to accomplish these employment goals is to require that all the goods used to build these infrastructure systems be produced in this country in other words local content rules should be applied including eventually domestically producing the industrial machinery used inside factories to make the manufactured goods all of the factories that produce these goods should be required to be unionized and new factories could be required to become employee owned and operated after a few years the combination of a federal job guarantee domestic content requirements tens of millions of new jobs unionization and employee control would give working people the power to claim their fair share of the economic growth of this country something that has been denied to them since the 1970s when manufacturing started to decline the working class would finally get a permanent raise now and in the future manufacturing could rise from employing 9 of the workforce to 20 as occurs in middle class countries such as germany and japan which would reinvigorate white african american and latino communities all of which have been devastated by deindustrialization over many decades contrary to popular myths of a post industrial society manufacturing continues to be the foundation of a prosperous economy a democratic party that can promise to directly help the entire working class will have enough long term support to defeat right wing nationalism as personified by donald trump and if progressive political parties around the world were to adopt a green new deal they could turn back the tide of rising fascism around the world all of these programs are technically possible but politically difficult they fulfill the requirements of science but threaten the power of political and economic elites think of it this way physical laws cannot be changed but political reality no matter how daunting can be here are the ten sets of projects including the greenhouse gases they eliminate and the approximate costs which can be further refined in the coming months further details on cost and job estimates are available in my book chapter and at greennewdealplan com at the center of a green new deal as aoc s resolution points out must be a national electrical system that uses only renewable technologies like wind solar and geothermal to generate electricity that doesn t mean we should shut down all the nukes coal and natural gas plants tomorrow depending on the circumstances they might stay open for a while but a modern system should eventually be 100 renewable the best way to do that is for the federal government to create a nation wide system of strategically placed wind and solar farms in what we can call an interstate renewable electricity system adopting part of the name of the popular interstate highway system this system would also rewire a smarter and more efficient national electrical grid and would include plenty of battery storage this program could even include buying up half the stock of the top 50 utility companies in the country so that we don t have to deal with their obstruction tactics against a green new deal this system would eliminate 27 of greenhouse emissions directly and much more in other sectors would clear up pollution from coal minimize the risk from nukes improve public health and should cost on the order of 300 billion per year including buying shares of utilities an interstate high speed rail system would use the electricity from the electrical interstate and follow many of the routes of the current interstate this system could eventually eliminate all jet travel within the continental united states would make long distance travel more pleasant and would reconnect smaller cities to national life since freight rail would also be part of the system and is many times more efficient than trucking most long haul trucking could be eliminated too and remember that there would be plenty of better jobs for truckers this would take care of up to 10 of emissions decrease air pollution improve public health and cost about 100 billion per year there are two ways to decrease emissions from automobiles which constitute about 17 of emissions in the u s total transportation emissions are 28 in the u s 13 globally the obvious way is to electrify them although we don t know how easy it will be scale up electric car production the politically and culturally more difficult way is to make it unnecessary to rely on a car by reversing sprawl that is recreating the walkable neighborhoods in our population centers or what used to be called citiesand towns except for parts of some cities such as nyc and sf urban areas are now mostly suburbs with a central business district which like industrial districts of yore become deserted at night only 5 of urban areas according to one study are now walkable including being served by transit but 30 of the public would like to live in a walkable community as anyone who tries to live in nyc or sf knows housing costs are out of reach for most of the middle class it is time to acknowledge that the market has failed to provide sufficient affordable housing and that the federal government should create tens of millions of residential units in new apartment buildings and townhouses thus creating main streets and livable city centers with a walkable community construction program costing about 250 billion this would include a regional transit plan for about 100 billion providing each urban area with enough good transit to provide a truly preferable alternative to automobiles the green new deal resolution only mentions making housing affordable i understand the reluctance to suggest that people might prefer urban living to suburbs but this mixes causes and effect suburban sprawl is often a consequence of the lack of affordable housing within the cities themselves very few people relish the idea of a 90 minute commute to work replete with traffic congestion and expensive parking in fact there is increasing evidence to suggest that millennials the next generation of potential car buyers place less priority on owning one everything about these projects should make them so attractive that people will voluntarilywant to participate there is nothing compulsory about any part of a green new deal it s basic marketing talk up the benefits and don t go on the defensive because the green new deal offers so much for so many it is well designed to be successfully marketed to the public the second way to deal with car emissions is to convert the national car fleet to electricity if say one quarter to one half of the population didn t need a car because they lived within walking distance of transit in a walkable neighborhood then we could decrease car ownership by half subsidize the purchase of electric cars and make it much easier to build out an electric car infrastructure such as charging stations for example at 100 billion per year if half the vehicles become electric that s a 20 000 subsidy per vehicle over 20 years such a deal apartments and townhouses in urban areas are much easier to heat and cool which causes 11 of emissions because they share walls unlike single family homes but we could strive to make all buildings energy self sufficient by putting ground source heat pumps underneath retrofits around and solar panels on top of buildings in what might be called a building energy self sufficiency program costing about 200 billion and providing millions of local neighborhood jobs the solar energy could even provide much of the electricity for the electric cars described above a third new interstate an interstate high speed internet system would move the u s back to the forefront of world internet systems in terms of speed reliability and access just as the original new deal created the rural electrification administration to extend electricity to rural areas so the internet interstate could do the same for rural areas and for underserved urban areas this system could serve as the backbone for an expanded role for the federal government in education universal pre k and childcare aid to public schools such as guaranteeing that no classroom size goes over 15 students and free technical school and public college the total might come to about 100 billion per year an infrastructure reconstruction program at about 200 billion could repair and upgrade the infrastructure that is falling apart today much of which was built by the original new deal this would include water systems of which the disaster in flint is a good negative example it also turns out that suburbia is slowly going bankrupt because it is too spread out to provide the tax revenues to maintain its water systems and roads according to the civil engineers at strongtowns org so why bail out a failed economic model because part of the green new deal should be a series of political deals a part of the electorate gets something in return for their support for a green new deal in the case of the suburbs they could get a new infrastructure for a few more decades and so would the cities which use their infrastructure much more efficiently and in return the voters in the suburbs would support a green new deal suburban voters would also be benefitting from subsidized electric cars while urban voters would be getting cheaper housing and better transit another good deal current discussions of the green new deal only briefly mention greening manufacturing but this is another area where the concept can really shine instead of imposing various regulations or giving tax breaks the federal government could initiate a manufacturing clean machinery program at about 100 billion that could radically improve the environment in many ways by replacing much of the machinery of current and new factories in order to implement the following goals first use electricity for heat processes that now directly use fossil fuels that account for 16 of emissions second eliminate as much as possible all air and water pollution what is called zero waste and third and most difficult redesign products so that they can be recycled or reused called cradle to cradle thus allowing us to shut down almost all mining taken in aggregate all of these measures would help slow or even stop the destruction of ecosystems and would improve public health but most importantly for the general population this program would provide a long term market for a revived manufacturing and industrial machinery sector which as the examples of world leading germany and japan shows supports a thriving middle class just as the u s had when it was the leading industrial machinery supplier as seymour melman argued manufacturing gives working people more power corporations receiving this aid could be required to give their employees representation on their boards of directors thus further empowering working people our current agricultural system is broken in many ways the government subsidizes corn which is used for unhealthy processed foods but instead we should be subsidizing the growing of organic crops and livestock pesticides and artificial fertilizers foul our soil food and water which together with belching and farting cows leads the agricultural sector to emit 13 of emissions plus 3 for landfills an agricultural reconstruction program at 100 billion can help farmers convert to organic farming place many farms nearer to cities and towns and set up networks of urban gardens in addition a new civilian conservation corps could do what the original did in the 1930s restore ecosystems destroyed by bad agricultural and mining practices at 50 billion also a national recycling program could be set up to help with the industrial system and recycling compost to farms at 100 billion all of these programs could provide good jobs and support for a green new deal from rural voters but there is one more problem that is even worse than agriculture global deforestation is causing about 17 of global emissions and is destroying critical ecosystems the u s is actually reforesting most of this is being done to expand livestock production mostly for cattle in other words the planet is being intentionally burned down so we can have cheaper burgers the global nature of deforestation is part of the global nature of the climate problem so we need an international agreement perhaps using the paris process as a framework that would create a global green new deal the deal in this case would be that developing countries would protect and let the developed countries help them protect their forests grasslands and other ecosystems in return the developing countries would get clean industrial machinery from developed countries say at 100 billion per year from the u s and more from other countries this would allow poorer countries to industrialize and help their own people while the developed countries industrial machinery sectors would get another boost until the developed countries got up to speed this is what happened when the marshall plan was used to reindustrialize post war europe and japan donald trump and the republicans have been engaged in a decades long campaign to cripple the capacity of the federal government to do anything constructive for the economy the shutdown was only the latest manifestation of what steve bannon called the deconstruction of the administrative state their goal is to free corporations and billionaires from any constraints on their ceaseless desire for more power at a similar moment in the 1930s fdr and the democrats passed the original new deal which directly and indirectly employed millions in order to create infrastructure and improve the lives of most of the society this government led growth continued through lbj s great society until he impaled the federal government on the disaster of the vietnam war the green new deal is the first comprehensive and comprehensible progressive economic proposal that has attracted significant public support since the 1960s for the sake of the planet and our global civilization it is time that we start as aoc put it picking up where we last left off jon rynn is the author of the book manufacturing green prosperity the power to rebuild the american middle class holds a ph d in political science and is a fellow at the cuny institute of urban systems his twitter handle is jonathanrynn and his blog economicreconstruction org contains a longer description of a green new deal and other writings
aliso viejo calif business wire the new home company inc nyse nwhm today announced results for the 2018 fourth quarter and full year fourth quarter 2018 financial results net loss of 16 2 million or 0 80 per diluted share including 30 0 million of pretax inventory and joint venture impairment charges adjusted net income of 5 6 million or 0 28 per diluted share compared to 14 2 million or 0 67 per diluted share for the 2017 fourth quarter total revenue of 229 7 million home sales revenue of 187 3 million deliveries up 35 to 187 backlog increased 25 to 191 units with total dollar value of 207 1 million ending community count up 18 repurchased 379 505 shares of common stock or 2 of outstanding shares for 2 8 million full year 2018 financial results total revenue of 667 6 million home sales revenue of 504 0 million net loss of 14 2 million or 0 69 per diluted share including 30 0 million of pretax inventory and joint venture impairment charges adjusted net income of 7 6 million or 0 37 per diluted share compared to 21 7 million or 1 03 per diluted share for 2017 deliveries up 46 to 498 for the full year net new home orders up 30 repurchased 1 003 116 shares of common stock or 5 of outstanding shares for 8 5 million the company reported a net loss of 16 2 million or 0 80 per diluted share for the 2018 fourth quarter adjusted net income for the period was 5 6 million or 0 28 per diluted share after excluding 10 0 million in pretax inventory impairment charges and 20 0 million of pretax joint venture impairment charges the company s net income for the 2017 fourth quarter was 10 5 million or 0 50 per diluted share adjusted net income for the 2017 period was 14 2 million or 0 67 per diluted share and excluded 3 2 million in income tax charges related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets and 0 9 million in pretax inventory impairment charges in 2018 we took another step forward in implementing our strategy to reach more buyers through more affordably priced communities as evidenced by a 46 increase in deliveries compared to 2017 and a 38 reduction in the average selling price of homes delivered said larry webb chairman and chief executive officer of the new home company however the fourth quarter of 2018 proved to be a challenge as potential buyers in our markets exercised a high degree of caution during what is already a seasonally slow period which resulted in a slower absorption rate in addition we experienced some construction delays at a few communities most notably at our multifamily condominium community in playa vista which negatively impacted our fourth quarter revenues while we continue to have confidence in the fundamental drivers of our business and strategy we acknowledge the operational challenges a slowing housing market poses and have adjusted our outlook accordingly mr webb continued as a result of this revised outlook we took impairment charges at two higher priced communities in southern california and one land development joint venture in northern california we believe these actions were necessary in light of the current demand environment and should allow us to turn through these communities at a more accelerated rate redeploy capital within our existing or new markets and generate cash flow more quickly mr webb concluded we continue to be positive about the long term outlook for our markets and our company and we are taking steps to right size our business and fortify our balance sheet we anticipate that these initiatives will lead to a leaner cost structure reduce debt leverage over time and improve shareholder returns fourth quarter 2018 operating results total revenues for the 2018 fourth quarter were 229 7 million compared to 324 1 million in the prior year period net loss attributable to the company was 16 2 million or 0 80 per diluted share compared to net income of 10 5 million or 0 50 per diluted share in the prior year period the year over year decrease in net income was primarily attributable to a 29 1 million increase in inventory and joint venture impairments a 33 decrease in home sales revenue a 770 basis point decline in home sales gross margin percentage 270 basis point decline before impairments and a 150 basis point increase in selling general and administrative costs as a percentage of home sales revenue these decreases were partially offset by a tax benefit for the 2018 fourth quarter wholly owned projects home sales revenue for the 2018 fourth quarter decreased 33 to 187 3 million compared to 279 9 million in the prior year period the decrease in home sales revenue was driven largely by a 50 decline in average selling price to 1 0 million which was partially offset by a 35 increase in deliveries home sales revenue was also negatively impacted by the delayed closing of several homes in backlog that were scheduled to be delivered in the period the decrease in average selling price was most notable in southern california where over half of our deliveries were from more affordable communities with base pricing of 750 000 or below in addition the 2017 fourth quarter average selling price was heavily influenced by deliveries from two crystal cove luxury communities in newport coast ca where average selling prices exceeded 6 0 million gross margin from home sales for the 2018 fourth quarter was 8 1 and included 10 0 million in inventory impairment charges related to two higher priced communities in southern california homes sales gross margin for the 2017 fourth quarter was 15 8 and included inventory impairment charges of 0 9 million excluding inventory impairments our home sales gross margin was 13 5 for the 2018 fourth quarter as compared to 16 2 in the prior year period the 270 basis point decline was primarily due to higher interest costs included in cost of home sales and to a lesser extent a product mix shift and slightly higher incentives additionally the 2017 fourth quarter also benefited from an 0 8 million warranty reserve adjustment adjusted homebuilding gross margin for the 2018 fourth quarter which excludes interest in cost of home sales and impairments was 17 7 compared to 18 0 in the year ago period our sg a expense ratio as a percentage of home sales revenue for the 2018 fourth quarter was 9 9 versus 8 4 in the prior year period the 150 basis point increase in the sg a rate was primarily due to lower home sales revenue higher co broker commissions and higher sales personnel and advertising costs associated with increased community count partially offsetting these year over year increases was decreased capitalized selling and marketing cost amortization due to the closeout of higher end luxury communities g a costs for the 2018 fourth quarter were also lower as compared to the prior year period primarily due to lower compensation related expenses net new home orders for the 2018 fourth quarter decreased 36 to 69 homes due to a slower monthly sales pace we believe buyer hesitancy stemming from higher interest rates and affordability concerns impacted 2018 fourth quarter demand with the monthly sales absorption rate dropping to 1 2 sales per community compared to 2 3 for the year ago period the company s active selling community count was up 18 as of the end of the 2018 fourth quarter to 20 communities the dollar value of the company s wholly owned backlog at the end of the 2018 fourth quarter was 207 1 million and totaled 191 homes compared to 162 3 million and 153 homes in the prior year period the increase in backlog dollar value resulted primarily from the 25 increase in homes in backlog and to a lesser extent a 2 higher average selling price fee building projects fee building revenue for the 2018 fourth quarter was 42 4 million compared to 44 2 million in the prior year period management fees from joint ventures and construction management fees from third parties increased to 1 6 million for the 2018 fourth quarter as compared to 1 2 million for the 2017 fourth quarter we generated 1 1 million in fee building gross margin for the 2018 fourth quarter versus 1 0 million in the prior year period the higher fee building margin was largely the result of increased construction management fees from third parties partially offset by a 0 3 million decrease in management fees from joint ventures unconsolidated joint ventures jvs the company s share of joint venture loss for the 2018 fourth quarter was 19 9 million down from 0 3 million of income in the prior year period included in the company s loss was a 20 0 million impairment charge related to our investment in a land development joint venture in northern california the impairment was primarily the result of lower anticipated land sales revenue as well as our decision to not incorporate a potential homebuilding component within the existing land development joint venture at this time the following sets forth supplemental information about the company s joint ventures such information is not included in the company s financial data for gaap purposes but is provided for informational purposes joint venture net loss totaled 28 3 million compared to net income of 0 6 million in the prior year period joint venture home sales revenue for the 2018 fourth quarter totaled 52 8 million compared to 38 1 million in the prior year period while joint venture land sales revenue totaled 7 5 million for the 2018 fourth quarter compared to 1 7 million in the prior year period at the end of both the 2018 and 2017 fourth quarters our joint ventures had seven actively selling communities net new home orders from joint ventures for the 2018 fourth quarter decreased 32 to 23 homes the dollar value of homes in backlog from joint ventures at the end of the 2018 fourth quarter was 66 9 million from 76 homes compared to 66 6 million from 80 homes at the end of the 2017 fourth quarter income taxes the company s effective tax rate was 27 8 or 27 5 before discrete items as compared to 51 7 or 37 8 before discrete items in the 2017 fourth quarter the effective tax rate for the 2017 fourth quarter was impacted by a deferred tax asset charge included in discrete items related to federal tax rate cuts from 2017 s tax cuts and jobs act the rate cuts were the primary driver of the year over year decrease in the company s effective tax rate before discrete items partially offset by the loss of certain tax benefits from production activities that were eliminated as a result of tax reform full year 2018 operating results for the full year 2018 the company reported a net loss of 14 2 million or 0 69 per diluted share adjusted net income for the year was 7 6 million or 0 37 per diluted share after

inventory impairment charges total revenues for the year ended december 31 2018 were 667 6 million compared to 751 2 million for the prior year homebuilding revenue declined to 504 0 million primarily from a 38 decrease in the average selling price of homes due to a strategic shift to more affordably priced homes in 2018 partially offset by a 46 increase in the number of homes delivered during the year the year over year decrease in net income was primarily attributable to a 27 8 million increase in inventory and joint venture impairment charges a 380 basis point decline in home sales margin 220 basis point decline before impairments an 11 decrease in total revenues and a 180 basis point increase in selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of home sales revenue these

standing by this is the conference operator welcome to the north american palladium fourth quarter and full year 2018 earnings conference call as a reminder all participants will be in a listen only mode as a reminder this conference call is being recorded i would now like to turn the conference over to erin satterthwaite vice president corporate affairs and communications for north american palladium please go ahead ms satterthwaite erin satterthwaite thanks ariel good morning everyone thank you for joining todayâ s webcast as we discuss our fourth quarter and full year financial results with us today is jim gallagher president and ceo tim hill chief financial officer and david peck vice president exploration following todayâ s presentation as ariel mentioned the lines are going to be opened for q a todaysâ webcast and presentation will also be made available later this afternoon on our website nap com please note that this conference call may include forward looking information which is based on a number of assumptions and actual results could differ materially all mining involve a number of inherent risks as a result we invite you to read and understand the disclaimer please also be advised that dollar amounts are shown in canadian dollars unless otherwise noted and with that i will hand the presentation over to jim gallagher president and ceo jim jim gallagher thank you erin and good morning everyone thank you for joining us on the call today 2018 was a very good year for north american palladium and our lac des iles mine while there are many noteworthy numbers this past year the one i am most proud of is zero zero lost time injuries for the entire year our team of more than 700 employees and contractors at site continue to demonstrate their relentless commitment to safety as of today that record sits at 496 days without a lost time injury something we are all very very proud of topping that off 2018 also had a record underground mine production combined with a record palladium prices which is owing to the best ever financial results in our companyâ s history with underground production reaching over 6700 tons per day in the fourth quarter at a cost of 35 per ton mined we have become one of the largest and lowest cost mines in canada as a result year end adjusted ebitda was 168 million revenue was 400 million and net income came in at almost 120 million palladium production was in the upper range of our guidance at 237 400 payable ounces and this is the highest palladium production since underground mining started in 2006 the graphs on slide 5 demonstrates very well the results we have achieved since the financial restructuring in 2015 with the support of our larger shareholder brookfield we have been on a focused path to fix the infrastructure technical and organizational issues at the sight over the last three years production is up significantly in both tons per day and ounces and our unit costs are down dramatically our demonstrated ability to product at a higher rate and low cost combined with a positive outlook for the price of palladium were key to the publishing of a new lac des iles mine plan in october of last year which had a 9 5 year life at over 12 000 tons per day with our excellent exploration portfolio we are confident that we can add to this plan we will talk to both the underground expansion and the exploration in upcoming slides but first i would like to turn it over to tim hill to present the details of our 2018 financial results tim tim hill thanks jim as mentioned by jim the company posted strong financial results again this quarter revenues for the quarter increased by 35 4 million or 40 over that in q4 2017 year over year revenue increased by 124 4 million to 396 8 million this was a result of increased palladium sales and a continued strengthening in the palladium prices production cost in q4 2018 increased to 45 per ton from 42 per ton in q4 2017 the increase in this unit cost is primarily due to mining cost associated with the sheriff open pit during q4 2018 year over year average production cost decreased to 45 per ton from 57 per ton in 2017 the year over year decrease is primarily a result of a significant reduction in the underground mining cost production cost include surface and underground mining cost milling cost general and administration inventory and all other cost at the lac des iles mine site we can expect this unit cost to increase slightly over the next couple of years as the underground mine transitions to a 12 000 ton per day mining rate and the surface mill feed is gradually replaced with underground ore adjusted ebitda for q4 2018 was 64 2 million an increase of 74 over that in q4 2017 for the year adjusted ebitda was a 167 8 million compared to 86 2 million in 2017 net income for q4 was 77 5 million compared to 14 3 in q4 2017 net income in q4 2018 included a one time adjustment of 43 5 million relating to a recognition of deferred tax assets derived from the companyâ s previously unrecognized income tax losses excluding this one time adjustment net income for q4 2018 increased by 29 5 million to 43 8 million more than twice that in q4 2017 for the year net income increased by 83 1 million over that in 2017 as jim mentioned 119 2 million palladium revenue for inaudible averaged us 1 101 for the year compared to us 876 in 2017 the all in sustaining cost per ounce produced averaged us 690 in 2018 compared to us 694 in the prior year the all in sustaining cost in 2019 is expected to increase to approximately us 800 per ounce payable palladium due to a slight increase in sustaining capita investment and a significant increase in the underground operating development cost related to the underground mine expansion project this operating is an advance of the associated ore production which will be realized in two three years the company invested 11 8 million in capital during q4 2018 compared to 12 7 million for the same period in 2017 capital expenditures in 2018 totaled 66 3 million compared to 62 5 million in 2017 as previously guided capital expenditures are forecasted to increase to 84 million in 2019 with the added investment in the underground mine expansion project exploration expenditures in q4 2018 equaled those in q4 2017 at 3 1 million for the year exploration expenditures increased by 5 4 million totaling 11 2 in 2018 compared to 5 8 in 2017 the company plans to spend 16 million in exploration in 2019 at year end the companyâ s debt was 49 1 million compared to 85 6 million as at december 31 2017 a reduction of 35 6 million for the year as at december 31 2018 the company has liquidity of a 122 million compared to 19 2 million at year end 2017 on december 17 2018 the company entered in to a new us 125 million revolving term credit facility replacing the existing credit facilities the term of the new credit facility is five years a portion of the proceeds of the initial draw down under the new credit facility was used to repay the outstanding senior secured term loan of us 35 million to brookfield business partners as well as the outstanding balance from the previous revolving credit facility the companyâ s liquidity at year end 2018 includes us 80 million available under its credit facility as at december 31 2018 the company had 27 million drawn on a credit facility plus 17 8 million utilized for letters of credit on december 24 2018 the company closed a non brokered private placement at 714 257 common shares in relation to a flow through equity offering gross proceeds to the company were approximately 10 million all proceeds from the sale of the flow through shares will be used to incur eligible canadian exploration expenses under the companyâ s green field exploration program overall 2018 was a good year for north american palladium the company is generating cash investment capital and exploration for the future and strengthening the balance sheet by reducing debt given consideration to the companyâ s cash flow and capital allocation alternatives including the previously mentioned underground mine expansion project and given the companyâ s confidence and continued strong financial performance naps board of directors has announced a quarterly dividend of 0 03 per common shares to shareholders on record on march 01 2019 next jim will discuss the underground expansion project underway at the lac des iles mine jim jim gallagher thanks tim so now iâ d like to talk to our underground expansion this past call we disclosed our decision to take the underground mine to 12 000 tons a day which will be our full mill production at that time as you can see from the graph on slide 14 our production rate is rising to 12 000 tons a day in the next 2 5 years there are some details i want to explain about the expansion project based on some of the questions i have received this is an extremely low cost mine expansion project and thatâ s primarily because as shown in the slide we are actually expanding back up in to the old part of the upper mine which we have previously mined but left behind a large lower grade resource we are now quite confident that if we mine this from underground at a high rate at a better grade than with an overall better business case while also capturing resources that were not included in the previous open pit pushback plan in each of the next two years weâ re going to spend approximately 80 million of capital half of which will be designated as project capital for this expansion our particular focus is there will be central zone which is shown in the diagram with the green development the zone was mined off previously but had a much higher cut off rate over 50 of the reserves of almost 20 million tons in the upper part of the mine are contained in the roby zone and the vast majority of the development and infrastructure is already in place the blue lines in the diagram show the satellite zones that weâ re now able to pick up because of the shared infrastructure in the upper part of the mine so the bottom line this is a very low cost very quick expansion simply because a significant part of the development is already in place we have already started this project both with our own crews and with development contractors we started at the beginning of this year in addition to expanding our current mine we continue to develop our exploration portfolio the number of targets are demonstrating promise and with iâ ll hand it over to dave peck our vice president exploration dave dave peck thanks jim as jim mentioned exploration expenditures were 3 1 million for the fourth quarter of last year and 11 2 million in total for 2018 this is a significant increase over the money spent in 2017 of approximately million this increase reflects a major investment and surplus exploration on the eastern part of the mine property and the addition of the sunday lake project to our exploration portfolio the comprehensive update on our 2018 exploration results from lac des iles was provide earlier in the week in the news release we continue to focus our exploration efforts on finding new resources at ldi last year the company completed approximately 12 000 meters and 29 underground exploration holes a majority of these were designed to extend our convert resources in the southern part of the offset zone in the fourth quarter we focused on revising our geological models and preparing new underground drill targets for 2019 this year we expect to complete a new exploration drift that will provide critical new drill platforms for most of our top ranked underground exploration targets next slide shows our plans for surface drilling a total 7 000 meters and 18 holes were completed from surface drilling in the fourth quarter and a total of 37 surface exploration drill holes and almost 20 000 meters were completed last year this includes both 2 000 at the legris lake approximately 5600 meters at sunday lake and nearly 12 000 meters at ldi in the fourth quarter surface drilling was limited to completing two sensitive holes that will provide the first two complete geological cross section across a highly perspective eastern part of the mine property these sections will be critical in maximizing the value at a significant amount of new geophysical data that was acquired in the last few months of 2018 we are continuing to receive an assess results from these surveys this year we plan to test all of the new geophysical targets while conducting step out drilling as a follow up to the positive drilling results received from the creek zone and baker zone last year in the fourth quarter we completed a new geophysical survey at sunday lake that has identified several conductor features along the base of the intrusion we started drilling these targets in january and then in addition to the over 10 000 meters of drilling weâ ve laid out we plan to complete downhole geophysical service before we wrap up this program in april we reassessed and re ranked all of our greenfield exploration properties within the lac des iles mine area and have designed a new series of geophysical surveys that we started in january these surveys will be used to select drill targets for 2020 iâ ll now return the call back to jim jim gallagher thanks dave further underscoring the companyâ s confidence in its future are the record palladium prices that we have seen recently and our belief that the strong prices will continue for several years to come there are a number of factors contributing to the rising price of palladium which currently sits at almost us 1400 per ounce as most of you are aware 80 of palladium produced ends up in catalytic convertors in automotive gasoline engines some of the significant factors that are contributing to the drilling palladium demand include the growth of hybrid vehicles the electrification is a positive for the palladium story and not everyone has seen it that way currently the biggest part of the automobile electrification story is hybrids as oppose to pure battery electrics hybrids contain higher loadings of palladium due to the on off cycle nature of the engines catalytic convertors work best when they run hot and that is not the operating cycle for a hybrid engine to accommodate for this higher palladium holdings are used another significant factor is lower diesel sales due to the diesel gate scandal with volkswagen and others diesel engines which have platinum based convertors are being replaced with gasoline engines at a high rate in europe and other parts of the world driving more palladium demand the growth of the suv and the truck market primarily in north america is also boosting demand larger engines simply require larger palladium holdings sustained growth of automobile sales around the world is another key factor although auto sales did flatten out in the last quarter of last year year on year over the last decade weâ ve seen at least a 2 growth driven by mostly by asian countries in particularly china but most significantly impacting our recent rise in prices are heightened emission standards globally a good example of this is the real driving emission standards that are being introduced in europe and in china and the next slide details that real driving emissions or rde testing will be part of mandatory car emissions measurement in the second half of 2019 in europe and china rde requires vehicles to undergo outdoor driving tests under various real world conditions and will be carried out in addition to existing lab based measurement tire palladium holdings are required to meet these higher emission standards in these more challenging trials in addition tests have shown that platinum does not perform as well as palladium under conditions such as these limiting the likelihood of a significant substitution giving us confidence that this strong palladium demand will continue for the foreseeable future another part of the story is the supply side this is a story of flat supply picture moving forward with some risk first the supply is inelastic given that the vast majority over 90 of the worldâ s production comes as a byproduct of other metals primarily nickel and copper mining in russia and platinum mining in south africa secondly there is the risk introduced by the jurisdictions where palladium is mined south africa is the highest risk area where there are challenges in the industry as a whole and particularly with the current economics of the platinum mines thirdly driving the price of palladium is the reduction in on ground inventory evidence of the fundamental change in the palladium market is demonstrated in this slide on page 25 the green line demonstrates palladium holdings in stock piles and etfs against the price as you can see over the last decade there has been a very strong correlation to investor interest in to purchasing and holding palladium and etfs or other above ground stocks in the price a very good correlation that changed early in 2017 when the above ground holdings began to fall off dramatically and continued to climb to the current low levels as prices have continued to rise this is really demonstrating the fundamental market deficit where supplies are extremely tight and there is very little product left available in inventory stock piles to supplement the market the price currently is being driven by fundamental supply demand issues not investor speculations in closing 2018 was a very solid year for us it is a reflection of the work that the team has done and that we continue to do to build a strong foundation in support of our long term vision for the company looking ahead our production where payable palladium ounces for 2019 are between 220 and 230 ounces and then average all in sustaining cost of us 785 to us 815 per ounce we are confident in our operational performance and our mine expansion plan moving forward we are confident in the fundamentals of the palladium market and we believe that 2019 and beyond will continue to be quite positive a reflection of this confidence is the boardâ s decision to begin payments of a quarterly dividend returning some capital back to our shareholders thank you very much for your time today iâ ll turn it back to the operator question and answer session operator your first question comes from derek macpherson of red cloud klondike strike derek macpherson my question relates to the dividend policy and obviously itâ s a great sign of confidence that you guys have declared that 0 03 dividend what do you see is the special dividend policy going forward obviously based on your feasibility study thereâ s a pretty good free cash flow and a strong palladium market what was sort of the yield going forward beyond this quarter on that jim gallagher i think iâ ll answer that and we literally just completed the board meeting yesterday so the dividend is really relatively modest at this point in time and i think the board will reevaluate that as we move forward as most of you are aware we were nearly a bankrupt company only three years ago and so i think this is a tremendous vote of confidence by the board everyone is confident in these fundamentals and then the operation moving forward so this is modest first step iâ m not going to predict what the policy will be moving forward but there is a commitment to see some capital returned to investors we are also interested in attracting perhaps a larger group of investor and so thatâ s why the decision was taken at this time and it will be reviewed obviously on an ongoing basis by the board operator our next question comes from of unidentified analyst a couple of questions firstly jim may be just give us some background on with the wholesaling situation in brazil what your tailing plans how you manage your tailing plans and what your plans are over the next say five or more years jim gallagher thanks dan and i was very prepared for that question so very unfortunate what has happened in brazil and unfortunately it has repeated itself in brazil just recently and the brazil scenario and the decisions that has taken since have tainted tailings management and in particular our former tailings management called upstream raising in a very negative light we donâ t currently use upstream raising however our plans are to use a variation of that or a hybrid version of upstream raising over the next several years and so i want to use an example an analogy a few years ago this is true story there were a number of building collapses in pakistan and in one in particular got a lot of press in canada simply because one of the large retailers was buying clothing from what was apparently a bit of sweat factory but because of a couple of buildings 20 storey buildings in pakistan collapsed the world did not stop building 20 storey buildings and the same is true and should be true for tailings and upstream raising if you properly engineer it properly construct it and properly maintain it you will not have problems with your tailings dams our design relative to the design as we understand it that was in place is made of different material our base dams which are all rock core dams and we will be building upstream raisings on top of the existing footprint of tailing dams are solid rock core dams that was not the case in brazil our upstream raising will be built out of a mix of rock and other material the tailings dams in brazil were actually built out of tailings themselves the slope of our dams will be much much flatter the height will be much much shorter and the factor of safety as we understand it will be significantly higher the other critical factor here is that the failures that happened in brazil both of them and the mount polley disaster in british columbia could not have happened to the same extent if there wasnâ t significant amounts of water being held in their tailings dams you could not possibly get that several kilometer downstream impact without that water our tailings design today and in the future are designed to be self draining and not containing any significant amounts of water thatâ s fundamental to the design even in a long term closure their designs will be sloped and again self draining so that without any real maintenance they will not hold water so itâ s just fundamentally different and i just want to repeat in the world of engineering engineer it right construct it right managed appropriately and you should not have any problems and thatâ s certainly what weâ re doing and key to that over the last several years and after the mount polley and then the samarco disaster in 2015 in brazil i took the decision to introduce an independent tailings review board this is three fully independent technical experts from around the world actually including one south african individual who oversee our design engineer and have bought an extra level of caution expertise and guidance to what we do so weâ re quite confident moving forward that we will not have problems and i sleep better at night because of all of that so thanks for asking that question dan unidentified analyst jim in terms of your production cost going up in â 19 and â 20 and i guess when i look at your technical report youâ re heavy in capex the next two years this year and next year should we see those all in sustaining cost come down in 2021 jim gallagher thatâ s correct and i donâ t know if tim can remember the numbers or the study better than i do at this point tim do you want to comment on that tim hill yes i believe iâ m going by memory dan because i havenâ t got it in front of me but yes it does go up over the next two years as we increase our underground operating development for the mine expansion i believe it comes down to us 700 per ounce or there about for â 21 going forward if iâ m not mistaken unidentified analyst last question in terms if you have a lot of tax losses is there anything thatâ s going to kick in based on your plan the next two or three years in terms of tax reserve or provincial royalties tim hill currently we are subject to ontario mining tax so we really donâ t pay royalty we do have this tax this deferred tax that we recognize on our balance sheet 43 5 million so that will offset taxes over the year or maybe 18 to 24 months after that time weâ ll be fully taxable going forward unidentified analyst youâ ve used all your federal losses by that time tim hill thatâ s correct jim gallagher that really it depends on the price but if the price stays where it currently is weâ ll burn through those tax losses quickly but thatâ s actually a pretty good thing operator our next question comes from john bender of matthew bender and company holdings ltd john bender the free float is 8 and i was curious what steps are you taking to make it profitable to institutional investors and what are the intentions of brookfield asset management they are a private equity firm they indicated that they intend to exit at some point iâ d be just curious to know is there a significant overhand that we might be expecting or in fact are you considering increasing the free float gradually to make the share more marketable to the two institutional investors jim gallagher so the simple answer is yes brookfieldâ s intention from the day that they made their first investment would be when they see an appropriate return that they would start obviously capitalizing on their investment and start selling down their position so that really has never changed i think if you were following the company last year we actually did have a declared process where brookfield was looking to sell a portion or even all of the company and a quick summary we had lots of activity we never had the right author come forward and part of the fundamental to that was not everybody was buying completely in to where the palladium market was likely going to end up so we officially cancelled that process formally at the end of last year however youâ re absolutely right brookfield and we recognize that to get more trading and more activity and more interest in the stock we need much more float so that is being evaluated its constantly been evaluated and brookfield will consider an opportunity to put more shares back in to the market and sell off a portion perhaps through the course of this year so it is something that is potential and is potentially likely thereâ s no formal process underway right now but certainly we are going to be engaging investors and weâ ll be at the bmo conference we are engaging investors in toronto and what weâ re doing otherwise and weâ ll be gauging the publicâ s interest perhaps in acquiring some of our brookfieldâ s position john bender and have you had interest from research houses who might consider following north american palladium jim gallagher we have had some and without declaring who we may get some coverage in the near future but the biggest holdback to that of course is the small float and multi analysts are reluctant because as you would be aware itâ s hard to recommend a stock where actually a fairly small amount of buying could dramatically impact the price and thatâ s a reality when we have a small float of less than 8 quite frankly in our stock so i think we need to get more float in order to get better analyst and coverage so itâ s something where the board brookfield and management is very aware and weâ re definitely with the heightened interest that has come i would say with the fact that palladium hit and then surpassed the price of gold i think it will be a different climate for us this year operator this concludes both the question and answer session and todayâ s conference call you may disconnect your lines thank you for participating and have a pleasant day

by it has been more than nine years since i resigned in protest over the escalation of the afghan war from my position as a political officer with the us state department in afghanistan it had been my third time to war along with several years of working in positions effecting war policy in washington dc with the department of defense dod and the state department my resignation in 2009 was not taken lightly by my superiors and my reasons for opposing president obama s surge in afghanistan found support amongst both military officers and civilian officials at senior levels in kabul and washington i was repeatedly asked not to resign and was offered a more senior position within the state department richard holbrooke then the president s appointed representative for afghanistan and pakistan told me he agreed with 95 of what i had written and asked me to join his staff while the us ambassador karl eikenberry told me my analysis was one of the best he had encountered and stated he would write an introduction endorsing my resignation letter if i remained with the us embassy in afghanistan for the remainder of my tour in conversation with the us deputy ambassador to afghanistan he agreed the war was not just unwinnable but also corrupt and stated he would not let his children serve in such a war further support for my views was provided by my counterparts who were serving as political officers in the most violent parts of afghanistan kandahar helmand kunar nuristan and oruzgan provinces these men and women made clear their agreement with my assessment and my resignation the support from the military was equally effusive and genuine often such support included apologies along the lines of i d like to resign too but i ve got kids heading to college in a few years the golden handcuffs are an incredibly instrumental and integral aspect of the us empire s infrastructure when i asked karen deyoung the washington post correspondent who wrote the front page above the fold story on my resignation for the post why she wrote such a piece about me she replied she could not find anyone at the pentagon state department or white house who disagreed with me i relate the above not to cheerlead for myself although the sadness and despondency from witnessing the wars up close and from afar and their cruel constant murder does at times necessitate such crutches for me but to relay my own personal observation of the great lie of war in action the ability of the machine of war to propel itself forward even when those most intimate with the war those most responsible for it and without whose support and effort the war could not continue carry on the war whilst knowing and living the lie full well nearly almost a decade after my resignation there are reports of a possible peace deal in the making for afghanistan what i recognize so clearly and sickeningly just as my mind and my soul can recall the bright scarlet red of fresh arterial blood that dulls in contact with dust and cloth or the clay like frozen set jaw of a dead young man whether he have been called an afghan american or iraqi are the same lies of the war that were so skillfully and effectively utilized by politicians generals and the media to escalate the war in 2009 now being recirculated to defeat any current attempts for peace sacrifice does not confer sanctity when president obama entered office in 2009 less than 30 000 us troops were in afghanistan within a year and a half that number would reach100 000 us military personnel along with 30 000 nato soldiers from europe and over 100 000 private contractors since 2001 more than 2400 us service members have been killed in afghanistan nearly 1800 of them since 2009 european armies have had more than 1100 soldiers killed and more than1700 contractors have been killed while performing jobs that in previous wars would have been done by us soldiers tens of thousands have been physically wounded while hundreds of thousands suffer from traumatic brain injuries post traumatic stress disorder ptsd moral injury depression substance abuse and other hidden wounds of war these hidden wounds have very real consequences the us department of veterans affairs reports young men and women who have served in afghanistan and iraq a great many of them have served multiple deployments to both wars have suicide rates six times higher than their civilian peers while infantry units those that have performed the most killing and dying have been seen to have suicide rates fourteen times higher than young civilian men their own age in real numbers that means since 2001 likely more than 9 000 us veterans who have served in afghanistan and iraq have been lost to suicide after returning home the numbers of afghans who have been killed are truly unknown the united nations reporting on civilian casualties which only began in 2009 reports tens of thousands killed with nearly each year since 2009 showing an increase in civilian dead and wounded a monstrous and grievous accomplishment of annual record upon record unama itself cautions its numbers should be understood to be a minimum or base level due to unama s methodology assessments of the total dead in afghanistan over the last seventeen years put total dead at more than 100 000 civilians although most who are familiar with war including myself are quick to say that is a conservative or low end estimate for example jonathan steele has estimated more than 20 000 afghans died as a result of the us bombings in the first four months of us military action following 9 11 at least one million afghans are internally displaced while afghans make up the second largest nationality of the largest refugee population the world has known since world war two with millions living in camps in iran and pakistan or claiming asylum in europe of course the afghan war did not begin in 2001 but began more than forty years ago and not with the soviet union s invasion but with an internal civil war that saw maybe as many 100 000 dead before the soviets invaded us support to afghanistan s mujaheddin the grandfathers of the young men we are fighting today in afghanistan began six months prior to the soviet invasion over forty years of war have completely devastated the people and land of afghanistan as a consequence of the violence afghan society is devastated by ptsd and drug use the countryside has been denuded and deforested resulting in agricultural troubles and water shortages and no industry exists besides the illicit drug trade which despite billions of us dollars spent yields record poppy crops and illicit narcotics exports nearly every year 2018 was an exception due to drought there is a desperate sunk cost argument that haunts all wars that are lost and unworthy as it is more often than not it is those who have not experienced the pain and the destruction of the war who demand more blood and more sacrifice turn on fox news or open the washington post and this will be apparent what makes such an argument even more mean and craven is these deaths ones that need not be lost in vain as it is typically phrased are forever tied and bound by the lies of the war making these deaths eternally ignoble and worthless the dead never to be heroes despite the exaggerations of eulogies bordering often on hagiography but only to be future less victims of the greed and egos that advance and maintain the war even a losing war makes money the total financial costs to the us in direct spending on the war in afghanistan are approaching one trillion dollars peak spending of the war reached more than 100 billion a year and currently runs between 40 and 50 billion a year total costs of all the wars the us has been sending its young men and women to kill and be killed in since 2001 are said to be 6 trillion and this is just for the wars that 6 trillion figure does not include the regular or usual costs of running the military which is now over 600 billion a year or the hundreds of billions of dollars spent on veterans the intelligence agencies nuclear weapons the state department or homeland security this staggering amount may perhaps best be understood by knowing that in interest and debt payments alone the us has spent more than 700 billion on the wars in 17 years regarding overall national security spending this year the us will spend hundreds of billions of dollars as it does each year on debt payments due to past spending on wars the military intelligence veterans etc if you compare washington dc and its suburbs to how they psychically existed prior to 9 11 you will most assuredly note the physical impact the wars and the benefitting military industrial complex has had on the city and its suburbs the pentagon is not confined to that five sided building alongside interstate 395 but rather stretches for miles along the potomac river from the key bridge in rosslyn south through arlington and extending past ronald reagan national airport into alexandria in office building after office building are tens and tens of thousands of men and women working for war likewise in the suburbs particularly west along interstate 66 or north along the baltimore washington highway hundreds of buildings exist to serve the war machine it s not just the defense industry or the contracting firms but also the banks hotels restaurants apartment complexes high rise condominiums and near million dollar mcmansions that have risen to serve and support the pentagon and its wars within these buildings are hundreds of thousands of men and women the majority not wearing a uniform but working for a contracting firm or defense corporation who often make salaries in the high five or six figures when i did such work in 2008 as a single 35 year old who s seemingly only qualification was that i had been a captain in the marines my salary and benefits came close to 120 000 when i joined the state department in 2009 i didn t take a pay cut while an entry level position with that same dod contracting company the requirements of which were to simply possess a secret level security clearance and to know microsoft office was more than 80 000 as you can see it is very easy to slip into those golden handcuffs what this calculates to and remember aside from national and homeland security the federal government has decreased non defense discretionary spending in real terms since 2001 is that the washington dc metro area is the wealthiest part of the country and has been for a number of years beginning after these unending wars and their mass profits began while you can argue correlation is not causation the symbiotic nature cannot be denied between the unending nature of the wars and the massive increase in wealth for washington dc and its people and organs observe the loud protestation by the us senate towards the idea of the us wars in afghanistan and syria ending to get a glimpse of the fear that exists in washington and within the war machine towards just the idea or concept of peace if you want to understand why these wars continue and why these lies persist then you must understand the money that sustains and underlies both the war and its lies there have not been hard won gains by the us military in afghanistan for all these costs particularly the bloody expenditure of lives the war remains the same as it was in 2009 neither side can win and neither side will surrender us proclamations of military success and hard won gains are specious and are just one of the ever present lies of war reviewing department of defense data on the war since 2009shows the taliban never weakened in strength at any time as us and nato and then afghan forces increased in number taliban strength and attacks increased commensurately roadside bombs mortar and rocket attacks assassinations etc by nearly every metric the taliban gained in strength and capability every year since president obama s surge at some point if the us had achieved military success over the taliban the taliban s ability to operate on the battlefield should have been impacted and their ability to launch attacks limited but the true impact of the presence of increased us nato and afghan government forces was to add purpose and motivation to a predominately anti occupation rural pashtun insurgency if one looks at us casualty data us casualties increased as more us troops arrived which is what one would expect as more troops go into combat more will be killed and wounded however against the assurances of the military and civilian experts in washington dc who promoted the counter insurgency doctrine whose adherents in many ways honestly resemble cult members casualties never decreased due to battlefield success casualties only decreased as a result of a decrease in us presence so as us troops went into a valley or village they met resistance and took casualties and that combat and those casualties never stopped the taliban and its supporters were never defeated no area was ever truly pacified subdued or came over to the side of the us and afghan government in a memorable passage of bob woodward s book obama s wars a skeptical president obama noted this reality and pushed back on his generals and advisors wherever us troops arrived in afghanistan they were met with a resistance that was never fully defeated quieted possibly for a limited amount of time but never defeated as i visited small and large bases in 2009 us army officers told me in both eastern and southern afghanistan the only land they held was the land that was covered by their machine guns and mortars the insurgency controlled the land and the population in many places it was relayed to me that the taliban welcomed the presence of us troops because with the presence of the us troops came millions of dollars in us military and usaid spending spending that went right into the pockets of the taliban this lack of control of the land and population remained true for the duration of us and nato forces in their positions as an occupation force and remains true for the afghan government forces which continue to be nearly in total non pashtun and serve as occupation force of outsiders themselves one example of many i can give of how the afghan security forces are seen as outsiders and occupiers in southern and eastern afghanistan and other pashtun parts of the country is of the seven senior afghan army officers in zabul province only 2 spoke pashto and could communicate with the near 100 pashtun population ana did not stand for the afghan national army but rather for the army of the northern alliance the force the taliban was fighting in 2001 and who the us put into power after overthrowing the taliban while it was repeated year after year authoritatively to congress that the ana was ethnically and regionally representative of afghanistan s population the truth is only about 4 of the afghan national army and police forces were composed of southern pashtuns the people from whom the taliban received the base of their support and the part of afghanistan were the fighting has been the worst i know of no evidence that shows the afghan army is any more representative of the pashtun population now as it has been over the last seventeen years as us and nato forces withdrew from the fighting in 2013 and 2014 the taliban turned their focus on the afghan security forces more than 45 000 afghan soldiers and police have been killed since 2014 while last fall it was reported fighting has intensified so that nearly 60 afghan soldiers and police are killed each day these deaths primarily come not against an outside enemy or groups of revolutionary religious fanatics but mainly against a taliban that is composed of locally organized and recruited insurgent forces who are fighting against foreign occupation and a corrupt predatory and non representative government that us european and afghan troops have died and been wounded in the hundreds of thousands in a civil war has been well understood by the us military and intelligence agencies even if it has been ignored by the us politicians and media the same was true of iraq of course as well as nearly any of the fourteen countries the us has sent its young men and women to kill and be killed in the people we are fighting are fighting us because we are occupying their countries and supporting violent repressive and corrupt governments when i was in kabul members of the us embassy located in the center of kabul behind ring after ring of checkpoints and concrete walls were not allowed to cross the street to the usaid compound on the other side of the road because it was not safe enough we had to walk beneath the street through a tunnel now members of the us embassy can not even travel via armored vehicles to the airport just a couple of miles away but must travel by helicopter naturally via a privately contracted helicopter force and this is in kabul not in the rural provinces where the taliban have their base of support the only success achieved by the us military since the obama surge has been the expansion of the war itself and the accompanying logistical accomplishment of moving so many people machines and stuff into and out of a mountainous and rural landlocked nation with a demolished infrastructure a result of the decades of fighting supported or taken part in by the us for nearly all of the four decades of war and again instigated by the us before the soviet union invaded the idea of military success and hard won gains has been nothing but craven and homicidal war propaganda trumpeted by us generals and the world s largest public relations operation and bleated obediently by politicians and shamefully journalists the pentagon spends almost 5 billion a year on recruiting public relations and psychological operations by comparison the largest public relations company in the world had annual fees for all of its clients of less than 900 million the us has not brought progress to afghanistan like a diseased onion claims the us has brought progress to afghanistan constitute another layer of the great lie of war as the us special inspector general for afghanistan reconstruction sigar has shown in report after report the more than 130 billion spent on reconstruction in afghanistan more than what the us spent on the marshall plan to rebuild europe after world war two in inflation adjusted dollars has been a huge bust billions of dollars in cash have been overtly stolen by afghan government officials and cronies in 2012 more than 4 5 billion in cash was taken directly out of the airport in kabul while famously in 2009 shortly after i resigned from my position in afghanistan afghanistan s vice president landed in dubai with more than 50 million in cash in his luggage 74 us and nato troops died that month the claims of millions of school children now attending school including millions of girls have been exposed to just be made up numbers the great majority of schools and healthcare centers that were supposedly built as much as maybe 80 of them don t exist can t be found or are empty while the triumphant claim that life expectancy for afghans increased by twenty years has shown to be in the words of the sigar director john sopko baloney similarly the idea afghan women are better off now than under the taliban exists more in public relations statements than it does in reality for many afghan women while the lives of women under taliban rule was horrific and in some places in afghanistan such as parts of kabul women have experienced much better lives the truth is the attitudes and actions towards women of many of the men the us put and kept in power after 2001 were and are not much different than the taliban many of the rules the taliban enforced against women such as the requirement to wear a head to toe burqa had been put in place by the misogynist leaders of the groups the taliban were fighting in the 1990s again the people the us put into power after 2001 under the karzai and ghani administrations women have committed mass numbers of suicides including through self immolation in areas controlled by the afghan government due to laws put in place by the government including laws allowing men to legally rape their wives and by a society were nearly 90 of afghan women experience domestic violence ultimately it is women who suffer the most in war and all the slogans put forth by the war s apologists about how much they care about women can not overcome the truth that millions of afghan women must deal with the consequences actual or potential of the hot iron lead and metal that tears apart the flesh and lives of their children if the generals spokespeople and think tank experts almost all of whom are funded directly or indirectly by the defense industry were so interested in the welfare of women in afghanistan they would be working to end the violence that terrorizes ruins and ends the lives of those women and their children and prohibits any development or progress including advancements in women s rights from occurring those we have put and kept in power in afghanistan constitute a brutal kleptocracy besides the pentagon and the defense companies and al qaeda and isis the only other people who have benefited from the wars since 2001 have been the corrupt leaders we have put and kept in power in places like afghanistan every afghan election has been thoroughly fraudulent and riddled with vote rigging and ballot theft on a mass scale the last presidential election in 2014 was so crooked that an extra constitutional position of co president was created to prevent a civil war erupting amongst the afghan constituencies that support the government while in the most recent parliamentary elections more than three months ago now the irregularities were so blatant results still have not been released i personally witnessed the 2009 afghan presidential election tens of thousands of us and nato troops were rushed to afghanistan prior to the election to ensure a free and fair contest in the late spring and summer prior to those elections hundreds of them died and thousands more were wounded many of them permanently how many thousands of afghans died we will never know the pashtun people in southern and eastern afghanistan just as the sunni iraqis did in 2004 another electoral charade i was present for boycotted the election although us officials would say they did not vote because of security concerns i ended up that day at an afghan army base where an unauthorized polling location had been opened at the last minute just one of many irregularities that day the boxes were stuffed by obedient soldiers my report of this back to the embassy in kabul was disregarded because this was not an official voting location so such ballot stuffing did not count the logic that supports many of the lies of the war would be impossible to make up if such logic and its realizations did not actually exist later that day i would overhear through my translator the afghan brigade commander for the province telephone a subordinate and order his soldiers to conduct the same ballot stuffing the vote theft was brazen and the dead numbered in the thousands and the same has occurred for every election and every year of our occupation in afghanistan meanwhile the afghan government and military have been the key figures in the afghan drug trade not just the taliban indeed much of the fighting over the last many years in places like helmand province can be attributed to a battle for control over the vast tracts of poppy fields the drug trade is not confined to low or local levels of the military and the police but has extended and continues to extend to the most senior men in government and this has been evident throughout the duration of our occupation of afghanistan when i was in afghanistan the biggest drug baron in southern afghanistan was president karzai s brother ahmed wali karzai awk the biggest in eastern afghanistan was the governor of nangahar province gul agha sherzai in the north various warlords the us worked with ran the drug trade including the governor of balkh province atta mohammad noor and in kabul mohammed qasim marshall fahim for whom the afghan military officers training academy is now named and who was the afghan vice president was famous for using afghan military aircraft to transport drugs out of afghanistan sherzai now the minister of border and tribal affairs and noor still control their drug fiefdoms while awk and fahim are dead but have been replaced by drug syndicates within the afghan government the detailing of the criminality and gangsterism of the afghan government is endless maybe best described by the general rashid dostum president ghani s vice president who is accused of massive war crimes in the years following 9 11 and who was forced to flee afghanistan in 2017 after kidnapping and raping a political opponent sherzai serves as a good case study for the insanity of the us war in afghanistan in the early 1990s sherzai ruled as a warlord governor in kandahar his barbaric rule can be counted as one of the defining factors in the rise of the taliban after 1994 the taliban received a great deal of popular support as an antidote to the murder rape and banditry of the warlords in 2001 after the us ousted the taliban the us put sherzai back in power in kandahar the very man who s brutality helped create the taliban we placed back in power sherzai s rule was again murderous and was now supplemented by american soldiers and money sarah chayes the former npr correspondent gives a heartbreaking detailing of sherzai s rule in her masterful the punishment of virtue sherzai would follow on his rule in kandahar with time in kabul as the minister of housing and minister of public works before becoming governor of economically important nangahar province on the pakistan border nangahar along with kandahar had traditionally been a large source of poppy production for the narcotics trade at this time when i met him sherzai s corruption and use of torture and violence as well as his keeping of dancing boys young slaves used for sexual pleasure and dominance was well known by the us government this however was shrugged off in kabul and washington with cavalier and smug excuses that war is a dirty business sherzai who was invited and attended barack obama s inauguration in 2009 as an official guest cultivated a romanticized following among officials within the state department and us embassy who adoringly and reverentially viewed him as a tony soprano like figure he was the very embodiment of the dark side dick cheney had advocating embracing sherzai who resided in the former summer palace of the afghan kings in jalalabad was indeed charming and gracious i met him twice but he knew full well the manipulation and control he had over the us government there was a poppy eradication program in place in 2009 one of many programs that have constituted the nearly 10 billion spent on drug eradication efforts in afghanistan the cost has been more than just financial one of my friends a fellow company commander in the marine corps michael weston was killed in afghanistan while posted there as a dea agent this program in particular offered 10 million in cash to governors who succeeded in eradicating a certain level of poppy crop sherzai through his family and due to his lingering power in kandahar had significant poppy field holdings and drug trade involvement in southern afghanistan now with the backing of the afghan and us governments and the dea sherzai was able to muscle his competition in eastern afghanistan those who wanted to cooperate with him in their poppy production and drug trafficking could survive those who did not want to pay him had their fields eradicated utilizing afghan and us resources sherzai could co opt or destroy his competition and was rewarded for doing so with 10 million courtesy of us taxpayers i am quite certain this happened multiple years to make the claim that we are supporting the guys in the white hats in afghanistan even more criminally ludicrous the afghan security forces be it the army the police or the intelligence services consistently torture prisoners as a matter of routine practice in addition to being themselves involved in the drug trade this has unsurprisingly received not very much attention from the us congress and press what has received attention but for which little has been done except for the us issuing actual and de facto waivers to the government of afghanistan and its security forces for the leahy amendment and child soldiers prevention act has been the widespread keeping of child sex slaves by afghan military and police officers some us military personnel so disgusted by the overt keeping of child sex slaves took matters into their own hands only to be relieved of command and forced out of the military for us generals and the congress afghan military and police officers keeping child sex slaves is entirely worth the end purposes of the good war whatever end purposes those may be as vonnegut said so it goes afghanistan as a necessary safe haven for another 9 11 is a myth the most fervent argument against peace the one that has carried forth the us war in afghanistan from its start in 2001 has been that a military presence and the requisite massive land war is necessary to prevent another 9 11 how quick are the facts of 9 11 and al qaeda forgotten and how easily jettisoned is critical thought when this argument is offered and accepted first none of the hijackers involved in the september 11 attacks were afghans nor was anyone involved in the planning or logistics more so the attacks were led and planned primarily in pakistan and germany training and planning did occur in camps in afghanistan but khaled sheik mohammad ksm the mastermind of the attacks was based in pakistan and that is where he did the majority of his planning and training while the leadership of the hijackers lived and planned in hamburg germany in what was known as the kitchen of the september 11 operation ksm was captured in rawalpindi pakistan the same town as the pakistani military headquarters osama bin laden was of course killed in abbottabad the same town as the pakistani military academy the man responsible for the logistics of the 9 11 operation never left germany until a few days before the attacks additional planning and preparations took place in malaysia spain and possibly dubai of course the most important safe havens for the hijackers were the us flight schools and martial arts gyms they attended while in the us it s important to remember that some of the attackers were in the us for more than 18 months before the 9 11 attacks and that it seems all of the attackers spent more time in the us than they did in afghanistan or pakistan not that it matters much where the attackers planned and trained as planning and training for these types of attacks requires nothing more than an apartment hotel room or basement understanding these attacks and what actually goes into them exposes the idea of the necessity of safe havens as nothing more than a necessary myth to propagate the global war on terror or as the pentagon likes to call it the long war which along with the greater middle east also now includes russia and china in us war plans none of the arguments for war in afghanistan to prevent another 9 11 speak of the well defined role of saudi arabia and possibly dubai in financing and facilitating the attacks without the saudi involvement in particular the attacks would have been impossible those who utilize 9 11 to fear monger in an attempt to silence critics of the war or proponents of peace brazenly neglect the failure the wars have been on and after 9 11 al qaeda was between 200 and 400 people strong world wide over the last seventeen years al qaeda and its successor isis has grown to number in the tens of thousands with branches and affiliates across the globe today the us is in combat operations in fourteen countries while conducting counter terrorism operations in sixty five countries to ostensibly defeat al qaeda and isis bombing that kills maims and make homeless tens of thousands each year from us aircraft and drones is daily in not just afghanistan and iraq but in libya pakistan somalia syria and yemen countries across the middle east and africa most especially libya somalia syria and yemen have been torn apart by civil wars and fighting that have at least some if not all of their genesis in us military and cia activities since 2001 at times al qaeda isis and their allies have controlled and commanded large swathes of land including major cities threatened to overthrow governments in nations both aligned and unaligned to the us and committed mass scale atrocities and genocide how can any person with any degree of intellectual honesty look at the us strategy and operations against al qaeda and terrorism over the last decade and a half and argue that more of the same is what is required peace has been possible in afghanistan what has been said repeatedly since 2001 regarding the taliban is that they have been uninterested in peace talks or negotiations this is untrue yes there are some elements of the taliban which have been against peace talks and negotiation but there have been many members and parts of the taliban that have been interested in talking however this goes against the profit benefits of an unending war as well as the political need for president obama to be not just a war time president but a victorious war time president something the george w bush and the republicans could not claim see bob woodward s obama wars and refer to hilary clinton and her hawkish role as secretary of state as a necessary part of her pre campaign for president pushing for war in not just afghanistan but in libya as well in the immediate aftermath of the us invasion major figures and parts of the taliban sought to surrender they were rebuffed as it was victory that was being sought by the us and their afghan warlord allies not reconciliation and peace in the years following 2001 members of the taliban who sought to surrender and reconcile were instead hunted down and killed those who were not killed were forced across the border into pakistan or iran anand gopal s reporting on this is excellent and necessary for understanding how the afghan war came to be unending post 2001 in the final years of the bush presidency and in the first year or two of obama s presidency the taliban made overtures to peace and negotiations middle eastern and central and south asian media reported the taliban interest in talks but these reports were rarely if ever picked up by western media the taliban suggested negotiations via social media including facebook posts and mullah omar the leader of the taliban in his annual eid messages would include comments about beginning a process of talks to lead to peace and reconciliation these overtures accompanied with the demand for foreign forces to leave an understandable call by an insurgency continued even after the us escalation of the war in 2009 none of this was even acknowledged let alone considered by the us government in 2016 the new york times whose editorial page has been a continual supporter of the war over the last seventeen years until just this month reported that in 2007 and 2008 norwegian negotiators had been meeting directly with mullah omar until this reporting it had been believed mullah omar had never met with any westerner and that a framework for peace was being advanced this opportunity was scuttled in 2009 by the obama administration s escalation of the war an escalation that was justified by president obama because according to him and the us government the taliban were not interested in peace sherard cowper coles britain s ambassador and special representative to afghanistan from 2007 to 2010 whom i met in richard holbrooke s suite at the waldorf astoria in new york city in 2009 and who praised me for my resignation letter described the main impediment to negotiations during his many year tenure in afghanistan as the american military and the reality of the american republic cowper coles after leaving afghanistan experienced an appalling sense of sadness and tragedy and above all the sense that otherwise intelligent people were living one big bright shining lie during my time in afghanistan i first hand saw a willingness to negotiate by elements of the taliban while in nangahar province in the spring of 2009 we were approached by representatives of hezbi islami gulbuddin one of three principal blocks of the taliban the taliban is not monolithic and is composed of dozens if not hundreds of locally organized insurgencies that fall under the umbrella of larger regional insurgencies whose leadership is based in pakistan which are then included under the overall broader designation that we call the taliban my instruction from the embassy was clear disregard we do not negotiate or are involved with reconciliation reconciliation according to the us government was only to be conducted by the afghan government a government that only existed and remained in power due to the backing of the us and nato so because of this backing from the world s lone superpower it was a government that was never going to willingly negotiate on its own why would it again the logic that sustains the lies of the war is brilliant in its speciousness on multiple occasions interlocutors from the insurgency were rebuffed and when us army commanders asked about how the war ends without negotiation they received no answer later in my time in afghanistan i moved to the southern province of zabul here too i met with taliban interlocutors and more than likely some taliban themselves my instructions were the same do nothing throughout the war the us has insisted on three preconditions for the taliban prior to talks 1 lay down their weapons 2 renounce links to al qaeda and 3 embrace the afghan constitution renouncing their links to al qaeda the taliban have done in one form or another since 2001 just as the taliban put out feelers for talks in the middle eastern and central south asian press that were never acknowledged by the us government so has their renunciation of ties to al qaeda been ignored the remaining two preconditions if followed by the taliban would in effect have meant their surrender as i was told several times in zabul when discussing with interlocutors and again maybe the taliban themselves and has been repeated to me by men in the us with ties to the taliban we are tired of fighting my father fought and now my sons are fighting i do not want my grandsons to fight but we are not going to surrender couple this with the fact that it was not until eleven years after the us invasion that taliban were allowed safe passage to negotiate meaning that if they identified themselves they would find their vehicle the target of a drone and its hellfire missiles and even in the last few years they have been consistently targeted and it is clear that us protestations for a willingness and a desire for peace may well have been the grandest and bloodiest lie of them all peace cut through all the lies and there it is right in front of you it is true that there are hundreds of thousands of well paid men and women in the us because of this war many of whom can now afford beach homes and bmws and yes it is true there are hundreds of politicians who subsist on the unholy campaign contributions that come from the war machine aside from these mercenary beneficiaries can someone point to any thing worthwhile from these wars what should be apparent to observers of the war in afghanistan is that the willingness for peace from the us and its allies has not existed the reasons are multiple there is too much money being made the political advantages of a victory presidency are too great the vainglorious egos of the generals and those in think tanks backed financially by the defense industry are too strong there may be a great deal of money in minerals to be made in afghanistan while the yearly record amounts of drugs grown and exported are enriching the afghan government and security forces as well as local regional and international banks and if you are the corrupt decadent afghan government with the us as your benefactor why seek peace what should also be clear and damning is how quickly and easily the recent peace talks have moved forward with seemingly minimal effort over the span of a few meetings a framework for peace appears possible all that tragically seems to have been required was the willingness of the us government to talk what a waste the saddest epilogue to this essay and to this war is that none of this was necessary it has all has been a waste blood flesh bone sinew organs ground up and thrown as if by some spectral ghastly hand and shovel into a furnace of oblivion and nothingness eb sledge a us marine who fought in the 20thcentury s good war wrote about his experiences as an infantryman amidst all the killing and dying in with the old breed over and over again haunted by the dead and the loss of their futures sledge summarizes what he saw with the words what a waste yes what a waste indeed

of 2019 the lower grade in 2019 reflects the sequencing of stopes in the mine plan to achieve the development ramp up to the 3 800 tonnes per day production rate working within geotechnical and ventilation constraints the average gold grade is representative of the areas to be mined in 2019 and is not representative of the estimated life of mine grade which will be provided in the second

kings zones at depth to the east west and north east of the valley of the kings resource will be drilled as part of an approximately 70 000 meter drill program planned for 2019 areas at depth below to the east and to the north east of the currently defined mineral resource are considered highly prospective for additional resource expansion previous drilling programs indicated the continuation of high grade gold mineralization vertically below the deposit as well as to the east furthermore a re interpretation of previous drill results indicates the presence of a repetition through faulting of the key stratigraphy that hosts high grade gold mineralization in the valley of the kings underground exploration drilling for porphyry source in 2018 two 1 500 meter holes drilled east from the valley of the kings intersected brucejack style mineralization throughout see news release dated june 18 2018 drilling demonstrated mineralization continuity between the valley of the kings and the flow dome zone an area approximately 1 000 meters east of the brucejack mine in addition the drilling intersected anomalous copper and molybdenum mineralization which coupled with mineralogical indicators suggest proximity to porphyry style mineralization at depth over the summer of 2018 a surface geophysical program along with mineral chemistry evaluation was conducted to follow up on the successful underground exploration drilling the drill results along with geophysics and mineral chemistry are currently being integrated to refine targeting of this zone for subsequent drilling plans

a variety of economic indicators has provided conflicting signals fiscal and monetary policies may appear to be moving contrary to investor expectations and there are many unanswered questions about external factors affecting china s economy and markets most notably the ongoing trade war with the united states these crosscurrents make it difficult to predict how chinese assets will perform this year crosscurrents is also an apt descriptor for what is happening within the chinese economy on the one hand the government aims to support the economy on the other hand the importance of controlling systemic risks limits the use of old tools crosscurrents seems to be the buzzword for global markets in 2019 and one of the oft mentioned risks for 2019 is the ongoing slowdown in china recent data showed that china s real gdp growth slowed to 6 4 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2018 underneath the surface different segments of the economy have been moving in different directions industrial production data showed a slight uptick after the government eased controls on polluting sectors and upstream producers last year while consumer spending on durables namely autos continued to weaken infrastructure spending a traditionally reliable channel through which to boost growth also looked to have made a comeback towards the end of the year the first large scale power grid in xiongan heibei province is under construction china s state planner has in the last two months approved several big infrastructure projects in an apparent effort to boost its flagging economy photo xinhua policies enacted throughout 2018 are likely to provide diminishing support for the economy to be clear growth looks unlikely to crater but it may slow further meaning authorities are likely to either introduce new measures or more aggressively pursue existing policies china s government seems comfortable with modestly lower growth official commentary has suggested real gdp growth may hit 6 3 per cent for 2019 with the potential for even lower growth in the first quarter it is worth keeping in mind that even if growth were to fall to 6 per cent for example the additional output generated would equal 5 1 trillion yuan us 753 billion a decade ago china s gross domestic product would have had to expand by 14 1 per cent almost double the rate china was growing at the time to add that much output economic policy operates on two different tracks in china monetary and fiscal much attention has been paid to monetary policy lately the already high levels of debt in the corporate sector the people s bank of china s long term focus on financial stability and its ongoing efforts to reform china s financial plumbing by relying on rate tools over quantity targeting measures and by standardising the private sector s access to credit all limit how far china can walk down the monetary track and aggressive easing may even be counterintuitive china s real gdp growth slowed to 6 4 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2018 underneath the surface different segments of the economy have been moving in different directions photo ap consequently in 2019 the pboc will focus less on providing broad stimulus for the economy and more on improving financing conditions for firms particularly small and medium sized private enterprises recent moves like the introduction of the central bank bills swap and changing regulations to allow greater diversification in commercial banks capital structure all support the idea that the central bank is more concerned with the effective transmission of policy rather than pursuing outright easing as it did during prior growth slumps the fiscal track merits more attention this time around measures announced in the waning months of 2018 a higher threshold for income taxes and tax cuts for small businesses amount to roughly an additional 0 8 per cent of gdp left on the balance sheets of households and businesses simplification of the value added tax system and a further cut to the vat rate both distinct possibilities in the first half of 2019 could add another 0 8 per cent of gdp to corporate balance sheets additional measures to support consumption of large ticket items like cars are also likely yet macroeconomics determine the fate of markets in china to a lesser degree than other markets us nominal gdp growth and price changes in the s p 500 are 2 3 times more correlated than chinese growth and the csi 300 though neither exhibit a particularly close relationship growth certainly has an impact on sentiment and investors watch government policy closely but the overall rate of growth will tell us little about onshore equity performance versus what we can learn from the way that growth is achieved as a consequence while china s rate of growth will remain on the list of concerns the crosscurrents of china s different policy measures will be top of the list of factors to watch within china hannah

forward to these further talks and hopes to see additional progress and both sides will continue working on all outstanding issues in advance of the march 1 2019 deadline for an increase in the 10 percent tariff on certain imported chinese goods ifo german car exports to us could be halved on new tariffs but eu could have clever counterstrategy the us commerce department is set to deliver its recommendation to the white house regarding auto tariffs meeting a deadline on sunday ahead of that german ifo institute warned that if us imposes 25 additional permanent tariffs on cars that could reduce german car experts to the us by 50 in the long run for germany according to gabriel felbermayr director of the ifo center for international economics total car exports could drop by 7 7 or eur 18 4b but exports from other sectors and to other countries could slightly cushion the overall loss but the net result could still be eur 11 6b loss of exports felbermayr adds the eu can however develop a clever counterstrategy that would bring the effects of us tariffs on the economic performance of both sides to roughly zero that would be tariffs on us products whose manufacturers would have to react with price reductions this in turn would harm third countries whose economic output could fall by about five billion euros all calculations assume adjustment reactions 90 percent of which take place within five years uk leadsom no deal brexit is on the table it s the legal default position uk government s leader in the house of commons andrea leadsom said the government does not want no deal brexit but it s there because that is the legal default position and essentially that is what will happen if we don t vote for a deal she also noted that what the government is seeking to do is to sort out the arrangements on the backstop so that parliament can vote for the deal that is the government s sole focus meanwhile leadsom also urged eu to compromise on the irish border backstop she said if the eu were to bring on the one thing that they have said they are determined to avoid that is the risk of the uk leaving the eu without a deal at the end of march and thereby having to have some kind of hard border between northern ireland and ireland so it simply would not make sense to precipitate such a conundrum when the option of a negotiated arrangement where the uk could put in place alternative arrangements for the backstop would be far preferable from everybody s point of view including from the perspective of the issue of the border between northern ireland

down than up rba assistance governor christopher kent delivered a speech on financial conditions and the australian dollar recent developments today there he acknowledged that developments in australian financial markets have been similar to those offshore with falling equity prices rising credit spreads and increased volatility such development is a story of risk premia increasing from low levels and were associated with rising concerns about downside risks both internationally and domestically the outlook for domestic economy has also shifted with downward revision in both growth and inflation forecasts and market expectations for the next move in cash rate have switched signs too kent noted that markets have assessed that the next move is more likely to be down than up and that s reflected in lower bond yields fall in australian bond yields is likely to have contributed somewhat to the modest depreciation of the australian dollar of late on the other hand higher

over to our president and ceo steve jones steve steve jones president and chief executive officer thanks dan and good morning everyone for those of you using the web deck please turn to slide three we finished strong in 2018 generating 457 million of adjusted ebitda and 100 million of free cash flow for the year this performance which came in at the top end of the guidance ranges is a product of our team s hard work and dedication and i want to take a minute to thank them for this great performance for 2019 we expect adjusted ebitda in the range of 440 million to 465 million and free cash flow of 120 million to 145 million as we discussed on the q3 call our outlook for adjusted ebitda is roughly flat to 2018 however as brad will discuss in more detail the midpoint of the guidance range for adjusted ebitda actually reflects a nice underlying trend of growth when normalizing for the timing of the business interruption proceeds that we received in 2018 and of course the free cash flow range represents significant year over year improvement i ll now review some key business and strategic highlights please turn to slide four from a performance perspective what a year we set records seemingly across the board we processed more waste generated more energy and recovered more metals than we have in any other year in the history of the company we processed a record 20 4 million tons reflecting a full year of dublin operations the addition of two large palm beach plants toward the end of the year and processing records at six different facilities which is a credit to our operating teams and demonstrates how the continuous improvement initiatives are bearing fruit we expect that you ll see more of the same in 2019 with even higher throughput given the full year contribution from palm beach we believe that safety performance and operational performance go hand in hand and while the plants set production records in 2018 we also had the safest year in the history of the company our energy from waste plants saw a 31 reduction in incidents year over year our total case incident rate which is a measure of the number of incidents to total hours worked was at the lowest level in the company s history this is a fantastic accomplishment but safety is about what we do every day and will continue to strive for zero incidents in the future our primary end market is sustainable waste disposal and as i ve become known to say it s a good time to be a waste company disposal options in many of the markets are decreasing and transportation costs are rising which is a big advantage for our plants which are more proximate to population centers this manifests itself in improved pricing and we re getting our fair share with same store tip fee pricing up 3 5 in 2018 remember that this is occurring even as the majority of our waste is under contract with price escalators running closer to 2 to 2 5 we expect similar pricing performance in 2019 and believe that there is substantial runway to continue to push pricing from a client perspective during 2018 we extended three service fee contracts totaling 1 1 million tons for an average duration of five years in 2019 we have expiring service contracts at two plants that we own and we re currently in active negotiations with those client communities and look forward to reaching positive outcomes for both contracts beyond that we don t have another service contract expiration until 2023 so this segment of our portfolio is well locked up our covanta environmental solutions business or ces continues to grow nicely revenue from processing higher value profile waste at the energy from waste plants grew another 10 in 2018 this growth was a product of improved diversification of outlets for profiled waste across the fleet better internalization to our mature processing facilities and the 26 growth in regulated medical waste while this waste stream still represents less than 10 of our total internalized profiled waste it is growing quickly and offers dramatically higher margins we expect our third permitted regulated medical waste plant to ramp up in 2019 and we plan to continue to expand our capacity to handle these waste streams by adding permits at other plants in the coming years at the material processing facilities we grew other environmental service revenue by 8 in 2018 and we ll look to further leverage these assets for mid single digit revenue growth in 2019 lastly we look forward to the start up of the new york city marine transfer station in manhattan in the second quarter we re proud to continue to partner with new york city to provide a sustainable long term waste solution and once the facility is fully operational we expect to receive an additional 170 000 tons annually into the system for ultimate processing at our delaware valley and niagara sites in total our energy from waste plants will now manage roughly one third of all waste collected by the city for disposal as you would expect record waste throughput and limited plant downtime translated into record energy production in 2018 with modest improvements in market energy prices we had a better than expected year for energy revenue that said even with this recent cold snap energy prices remain subdued and our primary goal is to manage risk and volatility we entered 2019 well hedged and at rates slightly better than the hedges realized in 2018 for the year nearly 85 of the forecasted energy revenue is already contracted or hedged from a long term contract perspective we have excellent visibility with no material contract maturities until 2024 as we noted in prior quarters capacity payments will be lower in 2019 based on the auction results from three years ago our outlook is for similar levels of realized price realized capacity prices for the next two to three years and lastly we continue to explore opportunities to improve pricing from our energy either from its green attributes or premium locations and expect to have more to highlight in future quarters in this area we continue to advance our capabilities and performance in metals recovery and processing in 2018 setting yet another record for recovered volumes adjusted for client revenue sharing we recovered over 470 000 tons of metal representing a 9 increase over 2017 we continue to find new opportunities to increase metal recovery particularly on the non ferrous side through selective additions of equipment at facilities prices for the ferrous and non ferrous material have been impacted by different market forces dictating how we have reacted to minimize volatility and maximize value ferrous has been an easier story as the tariffs on imported steel has supported domestic steel production and thus demand for our products has an input the hms index averaged over 300 per ton for the year in 2018 and while prices are likely to soften a bit in 2019 we expect relative stability and ferrous prices to continue resulting in a favorable overall environment for this business non ferrous has been a bit more complex as demand for scrap aluminum has declined and prices softened due to policy changes in china however the team has successfully found ways to add value to our product via improved separation and in spite of persistently low scrap prices for scrap aluminum we expect realized non ferrous prices and total revenues to be higher in 2019 we re often asked how much exposure we really have to market prices for metals so i d like to provide some context on ferrous the current hms of nearly 300 per ton is approximately at the 10 year average while this isn t an exact science we estimate that a 25 per ton move in hms on an annual basis would have a 4 million to 5 million impact to revenue implying that movements to the historical highs or lows represent approximately 15 million to 20 million of upside or downside on non ferrous we saw a number of products but most correlate either to aluminum or copper scrap aluminum prices are already at 10 year lows and appear to have bottomed so we see more potential for upside than downside from current levels copper prices are slightly below the 10 year average and at a 0 25 per pound move in copper prices would likely impact revenue by around 2 million to 3 million annually positively or negatively one of the benefits of our metals program is that we diversified our exposure across multiple metals and geographic end markets while we increased our product quality and volume these efforts make metals a more durable and valuable line of business for us going forward earlier this year we began constructing our first total ash processing system or taps as we refer to it construction is likely to take most of the first half of the year and we ll commission it in the second half we do not expect a material financial contribution in 2019 however we re very excited about its potential to increase metal recovery and reduce our ash hauling and disposal costs and hope that this is the first of several such facilities while we work through construction commissioning in the first location we re working in parallel to develop other sites in the fleet that could make sense for additional systems once the first facility is in operations on the top of the plant maintenance our total energy from waste maintenance spend was less than 2 was up less than 2 in 2018 as compared to the prior year even as we added the dublin and palm beach plants the outlook for 2019 is similar adjusting for inflation and the full year impact of the large palm beach facilities this level of maintenance spend is in line with the previously discussed plans and the overall long term trajectory is unchanged all else equal we expect total efw maintenance spend to continue to increase at an inflation type rate over time plus or minus as we ve discussed our current level of maintenance activity is appropriate to cover both routine maintenance and long term asset reinvestment as we seek to ensure that our plans will continue to run at peak performance for decades to come one facet of managing costs and risk is managing the size and composition of our fleet you ve been hearing from me for some time that i want to take action on the lower profit facilities and in 2018 those efforts began to yield tangible changes we successfully amended our agreement with the city of long beach and this new arrangement represents a model for how we d like to structure the client facility agreements with appropriate risk allocation long term reinvestment by the client and shared upside for new revenue opportunities in palm beach florida we ve gotten off to a great start with a new client these large facilities fit perfectly into our existing footprint are operating well and offer attractive opportunities for improvement going forward during the second quarter of 2019 we planned to mop all the ph warren county new jersey facility we ve already announced this decision so there s no change there shutting down operations at a facility is a difficult decision but in this case it s the right decision from a risk reward standpoint lastly during 2018 we signed or closed on the sale of the hydro operations and three transfer stations as we look to redeploy capital invested in non core assets for higher returns elsewhere note that while transfer stations represent a critical component of our overall waste sourcing operations these facilities were no longer strategic for our assets and represent greater value in the hands of other waste companies to be clear we re not done yet there are many ways to improve the economics of the assets and we re pursuing multiple paths at other facilities that need improvement expect to hear more from us on this topic as we move through 2019 finally i d like to discuss the progress we ve made on our uk pipeline in late december we announced that we reached financial close of the earls gate energy center located in grangemouth scotland earls gate will have the capacity to process approximately 215 000 metric tons of waste per year and generate 21 5 megawatts equivalent of power i m saying megawatts equivalent because this plant will sell both power and steam the majority of the facility s waste is contracted with municipalities and local haulers while the energy output is secured under long term agreements we expect the facility to be in service by late 2021 and we re extremely excited to have our first uk project investment moving forward regarding the rookery in bedfordshire england the high court denied a court challenge to the issuance of our operating permit in november the local opposition group is now appealing this decision and we expect this to play out over the course of 2019 we agree with the environmental agency s position that the challenge to their very thorough process is without merit and we received strong legal advice supporting this in any event we view this as an issue of process only not whether the plant will have the rights to operate therefore we re pursuing options to proceed to financial close and commence construction of this much needed infrastructure prior to the end of the appeals process our two projects in the partnership with biffa protos and newhurst continued to make progress as well we just received the operating permit for protos and expect to move toward financial close once it has cleared the standard 90 day judicial review period the newhurst project awaits a draft permit following an application to vary the existing permit which will then be subject to consultation in both cases we look to be in position to reach financial close in 2019 like many comments i ve made in the past i expect to move all three of these additional advanced projects into construction by the end of 2019 and when in operation along with earls gate we expect our uk investments in total to generate 40 million to 50 million in cash annually the excitement in the investor community around the execution of our long term strategic plan with the uk project is well founded we look forward to keeping you updated as our pipeline progresses we consider continued international development to be critical to our long term growth plan with that i ll hand the call over to brad to discuss the financial results and outlook in greater detail brad helgeson executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks steve good morning everyone i ll begin my review of our financial performance with revenue on slide six total revenue was 1 87 billion for the year up 116 million or 6 6 compared to 2017 organic growth excluding the impact of commodities accounted for the majority of the improvement record efw plant production including full year of operations at fairfax and an environment of stronger waste prices with same store tip fee price growth of 3 5 drove the increase commodity prices had a modestly positive net impact as we saw a 9 million benefit from metals with strong ferrous index prices outweighing softness in non ferrous partially offset by a 4 million impact from lower energy prices with slightly lower prices on hedges and under contracts with caps and floors as compared to 2017 over the course of the year dublin generated 10 million of incremental service revenue net of its contribution in q4 2017 while the newly acquired palm beach operations added 17 million for the year long term contract transitions represented a net revenue reduction as the previously discussed transition of a client facility to another operator earlier this year and the expiration of a legacy power contract contributed to a 21 million headwind moving on to slide seven adjusted ebitda was 457 million in 2018 exceeding our guidance range and representing an increase of 49 million year over year excluding commodity prices adjusted ebitda grew by 44 million organically again driven by a strong plant production particularly at fairfax and the inclusion of 17 million in business interruption insurance proceeds during 2018 relating to the fire in 2017 excluding the benefit of the business interruption insurance in 2018 we grew adjusted ebitda by over 6 organically before commodities surpassing our 3 to 5 annual organic growth target the net benefit from ferrous metal prices and modest headwind from energy prices as i just discussed translated directly from revenue to the adjusted ebitda line the dublin facility contributed 22 million of incremental adjusted ebitda in the year which comprise both our o m services and the proportion of adjusted ebitda from our 50 jv ownership in the projects company contract transitions represented a 22 million headwind on a year over year basis half of which related to the client settlement benefit that we received in 2017 with most of the balance relating to the expiration of a legacy power contract and lower contractual client project debt service payments turning to slide eight free cash flow was 100 million for the year at the top end of our guidance range compared to 132 million in 2017 the primary driver of the change was working capital which represented a net 56 million headwind on a year over year basis with a 12 million cash outflow in 2018 compared to a 44 million cash flow benefit in the prior year as discussed when we set guidance going into the year we initially planned for a 20 million to 40 million net use of cash in working capital in 2018 but this anticipated outflow was mitigated by very strong accounts receivable collection performance driving a five day reduction in days sales outstanding stepping back from the working capital noise underlying free cash flow grew by 24 million or over 25 year over year that s the real story here this was driven by strong organic growth in adjusted ebitda as well as the first cash distribution received from the dublin project partially offset by higher maintenance capex year over year now please turn to slide nine where i ll review our growth investment activity during 2018 we invested 23 million in organic growth projects primarily for increased metal recovery and opportunities in our covanta environmental solutions business including expanding further into regulated medical waste we expect to spend a similar amount in 2019 and believe that this represents an appropriate expectation for recurring spend in these areas for the next few years before taking into account discrete projects these investments tend to be small individually but have very attractive returns and quick paybacks for larger projects the first to come online will be the new york city marine transfer station or mts in manhattan we expect to spend about 30 million on the project in total primarily for additional transportation equipment needed to add service at this second mts 13 million was already spent in 2018 with the balance to come during the first half of 2019 as you heard from steve earlier we received a permit for our first taps site and have commenced investment to purchase equipment and build out the system we expect to spend around 15 million in 2019 and approximately 25 million in total through 2020 we invested 21 million into our uk development pipeline in 2018 including early site work at rookery and the initial equity contributions and our entry premium for earls gate the 2019 outlook shown here for uk spend of 10 million represents just the remaining investment into earls gate and does not yet include the commencement of full construction on rookery protos or newhurst once we reach financial close on these projects we intend to update this forecast overall we expect the four projects to require a total equity contribution of 150 million to 200 million note that the funding for earls gate is front loaded but the investment profile for the other projects will likely differ we expect protos and newhurst to be generally ratable over the life of construction while rookery will likely be back end weighted we ll provide more of these details as projects reach financial close acquisition activity totaled 50 million during 2018 primarily reflecting the acquisition of the palm beach operations as usual we won t be providing a specific outlook for this line in 2019 and instead we ll update it only as specific transactions take place however you can expect that acquisition activity will be relatively limited in 2019 given our other investment priorities please note that we re also highlighting asset sale proceeds here as they will provide incremental funding for our capital spend during 2018 we monetize nearly 200 million most significantly from the sale of a 50 stake in the dublin project looking to 2019 while we have not explicitly listed any asset sales we do expect to include any premiums paid to us by gig when we reached financial close on rookery protos and newhurst these proceeds will help fund a portion of the 150 million to 200 million of uk project equity spend please turn to slide 10 where i ll provide an update on our balance sheet at december 31 net debt was a little over 2 4 billion down 31 million from december 2017 our treasury team had a busy year completing three important refinancing transactions totaling approximately 2 billion which combined to extend our maturity profile reduce interest cost and improve our liquidity and flexibility going forward we ll continue to look proactively for opportunities like these to optimize our capital structure at year end our consolidated leverage ratio was 5 6 times down from 6 4 times at the end of 2017 the senior credit facility covenant ratio ended the year at 2 2 times which is almost a turn and a half lower than the 3 6 times we had at the end of 2017 at year end our available liquidity under our revolver was nearly 450 million considering our planned investments in 2019 and the expectation for adjusted ebitda to be roughly flat year over year we expect our 2019 leverage ratios to remain similar to current levels remember that we ve reduced conservative leverage by 1 5 turns from its peak in 2017 and as we continued to drive adjusted ebitda and free cash flow growth these metrics will improve further over time toward our long term goal of four times however in the near term we believe that the best path for maximizing long term value for shareholders is to execute on our attractive investment opportunities while our joint venture with gig minimizes the near term impact on our balance sheet now please turn to the slide 11 where i ll talk about our 2019 outlook for adjusted ebitda in a little more detail while initiating 2019 guidance for adjusted ebitda of 440 to 465 million as previewed on our third quarter call this outlook is similar to 2018 results organic growth excluding commodities is expected to contribute 10 million to 20 million for the year again driven by strong efw facility production increased metal recovery and improving waste prices note that this growth is net of the year over year headwind from fairfax business interruption insurance proceeds received in 2018 which i ll discuss in further detail shortly at the midpoint of this net organic growth range we should be toward the lower end of our annual target of 3 to 5 however excluding fairfax insurance from the year over year comparison we d expect to come in at the top or even above the range again this year commodity pricing is expected to weigh on growth this year as previously discussed we expect capacity payments to be lower by about 10 million year over year with variability up or down from that number based on market power prices for our open position metals index prices are expected to represent a 5 million to 15 million headwind based on the outlook for modestly softer ferrous and scrap aluminum prices our recent investment in the palm beach operating contracts and the start up of the new york city mts will contribute about 15 million incrementally in 2019 this will be partially offset by the 2018 sale of 50 of the dublin facility since we owned 100 of the plant for the first six weeks in 2018 we ll also see a few million in headwinds in 2019 results from fleet optimization efforts including the shutdown of the warren facility however as steve discussed these activities will allow us to reduce risk and reallocate resources to other more profitable facilities which will benefit the company in the longer term lastly transitions will again be a small net negative primarily due to lower contractual client project debt service payments after 2019 we no longer see this as a material headwind which if you ve been a long term investor or analyst following covanta it s quite a milestone this item has represented an adjusted ebitda headwind of over 100 million over time before i move on i want to mention that the first quarter of 2019 will be a normal first quarter for us with a typically high level of planned maintenance in the busy outage season when comparing q1 2018 remember that we had benefit of insurance recoveries and owning 100 of dublin for a portion of the quarter last year also energy prices were higher in q1 2018 than we ve experienced so far this year overall this will make q1 2019 adjusted ebitda lower than last year this outlook is fully accounted for in our full year 2019 guidance which implies that the balance of 2019 will likely be favorable with slide 12 i d like to take a moment to illuminate the underlying trend of consistent growth in adjusted ebitda that has been masked somewhat by the timing of insurance proceeds related to the fairfax facility fire in 2017 to recap we received 17 million of business interruption insurance proceeds in 2018 to reimburse us for amounts that would have otherwise earned in 2017 if the plant were operational at historical levels in effect the delay in collecting insurance had the impact of reducing 2017 and increasing 2018 results for purposes of this discussion if we take a simple step of moving the 17 million received in 2018 back into 2017 when the downtime occurred you get a very different picture looking at the chart on the right which adjusts for the timing impact of insurance proceeds you can see that our adjusted ebitda trend has been consistently higher which we expect to continue in 2019 as organic growth and our investments are more than offsetting commodity headwinds and contract transitions now please turn to slide 13 for a walk from 2018 free cash flow to our guidance for 2019 we expect to grow free cash flow to between 120 and 145 million this year in line with our preliminary 2019 comments on the q3 earnings call with adjusted ebitda in a similar range to 2018 anticipated free cash flow improvement is driven primarily by lower maintenance capex year over year and improved cash flow from working capital which we expect to be flat or a slight positive to cash flow in 2019 i ll conclude by looking beyond this year and restating our long term target of hitting 250 million of sustainable annual free cash flow by the middle of next decade our steady progress on key strategic initiatives over the next two years including steps in the uk are the building blocks toward that goal and we believe that the path to this target will become more clear as we move forward and continue to demonstrate tangible successes with that operator we d like to move to q a questions and answers operator operator instructions and our first question comes from the line of tyler brown from raymond james your line is open tyler brown raymond james analyst hey good morning guys steve jones president and chief executive officer good morning tyler tyler brown raymond james analyst first off congrats to all of you really exciting to see all the progress but hey brad just same store pricing was up a very solid 3 5 i appreciate the 3 guidance for 2019 but i m curious about say the next three years to five years i know you guys have a couple of large merchant waste contracts that reprice this year you ve been trying to shorten your contract lengths but conceptually is there any reason to think that 3 plus same store pricing baseline really isn t reasonable to think about even past 2019 brad helgeson executive vice president and chief financial officer no i think that is a reasonable assumption the contracted portion of the portfolio escalates at inflation so 2 to 2 5 but given the dynamics in our markets that we we ve talked about repeatedly we see the ability to move price substantially particularly as you point out as contracts roll over so overall we d look to exceed inflation by the amount that we re demonstrating last year and expecting for this year steve jones president and chief executive officer yes i think you re going to see tyler particularly in the north a lot of pricing moving up pricing moving up pretty significantly and then also our profiled waste business continues to click along 10 growth again this year regulated medical waste drug take back programs and there s just a lot that s driving that business and will continue to drive it for the foreseeable future tyler brown raymond james analyst right okay good and then on the energy side i just want to make sure i have it as well but at this point virtually all the big contract transitions are behind us all of that noise has largely sunset at least until the mid 2020s so is there any reason here not to believe that the 2 million contracted megawatt hours will continue to see a price around 65 and you ve already given us capacity revenues so the only thing that really moves in that piece is basically market prices and the rolling average impact on hedge prices brad helgeson executive vice president and chief financial officer yes correct that s the right way to look at it tyler brown raymond james analyst okay and then maybe my last one for steve it feels like coming off of fairfax you guys have really hit your stride or really humming from an operations perspective i m sure you can appreciate that it s a little hard for us to see the changes from the outside looking in but can you talk about some of the continuous improvement initiatives that are really bearing fruit and then despite running well where do you think there s still opportunity to improve steve jones president and chief executive officer yes so we ve only rolled out things like stable operations and you ve heard me talk about this before this is as if you had the best operator on your on the board every minute of the day and so because i mean think about the fact that if you allow the linear programming model to run the plant it s probably better than a person running it right you obviously need a person sitting there but with smart equipment now it s just more efficient and effective to run that way with the computer and the programming model so and that s what stable operations is and so we ve rolled that out to our biggest plants those profitable plants but we haven t really taken that through the whole fleet yet so actually this past year our continued improvement gross productivity was at the highest level ever so and we ve been at for since i walked in the door say three four years and we re just starting to hit the stride now on the ability to take these tools and apply them to problems that we have in the plant or just day to day operations so that you get the most out of the plant every day so there s a pretty long runway i think it s years it s not a couple of years it s a lot of years but we re going to be able to continue working with lean six sigma tools to make our operations more effective and we talk a lot around here we talk a lot about operational discipline now how do we make sure that we ve got disciplined operations that at all of our plants tyler brown raymond james analyst all right that s great congratulations and thank you steve jones president and chief executive officer thanks operator our next question comes from the line of brian lee from goldman sachs your line is open brian lee goldman sachs analyst hey guys thanks for taking the questions good morning steve jones president and chief executive officer good morning brian lee goldman sachs analyst good morning couple from me just on the uk development pipeline just first off could you remind us what the contracted status of the facility today steve jones president and chief executive officer i m sorry couldn t hear you that well brian so if you look at each of the projects has waste locked up probably to like the 70 plus level in that range it depends on that project but i mean that s the first thing that we go out and do is make sure that we ve got access to the waste and so if you look and you ll see that we we ve tried to do is partner with waste companies right because they need as the uk is eliminating landfill capacity the waste companies are good at getting waste on wheels and rolling the trucks around and picking up waste but they need access to disposal capacity so if you look at rookery inaudible is involved in that protos and newhurst it s biffa and then up in earls gate there is a couple of different local haulers but all the waste that s the first thing we go out and do is get that waste locked up brian lee goldman sachs analyst okay appreciate that and then i guess related to that with the brexit uncertainty in the region i know that s been an ongoing issue but does the outcome there have any potential impact for raising debt financing or the cost of that financing just maybe how you re thinking about that situation brad helgeson executive vice president and chief financial officer hey brian it s brad i mean like everybody else we re waiting eagerly to see how this plays out we haven t seen any real impact so far and we don t expect it to impact our ability to raise funding in installing for the projects so but i think the long term implications for the uk remains a question and we re watching just like everyone else steve jones president and chief executive officer and one of the interesting thing is that there was an article on the guardian a couple weeks ago with respect to the fact that there s roughly 3 5 million tons that leaves the uk to the continent and so you need a permit or license to move that takes center as the hard brexit that waste won t move as easily and so there was concerns and this played out in the guardian article about waste kind of getting caught up in the system and what happens to it so there could be pros and cons associated with how brexit plays out depending on where we go in the next couple of several weeks here brian lee goldman sachs analyst okay understood that s helpful context just maybe last question for me and then i ll pass it on i know you guys get this question from time to time it seems like it s still a point of detention for some investors on the stock but is there any flexibility particularly as you start to have the capital to the uk pipeline over the next two years but around the dividend policy just any sort of flexibility to the bitter temporary shifts in how much of a priority that is within your capital allocation strategy overall is that on the agenda at by any means has the board entertained this as a potential option as we move closer toward again having the capital to regain stability steve jones president and chief executive officer yeah we look at the dividend policy all the time but kind of more formally in december of every year we re committed to the dividend i don t think you re going to see a change there i think what hear is quite frankly our net debt to adjusted ebitda higher than people like as brad pointed out in his prepared remarks we also have these great projects in the uk so at least for 2019 we re going to our dividend is as i said we re committed to it we focused on advancing these accretive uk projects and at least in 2019 i don t think you re going to see our net debt to adjusted ebitda move that much it will be kind of in the range that it is today but we are it s not lost on us by the way and i want to say inaudible it s not lost in us and the board that we we need to move that number down as we move through time here that net debt to adjusted ebitda number brad helgeson executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah brian it s brad i ll just add to that i think the real consequence of a capital allocation policy that is weighted toward paying back capital to shareholders would be in theory that they got in the way of us being able to invest in the opportunities we have in front of us but that s not happening you saw how we were able to refinance in fact most of our balance sheet this year to really strengthen and improve our capital structure with our partnership with gig and the credit strength of the uk projects is being financed very efficiently so it will set things up where notwithstanding i think the optics the dividend versus the cash flow here in the near term we ve set things up where we think we can achieve or we know we can achieve both goals of continuing the payout and strengthening the payout and then making sure that that doesn t stand in the way of our investment opportunities brian lee goldman sachs analyst all right thanks guys operator our next question comes from the line of michael hoffman from stifel your line is open michael hoffman stifel analyst good morning gentlemen thanks for the questions you all love to talk about waterfall so i d like to ask the question and i think they re very useful in the context of a waterfall if you think about a baseline of midpoint round numbers 450 million is the starting ebitda today you have a goal to grow free cash to 250 million to accomplish that before we get the benefit of the 40 million to 50 million from uk domestic organic growth has to hold a 3 or 4 growth rate in ebitda can you waterfall us that the progression of that over the next three years how we think where that s coming from at a high level so we can appreciate what you ve got in front of you to support that brad helgeson executive vice president and chief financial officer yes hey michael it s brad that s exactly right so set aside the uk for a second we re looking at the organic rate of growth of the business we put out the 3 to 5 target of course we beat that in 2018 and feel pretty good adjusting for insurance about hitting that or beating it again this year i think we intentionally stayed away from putting too fine a point on how much of that 3 to 5 is going to come from the different pillars of the growth strategy but it s it s really all of the things that we ve been talking about it s continuous improvement in plants it s not a recovery it s waste prices and that s obviously the underlying dynamics in our core markets the northeast as well as the opportunities to grow profiled waste into the plants and grow the ces business more broadly so i know that probably doesn t precisely answer your question but we think we have a lot of arrows in the quiver if you will to make sure that we re hitting that 3 to 5 for the foreseeable future steve jones president and chief executive officer yeah we feel i feel personally pretty real good about this i think we have enough levers to pull when you look at some of the things that brad just laid out i talked about continuous improvement before but we have taps out there more metals recovery profiled waste the ces business is growing well with 10 again this year so i think we re in good real good shape with respect to that part of the funneling or as you put it waterfall to the 250 million free cash flow michael hoffman stifel analyst and just to be clear i mean the simple math is if i take the midpoint this year at 130 million you kind of have to get 70 million from domestic and then the other 50 million comes from development and really need that 3 to 5 to get that domestic piece right that s the right way to think about it brad helgeson executive vice president and chief financial officer that s exactly the way that s exactly the way i m thinking about it michael hoffman stifel analyst okay and then can we talk about the debt just a little bit i mean we do need to acknowledge that the very good total leverage probably ticks up some but if you can do this 3 to 5 that helps temper that rising more it stabilizes and then as uk comes on we start that steady progression back down toward ultimate goal of 4 brad helgeson executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah that s right and as i commented in the prepared remarks wouldn t really expect to be lower plus or minus we wouldn t expect be lower as we exit 2019 than we are today but that being said the expectation isn t that we won t see improvement until the uk projects come online in three years i think that will certainly accelerate that process but we re going to be looking to based on the the growth in the domestic business we re going to be looking to grow ebitda cash flow and thus be working our way down on leverage and that will be uk again coming on that should really accelerate us toward that long term target steve jones president and chief executive officer in a lot of respects we re kind of growing into where we want to get too i mean there s other ways to do it you see us actually sell assets right so that s one of the things i ve been pushing hard on is underperforming assets or assets that don t make a lot of sense for us we re selling those but i think what really will get us into the four times range is this is this will 3 to 5 growth and ultimately the uk projects but we ll kind of grow into the balance sheet a little bit here michael hoffman stifel analyst but to be clear the market should take in stride that 5 6 probably less might go to 6 but then stabilizes and starts working its way back down again gradually before uk comes in and then it steps down a little more aggressively that s nobody should be alarmed by that because you are going to spend some money on that s going to come in as debt for the projects brad helgeson executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah that s directionally how i am thinking about it i think that s a fair statement michael hoffman stifel analyst okay that s what i need to know thanks brad helgeson executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks operator our next question comes from the line of noah kaye from oppenheimer your line is open noah kaye oppenheimer analyst good morning thanks for taking the question steve let me just follow up on something you just mentioned around really optimizing the domestic waste energy fleet footprints now that the wheelabrator sale from macquarie is final and of course with the disambiguation that it s not the same macquarie that you re partnering with for the uk project presumably those folks are looking to optimize the portfolio they ve just bought as well how are you thinking about the prospect of asset swaps or any kind of exchange of the assets between your two companies steve jones president and chief executive officer i mean we ll have discussions with them about that and certainly that makes sense in some cases particularly if you can get synergies associated with it i mean one of the reasons we are most interested in palm beach was because it was kind of in our sweet spot with the number of plants that we operate in florida so there might be cases where it got more operations in certain areas than we do and they can make a facility more profitable than we can because of their existing operation so we d certainly look at that with them obviously we d have to pass any trust scrutiny around any type of swaps so that s always that always gets a little tricky noah kaye oppenheimer analyst right right and then maybe a follow up question to michael s question around the leverage is my understanding that given the jv structure the debt for the uk project is not going to go on your balance sheet we re really talking about impact to your net cash as you put more of the cash on your balance sheet to work for equity in those projects is that correct brad helgeson executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah that s exactly right yeah noah kaye oppenheimer analyst okay so the upward impact to leverage from debt may actually be somewhat muted as you see those projects closer to becoming online brad helgeson executive vice president and chief financial officer certainly over the course of the three year construction period yes that s our expectation noah kaye oppenheimer analyst okay steve jones president and chief executive officer i think as equity going into different times so that s why brad mentioned this in his prepared remarks in some projects it s front loaded some it s ratable and then some it s back loaded so i mean we re we ll manage that a little bit that way noah kaye oppenheimer analyst yeah and then specific to rookery steve i guess here with the appeal of the appeal you mentioned possibly finding a way to move forward if the question is really have you found precedence for projects like this or in a similar profile to proceed even with the sort of legal status a little bit up in the air would that inhale steve jones president and chief executive officer yeah as people it will take on the risk there is also other ways to kind of deal with the risk i mean the bottom line is we re pretty comfortable after looking at the high court s ruling in november and then talking to our counsel that ultimately will get an operating permit well i certainly don t need the operating permit until we re in operation so we ve got a long period of time here during construction where we can sort this all out so there are people who will close without the operating permit depending on where they see the ultimate risk noah kaye oppenheimer analyst okay so your comment that this will play out over the course of 2019 again that we shouldn t read too much into that from a timing perspective that this isn t a 2019 event it could come earlier than that brad helgeson executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i m expecting it will come earlier than that is my current view yes noah kaye oppenheimer analyst thanks very much appreciate it steve jones president and chief executive officer sure no problem operator our next question comes from the line of jeff silber from bmo capital markets your line is open jeff silber bmo capital markets analyst thanks so much wanted to focus excuse me on taps i know you mentioned the construction in the first half of this year it s not going it s commissioned second half of next year but going forward what kind of financial impact do you think that ll have on your business steve jones president and chief executive officer so the first one will probably be 5 million to 7 million of ebitda now we ll see it will be interesting because i think there ll be some upside associated with it as we start to shake out the system so we ll construct it we aren t constructed now we ll start to start to do the commissioning end of the second quarter into the third quarter and then we ll see how much throughput we can get through the equipment my current view is we ll probably do better with throughput from some of the things that i heard so that will so 5 million to 7 million i think is kind of our base case at this point about 7 million of additional ebitda brad helgeson executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah and jeff it s brad looking at the model for these systems they re really based on in theory three new revenue streams we ve made the investment case based on two of the three so that s kind of what steve was alluding to so it s really enhanced waste metal recovery particularly small fractions of heavy and high value on the non ferrous side number two is of course offsetting disposal cost that disposal cost to the extent that we re able to beneficially reuse the material and the third which we haven t really banked on is the market value of that reusable material who are things such as construction aggregates so it s going to take us some time not only to be getting the project up and running and working out some of the inevitable kinks but also from a market development standpoint developing out those revenue streams so 5 million to 7 million is kind of what we see based on the model today we ll need to get through the commissioning period and probably toward the back half of this year we ll have a much better sense to how good we feel about that 5 million to 7 million but then again as steve alluded to we think the longer term opportunity here is even bigger jeff silber bmo capital markets analyst alright great and i know you don t give quarterly guidance unfortunately we have to model by quarter is there anything to call out seasonally this year that might be different from last year and if also you can remind us on the cadence of the bi insurance the insurance proceeds of when you got them last year during the quarter thanks brad helgeson executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so jeff so for the first quarter i mean there were a couple of items one was that the dublin if you recall the dublin sale didn t close until this time around last year so we had there s about 5 million of contribution from a consolidation of dublin for the beginning of the first quarter so that will wrap from an anniversary standpoint with 7 million as i recall in business interruption collection for the fairfax fire as we look at 2018 and as you think about the year over year as we move through 2019 of course we collected another 10 million or so in the fourth quarter from the insurance so that s something to look out for moving through the year i also commented on the strength in energy prices that we saw first quarter last year that s probably less of an impact year over year comparatively but we wanted to flag it maintenance really should be typical trend there s really a little bit of movement but nothing as we move into 2019 that we think is worth highlighting jeff silber bmo capital markets analyst okay appreciate that thanks so much operator our next question comes from the line of ben callow from baird your line is open ben kallo baird analyst hey good morning i don t want to put the cart before the horse but you got a lot of projects going on so i just kind of want to know what the development team is doing kind of for the next level and i know that s easy for my inaudible but thanks for any kind of color of future projects out there you guys are developing and then on taps could you just talk about how you guys view the overall addressable market there steve jones president and chief executive officer sure with respect to project development we re looking at other projects in the uk so there were other projects that gig was working on when we re looking at other projects so the uk market needs more energy from waste there s probably i d say there s probably a five year to 10 year window in uk where there s going to be more energy from waste projects so we ll get these four rolling and then there s some other earlier development phase projects that we ll bring forward there s also projects outside the us that s why i mentioned at the very end i think international business development is important to our growth story so you may have seen that in the philippines we are working with macquarie and metro pacific we ve been awarded the energy from waste plant in the quezon city so outside of manila area and so we re working on that project that will take a few years to work its way through getting all the permits and the financing set up and things like that but there is going to be a number of projects in southeast asia that are potentially projects that we ll participate in so there s a lot going on i think you re going to see some in south america we ve recently seen an uptick in activity there so i think the uk is going to be our focus we ll do a lot of value creation if we focus on the uk for the next few years but you re going to see some of these other locations start coming into play as the uk finishes their development of disposal energy from waste disposal plants on taps so this total market size so this particular plant will take ash from four of our facilities we ll probably need another four or maybe five facilities depending on location so right now what we re doing is we re we looking at various spots in our fleet where we can sight ph plants whether they re at our energy from waste facilities and then feed those regionally so i would say this plant plus another four potentially will round out our fleet and then quite frankly there is what does wheelabrator do maybe we can start to source ash from some facility and run that through our plants so that there might be other opportunities to take this a little wider than our own facilities ben kallo baird analyst okay i guess just back to the first question on pipeline just as far as cadence goes of development because we had dublin it was first then all of a sudden we got your four projects here in the next couple of years is it going to be more of a steady state kind of an announcement on progress on projects you think than with the last 10 years steve jones president and chief executive officer yes and that s part of my goal is that is to get more projects in the development pipeline and then kind of have a steady growth of new plants coming on i mean because know we re the largest or the biggest energy from waste company in the world and focused just on energy from waste we get invited to participate in a number of projects some of them are further along in development and we kind of jump on the train as it s moving some are earlier in development but we re going to look a little more closely now at filling that pipeline so that we have a steady state of growth of new energy from waste plants as time goes on ben kallo baird analyst great thank you steve jones president and chief executive officer thanks ben operator and our last question comes from the line of inaudible your line is open moses sutton barclays analyst good morning could you talk a bit about the net irrs expected at each of the uk projects assuming things continue to move along on time and your construction by year end at all of them brad helgeson executive vice president and chief financial officer yes hey moses it s brad so we re looking at cash on cash irrs on our equity investment this varies by project i m not going to get into project by project but overall we re generally looking in the low to mid teens irrs which given the way these projects are structured and buttoned up from a contractual standpoint we find those risk adjusted returns to be very attractive moses sutton barclays analyst got it is it fair to say that earls gate will be lower irrs than say rookery assuming that you have no issue with rookery brad helgeson executive vice president and chief financial officer i think that s i mean inaudible investment is attractive but yes that s a fair assumption and there are a couple of reasons for that one is of course first and foremost the size it is generally more profitable at a higher return to build these projects bigger of course we only build them to the size of the market needs so that s why earls gate is smaller but you would expect a general better generally speaking a better return profile for bigger plant of rookery also rookery was our project that we ve been developing earls gate we stepped into so the nature of our arrangement again with the green investment group is that for the partner that has been developing the project the other partner will pay a premium based on a target irr to buy into the project so we ll get a nice return on our both our development dollars that we ve spent and our sweat equity in rookery which will help the overall return for us moses sutton barclays analyst got it thanks and regarding potential asset sales throughout 2019 i know you mentioned you d give more detail throughout the year is there perhaps there a target range of proceeds for 2019 or 2020 i m not sure if you re willing to put a number to that yet brad helgeson executive vice president and chief financial officer not necessarily so there are a couple of components to it as mentioned on the call on the prepared remarks in the call we are in the process of monetizing some non core assets the hydro assets we closed one in 2018 there is another one that s just awaiting approval so we will closing it here in the early part of 2019 we mentioned three transfer stations that we re selling not all of those are closed either so we ll be kind of finishing off those non core asset sales and then if and as the uk projects come online or rather move into past financial close into construction we ll be reflecting the premiums that were earned by selling down those projects in the context of our gig partnership as those move forward beyond that we don t have any specific targets but as steve mentioned we have open minds and open eyes for opportunities where we can we can recycle capital for better returns for us for assets that makes sense in other hands so if any of those opportunities move forward we ll just refresh at that point moses sutton barclays analyst thanks appreciate the color brad helgeson executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks operator and there are no further questions at this time i will turn the call back over to steve jones for closing remarks steve jones president and chief executive officer thank you for joining us today and as always we appreciate your participation and interest as we discussed we re making real progress on our strategic initiatives and expect 2019 to be an important year in continuing this momentum thank you again and we look forward to seeing and talking to all of you in the coming months operator and this concludes today s call you may now disconnect duration 65 minutes call participants dan mannes vice

and chief executive officer thank you tejal and good morning everyone thanks for joining us on our year end 2018 earnings conference call 2018 was another year of solid operational performance continued asset recycling and further balance sheet improvement for washreit we delivered approximately 2 core ffo per share and 3 same store noi growth on a year over year basis we upgraded our northern virginia office portfolio with the sale of braddock metro center in alexandria and the acquisition of arlington tower in rosslyn we continued to upgrade our dc office portfolio with the sale of 2445 m street in the west end having acquired watergate 600 on the dc waterfront in 2017 and we ended the year with a net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio of 6 2 times as a result we have entered 2019 with a strong balance sheet and a higher quality better located portfolio with exciting lease up opportunities in a region that is expected to benefit from a continued rise in defense spending and amazon hq2 related growth this year we are focused on multiple commercial lease up opportunities that represent meaningful long term noi growth for our shareholders our 2019 goal is to create solid visibility on our future revenue growth by executing commercial leases throughout the year and by delivering the first units at the trove our multifamily development by the pentagon in the fourth quarter of this year let me now provide you with a progress report on our key commercial leasing opportunities that were referenced in the 8 k we filed last november starting with watergate 600 we are very close to signing a 51 000 square foot long term lease for the top two floors of the building with a blue chip company that considers watergate 600 to be its best relocation option as it looks to expand its regional footprint we expect lease commencement to take place in early 2020 pending the completion of an extensive build out this lease and the 22 000 square foot of other leases that we have executed thus far at watergate 600 validate our acquisition thesis on office tenants being drawn to the asset s iconic status and unparalleled waterfront views following the lease up of watergate 600 s top two floors we have a pipeline of approximately 100 000 square feet of deals for approximately 40 000 square foot of current availability which includes all other 2019 lease expirations thereafter annual lease expirations at watergate 600 are negligible until 2026 and beyond moving on to arlington tower we delivered one floor of collaborative furnished suites within the space program from december through early january over that period we have signed two leases totaling approximately 8 000 square feet that are both already generating gaap and cash revenues and have now received multiple lois for a third suite when signed we will have leased nearly half the floor we just delivered at weighted average rents that are 12 higher than both the expiring and the market rent for traditional leases with a weighted average term of 3 5 years and 26 days of weighted average downtime from delivery to rent commencement our build out of these space suites is approximately 30 lower than the average tenant incentives incurred on new class a inaudible quarter over the last 12 months according to comstock data based on our proof of concept at the 1600 wilson we expect 90 of our initial space capital outlay to have a useful life of at least 10 years as of today we have approximately 36 000 square feet of space and 27 000 square feet of traditional lease space that is currently vacant and available to lease at arlington tower we expect the majority of space vacancy to commence throughout 2019 and for the traditional lease space to commence in the first half of 2020 we remain bullish on rosslyn which delivered another strong leasing year in 2018 following a record leasing year in 2017 this sub market continues to attract premier office tenants with the latest reports being that amazon is looking to take a large block of co working space in rosslyn furthermore the research we conducted with congressional quarterly projected an increase in contract awards in the rmb corridor ph that is resulting in robust activity among small and midsize office users looking for furnace space with immediate availability and flexible terms we continue to see excellent small deal activity in the market and tour velocity at arlington tower remains high with a deal pipeline of approximately 210 000 square feet in general we expect demand for high quality flexible office space in our region will continue to grow and that landlords will have to quickly adapt their product offerings to capitalize on what is now regarded to be a secular shift in the office business that said while flexible office and co working are often spoken as one product offering we believe they have different value propositions space is predominantly a flexible office offering that addresses existing and new tenant need for greater flexibility while continuing to forge their unique corporate identities although core working product also offers duration flexibility it is a relatively more expensive option for small and mid sized users in our market particularly those seeking to space to accommodate 12 or more employees moreover co working still does a relatively poor job of helping small and mid sized users establish their unique corporate identities as it attempts to cater to a wide variety of tenants with different space needs from freelancers to fortune 500 corporations although space is priced at a premium to traditional leases it is at a very meaningful discount to co working with creative design that allows tenants to emphasize their own brand culture and customer experience we therefore believe it is well positioned to meet the growing demand for flexible space both out of co working and from our existing long term tenants who regard space to be a valuable amenity we finished 2018 with approximately 133 000 square feet of delivered space space which is located in 53 spaces across 10 buildings the delivered space is currently 86 leased with the majority of the remaining space having been recently delivered we have another 57 000 square feet across 14 spaces in the space program that we ll deliver over the next 6 to 8 months thus far we have achieved rents that are at a premium to the market and in full year 2018 it took us approximately 69 days on average to get from delivery to lease commencement this compares favorably with the 3 5 months of average downtime for spec suites and 16 5 months average downtime for traditional to be customized shelf space according to nkf data moving back to washington dc office we finally have some availability in our value oriented dc class b office portfolio after years of being largely stabilized and fully occupied our most significant lease up opportunities are 1220 19th street 2000 m street and 1227 25th street where we have approximately 71 000 square feet of anticipated tenant vacates within our 2019 lease expirations these include approximately 19 000 square feet feet at 1227 25th street as well as 41 000 square feet at 1220 19th street both of which were referenced in the 8 k published in november 2018 expiring rents for these anticipated vacates range from the high 40s to the low 50s gross per square foot implying slight mark to market upside as well as significant gap to commodity class a product where asking rents are currently in the high 60 gross per foot range according to jll data moreover jll expects another 2 million square feet of class b office product will be removed through 2022 further limiting value oriented options in the dc corridor in the 8 k we filed last november we referenced four renewal leases in the dc class b portfolio two of these were roll ups and two were roll downs which i would like to detail further the expiring cash rents for the 42 000 square feet tenant we renewed at 1775 eye street were in the mid 60s as they had escalated over a number of years and blended 8 000 feet of the high value retail space that we now have taken back we renewed the tenant at just above 60 a foot with 2 5 rent escalators over a term of 11 3 years which is a very solid execution for lower floor class b office space in washington dc moreover we expect to release the 8000 square feet of prime retail space at rents that will roll up in the low double digits the gsa renewal which is out for signature was atypical as the gsa held a recompete process where we were competing against c buildings in southwest dc 1227 25th street is one of three assets in our portfolio that has space leased to the gsa and federal government tenants comprised less than 2 of our annualized base rental revenue as of december 31 2018 now onto retail where we are under loi for both the 28 000 square foot former hhgregg vacancy at hagerstown and the 23 000 square foot former hhgregg vacancy at frederick crossing with a discount retailer that will require significantly lower capital investment than previously estimated we expect both leases to commence in the first half of 2020 and to generate approximately 0 5 million of combined stabilized annualized noi we are also negotiating a lease with a medical user for the entire second floor of the new spring valley village development if signed this lease is expected to commence from early 2020 and contribute a little over 400 000 of stabilized annualized noi in addition we are very close to releasing a challenging 28 000 square foot vacancy at montrose shopping center for a term of four years with lease commencement beginning at the end of the first quarter this year as well as a 15 000 square foot vacancy at concord center for a term of 10 years with lease commencement around year end 2019 finally we have executed a 12 000 square foot lease for another vacancy at randolph shopping center in summary we are at loi or lease for approximately 114 000 square feet of retail vacancies that are expected to commence by early 2020 we have made substantial progress on some of our most challenging vacancies and are pleased to be restabilizing the retail portfolio s cash flows shifting gears to multifamily we believe the announcement of amazon hq2 at national landing is an unequivocal long term positive for our multifamily portfolio approximately 95 of our multifamily units are within a 30 minute driving distance from hq2 with approximately 70 of the units located within a 5 mile radius of hq2 we expect amazon generated jobs to benefit the lease up at the trove where the first units are expected to deliver in the fourth quarter of this year as well as some of our other northern virginia class a assets including bennett park and the maxwell located in the rosslyn ballston corridor with the cancellation of hq2 in new york there is potential for even greater job growth in northern virginia there are several studies that had analyzed the multiplier effect of the 25 000 employees that amazon has committed to bring to the dc metro region over 10 years while the us bureau of economic analysis estimates a multiplier of 1 9 uc berkeley forecasts a multiplier of 5 additional jobs for every one amazon job as this multiplier manifests itself in potentially 50 000 to 125 000 additional jobs over the next decade we expect it to positively benefit our class b assets in northern virginia including paramount wellington park adams riverside and roosevelt towers we remain positive on multifamily on a near term basis as well while supply deliveries remain at elevated levels both our class a and class b multifamily portfolios continue to grow rents and occupancy as nearly 75 of our multifamily noi is derived from assets located in northern virginia and approximately 80 is from class b assets as a result our portfolio is relatively insulated from the large wave of class a supply that s delivering in the capitol hill riverfront and noma submarkets of the district in the fourth quarter we grew class a average rents by approximately 1 8 and class b average rents by approximately 2 6 year over year while ending occupancy grew 70 basis points year over year on a square footage basis in full year 2018 we achieved 4 1 renewal trade outs 60 basis points higher than in 2017 while retention remains steady year over year new lease trade outs came in at a 1 8 for the year broadly in line with our performance in 2017 looking at deliveries over the next 12 months northern virginia is expected to receive 42 of the region s new units below its historical average of 50 of the units while washington dc is expected to receive 45 of the new units well above its historical share of 20 according to delta associates this regional delivery trend leaves us confident in our portfolio s relative positioning in 2019 moving onto our region s fundamentals in spite of the recent government shutdown we are optimistic on federal spending continuing to be a positive driver for real estate demand particularly in northern virginia which will benefit from the continued increase in the defense budget and contract awards as the data for 2018 contract awards is now available we ask cq examine how contract spending had fared relative to their expectations at the time of the 2018 budget appropriations last spring for the dc metro region as a whole government contract spending increased by 6 1 in 2018 which although significantly positive relative to recent history was 2 1 lower than the projected year over year increase moreover while contract spending rose 7 6 in maryland and 6 9 in virginia it actually declined 1 1 in washington dc growth in virginia was driven by defense contract awards which grew 11 in 2018 according to cq data and having met annual projections are expected to continue to rise in the current fiscal year this is supported by the fact that for the first time in over a decade the fiscal year 2019 defense budget was appropriated prior to the start of the fiscal year which means that contractors have more clarity and fiscal assurance today than at any time in the past 10 years the overall regional increase in contract awards does appear to have had a positive impact on job growth which was robust at 52 100 new jobs in 2018 relative to 50 900 new jobs in 2017 importantly the region created 16 000 new professional and business service jobs which represented 31 of 2018 job growth relative to 10 400 new professional and business service jobs created in 2017 representing 21 of 2017 job growth the fact that our region generated 54 more new professional business service jobs year over year is impressive that said we believe the pace of fiscal year 2019 contract award has been interrupted due to the recent government shutdown as a result some awards may be shifted to later months of this fiscal year while the initial shutdown didn t have a significant impact on our portfolio the region s real estate fundamentals do remain partially dependent on federal government spending encouragingly for virginia not only was 2019 defense budget passed on time but inaudible defense spending levels for 2020 and fy 2021 also call for continuing gains in spending now i would like to turn the call over to steve to discuss our financial and operational performance in the fourth quarter and our 2019 guidance stephen e riffee executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks paul and good morning everyone 2018 net income attributable to controlling interests of 25 6 million or 0 32 per diluted share exceeded 2017 net income attributable to controlling interests of 19 7 million or 0 25 per diluted share core ffo of 1 86 per diluted share for the full year 2018 was in line with the midpoint of our most recent guidance range we grew core ffo per share by approximately 2 year over year partly due to 3 1 year over year same store noi growth on a sequential basis fourth quarter core ffo grew by a penny primarily due to lower overall building operating expenses expenses as a percentage of revenue improved 110 basis points for the second consecutive year to 34 5 for full year 2018 driven by expense management initiatives across the same store portfolio as well as lower real estate taxes core funds available for distribution or core fad was approximately 121 million in 2018 representing a 78 4 payout ratio which was better than the 80 payout ratio we had targeted for the year for 2019 we are targeting a core fad payout ratio of approximately 80 our full year 2018 same store noi growth of 3 1 gaap and 3 7 cash was driven by higher revenues across the office multi family and retail portfolios as average same store occupancy grew by 40 basis points year over year and rental rates and recoveries across all three property types trended higher moving onto office and retail leasing we leased approximately 153 000 square feet in the fourth quarter including 52 000 square feet of new leases and 101 000 square feet of renewal leases office renewals included the 42 000 square foot early renewal of one of our top 10 largest tenants as we had detailed in the 8 k filed in november 2018 the renewal was for 11 3 years at rents that were single digit roll downs on a gaap and a cash basis notably the remaining approximately 49 000 square feet of office renewals rolled up on a gaap and a cash basis retail signed approximately 17 000 square feet of new leases where economics were skewed by two leases signed with service providers that are expected to further improve the merchandising mix and traffic at two of our neighborhood and community shopping centers we achieved 100 retail tenant retention in the fourth quarter driven by our proactive approach to retention and tenants exercising early renewal options a trend that we believe will continue in 2019 our biggest needle movers on the leasing front are arlington tower and watergate 600 these two assets account for a third of our 2019 office lease expirations and provide us the opportunity to create longer term value by growing rents and further enhancing nav in retail we have approximately 99 000 square feet or 5 4 of annualized retail rent expiring in 2019 the majority of these lease expirations are in our neighborhood and community anchored shopping centers with a median lease size of approximately 2 500 square feet with regards to multifamily unit renovations at year end we had 272 units left to renovate at the wellington and 191 units left to renovate at riverside the wellington unit renovation program is now 60 complete while riverside is 78 complete we are generating a mid teens return on cost on the renovation dollars that have been invested at these two assets to date and expect consistent returns as we plan for these programs to be substantially completed through 2019 now turning to 2019 we are guiding to a full year core ffo per share range of 1 74 to 1 78 this range includes a 1 million to 1 5 million impact or an approximately 0 015 to 0 02 reduction as a result of adopting the new leasing accounting standard asc 842 beginning january 1 2019 our guidance includes the following assumptions a projected same store noi growth range of negative 0 5 deposit of 0 5 excluding watergate 600 same store noi growth is projected to range from positive 1 75 to 2 75 as paul mentioned we expect the top two floors of watergate 600 to be built out for a new tenant in 2019 and the lease to commence in early 2020 we assume same store office noi declines to range between negative 5 25 to negative 4 25 while we are in the process of leasing up spaces which we expect will contribute to same store noi growth in 2020 and beyond excluding watergate 600 same store office noi growth is expected to be approximately flat at the midpoint we assume multi family and retail same store noi growth will each range from 3 75 and 4 25 we project dispositions to range 175 million to 200 million our capital plan for 2019 assumes approximately 65 million to 70 million of development spending predominantly for the trove where we have executed a guaranteed maximum price contract that insulates us from escalations and construction pricing our interest expense is expected to range between 51 million to 51 75 million capitalized interest is expected to range from 2 75 million to 3 25 million g a is projected to range from 18 million to 18 75 million as we reduced costs by approximately 17 at the midpoint to partially offset the lower revenue in this lease up period finally we project office non same store noi which consist of arlington tower purchased in 2018 to range between 16 75 million and 17 25 million our focus remains on maintaining our balance sheet strength we expect our net debt to adjusted ebitda to be in our targeted range of 6 to 6 5 times and to end the year at the lower end of the range following the completed plan of dispositions and with that i will now turn the call back over to paul paul t mcdermott president and chief executive officer thank you steve i would like to take this opportunity to announce that tom bakke our chief operating officer has informed the company of his retirement as many of you know tom joined washington reit in 2014 to help transform the company tom turned the operations around by implementing a portfolio management model that increased accountability and drove superior performance in a nutshell tom helped create washreit 2 0 i can t thank him enough for his many contributions his passion his leadership and for his friendship over the years one of tom s greatest successes is the development of an extremely talented team of portfolio managers across all three asset classes i m confident in their leadership and ability to achieve our operational and strategic goals we wish tom all the very best for this new phase of life and his very well deserved retirement to recap we are excited about our multiple commercial lease up opportunities and look forward to updating you on our progress on those as well as on the robust multi family and retail growth we expect this year as our guidance implies we are proactively reducing our g a by approximately 17 at the midpoint of our 2019 guidance range as we cut costs and maximize the ffo we generate for our shareholders while working to create long term noi growth through leasing we have entered 2019 with a strong balance sheet and a capital plan that enables us to deliver the first units at the trove later this year 2019 is about leasing execution at washreit and we look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year with that let me now open the call to answer your questions questions and answers operator great thank you at this time we will be conducting a question and answer session operator instructions our first question is from blaine heck from wells fargo please go ahead blaine heck wells fargo securities analyst thanks good morning paul thanks for all the commentary on space that was very helpful and it seems like pretty significant growth initiative for you guys i guess how much of your office portfolio do you see as available to convert into space and how big do you envision that segment could eventually represent paul t mcdermott president and chief executive officer blaine tom is pioneering this over the last over the last six months and so i m going to just ask him to comment on the metrics thomas q bakke executive vice president and chief operating officer yeah thanks paul so blaine i think we ve touched on space before it s our flexible space program and we do have a lot of things happening in the office business one of the most important things is this push toward more flexibility and more experiential type offerings you hear a lot of co working data sort of geared and it could grow upwards of 10 of the office business i think that s sort of on the aggressive side the way we look at it is we are creating an offering sort of in the midpoint that addresses the small to mid sized tenants that have a need for speed that have a need for flexibility have a need for sort of a broader service offering and we think it could be upwards of 5 of our portfolio so right now it s probably about 3 i don t think it gets much above 5 but we want it to be broad enough that we can address these evolving tenant needs in pretty much all the sub markets we are in blaine heck wells fargo securities analyst great that s helpful maybe for paul or steve you guys have been trading at a discount to nav most of this year so far good to see some of that is coming back today but have you guys contemplated share repurchases and how do you think about that opportunity to invest in your own stock versus maybe going out and purchasing something at market cap rates stephen e riffee executive vice president and chief financial officer well blaine i think we ve probably been asked that over the years from time to time as the markets have fluctuated it s certainly in our capital allocation analysis we ve always said that we do consider it but we would do it on a leverage neutral basis to keep the balance sheet strong and so to do that the debt that we would be paying down alongside of a share repurchase would be on the cheaper end of our debt it would be our short term debt that we could pay down and we look at like their stock price where we re at it s we are in the 5s and we still have the trove where we have a guaranteed maximum price contract we re well along the initial stabilization yields are over a 6 in that development and we think thereafter we think that s an improving market for further growth and in the near term we still have some of our renovation programs going on in our units in our multi family value add properties and that s been yielding in the mid teens so it is something that we do evaluate it has not crossed the threshold is our best allocation to capital at this point blaine heck wells fargo securities analyst okay makes sense and then last from me you guys have guidance for around 200 million of dispositions this year can you just talk a little bit about what you guys are targeting to sell whether it s going to be kind of one offs or larger deals and maybe how you re thinking about the timing of those sales is there anything being marketed at this point paul t mcdermott president and chief executive officer blaine nothing is being marketed right now but i would say that as we look at our portfolio we have some office assets that are probably reaching their inflection point and that has just been due to tom s team s great leasing efforts and so we re i think at the end of the value creation from our standpoint there and so those are types of assets we would take to market steve just in terms of timing stephen e riffee executive vice president and chief financial officer sure i mean considering we re already a little bit into the year our own models and forecasts assume that we get i d say less than half done around mid year with the balance of our guidance range toward the end of the year blaine heck wells fargo securities analyst great thanks and tom good luck on everything in the future thomas q bakke executive vice president and chief operating officer thanks blaine appreciated great operator our next question is from john guinee from stifel please go ahead john guinee stifel nicolaus analyst great nice job and tom we will miss you talk about the trove it looks to me like it s almost walking distance to the pentagon to fashion square pentagon city and a couple of blocks further east is the new amazon hq2 headquarters can you actually walk in a tunnel under 395 to get to it or do you have to cross 395 on foot thomas q bakke executive vice president and chief operating officer you have to cross 395 but john i think from the trove we will be running shuttles like we do from the wellington its sister property on the site so we don t want people running across 395 john guinee stifel nicolaus analyst and is 300 000 a unit seems pretty reasonable can you talk about how you got there did you allocate any land to it did you have to build a bunch of structured parking et cetera paul t mcdermott president and chief executive officer sure john so 300 000 units it s just a hair above 300 000 a door i think our competitive advantage you hit on it is really the land basis our hard costs and i m just going to go the tower and a parking but our hard costs are around 235 a door soft costs around 36 and our land basis we think if you were to try to go out and buy land and replicate what we re doing on the trove call it be about 70 000 a door and our land basis is just between 36 and 37 a door the only thing i would add to that again if you re comparing it to kind of a market rate deal on our math since we have looked at other opportunities yes you do as you pointed out john in terms of parking if you re doing above grade we re allocating probably 22 000 a stall for that and for going below grade we re probably averaging around 45 000 a stall john guinee stifel nicolaus analyst great okay and then shifting to ffo guidance it s down 0 10 year over year which on 80 million shares equals about 8 million your ffo for 2018 is 146 million so it s over a 5 decline year over year what on earth is driving a 8 million 5 decline in ffo stephen e riffee executive vice president and chief financial officer john this is steve i think one of the reasons that we wanted to give visibility in the 8 k that we filed in november 2018 was to kind of lay out the lease expirations so they re laid out and pretty much in sequence with 60 000 square feet happening right off in mid january and so and we also talked about in this call our efforts in 2019 are really we believe we re under the way will be steady lease up throughout 2019 for the spaces that we have available so i think in most of that we will be really contributing in early 2020 and some of the leases will continue in the 8 k will continue to expire in may and august so we believe looking at our numbers we re certainly not ready to give full guidance for 2020 but we believe that both same store and overall overall same store and office same store will then return to same store growth in the first quarter of 2020 john guinee stifel nicolaus analyst got you thank you operator operator instructions our next question is from daniel ismail from green street advisors please go ahead daniel ismail green street advisors analyst great thanks guys and good morning and tom all the best in retirement just a quick question on the dispositions are there any tax consequences associated with the dispositions stephen e riffee executive vice president and chief financial officer dan it is steve right now we always do tax planning and for having already recycled as a management team over 1 billion of capital we ve always made sure that is tax efficient right now we believe that the guidance that we put out and the way we could execute it that we wouldn t have to reinvest the proceeds but it really depends on what you sell and when you sell it so it s something that we re always mindful of and that we would always keep an eye on daniel ismail green street advisors analyst great and i think you mentioned over the last few quarters some difficulty in finding acquisition opportunities in your the sweet spot of value add multifamily can you expand on that and how you guys have seen the pipeline over the last quarter paul t mcdermott president and chief executive officer sure danny i think if you re looking at the dc market right now i would say that predictably given all the volatility that we saw in december we saw a little bit of a pull back by some of the portfolio managers that we thought were going to bring product to the market in january so i think we ve had a slow start there but we do see a lot of product particularly office product coming to the market i think that is also pretty predictable especially in northern virginia i think you re going to really see a surge in northern virginia office product coming out trying to draft off of the successes of both the silver line and hq2 he type of we re still not really seeing any core capital out there looking for product it all has to have a value add component i think as we ve tried to say to you we are going to continue to look for multifamily product that s the part of the portfolio we want to continue to recalibrate when i say that too i think there s going to be some eye popping numbers i mean the rumor is now the meridian that s on the market directly across the street from amazon will trade in the upper three caps that is not the products that we re looking for we think that we are looking at some multifamily both one offs and portfolios right now and the opportunities that we do look at are at better cap rates and i think have better offer better value propositions for our shareholders daniel ismail green street advisors analyst and maybe for the ones that you get a fee income to market has pricing changed at all maybe excluding the ones around national landing paul t mcdermott president and chief executive officer i don t think we have enough data points for a fact pattern there i think if anything they ve been flat i think when you look at anything i mean i can t pick up an om that s come across my desk without giving me the precise proximity to hq2 so i think people are definitely looking for a little juice there but i think smart investors are discounting that it s still like i said earlier it still has to have danny some type of value add characteristic to really get the juice and i think people are really looking for just given the inflow of jobs over the next 10 years or what s projected to be and drafting off of defense and tech in northern virginia i really think the multifamily is still kind of the sweet spot daniel ismail green street advisors analyst and maybe just last one for me the riverside land parcel can you guys give us an update on your plans for that piece of land and maybe expectations for any type of development starts in the near future paul t mcdermott president and chief executive officer well we re in design development on riverside right now i think you re talking about the piece of land that was out in front of our property yes we re still examining that our land basis right now in riverside is i want to say between 20 and 21 a door and we think market land value if i was to do a market rate deal down there it s probably about 35 000 a door so roughly about a 40 discount but we are looking at riverside both with and without that parcel and as soon as we have something further to comment on about danny we ll let you know daniel ismail green street advisors analyst okay great thanks guys paul t mcdermott president and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question is from chris lucas from capital one please go ahead chris lucas capital one analyst good morning everyone tom congratulations good luck and thanks for all of your help over the last several years i appreciate it thomas q bakke executive vice president and chief operating officer thanks chris chris lucas capital one analyst as it relates to the trove paul just kind of curious i know phase 1 is up and you re moving forward and expect delivery of units later in the year is phase 2 under construction at this point and if so when or if not when will you start construction for that phase paul t mcdermott president and chief executive officer phase 2 is not under construction right now i believe that we are shooting forward in the back half of 20 in terms of delivery chris lucas capital one analyst right so when would you have to get started in order to meet that delivery timeframe paul t mcdermott president and chief executive officer later on in the year chris chris lucas capital one analyst okay will the lease up pace at the phase 1 impacted all your decision to move forward with phase 2 paul t mcdermott president and chief executive officer no it will not chris lucas capital one analyst okay so you re going to press forward with that okay and then as it relates to sort of longer term lease expirations we re inside of two years now in world bank when should we be thinking about how to handicap that renewal thomas q bakke executive vice president and chief operating officer this is tom i think we are in discussions with them right now chris and i think there is there are some things going on at the world bank as we know but the real estate department seems fairly focused on trying to get something done so hopefully we ll have some good news at some point in the not too distant future chris lucas capital one analyst okay thank you and then on the dispositions i guess just kind of curious you mentioned targeting office i guess just curious whether or not these would be lumpy transactions or whether or not there are some granularity to sort of the mix paul t mcdermott president and chief executive officer i think there will be some granularity if it s office they re kind of on an asset management basis kind of when they hit their different inflection points so there may be separate opportunities and the timing might be different chris lucas capital one analyst okay and then on the on tom s retirement i guess just trying to understand paul will you be back filling that role or how are you thinking about what your plans are there paul t mcdermott president and chief executive officer well like i said in my remarks chris i think tom has built out an exceptional team i think they re kind of a self leading team the three portfolio managers and so we re not going to backfill it at this time but we will keep our options open going forward chris lucas capital one analyst okay and then maybe if i could just pivot over to the g a guidance can you give me more color on just sort of how you re able to inaudible that much savings year over year i m just trying to get my arms around it stephen e riffee executive vice president and chief financial officer sure chris well in addition to everything else we ve been executing over the last couple of years we ve had pretty large initiatives to invest in our technology and our processes and also in our leadership development to prepare people to step up into bigger roles and all of that s creating efficiencies and we feel that it was very timely we believe those efficiencies are going to allow us to reduce costs this year and that would be appropriate for our shareholders in this period of where revenues are down what we re going to lease up again chris lucas capital one analyst okay thank you i appreciate it paul t mcdermott president and chief executive officer thanks chris operator thank you this concludes the question and answer session i d like to turn the floor back to management for any closing comments paul t mcdermott president and chief executive officer thank you everyone again i would like to thank you for your participation on our call today and we look forward to talking with many of you soon at the upcoming conferences have a good afternoon thank you operator this concludes today s teleconference you may disconnect your lines at this time thank you for your

washington feb 14 us retail sales recorded their biggest drop in more than nine years in december as receipts fell across the board suggesting a sharp slowdown in economic activity at the end of 2018 the economy s outlook was further dimmed by other data today showing an unexpected increase in the number of americans filing claims for unemployment benefits last week that pushed the four week moving average of claims to a one year high an indication that job growth was moderating there was also little sign of inflation in the economy with producer prices dropping in january for a second straight month moderate inflation and softening domestic demand support the federal reserve s pledge to be patient before raising interest rates further this year this suggests that the word patience will be in the fed s vernacular for some time said jennifer lee a senior economist at bmo capital markets in toronto advertisement the commerce department said retail sales tumbled 1 2 per cent the largest decline since september 2009 when the economy was emerging from recession data for november was revised slightly down to show retail sales edging up 0 1 per cent instead of gaining 0 2 per cent as previously reported economists polled by reuters had forecast retail sales increasing 0 2 per cent in december retail sales in december rose 2 3 per cent from a year ago the december retail sales report was delayed by a 35 day partial shutdown of the federal government that ended on january 25 no date has been set for the release of the january retail sales report which was scheduled for publication tomorrow advertisement the plunge in retail sales came amid a sharp stock market sell off and drop in consumer confidence in december the longest government shutdown could also have undercut sales some economists questioned the credibility of the report arguing that the shutdown could have impacted on the collection of data but the commerce department said the processing and data quality were monitored throughout and response rates were at or above normal levels for this release excluding automobiles gasoline building materials and food services retail sales dropped 1 7 per cent last month after an upwardly revised 1 0 per cent surge in november these so called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product they were previously reported to have jumped 0 9 per cent in november december s sharp drop in core retail sales suggested a moderation in the pace of consumer spending in the fourth quarter consumer spending which accounts for more than two thirds of the us economy increased at a 3 5 per cent annualised rate in the july september quarter as result of the weak retail sales report economists slashed their fourth quarter gross domestic product growth estimates by as much as seven tenths of a percentage point to as low as a 2 0 per cent rate growth estimates could be trimmed further after another report from the commerce department showed retail inventories excluding automobiles tumbled 1 0 per cent in november the most since december 2008 the economy grew at a 3 4 per cent pace in the july september period us treasury prices rose on the data while the dollar fell to session lows against a basket of currencies stocks were trading lower broad weakens in december online and mail order retail sales dropped 3 9 per cent the biggest drop since november 2008 receipts at service stations dived 5 1 per cent the biggest fall since february 2016 reflecting cheaper gasoline prices there were also declines in receipts at clothing and furniture stores americans also cut spending at restaurants and bars sales at hobby musical instrument and book stores plunged 4 9 per cent the biggest drop since september 2008 but sales at auto dealerships rose 1 0 per cent in december and receipts at building material stores gained 0 3 per cent the outlook for consumer spending which has been underpinned by a strong labour market and cheaper gasoline is not encouraging a report this week from the new york fed showed the overall debt shouldered by americans edged up to a record us 13 5 trillion rm54 9 trillion in the fourth quarter of 2018 in a separate report today the labour department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 4 000 to a seasonally adjusted 239

last year saw significant efforts to either impose a price on carbon or reform existing programs and in some cases roll those programs back the paris agreement advanced a critical step but without settling on rules for offsets and a new market mechanism much remains in flux carbon pricing proposals proliferated but not without political headwinds in some jurisdictions including the rollback of ontario s cap and trade program and riots in paris over an increased gas tax will we look back on 2018 as a watershed year it s hard to tell but it certainly kept us busy united states california extends and reforms cap and trade program updates low carbon fuel standard in 2017 california rebooted its cap and trade program by enacting assembly bill 398 ab 398 to reauthorize and extend the program through 2030 signaling the program s essential role in achieving california s ghg reduction target for 2030 of at least 40 percent below 1990 levels set by senate bill 32 sb 32 in december 2018 the california air resources board carb adopted implementing regulations setting a new allowance price ceiling that will start at 65 in 2021 and increase each year by five percent plus the rate of inflation at the most recent auction all allowances sold for 15 31 each 78 cents higher than the 14 53 auction floor price carb also changed the rules for its offset program currently an entity may to use offsets for up to eight percent of its compliance obligation but the new rules reduce offset usage limits to four percent for 2021 to 2025 rising to six percent for 2026 to 2030 the rules further provide that no more than half the offsets used by an entity can be sourced from projects that do not provide direct environmental benefits in the state these changes are aimed at increasing environmental co benefits in california from offset projects consistent with sb 32 carb also adopted updates to its low carbon fuel standard regulation lcfs which became effective on january 4 2019 with this set of amendments carb is targeting to reduce the carbon intensity of fuels in california by 20 percent from a 2010 baseline by 2030 carb also adopted amendments to its regulation on commercialization of alternative diesel fuels based on a new environmental analysis mandated by court decision these amendments include 1 requirements for third party verification of fuel pathways and reporting 2 incorporation of a stringent carbon capture and sequestration protocol for credit generation and 3 provisions to allow crediting of zero emission vehicle fueling infrastructure rggi set to expand membership to virginia and new jersey in september 2018 the virginia department of environmental quality released a revised proposed regulation aimed at establishing a ghg trading program creating a pathway towards full rggi membership the revised rule contains a reduced co2 allowance budget a change in line with earlier comments from rggi and other rggi member states the proposal includes a base budget of 28 million tons beginning in 2021 with a 3 annual reduction for annual budgets and allocations through 2030 virginia made the change to help allay concerns that its proposed rule was not ambitious enough and could potentially result in a surplus of allowances virginia s air pollution control board decided to move forward with the revised rule and the revised re proposed rule is open for public comment from february 4 through march 6 2019 new jersey which withdrew from rggi in 2011 plans to rejoin rggi and released its proposed regulations to do so in december 2018 both virginia and new jersey are on track to begin participating in rggi in 2020 while rggi allowance prices rose last year selling for 5 35 at the december auction auction prices hadn t broken 5 since early 2016 they are still well below prices in california and the eu northeast states agree to begin development of a transportation climate initiative on december 18 2018 nine states and washington d c agreed to begin development of a regional cap and trade program covering transportation emissions if implemented the transportation climate initiative tci would establish a regional program to impose a declining cap in emissions from transportation sources details are thin at this stage but with transportation becoming an increasingly large portion of northeast ghg emissions tci could ultimately result in a significant regulatory and carbon pricing regime the current state lineup largely mirrors rggi and consists of connecticut delaware maryland massachusetts new jersey pennsylvania rhode island vermont virginia and washington d c oregon adopts updates to the clean fuels program challenger seek supreme court review on november 15 2018 the oregon environmental quality commission adopted amendments to the oregon clean fuels program these amendments included updates to the models used to determine the carbon intensities of fuels and the resulting changes to the lookup table values clean fuel standards energy economy ratios and temporary fuel pathway codes the amendments also provide new categories of fuel applications that can be used to generate credits including forklifts and transport refrigeration units and added new fuels that could generate credits such as alternative jet fuel and renewable propane the program has not been without controversy on september 9 2018 the ninth circuit affirmed the dismissal of a lawsuit challenging the oregon clean fuels program am fuel petrochemical manufacturers v o keeffe 903 f 3d 903 9th cir 2018 on january 9 2019 the american fuel petrochemical manufacturers american trucking associations inc and consumer energy alliance filed a petition for writ of certiorari seeking review of the ninth circuit s opinion upholding the oregon clean fuel program in particular they sought review on the questions of whether the program s regulation of fuels based on a life cycle analysis constituted impermissible extraterritorial regulation notably a similar attack on california s lcfs has recently and in the past proven unsuccessful see rocky mountain farmers union v corey 913 f 3d 940 9th cir 2019 however our panel need not linger on whether the constitution could support such a claim because we are bound by recent circuit precedent that has settled whether a program very similar to the lcfs is inconsistent with the structure of the constitution citing o keeffe 903 f 3d at 916 917 washington voters reject carbon fee last november voters in washington state rejected ballot initiative 1631 a potentially ground breaking ballot initiative that would have established an economy wide carbon fee had it passed washington would have become the first u s state to enact a carbon fee or tax and also the first jurisdiction worldwide to place a price on carbon through a ballot initiative ballot initiative 1631 would have imposed a 15 per ton fee on co2 emissions increasing by 2 annually until 2035 when the fee would top out at 55 per ton at that point state lawmakers could either freeze the fee or vote to continue annual increases proponents have labeled the carbon price as a fee since fees under washington state law can be targeted towards certain uses while taxes can be spent on any government expenses interestingly carbon tax proposals are on the legislative agenda in numerous other states and in 2018 a bipartisan group from the u s congress proposed the energy innovation and carbon dividend act which would impose a tax of 15 per ton of carbon dioxide beginning in 2019 increasing by 10 each year prospects for this bill are dim in the short term but may indicate a renewed interest in carbon pricing at the federal level canada canada imposes carbon tax on four provinces under the greenhouse gas pollution pricing act s c 2018 c 12 s 186 canada will implement a revenue neutral carbon tax starting in 2019 while several provinces already have their own carbon pricing schemes the federal program will serve as a backstop and impose a carbon price in provinces without an equivalent scheme ghg emissions will be taxed at 20 per ton in 2019 rising at 10 per ton per year until reaching 50 per ton in 2022 where it will remain unless the legislation is updated three provinces already have carbon pricing schemes and four more are under development ontario is one of the provinces that will become subject to the new national tax which it has vowed to fight in court arguing that ottawa s carbon pricing plan is unconstitutional earlier in 2018 ontario ended its cap and trade program and withdrew from the western climate initiative which had linked it to california and quebec international eu ets has banner year the eu emissions trading system eu ets had a banner year in 2018 with allowance process tripling on february 27 2018 the council of the european union approved revisions to the eu ets for several years the eu ets was plagued by an over allocation of allowances the reform package introduces three new elements 1 an annual 2 2 percent reduction of the ghg emissions cap 2 doubling of the number of allowances placed in the market stability reserve msr until the end of 2023 and 3 limiting the validity of msr allowances beginning in 2023 these changes are aimed at enabling the eu to reduce overall ghg emissions by at least 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030 and meet corresponding commitments under the paris agreement the practical effect was swift eu ets allowance prices started 2018 below 8 and ended the year just over 24 paris agreement advances but still lacks rules for market mechanisms and offsets paris agreement parties are working towards development of a paris rulebook that would establish ground rules to facilitate achieving the nationally determined contributions that form the basis of the paris agreement progress on the paris rulebook has been slow but advanced significantly during the 24th conference of parties cop 24 in katowice poland during cop 24 the parties reached agreement on numerous aspects of the paris rulebook including key carbon accounting methodology and reporting provisions while these developments were a key step towards implementing the paris agreement the parties could not reach agreement on the article 6 market mechanisms the market mechanisms created by article 6 of the paris agreement are fundamental and would establish a new carbon market and new offset provisions the kyoto protocol s offset programs the clean development mechanism cdm and joint implementation mechanism experienced a lack of transparency and significant market failures resulting in a flood of offset credits that threatened to undermined the integrity of the kyoto protocol parties to the paris agreement are trying to avoid these past mistakes while addressing concerns regarding the transition of cdm offset credits into a new market mechanism at cop 24 brazil and a few other parties opposed provisions related to the treatment of clean development mechanism offset credits highlighting one of many differences between developed and developing countries in how the paris agreement should be implemented that disagreement forced the parties to shelve discussion of market mechanisms until cop 25 which will be held in chile in november 2019 the kigali amendment enters into force without the u s the kigali amendment to the montreal protocol which aims to phase down the use of hydrofluorocarbons hfc entered into force on january 1 2019 during 2018 a number of countries ratified or approved the kigali amendment bringing the total to 69 parties including the eu the united kingdom and many other european and african nations the u s was instrumental in developing the kigali amendment under the obama administration but has yet to ratify it on june 4 2018 a number of republican senators sent a letter to president trump asking him to submit the kigali amendment to the senate for ratification and it appears the senate is close to having the 67 votes it would need the u s chamber of commerce has indicated that ratification of the kigali amendment would benefit u s industry and boost output in the u s manufacturing sector by an additional 12 5 billion by 2027 but despite bipartisan and broad industry support the trump administration has not taken a position on whether to ratify the kigali amendment in fact during 2018 the trump administration took multiple actions to roll back hfc regulations u s states have begun to fill the gap left by federal inaction on hfcs in march 2018 carb adopted rules replacing certain federal regulations and on september 13 2018 california s then governor jerry brown signed the california cooling act sb 1013 codifying into california law the obama administration targets for reducing hfcs after a federal court struck down related federal provisions earlier in 2018 the law also supplements carb s authority to adopt rules limiting the use of hfcs and creates an economic incentive program to accelerate the transition from hfcs to alternative substances new york maryland and connecticut announced plans to take similar action airlines set to begin offsetting emissions increases the carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation corsia was agreed to in october 2016 by 191 countries in the international civil aviation organization icao with the central goal of stabilizing aircraft emissions at 2020 levels by offsetting future ghg emissions increases in 2018 icao finalized a set of standards and recommenced practices that became applicable january 1 2019 icao first edition of annex 16 to the convention on international civil aviation vol iv first ed oct 2018 while corsia has largely flown under the radar it is a significant program that will create a large market for carbon offsets starting in 2021 china china s environmental authority seizes leading role on climate change policy china s ministry of ecology and environment mee the country s top environmental agency officially assumed the primary role in china s climate change policymaking on september 11 2018 this shift occurred following a number of measures from china s leadership in 2018 to shift power on climate issues from the country s macroeconomic planning authority to its environmental authority according to a new ministerial organizational plan released on september 11 mee is now responsible for the work on addressing climate change its powers include organizing the design and drafting of major strategies plans and policies relating to addressing climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions jointly leading the arrangement of and the participation in the international negotiations on climate change with relevant ministries and responsible for china s implementation of the unfccc the ministry is authorized to establish a division dedicated to climate change issues historically china s domestic climate policymaking authority was heavily vested in the national development and reform commission ndrc which primarily controls china s economic planning as an example china s state council the country s cabinet operates a consultative group called the national leading group for climate change energy conservation and emission reduction the climate change leading group since 2013 ndrc has been responsible for the routine work of this group despite wide participation by various ministries in march 2018 china s national legislature approved a major reorganization of the state council which required that ndrc transfer its climate policy authority to the reshaped power enhanced mee on july 19 2018 the state council reformed the climate change leading group noting that both mee and ndrc are now responsible for the group s routine work the organizational plan for mee is the latest signal that china s environmental authority is gaining increasing control over the country s climate policy decisions china advances plans for national carbon emission trading in the power sector china launched regional pilot trading platforms in 2013 aimed at multiple sectors china had hoped to transition the regional pilots to a nationwide emissions trading scheme by 2017 but was unsuccessful some observers fear that the transition of power to the mee has the potential to either disrupt this process mee has less political clout than the ndrc china s mee organized a conference on september 5 2018 to plan for national carbon trading in the power sector power sector representatives the civil aviation authority officials from ndrc local environmental regulators and a number of trade groups and research institutes attended the conference following a policy plan released in december 2017 and subsequent work in early 2018 the power sector is likely among the first participants in china s anticipated national carbon market according to the trade press covering the conference mee is preparing a number of framework rules on regulating the national market as well as on incorporating verified voluntary reduction credits into the trading scheme mee also plans to organize training activities for carbon trading professionals among local regulators carbon emitting entities and third party certifiers china solicits second round of comments on proposed renewable portfolio standard during 2018 china s ndrc solicited comments on the power generation allowances and assessment measures for renewable energy rule a proposal for a renewable energy quota and allowance trading policy according to a draft leaked in september 2018 this was the second round of comment solicitation following a similar process in march 2018 under the leaked september draft the national government would assign a renewable energy percentage target to each province every year six categories of entities quota obligation entities must fulfill an annual renewable energy quota calculated based on the total amount of sold or consumed electricity and the provincial renewable energy percentage target quota obligation entities would include the state or provincial power grid companies power distribution and sale companies independent electricity sellers certain electricity users and certain enterprises with their own power plants green certificates issued for renewable energy allowances would be traded on a market and can be used to meet the quota requirement ordinarily green certificates are traded along with the electricity sales ndrc expects to promulgate more detailed rules on green certificates failure to fulfill the quota requirement would result in a payable compensation the collected compensation would be transferred into a national renewable energy subsidy fund other penalization measures including restrictions on future projects might attach to entities that refuse to comply provisions to address recent deficits in the subsidy fund sets a target of 35 renewable energy by 2030
